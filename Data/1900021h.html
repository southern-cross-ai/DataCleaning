<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. "THE PAST IS DEAD!"</h2>

<p>BEYOND the blurred car window the land lay dark and formless and
unvarying&mdash;a flat emptiness across which the westbound train
rushed hour after hour and yet seemed to make little progress.
Occasionally the shape of a corral whipped by, less occasionally
glimmering ranch lights reached forward from the remoteness of the
prairie; but these were minute flaws to accent the loneliness of a
world lost in its own immensity. When some restless passenger
opened either vestibule door, the clacking assaults of iron on iron
rushed in, and biting air currents turned the gauze gaslights of
the coach redly dim. Cecile, a social and warmth-loving creature to
her last plump fiber, made a small shuddering gesture.</p>

<p>"This is simply insane, Nan. It really is. You've got to change
your mind in the next half-hour. Listen to me. You can't drop out
of your own set&mdash;it will be so horribly dreary. If you must
run, come on to the coast, where at least you'll meet your own kind
of people."</p>

<p>Nan Avery answered with a falling inflection, with a queer lack
of tone. "The past is quite dead, Cecile. I buried it, laid on the
flowers, and shed my tears." She sat relaxed, supple hands crossed
in her lap, the neat military shoulders swaying in response to the
motion of the car. Nothing, Cecile thought, could ever erase the
smooth, fine regularity of Nan Avery's face. It was definite, it
was proud, it was close to being beautiful. The mass of brushed
copper hair heightened a whiteness of temple and brow; and had some
odd disciplinary effect on the gray, straight-glancing eyes. All
the Averys were like that, very direct and honest, very strict with
themselves. What saved Nan from the otherwise Puritan sobriety of
the tribe was a zest for living, a vital gayety that once had
colored everything she did or said.</p>

<p>But she was not gay now. She sat there with an air of inner
quiescence, as if all thinking and all hoping had ceased to be
important; and in those expressive eyes was a foiled, faint
bitterness. No strong character herself, Cecile felt a queer sense
of desolation to see this swift surrender. For it was surrender; it
was defeat. Even Cecile knew that after five miserable days on the
train. Somewhat desperately she said:</p>

<p>"I actually can't bear the thought of leaving you. Nan, you'll
come home after everything has settled and been forgotten."</p>

<p>"No," murmured Nan in the same detached manner. "I don't know
what lies ahead. It doesn't matter. But I'll never go back."</p>

<p>"But why, of all places, should you choose to live out here?"
cried Cecile.</p>

<p>Nan Avery's words were aloof, impartial&mdash;as if she were
viewing herself from afar. "My life has been luxurious and easy.
See what has come of it. Now I shall really find out if I'm any
good."</p>

<p>"Oh, you little fool, there is no blame on you!"</p>

<p>"But there is," said Nan softly. "My name has been dragged
around the mud. However right or wrong it may be, people are
talking. They always will." Then a small echo of hurt anger warmed
her speech. "Can't you see what that does to me? It&mdash;it makes
me feel like soiled linen! I hate it! I hate myself! I never
expected it and never deserved it. But it happened, and so it must
be my fault. Why should I try to find excuses? Well, it won't
happen again. What's done is done, and I am through crying."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about this country," brooded Cecile.
"Nor anybody in it. You're stepping into a wilderness. Really you
are. You might as well be dead as far as your friends are
concerned."</p>

<p>"Just as I want it to be," said Nan indifferently; and her
clouded glance turned to the vague landscape. A red-and-green light
bloomed and vanished. The engine's whistle signal fled by in long,
undulating ropes of sound.</p>

<p>The conductor came in to collect fares from a group of obvious
cowhands at one end of the car, and Cecile, always intensely
interested in people, looked at the visible figures with a silent
admiration. During the past two days the transcontinental had
become a sort of accommodation local that collected and dropped
travelers at each station. Sometimes it would be a woman, sometimes
a family; but usually it was otherwise, for this clearly was a
man's country. The coach was crowded with men now, of a type
entirely new to her. They were tall or short and of all degrees of
appearance, but certain particulars about them were inevitably
uniform. For one thing, a characteristic slimness of body; for
another, a similarity of boots, vests, and broad hats. When they
walked they were awkward. When they sat they talked with a slurred
briefness, and they used their hands freely to piece out phrases,
Indian-like. Their faces were watchful, somehow deliberately
wooden. Their eyes were more often than not blue, a blue turned
almost green by the surrounding darkness of tanned skin. They moved
about a great deal, played poker interminably, always were rolling
cigarettes. The coach was a fog of smoke. Directly across the aisle
a pair of them, more subdued than the rest, sat silently along the
miles, and only when the end doors opened did they show
interest&mdash;a momentary alertness that was quick and hard. Both
had their saddles beside them, and both wore belts and guns. By now
Cecile was accustomed to the weapons. More men wore them than
didn't. She was thinking of the scratched scar on the face of the
younger one when Nan broke a prolonged silence:</p>

<p>"You really don't know how glad I am to have you along. No, you
don't, Cecile. It has kept me from remembering things I don't want
to remember. But when I get off, you'll go on and I shan't ever see
you again. After you reach the coast, take another route home. If
you want to write, address the letter in care of the lawyer. Save
for yourself, he is the only person who has the name of the town
I'm going to. He will never tell." Then Nan bent forward and said
soberly: "And you must never tell. I don't want the past to follow
me. It is too hard to get rid of."</p>

<p>The conductor came along the aisle and paused. "We reach Trail
in twenty minutes. I'll see about your luggage. Kind of sorry you
have to put up with this smoke, but you can't do much with these
fellows."</p>

<p>Nan's answer was limpidly cool: "I have observed that men like
to make their own rules."</p>

<p>The conductor, appearing a little puzzled, went on.</p>

<p>Cecile spoke: "You never used to be bitter, Nan. It isn't like
you to be unkind."</p>

<p>"That, too," said Nan gently, "is part of the past. I shall not
again trust a man, make allowances for him, ask favors of him."</p>

<p>"You'll soon forget that notion," said Cecile, very positive.
She could not let such heresy go unchallenged; for if she was not
reflective, she had the wisdom of her own desires.</p>

<p>"No," contradicted Nan. "Now remember what I told you. Don't
ever give anyone my address."</p>

<p>Cecile flushed. "I shan't."</p>

<p>But Nan, looking sharply at her friend, thought she had touched
an otherwise frame of mind. So she said: "If you do, I'll of course
have to move on. Beyond even your letters."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, Nan, I won't!"</p>

<p>"The break is complete," Nan observed, more to herself than to
Cecile. "I am glad I had just enough courage to make it."</p>

<p>"But what will you do?" demanded Cecile forlornly.</p>

<p>"Does that matter?"</p>

<p>"I hate to leave you like this," worried Cecile.</p>

<p>Cold air poured into the car, and the lights dimmed again. A man
hurried forward, stopped beside the pair across the aisle&mdash;a
young and bulky man with a wide, loose mouth and a flattened nose.
It was not possible to avoid hearing him speak.</p>

<p>"Get on at Green Springs, boys?"</p>

<p>"Howdy, Hugo. Yeah."</p>

<p>Hugo's glance swept the coach and fell on the women with a
focused brightness. Cecile felt that she was being weighed,
considered unimportant, and dismissed from thought. The man's voice
dropped to a lower pitch: "Dan Bellew is on this train."</p>

<p>That name had its instant effect. The younger of the pair stood
up and looked to either end of the car. The other said: "When did
he come aboard, Hugo?"</p>

<p>"At Big Mound."</p>

<p>"He's seen you?"</p>

<p>"Think so," answered Hugo.</p>

<p>The older one was obviously irritated. "He's always showin' up
where he shouldn't be. I don't want him to see us."</p>

<p>"Get in the washroom," said Hugo.</p>

<p>The other rose. The older man murmured something Cecile, now
frankly listening, didn't catch; then the two went along the aisle
and disappeared into the washroom. Hugo sat down in the vacated
section and hoisted his feet to the red plush seat. Nan was
speaking again:</p>

<p>"When you get back home, Cecile, you'll probably meet Jamie
Scarborough. There's no doubt he'll ask you about me. Tell him
nothing. Absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>"You're sure?" asked Cecile.</p>

<p>"Well," amended Nan, "tell him this&mdash;tell him I don't want
to see him or hear from him. And that there is absolutely no use
trying to find me."</p>

<p>"That will hurt Jamie," observed Cecile.</p>

<p>"How about me?" answered Nan curtly.</p>

<p>Cecile started to speak and stopped. The inquisitive half of her
mind was engaged in the affair across the aisle; and now she saw
the rear vestibule door swing open before a high-built man. He
stood in the opening for a while, visually searching the car. Then
he came on and halted before the apparently indifferent Hugo, one
hand idly resting on the arm of Cecile's seat. Over a long interval
he said nothing&mdash;only looked down with a faint amusement that
had no friendliness in it. He was, Cecile thought, cut in much the
same pattern as the others; with a slimness of waist that
strengthened his shoulders and a sense of solidity and deep-seated
health about him. The flare of his hat accentuated all the angles
of a rather broad face, sharpened the sweep of jawbones. His skin
was ruddy and quite smooth, save for those finely etched weather
wrinkles about the temples which seemed so universally stamped on
these riding men. And that sense of inner amusement turned a broad,
compressed mouth into a slightly skeptical curve. There was, Cecile
said to herself, something just a little formidable about him. His
continued silence disturbed her.</p>

<p>Quite apparently it also disturbed the reclining Hugo. His
attitude of unawareness failed him. Turning his head, he looked up
through half-closed eyes and casually spoke:</p>

<p>"Hello, Dan."</p>

<p>Dan Bellew's "Hello, Hugo," was equally casual. He pushed back
the brim of his hat. "Traveling for your health?"</p>

<p>"A little business," muttered Hugo.</p>

<p>"Going to Trail?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"That's strange."</p>

<p>"What's strange about it?" demanded Hugo, on the defensive.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't think you'd find much business in a town you got run
out of," mused Bellew. He had never taken his attention from the
other, and that attitude of being sardonically entertained grew
more obvious. It seemed to Cecile he was playing with this Hugo.
Turning, she found Nan watching the scene, and she said to herself,
"Nan's not too depressed to see a good-looking man."</p>

<p>"My business is my business," grunted Hugo.</p>

<p>"Would be if it was a legitimate business," observed Dan Bellew.
"You wouldn't really try to fool me, would you, Hugo?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" rapped out Hugo.</p>

<p>The lurking grin broke through Bellew's face, hard and sharp.
"Just came in to tell you that you're not going to Trail."</p>

<p>"I think I am," contradicted Hugo flatly.</p>

<p>"You've been wrong before," drawled Bellew. "You're wrong
again."</p>

<p>Hugo said nothing, but he was staring back at Bellew with a
winkless attention. His body had gone still on the seat; his hands
were idle beside him. The softness, the suavity of this quarrel
astonished Cecile, who glanced at Nan in mute astonishment.
Nan&mdash;and this was surprising, too&mdash;looked on with little
signals of anger staining her cheeks. The conductor came down the
aisle, stopped in front of Bellew and recognized him with a
friendly nod.</p>

<p>Bellew said: "This man has made a slight mistake, Sam. He
thought he was going to Trail, but he finds he isn't. He'd be
pleased if you'd stop the train just long enough for him to get
off."</p>

<p>It was, of course, rank insolence, and Cecile waited
breathlessly for the conductor's explosion. Oddly, the latter's
answer was mild to the point of being conciliatory:</p>

<p>"Maybe he's got a different idea, Bellew."</p>

<p>"Hugo," stated Bellew gently, "seldom has ideas of much
importance. Sorry to bother you, Sam. Please pull down on that bell
cord."</p>

<p>The conductor was handling the situation gingerly. He looked now
to the seated Hugo, Hugo abruptly rose. "You're puttin' me afoot on
the prairie, Bellew?"</p>

<p>"My apologies."</p>

<p>Cecile could see no weakening of the deadlock. But the conductor
apparently did, for he reached up and seized the bell cord. There
was a swift reply from the engine's whistle ahead and an immediate
shrilling of the applied brakes. All the other men in the car had
turned silent and were watching with an absorbed, inscrutable
interest. Hugo's countenance was dry of expression; nothing of his
thinking showed through except for a brighter flare of light in his
greenish eyes. He said, very briefly:</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;this time, Dan."</p>

<p>Something of Bellew's preoccupation left him. He stepped back a
pace and waited for Hugo to precede him down the aisle. The door
opened and let them out, and afterwards there was a moment's
strange quiet as the train came to a full halt. Cecile heard feet
strike the graveled roadbed; a man in a near-by seat murmured,
"Told you so." Then the coaches lurched ahead under a wrenching
application of power. The conductor returned to collect Nan's
baggage. "Ten minutes to Trail," he warned her. Presently Dan
Bellew came again into the coach and walked to the deserted
section. For a little while he looked down, rolling a cigarette
with an air of abstraction. Cecile wondered about that until the
man abruptly reached over and lifted the skirts of the two saddles
still lying there.</p>

<p>He seemed to find something of particular interest.</p>

<p>Straightening, he studied the car, and when he lit the cigarette
the matchlight glowed against a smooth, guarded face. Cecile was
startled to hear Nan Avery speak in a clear anger:</p>

<p>"Arrogance in men is not a pretty thing to see."</p>

<p>Cecile swung to caution her friend, but she saw instantly that
Nan had meant the observation to be heard. Nan sat straight, her
chin up&mdash;sure sign of her temper&mdash;and she was directly
meeting the surprised look of Dan Bellew. He had turned; he had
withdrawn the cigarette from his mouth. His eyes, Cecile thought,
confusedly, could be very bleak and unfriendly. They were now. She
had the distressing feeling that he was stripping Nan's mind for
his own cool satisfaction. Yet even as she thought so a sure gleam
of humor replaced the severity of his glance.</p>

<p>"Little girls, especially strange little girls, should be seen
and not heard," he said and walked away.</p>

<p>"Why didn't the other man fight back?" fumed Nan.</p>

<p>"You deserved what you got," said Cecile candidly.</p>

<p>"What right has he to put anybody off this train?" demanded Nan
irritably. "It was outrageous. I hate men who use force like
that."</p>

<p>"Must have been a reason," said Cecile practically. "He doesn't
look like one to do anything without cause. Anyhow, why should you
care?"</p>

<p>Nan caught a quick phrase on her tongue and turned to the
window.</p>

<p>After a long period she spoke: "You're right. I shouldn't mind
it. Only there is so little fairness in this world, especially
among men."</p>

<p>Cecile was thinking, in half a panic, of other things.</p>

<p>Through the window she saw the clustered lights of an advancing
town. The train was again whistling for a stop, and some of the
cowhands were collecting their effects. The conductor put his head
into the coach and shouted, "Trail&mdash;Trail!" Nan's face was
turned back to her, a sign of strain showing through the
long-maintained composure.</p>

<p>"I guess this is the end, Cecile. Remember what I've told you.
And be a good girl."</p>

<p>"It's so damn hard to see you go!" cried Cecile.</p>

<p>"Don't!" warned Nan. She rose and walked along the aisle. There
were quite a few men in the vestibule, and the two women stood
silent and constrained while the cars came to a sighing halt. The
conductor swung down and held up his arm for Nan. One faint light
seeped out of a station house&mdash;and that seemed to be all of
the city of Trail, to which she had blindly bought a ticket. Behind
her was the pressure of the men impatient to be off; but Cecile was
clinging to her shoulder, and suddenly she turned and kissed the
girl. Cecile, frankly crying, said:</p>

<p>"You little fool!"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Nan in a small voice, "can be any worse than
what was." Then she got down and stood uncertainly to one side.
Cecile disappeared, the men filed out. Steam jets from the engine
made sharp reports through the night, and the bell's ringing rolled
resonantly across an emptiness that seemed to have no boundaries.
The conductor waved his lantern in a full bright circle and swung
up, the cars gathered momentum and slid by.</p>

<p>She saw Cecile's face pressed against a window, very dim; and
presently there was only a line of faintly, glimmering lights
curving across the flat land westward.</p>

<p>She stood there in the darkness, with her luggage around her,
ridden by a loneliness she could not help. The rest of the
deposited passengers had gone off, and she was quite alone,
smothered in the shadows. Small impressions came to her&mdash;the
smell of sage and wood-smoke, the clatter of a telegraph key. Along
the station wall was a sign that read: "See Townsite Jackson." But
her mind was on that fast-fading red-and-green glow of the train;
and as the lights grew dimmer and dimmer, so did her courage. Out
there vanished the last of her old life, gone forever with nothing
to replace it: and it was like a dark omen to think that her last
view of Cecile had been blurred and uncertain. She found herself
thinking desperately: "Why should this happen to me?" As much as
she had prepared herself for this final break, the sweeping
reaction of helplessness and regret was worse than she had ever
imagined it could be; it carried her downward into an abyss from
which there seemed no return.</p>

<p>She heard a shifting of weight on the gravel. That literally
dragged her from her reflections. Turning, she found the tall
shadow of a man standing by. When he spoke she instantly
recognized&mdash;with a revival of resentment&mdash;the casual calm
voice of Dan Bellew:</p>

<p>"Were you expecting someone to meet you?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. THE FORESHADOWED TEMPEST</h2>

<p>"NO," said Nan, pointedly brief.</p>

<p>"Then I'd better help you to the hotel."</p>

<p>It further irritated her that he refused to accept the implied
dismissal. He was only an arm's length away, looking down from his
height, immovably certain. She couldn't read his expression very
well through the dark, but she believed he was smiling with that
same faintly amused manner he had used on Hugo in the car. A
critical inner voice told her she was being ungracious and a fool,
yet her answer went curtly back to him: "I'm quite able to help
myself."</p>

<p>He didn't hear it, or if he did he brushed it aside as being
inconsequential. His body swung around to meet the arriving sound
of some other person. A shadow, small and narrow, made a breach in
the night, and a voice containing the surcharged weariness of the
world drifted forward: "Wasn't sure you'd be on this train, Dan.
Your horse is in front of Townsite's."</p>

<p>"Solano," said Bellew, "you lean against the wall over yonder
for about ten minutes. If you see anybody walking up the track,
come and tell me."</p>

<p>"Yeah," murmured Solano and backed away.</p>

<p>Bellew took possession of the luggage. "There is only one
hotel," he explained, "and it's a potluck affair. Around the left
side of the station."</p>

<p>Nan closed her lips against a quick, resenting answer and fell
in step. He was, she decided, one of those dogged men against which
irony made no impression; and she was too weary to argue. When they
turned the corner of the station she saw the lights of the town run
irregularly down one long street and halt against the farther
darkness of the flats. There were a few tall trees growing up from
the sidewalks, and the buildings she passed beside were all of
weathered boards, set apart by narrow alleys. A rider loped out of
the shadows and drew into a hitch rack, leaving a series of dust
bombs behind him. He crossed in front of them, threw a musical
"Howdy, Dan," over his shoulder, and pressed through the swinging
doors of a saloon, Yellow radiance momentarily gushed out, and a
confused murmuring of many voices rose&mdash;and died as the doors
closed. They arrived at a square which seemingly centered the town,
went over it and came up to a building identified by a faded sign
on its porch arch: "TRAIL HOUSE&mdash;1887&mdash;Maj. Cleary."
Bellew stepped aside, and thus Nan preceded him into a
lobby&mdash;gaunt beyond description. Behind a desk stood a
cherubic man whose eyes were brilliant beads recessed in a pink
round cushion; there was the air about him of having been waiting
indefinitely for her.</p>

<p>"Customer for you, Cleary." said Bellew.</p>

<p>"Et supper?" asked Major Cleary in a ridiculously treble
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nan. She was busy for a moment signing the register,
one part of her mind wondering how she should thank a man she had
no desire to thank. When she turned around she found Bellew had
settled the problem for her; he had quietly retreated and stood now
at the doorway. A woman's quick pleased exclamation raced in from
the street: "Hello, Dan&mdash;I thought you'd be back this
evening."</p>

<p>Cleary came about the counter and took Nan's luggage, saying,
"Up these stairs, please." But Nan, faintly curious, remained
still. Dan Bellew was smiling, and in another moment a girl walked
into the lobby with a swift, boyish stride. She was very slim, not
more than twenty. Her face was slightly olive and clearly modeled.
Black hair clung loosely and carelessly to a restless little head,
and two shining eyes seemed to gather all the light of the lobby
lamps and throw it laughingly up to Bellew. "She's pretty," Nan
found herself thinking, impartially. "Very pretty." The rest was
obvious, for the very manner in which this girl took Bellew's arm
and raised her shoulders was a frank, unconscious admission of what
she thought.</p>

<p>Bellew was indolently speaking:</p>

<p>"I'm put out with you, Helen. Didn't meet me at the train. No
girl of mine can neglect me like that."</p>

<p>Helen's laugh was exuberant, throaty. "Careful. Dan, careful.
I'm apt to take you seriously."</p>

<p>Nan followed the heaving Major Cleary up the stairs, vexedly
asking herself why she had spent the time looking on. Cleary went
into a musty room, lit a lamp, and retreated. When the door closed
behind him, Nan relaxed suddenly on the bed, bereft of all energy.
She had hoped, distantly, for some glamour of the country to carry
her through; but she saw nothing of it, felt nothing of it. Trail
was a drab and common and flimsy cattle town on the prairie, and
she sat in a room cheerless beyond words. A yellow mirror hung on
the wall, a chair covered with dust sat in one corner. These
articles and the iron bed on which she sat made up the furnishings.
A shade flapped full length against an open window; and there was a
hole&mdash;it looked like a bullet hole&mdash;through one
partition. All this grated on her sense of neatness. But, studying
her gloved fingertips, she quietly warned herself: "The trouble is
not with the place. It is with me. I must not ask for too much."
Tired and forlorn as she was, some restlessness would not let her
sit still. She got up and went to the mirror, to see there the
clouded reflection of a person she scarcely knew. The image
disturbed her, and she turned away, thinking: "I've got to keep
moving or I'm lost." Abruptly she left the room and went down the
stairs. Major Cleary was in a lobby chair, rocking himself to
sleep.</p>

<p>"I want to talk with somebody about a house," she said
uncertainly. "Something that will be outside of town."</p>

<p>"You'd want to see Townsite Jackson."</p>

<p>"Would you mind getting him for me?"</p>

<p>Cleary looked at her through nearly shut lids. "I doubt if he'd
come," he said indifferently. "Better go see him."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>Cleary's pipestem described a half-circle. "Catty-corner from
here across the square. They's a building there with four
doors&mdash;bank, post office, store, and land office. Any one of
'em will lead you to Townsite. Fact simply is, any business you may
do will by and by take you to Townsite."</p>

<p>Nan said "Thank you" soberly and left the lobby. Certain
shadowed forms loitered on the porch, and an idle talk died as she
went down the steps and along the boardwalk. Men strolled casually
from place to place, without hurry or apparent purpose. The air was
sharper than it had been, and she caught the keen taint of burning
wood and an intermingling dust scent. Water trickled pleasantly
from a trough; a densely black stable's mouth yawned at her,
through which traveled the patient stamp of stalled horses. There
was, she thought slowly, an air of deep peace here, the peace
following a hard day's work. The yellow dust settled beneath her
shoes as she crossed the square and turned into the doorway of a
starkly rectangular two-story building. Bright bracket lamps hung
over a counter, but the long shelves of supplies ran into a dim
background, and great mounds of sacked and boxed stuff made
breastworks along the floor.</p>

<p>A man walked slowly from some other room.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Mr. Jackson."</p>

<p>"I'm Townsite," said the man cheerfully.</p>

<p>He was, she decided, a rawboned General Grant; with the same
square, closely bearded face, the same indomitable mouth. His eyes
were a clear blue and patiently kind. Past middle age, he had the
appearance of physical strength. She thought of all this while
framing her request. It was more difficult than she had imagined,
for she stood on wholly alien grounds, a transparent Easterner.
Unconsciously she threw her shoulders back.</p>

<p>"This," she said, slowly, "is what I've come to see you about: I
want some sort of a place, a house only large enough for myself
with just a little ground around it. I want it away from town. The
rest is entirely up to your judgment. Pick the place, arrange for
it. Select whatever I shall need. Tonight, if you please. In the
morning I will be here with a check to pay for it&mdash;and ready
to go."</p>

<p>Townsite Jackson stood still while she spoke. And afterwards he
studied her for a long interval with that same slow, judging
scrutiny she had experienced at the hands of Dan Bellew. He was
smiling, but, behind that smile was a shadow of sympathy and
regret.</p>

<p>"I'm always kind of sorry to spoil a fine dream," he told her
gently. "Now let's consider this, thing a little more fully."</p>

<p>Dan Bellew stood under the black shadows of a locust and idly
talked to Helen Garcia. Then Solano came ambling out of an alley,
and Helen walked away. "I saw nothin'," said Solano.</p>

<p>"We'll ride to the ranch in the morning," observed Dan. "So you
better get your serious drinking done tonight." He crossed the
street, all at once fallen into the indolent tempo of the town, and
paused at the swinging doors of the Golden Bull. Viewing the crowd
inside&mdash;and identifying each man with particular care&mdash;he
stepped discreetly back into the shadows. The girl from the train
was at that moment heading for townsite's, and Dan watched the
quick sure swing of her body with a silent approval. There was no
doubt of her firm, independent mind; the incident on the coach had
determined that.</p>

<p>Dan chuckled soundlessly when he thought of the scene. It was
somewhat strange that the outline of her features, the gray
straightness of the glance, and even the still, angered clarity of
her voice remained distinctly with him. Her display of temper had
something to do with it, he reflected; yet beyond that was a
clear-cut personality at once colorful and feminine. Meanwhile he
searched the odd corners of Trail with a careful eye. Seeing
nothing, he strolled down to the sheriff's office and went in.</p>

<p>Jubilee Hawk was at the moment assembling the parts of a rifle
scattered along his desk. He looked up swiftly&mdash;all the
muscles and nerves of this keenly edged young man were turned to
abrupt responses&mdash;and the oddly angular face relaxed from its
concentration. He reared back, sorrel hair shining beneath the
light, and reached for his pipe. Dan sat down, rolled a cigarette.
It was, invariably, a ceremony between these two ancient friends
who knew each other so well. Dan put his feet on the desk, struck a
match, and idly surveyed the surrounding walls&mdash;Jubilee
watching him through the smoke with an oblique, half-lidded
interest. When Bellew did at last break the silence it was so
casually as to suggest the continuation of a previous sentence:</p>

<p>"When there's carrion around, the buzzards circle down."</p>

<p>Jubilee nodded. "Election's only ten days off, if that's what
you mean."</p>

<p>Dan looked across the table. "How'd you like to be an
ex-sheriff?"</p>

<p>"May damn well be," grunted Jubilee. "And very soon. Neel St.
Cloud is going to frame the election if he can. Once he gets Ruel
Gasteen wearin' this star he'll have the best luck of his life.
Ruel Gasteen will absolutely obey orders. St. Cloud knows
that."</p>

<p>"How," went on Bellew idly, "would you like to be a dead
sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Thought we'd get to the nigger in the woodpile pretty soon.
Let's have it."</p>

<p>"I'm going to catch thunder for monkeying in your business,"
said Dan whimsically. "But anyhow, Hugo Lamont was on the train
tonight."</p>

<p>"So?" Jubilee straightened. "I ran him out of here once by the
slack of his britches."</p>

<p>"I knew that. Why do you suppose he wanted to come back?"</p>

<p>"Vote St. Cloud's ticket of course."</p>

<p>"No," answered Bellew. "No. If it was that, he'd wait until the
last day. Only reason he'd venture into this town again would be to
take a shot at you. He's got a score to settle."</p>

<p>"I can run him out again," was Jubilee's laconic
observation.</p>

<p>Bellew smiled. "As I said, I'm going to get the devil for
interfering. But I was afraid if he got here he'd broach you before
I could put my warning in. So I stopped the train and set him off.
If he's comin', it will be afoot. You're warned."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd quit goin' to trouble for me, Dan."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure there wasn't somebody else of interest on that
train," added Bellew, very thoughtful. "Saw a couple of saddles in
an empty section. You watch your step."</p>

<p>"Why should everybody have the sudden desire to make a target
out of me?"</p>

<p>"St. Cloud isn't any too certain he'll win the election. If you
got unfortunately killed in line of duty it would simplify matters
for him. He's determined to put his whole ticket of scoundrels into
office."</p>

<p>"He's a cool enough cucumber to figure all the angles."</p>

<p>"Never underestimate him," said Dan. "He has a first-rate mind.
And when you harness a good head to crooked schemes, you've got a
situation full of dynamite."</p>

<p>Silence came again, prolonged and studious. Jubilee ran a hand
through his sorrel hair and appeared puzzled. "This is a rougher,
tougher country than it used to be, Dan. More trouble, more
suspicion, more thievin'."</p>

<p>"I've watched the grief gatherin' up for the last couple years,"
agreed Bellew. "The trouble is right over yonder in Smoky Draw, my
lad. Neel St. Cloud never used to be anything but a talking man.
Then he got himself an idea. He's been working on it ever
since."</p>

<p>"What idea?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," was Bellew's slow answer. "I can't figure out a
sensible story."</p>

<p>"If it was a decent candidate runnin' against me," grumbled
Jubilee, "I wouldn't mind losing. This job is nothing but
sorrow&mdash;and gettin' worse. One of these days I may have to do
something I don't want to do. Learned yesterday that Pete Garcia
finally made up his mind to throw in openly with the crooks. He's
moved to Smoky Draw. He's ridin' with St. Cloud's outfit."</p>

<p>Bellew reared, showed a disappointed disgust. "That's something
I halfways expected but hoped wouldn't happen."</p>

<p>"He's plain no good. Don't see how one family can produce two
such different kids. Helen's straight as a string. Pete's
foolishness hurts her, Dan."</p>

<p>"Of course it does. I've got to talk to that boy."</p>

<p>"For more reasons than one," added Jubilee quietly, "it hurts
her."</p>

<p>Dan stared at his partner. "Well?"</p>

<p>But Jubilee got up, shaking his head. "I'll say no more. Shoot a
game of pool?"</p>

<p>"No, I've got to see Townsite yet." Bellew also rose, openly
disturbed. "All Helen ever got out of that shiftless family of hers
was a dirty deal. Now here is her brother gone haywire. I'm going
to find Pete and make his ears ring."</p>

<p>"Do you no good. You've kept him on the safe side long as you
ever will." Jubilee made a circle about the room, scowling at the
floor. Presently he stopped in front of Dan. "You could go farther
and do worse, Dan."</p>

<p>"Cut that out. Helen's just a kid."</p>

<p>"Nineteen. You're only twenty-six."</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do?" challenged Bellew. "Marry me off?
Be sensible."</p>

<p>Jubilee grinned slowly, but his eyes remained sober.</p>

<p>"Wanted to get a declaration. If you're not in the race, then
the field's open to me."</p>

<p>"With my best love," drawled Bellew.</p>

<p>"Don't want yours. I'd want hers. That's no good, either. Hers
is on another man."</p>

<p>Bellew was instantly interested. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Not sure," said Jubilee evasively and changed the subject.
"While we're speakin' of being careful, you do same. If St. Cloud
really takes to a hardware campaign, you'll be number one on his
list. Don't forget that. You and him have been on the opposite ends
of the teeter-board for a good many years."</p>

<p>Bellew, not paying much attention, went out, deeply engrossed
with the affairs of Helen and Pete Garcia, somberly and acutely
displeased. He could not remember when they had not brought their
troubles to him. He couldn't recall when he hadn't fought for the
both of them. With Pete it was only a question of keeping him out
of too serious trouble, for the boy was a slack and shiftless
Garcia. But Helen, and the thought brought a quick upswing of
pleasure, was always full of pride, always indomitably at work. To
see her was to see a flash of something bright across an otherwise
gray scene.</p>

<p>"She's been a good soldier, with never any reward," grumbled
Bellew. "She was made for something better than a slavey to a
plain, no-'count family. I'm going to run Pete out of the country:
If he wants to go to hell, he can do it beyond her sight."</p>

<p>His feet struck the edge of the walk, and he woke from his
preoccupation to find he had unconsciously turned back to the
Golden Bull. Recollecting he wanted to see Townsite, he started
forward. A moment later he came to a full halt in the shadows,
strangely puzzled. Something happened on the edge of his
vision&mdash;happened swiftly and surreptitiously. That odd
movement was enough to throw him instantly against his alert and
wary self. Placing his shoulders against the saloon walls, he
turned his eyes to the lower and blacker half of the town.</p>

<p>He saw, first, a man standing quite alone on the walk about
fifty yards away. The fellow was drawn up against a porch post in
an attitude of rigid attention and his face was aimed on the
sheriff's office diagonally across the street. This went on for
perhaps half a minute; then the man lifted an arm in apparent
signal. At once a second figure came from an alley near the
sheriff's office and stepped along the boards, keeping well against
the building walls. All this, Bellew thought with a narrower
interest, was deliberate and premeditated; the man passed Jubilee's
door, looked swiftly in, not breaking his stride. A little later he
arrived directly opposite Bellew, whom he apparently didn't
see.</p>

<p>Bellew flashed a glance back toward the first man, to discover
instantly that one had faded out of the scene; and then this
predatory maneuvering became clear to him. The second fellow halted
near Townsite's, turned on his heels, and began to retrace his
route. Bellew reached the dusty street in three long paces, coldly
afraid he had come into action too late. His challenge broke across
the quiet:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute."</p>

<p>It was, he realized, a bad place to be and a poor move to make.
He stood aligned between the two&mdash;and the game was deadly
serious. He recognized that before the echo of his order had quite
died. The cruising man pulled to a sharp halt, evidently startled
out of his set design. Taut and fine-drawn, Bellew saw the impact
of that surprise congeal the man to a postured stillness&mdash;a
warning stillness that hit Bellew with a chilling effect. Thinking
about the fellow somewhere behind him, and thinking of Jubilee off
guard in the brightly illumined office, Bellew spoke again:</p>

<p>"Don't lose your head. Cut loose from your rope. Come over
here."</p>

<p>There was a dimming of that lamp glow flooding from Townsite's
door. Somebody stepped out&mdash;this much was on the remote area
of Bellew's vision. A chair scraped a floor near by. The opposing
man let out a long, gusty sigh and said, "You're in the way,
Bellew." His whole body was released from the cramped immobility;
he leaped aside. Bellew thought distantly: "The fool is drawing on
me," and brushed the skirts of his coat away from his gun's butt. A
swelling roar drove all the silence of the town up beyond the
housetops, and those peaked roofs seemed to come crashing down. A
snake-head of dust sprang in front of him, and a hard, fierce sense
of pleasure flowed along his fibers from knowing he survived the
shot. He brought his weapon swiftly forward and fired twice on the
plaque-like silhouette ahead, There was a tumbling rush of bodies
in the Golden Bull. Jubilee was in the play now, for Jubilee's
metal order beat across the street to check somebody's advance:
"Get back there, you!"</p>

<p>Bellew, motionless, said into space: "Careful, Jubilee, there's
another one." The figure before him swayed, called weakly, "That's
it, I guess." Then fell and turned shapelessly still on the
dust.</p>

<p>Bellew called again to Jubilee: "Watch for the other one." He
walked forward, stood directly above the fallen gunman. The
sleepiness of Trail was gone, and people were running up from all
its quarters, to make a discreet gallery along the walks.</p>

<p>"Somebody get a lantern," he muttered.</p>

<p>Jubilee came back in long, unhurried strides. "I saw that other
mug when I came out the door. He faded on the run. What've we got
here?"</p>

<p>"I walked into it," said Bellew slowly. "But it was meant for
you. Bring that lantern here."</p>

<p>The crowd stood back, cautious of sudden shots out of the dark.
But one lantern made a gleaming, restless wake forward&mdash;that
was Townsite Jackson coming up. He swung the light down against the
prone body.</p>

<p>"Tom Addis," said Jubilee, surprised. "What in thunder was he
sore about? This is queer."</p>

<p>"He and his partner were on that train," reflected Bellew. "They
belonged to those saddles I saw. A nice trick. Use your head,
Jubilee. He didn't have to be sore. He was obeying orders."</p>

<p>"Well," mused Jubilee, "here's the end of something."</p>

<p>"No," put in Townsite gravely, "the beginning of something."</p>

<p>"That's right," assented Bellew. Then he added a very quiet
phrase: "I'm sorry for this poor lad."</p>

<p>Only Townsite and Jubilee heard that. Jubilee watched Bellew
with a strangely blank expression. His arm fell lightly on Bellew's
shoulder. "Might of been you, Dan."</p>

<p>Bellew stared at his partner, but looked quickly away.
"Solano!"</p>

<p>Solano's exhausted voice came from a hidden alley. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"I thought I told you to keep an eye on the station."</p>

<p>"Wasn't nothing there," said Solano positively.</p>

<p>Nan Avery, leaving the store, stepped directly into the full
shock of it. The sound of the shooting leaped at her, the wake of a
passing bullet passed across her face. Not comprehending, she did
the natural thing and shrank back against the wall. Looking around,
she saw the two of them planted in the street, both motionless,
both speechless; and then the sense of all this went through her,
actually shaking her body. The nearer man sighed, a sound more
horrible than anything in her experience. He said faintly, "That's
it, I guess," and fell in a wheeling, dreadful motion. After that
Bellew's rapid "Watch for the other one" identified him to her for
the first time.</p>

<p>He came forward from the obscurity and stood with his head
slightly bowed. Townsite passed with the lantern, and then Nan
observed Bellew's face rather clearly. It was very sober, very
calm. Other men were talking, but she paid no attention to what
they said. A bit of powder smoke drifted back and left a definite
taste on her palate, strengthening her feeling of physical
sickness. The fallen man never moved again; he lay sprawled there
without dignity, without shape, one hand stretched out in a vain
reaching. It was all so merciless, so savage. The slow conversation
that went on seemed to have no sympathy in it, no regret. Looking
up again to Bellew and vainly hoping to find the established
coldness breaking into a more humane expression, all the bitter
resentment at a heartless world swept through her and found an
outlet. She straightened from the wall, calling directly to
Bellew:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you killer!"</p>

<p>His face came quickly up, but she saw it only in blurred
outline. Wheeling, she ran confusedly across the square and into
the hotel. Major Cleary still sat in his easy chair, though
upright. When she passed him he said:</p>

<p>"Who was it?" Halfway up the stairs she heard a woman's voice
follow her, arresting and imperative. Going defensively about, she
found the girl Helen framed in the doorway. The boyish body was
straight with anger, the olive face pale&mdash;so pale that the
deeply black eyes made a burning impression against it. The vivid
lips parted.</p>

<p>"Until you know more about this country," said Helen, words
rushing violently across the barren lobby, "and until you know more
about Dan Bellew, keep your mouth shut!"</p>

<p>Major Cleary bawled out: "Get out of my place, Garcia!"</p>

<p>The girl turned impetuously on him. "You&mdash;you're no better
than any other St. Cloud man! Why don't you tell people how you
play his crooked game!" She looked back at Nan, stormy, shaken by
her own feelings. Then she flung herself around and disappeared,
the sound of her hurried steps striking into dead silence.</p>

<p>Nan pulled herself up the stairs. Soon in bed, she couldn't
sleep. The images of what she had seen palpitated across the
darkness in stark and terrifying distinctness, like a nightmare
dream. Lying there, she had the sensation of the cruel weight of
this land pressing down on her, smothering her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. THE CHARMING SINNER</h2>

<p>DAN BELLEW walked through the thickening crowd and across the
square to Townsite's store, feeling his nerves loosen and grow
ragged. It was, he realized distantly, the inevitable
after-punishment a man took for throwing his past and future into
one debatable moment of time. All the sounds and sensations of the
fight remained with him, and the last scene&mdash;of Tom Addis
lying on the earth like a vagrant shadow&mdash;was etched in his
mind with an intaglio sharpness. Thinking of it, his eyes assumed a
somber, smoky coloration. Townsite and Jubilee noticed that the
moment they followed Dan into the store.</p>

<p>Townsite, older and wiser, said nothing; he began a little chore
of whittling plug tobacco for his pipe. But Jubilee, whose thoughts
always ran parallel to those of his partner, cast a keen glance at
Dan and broke the spell.</p>

<p>"He was free, white, and twenty-one. He had his plain choice,
and he chose to make the fight. Forget it: Might of been you,
Dan."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for him," said Dan, profoundly regretful.</p>

<p>Townsite drawled: "A man always goes through these scraps twice.
Durin' the shootin' and after the shootin'. Second time is
hardest."</p>

<p>"I should have moved into the play sooner," said Dan, reviewing
each step of the way. "I caught him too late, after he was set. He
was in no frame of mind to back up. I'm sorry for that. It wasn't
his personal fight&mdash;it was the fight of the man that ordered
him to Trail." His temper rose and rubbed the words. "There's
something else to put on Neel St. Cloud's record."</p>

<p>"You sure?" questioned Jubilee.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest doubt of his part in this," answered Bellew.
"He's not sure he can muster the votes to put his thugs in office.
So he's going to the gun."</p>

<p>Townsite removed his pipe, bent over the counter. "We can't let
him, boys. It'll be a taste of raw meat for him and his kind. Once
the wild ones climb the saddle, this valley will be bloody ground,
I'm telling you."</p>

<p>Jubilee squatted on a sugar sack, shook tobacco in a brown
paper. He threw back his angular, sorrel head and surveyed the
others slantwise. "Well, first shot has been fired."</p>

<p>"There will be more," observed Bellew, very quiet. "The break's
been made. It can't be stopped&mdash;not short of a decisive defeat
for one side or the other."</p>

<p>Townsite's bearded face waggled slowly from side to side. He
muttered forebodingly: "I hate to think of the next ten days."</p>

<p>"Why just ten days?" asked Jubilee practically. "The election is
only part of it. Doesn't matter who wins, the grief is going to go
on."</p>

<p>There was a little silence. Heavy smoke folded across the yellow
lamplight. Townsite's pipe wheezed. "I have lived here twenty-seven
years. I put up the first cabin in this town. I helped drive in the
first herd of Texas beef." Paused, Townsite stared at the others
with a sudden angry energy. "I knew the fine men that made this
range, and I'll be damned if I'll stand by and let the crooks make
an outlaw strip of it!"</p>

<p>"I wish I could see what there was in it for St. Cloud," fretted
Jubilee.</p>

<p>Bellew came to a stand. "Three years ago he had half a dozen
cowhands up in Smoky Draw. Maybe three thousand head of stock.
Today nobody knows how many riders are hiding back in that timber.
I've checked twenty or better. As for the beef, it has grown out of
all proportions to the natural increase."</p>

<p>"I know," agreed Jubilee. "But there's a limit to thievin'. What
will political control of the county buy him?"</p>

<p>"I've told you before the man has a restless, fertile brain.
He's got some plan."</p>

<p>"We're ruined if he does gain control," grumbled Townsite.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" began Jubilee.</p>

<p>Dan said "Careful," in a flat voice; and all three turned toward
the doorway and toward the man framed in it. "Gasteen," muttered
Dan, "you have a poor habit of eavesdropping."</p>

<p>Ruel Gasteen remained still. Beneath the shadowing brim of his
hat lay features scarcely conforming with one another. A lantern
jaw threw the lower lip beyond the upper and so created a plain
impression of brutality. The man's skin was yery dark, tightly
bound across broad blunt bones; his eyes were secretively inset and
somehow suggested the predatory. Inordinately long arms hung
straight and motionless beside him.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" challenged Townsite.</p>

<p>Gasteen shifted. "If I was sheriff, Bellew," said he in a
strange softness, "you'd be in jail for that shootin'."</p>

<p>"We'll wait till you are," countered Bellew evenly.</p>

<p>Gasteen nodded. "It will be my first official act&mdash;to put
you there."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the warning."</p>

<p>Gasteen stepped backwards, out of sight, as discreetly as he had
entered. The three presently heard his pony drumming down the
street, northward.</p>

<p>"Gone to report the bad luck to St. Cloud," growled
Townsite.</p>

<p>Bellew said, "Just so."</p>

<p>Townsite thought of something else. "By the way, that Eastern
girl came to see me. Name's Nan Avery. She wanted me to get her a
homestead somewhere beyond town."</p>

<p>Bellew displayed a quick interest. "You told her that was
impossible, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"It did me no good," chuckled Townsite. "I talked to her like a
beloved uncle. When I got through she went right on as if she
hadn't heard. That girl has been accustomed to giving orders."</p>

<p>"You should have mentioned the danger of a woman living alone on
the prairie."</p>

<p>"She waved that aside, too. The girl's got courage, Dan. And I
think she's been in trouble. Anyhow, she was so downright about it
I had to give in. As much as told me she'd go ahead anyhow if I
didn't see fit to do the dickering for her."</p>

<p>"And she would," mused Bellew.</p>

<p>"Well," Townsite wanted to know, "where'll we put her?"</p>

<p>After a moment Dan said: "Tanner's old cabin."</p>

<p>Townsite was dubious. "Too close to St. Cloud's wild boys."</p>

<p>"I know. But Henry Mitchell's only half a mile from it, and I'm
just west of the coulees a couple miles."</p>

<p>"All right," said Townsite. "Now I've got to arrange everything
tonight. Guess she never heard about the values of procrastinatin'.
Who'll show her up there?"</p>

<p>"It's on my way," said Dan. "I'm going home in the morning."</p>

<p>Both men looked oddly at him. Jubilee's question was faintly
ironic: "After she gives you a lacin'?"</p>

<p>"She didn't understand," said Dan gently.</p>

<p>Townsite repeated his conviction: "She's been in trouble."</p>

<p>Dan nodded indifferently and left the place, obviously thinking
of other things. He took his horse to the stable and afterwards
headed for the Golden Bull, there locating Solano. "Go on home
tonight," he told Solano. "Early in the morning take a broom and a
hammer over to the Tanner cabin and clean it up."</p>

<p>Back in the store Townsite said: "The shootin' hurt him pretty
hard."</p>

<p>Jubilee morosely assented. "A lot of things hurt him. What
worries me is the future. You realize that Dan will sure be the
chief target in this fight? You'll never organize the respectable
ranchers under anybody else. St. Cloud knows it, too. His aim will
be to get Dan out of the way."</p>

<p>When Nan came from the hotel next morning early, she had for a
moment the sensation of definitely beginning another existence. A
hard, bright sunlight washed the unlovely walls of Trail to create
crisp black and white contrasts. All the buildings stood before her
with a gaunt angularity. In another hour it would be hot, but there
was yet a coolness to the air and a kind of winelike vigor that
woke in her some little sense of buoyancy. Surprisingly, the night
and its terrible, scene absorbed less of her imagination than she
had thought possible. Crossing the yellow dust of the square, she
found a flat-bed wagon and team waiting there, loaded with
supplies. Tethered behind was a pair of saddled horses.</p>

<p>Townsite came out of the store.</p>

<p>"I have a cashier's check," she said and held it out to him,
"Please settle the account and let the balance stand in your
bank."</p>

<p>Townsite grinned openly. "I don't believe," he drawled, "I ever
run up against anybody like you. But I got everything fixed."</p>

<p>"What are the saddle horses for?"</p>

<p>"One's yours. Hereabouts you need a horse worse than you need
shoes. It's the little strawberry there&mdash;very gentle. Other
one belongs to the man that's taking you out. Mama, come out
here."</p>

<p>A gray, quick-moving little woman appeared from the store. She
had, Nan realized, been watching. Townsite said: "This is Miss
Avery, Mama."</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsite had snapping, inquisitive eyes; but a kindly mouth
and a ready smile. "If you'd just stay over a day," she offered,
"I'd like to introduce you to the women of the town."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"Here's your teamster for the trip," drawled Townsite. "Dan
Bellew&mdash;owner of the Broken Stirrup."</p>

<p>Nan turned quickly, saw Bellew strolling over the dust; and for
a moment most of her self-possession deserted her. It was a
situation she didn't know how to meet. Half angered, she felt color
come to her cheeks. Townsite was speaking: "Dan's ranch ain't far
from your cabin, Miss Avery. He's goin' home and agreed to take
care of you."</p>

<p>There was no use of pretending, she thought, and met Bellew's
glance directly. "I believe you understand how little I like to put
you to this trouble."</p>

<p>The challenge was there, as she meant it to be. But once again
she was left helpless in front of his manner. He only nodded, the
same remote amusement in his eyes&mdash;they were a darker hazel
than she had first imagined&mdash;and went directly to the wagon.
Obviously he waited for her, and so she followed, accepting his
hand-up. He went around, climbed to the seat, and took the
reins.</p>

<p>"You're carryin' a sack of flour for Henry Mitchell," called
Townsite.</p>

<p>Bellew kicked off the brake, leaned down to Townsite. "If
anything comes up suddenly," he murmured, "get the news to me."
Then the team moved away.</p>

<p>Townsite chuckled at the departing pair. "She's mad enough at
him to chew nails, Mama."</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsite said firmly:</p>

<p>"Jackson, she's got a past&mdash;you mark my word. I'll bet
she's a remittance girl."</p>

<p>Townsite went stoutly to Nan's defense: "I like her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsite flashed a humorously understanding glance at her
husband. "You'd like anything that was helpless. She won't last out
here, Jackson."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't bet on that," said Townsite. "She's a fighter."</p>

<p>The road climbed a gentle grade and presently tipped into a
valley; and it was, Nan thought, like putting away from shore. To
right and left&mdash;perhaps eight miles in either
direction&mdash;were low enclosing ridges now being slowly blurred
by the haze of summer. Northward at a greater distance lay a high
and black pile of hills toward which the tawny-grassed flooring ran
in long, slow undulations. The road pointed that way straight as a
chalk line. A red sun climbed into a sky that was very blue; one
gleaming cloud pillar stood alone. Morning's breeze died, and she
felt at once the day's sultriness closing in. Cattle lay scattered
and apparently motionless all about the flats. Two miles or more
onward she looked back to see the whole distance to town marked by
a risen banner of dust that clung cloudily to the air.</p>

<p>Dan Bellew had so far said nothing. From the corner of her
vision she saw him loosely straight on the seat, his bronzed face
soberly composed. Now and then his head described a long arc, as if
he regularly searched the horizons, and he appeared to be oblivious
of her presence. Presumably he had felt her attitude of resentment
and meant to respect it. Yet, the situation promised to grow
intolerable, even ludicrous; two people could not ride together by
the hour and ignore each other. That calm of his was monumental,
she thought irritably; yet another reflection, and a fairer one,
told her she had set the precedent and so had to make the first
overture. Her voice seemed to her to be ridiculously stiff:</p>

<p>"How far is this place?"</p>

<p>"About fourteen miles from Trail."</p>

<p>He had returned the same exact measure of words.</p>

<p>She told herself, "He's either trying to discipline me or ignore
me," and decided to remain silent all the rest of the way. A long
time afterward she was a little surprised to hear him talking
impersonally:</p>

<p>"This is plain cattle country, nothing else. Off to the left
rear&mdash;where you see a slight break in the ridge&mdash;is Simon
LeBoeuf's ranch. His range comes over as far as this road. Look to
the right now and you'll see Gunderson's quarters." His long arm
pointed, and she discovered the outlines of grouped houses against
the foot of that rightward ridge. "LeBoeuf and Gunderson control
all the lower half of the valley. The upper half, which is
narrower, is my range. Broken Stirrup. There's maybe a dozen small
outfits here and there, in addition. That's all."</p>

<p>She had begun to observe that upper narrowing of the flats.
Those left and right ridges were gradually closing in. She asked
about it, more to avoid embarrassing silence than anything
else.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dan. "They meet up yonder by those dark peaks to
form Smoky Pass. Your place is there." A lighter and more indolent
manner came to him. "The Indians have a legend about those two
ridges. Seems like there once was a maid and a man who quarreled.
So the gods turned 'em into hills. That eastern one is Buck ridge;
the western one, Squaw ridge. But the maid got sorry, and even
stones couldn't keep her away from the man. So there's the result."
His arm traced the far-off bending of Squaw ridge. "She went back
to the man. Squaw and Buck ridges join at the pass."</p>

<p>"The man," said Nan, coolly, "made no move to meet the
maid?"</p>

<p>"Men are stubborn, I guess."</p>

<p>"It is easy to see that a man created the myth," was Nan's brief
retort.</p>

<p>"I was waiting for that," drawled Dan. For the first time their
glances locked. Nan saw the humor lying quietly in his eyes. It
only increased her defensive aggravation. "You seem sure of my
reactions, Mr. Bellew."</p>

<p>"I have a couple previous ones to judge from. As for the man,
maybe he thought the maid had him all wrong&mdash;and waited till
she changed her mind."</p>

<p>"Quite probably he would think himself the injured one."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," agreed Dan. "But right or wrong, about all the
buck could do was wait. If he was right he had an apology coming.
If he was wrong he'd naturally suppose the woman was through with
him." Then he added idly: "Another strictly man's idea, of
course."</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose the woman may have thought the same way?"</p>

<p>"Don't lay that trap for me," countered Bellew. "How do I know
what a woman thinks?"</p>

<p>"She may have thought this man unjust and blind&mdash;and still
have gone to him because she couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't be finished with him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Nan, suddenly feeling the conversation out of
control. "Not if she loved him. That&mdash;that's a weakness. I'm
not applauding the woman for it."</p>

<p>"I believe," murmured Bellew, "I would."</p>

<p>"Of course," retorted Nan.</p>

<p>He looked obliquely at her, then turned his attention across the
flats to sudden bomblike clouds of dust. The road made a swinging
circle toward the eastern ridge and gradually ran a parallel course
beside it. The dust cloud rolled nearer, and presently Nan
recognized a compact body of horsemen advancing at a set gallop.
Dan. Bellew was quite silent, and she looked curiously at him,
feeling a strange stiffening of his attitude. The direct glance was
pinned on the cavalcade; his face had gone quite smooth. Something
about him sent a small current of excitement through her. The group
arrived within a few hundred yards, broke out of the gallop to a
slower pace. Two men spurred abreast the leader&mdash;and so the
team and wagon came upon them. Bellew said "Who-oa"
expressionlessly and halted. "Hello, St. Cloud."</p>

<p>"Hello, Dan."</p>

<p>The name registered instantly with Nan, but for a moment her
attention strayed to the two other flanking riders. One&mdash;this
was Ruel Gasteen, though she didn't know it&mdash;she had seen for
a moment during the previous night and had remarked the excessive
lower jaw and the tight leather skin. The other was very short and
very broad, with a face quite unrelieved by intelligence or
humanity. His wide mouth was indescribably bitter, his eyes
intensely glowing; a broad cowlick of hair covered a half of his
forehead and hung just above one eye, to give him a sullen,
dull-witted appearance. One leg, she saw, was short and deformed.
Then her glance passed to the center man and found a quick
contrast. This Neel St. Cloud, whose name seemed to be a password
of trouble, was a slim, cavalry-figured person as tall as Bellew.
He had yellow hair, a sharp, mobile face, a cream-ruddy complexion.
And he was, she instantly guessed, rather educated. That air was
about him. But the dominating impression he left with her was of a
lurking, restless laughter; of a cynical nonchalant cheerfulness at
once keying his character. He was obviously sure of himself, almost
disdainfully sure, and he made so great a contrast to the more
animal types beside him that Nan found herself absorbed. She was,
consequently, half startled at the swift answering interest this
Neel St. Cloud passed to her. She looked quickly away.</p>

<p>"Trust you had a nice train trip," said St. Cloud to Bellew.</p>

<p>"Been informed, I see," replied Bellew.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Any objections?"</p>

<p>St. Cloud's ironic smile grew more pronounced. "None, my friend.
None at all."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose one man more or less counts much with you,"
agreed Bellew.</p>

<p>"It is not the checkers that count, Dan. It's the game."</p>

<p>"I judge so."</p>

<p>The antagonism of these two reached out and touched Nan. It was
something distinct and embodied. It inflected each of those soft,
courteously spoken words. She observed something else about St.
Cloud, too. Careless as he was, apparently reckless as he was, his
attention remained on Bellew as a sharp, constant thing. There
could be, she reflected, no pair so opposed. Bellew was solidity
itself, slow and even-tempered, his energies stored away. By
contrast, St. Cloud was mercurial, his mobile face reflecting the
lightness and darkness of his thoughts. Bellew said abruptly:</p>

<p>"&mdash;I'd like to see you soon, St. Cloud. For a talk."</p>

<p>"On my way back from town I'll drop over," promised St. Cloud
and reined his pony around the wagon. In passing he lifted his hat
to Nan and smiled directly at her. Then the whole cavalcade went
storming by, Bellew put his team in motion.</p>

<p>"He is a rancher?" asked Nan.</p>

<p>"Has a ranch. Beyond the pass, in Smoky Draw."</p>

<p>"Those were his men?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The reticence of the answers warned her. She thought quietly,
"He hates the man, but won't speak." Thereafter silence covered the
dusty miles one by one. Heat waves made quivering layers against
the earth, and the dry grasses sent up a scorched smell. She could
see now the jointure of Squaw and Buck ridges, the little notch of
the pass, and the darkly rising peaks beyond. The road took an
upward direction, wound along the irregular footing of the slopes.
Turning a point of rock, Bellew drew up in front of a small,
paintless house. A man walked from behind it&mdash;loose of frame
and gaunt. He was rather old, she saw, but he had that weathered
vigor of an out-of-doors hand worker. "This," said Bellew
cheerfully, "is Henry Mitchell: Henry, you'll have a neighbor. Miss
Avery here is going to live in Tanner's place."</p>

<p>She liked Henry Mitchell at once, just from the way he lifted
and dropped his beaten hat; his eyes were faded, very honest. All,
he said was, "Fine, fine." But it was deeply encouraging.</p>

<p>"Sack of flour for you," said Bellew.</p>

<p>Henry Mitchell went to the tailgate, found his flour and dragged
it out. Bellew sat idle a moment. "What's news?"</p>

<p>"Lorrie," drawled Mitchell, full of pride, "shot a deer all by
himself."</p>

<p>Bellew chuckled. "The kid's a regular Sioux," he mused, looking
around the yard.</p>

<p>"You won't find him," said Mitchell. "He saw you comin'. Ducked
out when he observed the lady. He's shy, ma'm. By the way, Dan, I
got some advice this mornin'."</p>

<p>Dan looked more closely at Mitchell. "Who from?"</p>

<p>"The doctor," said Mitchell enigmatically. "It was his reckonin'
I ought not to travel too much. Specially up in the hills."</p>

<p>They were, Nan knew, speaking in code. Dan's face settled to a
thoughtful severity. After a while he said: "Better be careful,
then, Henry. You've Lorrie to look after."</p>

<p>"Yeah," observed Henry Mitchell. "Wait a minute," he added and
walked behind the house. A little later he returned with a can of
water which he placed securely in the wagon. Dan nodded, urging the
horses on again. A hundred yards away Nan saw a boyish form rush
from one high boulder and disappear behind another. Head and eyes
came cautiously around it; a shrill whoop sailed along the windless
air.</p>

<p>Bellew grinned. "That's Lorrie," he said and let the team set
its own pace up and around a steeper grade. Trees thickened on the
ridge's side, and the ground buckled into several parallel,
coulees. Looking behind, she saw the valley sweep away from her to
a misty horizon; and when she again straightened frontward, she
found the end of the journey. Another house&mdash;no different from
Mitchell's&mdash;set a few rods off the road, without shelter,
without grace. Bellew drove abreast a small porch, kicked on the
brake, and got down. Rather stiffly Nan followed
suit&mdash;uncertain, once more feeling a let-down of spirit.</p>

<p>She had expected little, nor was this any better than her
expectations. Crossing the porch, she entered the place and stood
aside while Bellew packed her belongings through. There were three
rooms&mdash;front room, bedroom, kitchen&mdash;and these only
separated by the scantiest sort of rough-board partitioning which
somebody had started to cover with old newspapers. The outer walls
were warped, none too windproof; and looking up to an unsealed
attic, she saw points of light stabbing through the shingles. A few
pieces of improvised furniture remained, an old pair of overalls
hung on a nail, the kitchen held a small stove. It was, she
thought, nothing better than a primitive shelter&mdash;and she
unsuccessfully tried to imagine the kind of people who had
previously lived in it. Comfort, apparently, was a luxury here.
What were the necessities?</p>

<p>Bellew stood before her, his hat off and the black hair aglisten
with sweat. "You're moved in," he told her. "That can of water is
sitting beside the pump. It's to prime with. Never let yourself get
entirely out of water. Your horse is in the barn. Piece of a fenced
pasture you can run him in. He won't drift away, and he'll stand on
dropped reins. Ever saddle a horse?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I've ridden before."</p>

<p>He loitered, looking down with that old air of judging her. "At
night you'll hear a lot of noises. Don't worry. Country's full of
packrats. Pay no attention. But as a matter of habit, lock your
doors."</p>

<p>"Against what?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his big shoulders. "Against possibilities. There's a
new .38 in that mess of supplies. Don't ride anywhere without it.
Don't go walking through sage without boots on. If you put your
bedding out to air, shake it before you bring it in again. That's
for ticks which we have in summer and fall. Should you hear travel
on the road after dark, don't display too much curiosity." Paused,
he showed a faint puzzlement. Nan, knowing he wondered about her
luck in such surroundings, was quick to speak up:</p>

<p>"I can take care of myself."</p>

<p>"One thing more," said Dan. "Don't ride beyond the pass. Not at
any time."</p>

<p>"Otherwise," asked Nan, deceptively calm, "I may do as I
please?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have offered too much advice," said Bellew quietly
and went out. Presently going to the door, she saw him driving away
with the empty wagon&mdash;not down the road but straight west over
a roll of land. He was soon out of sight, leaving her with the
uncomfortable thought that she had made no effort to thank him. As
before, he had relieved her of the need of doing something she
didn't wish to do.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. ST. CLOUD'S PRONOUNCEMENT</h2>

<p>THE last clacking echo of the wagon died out in a coulee, and
afterwards the deep silence of the country returned. Nan removed
her hat and coat and sat on the edge of a trunk, all her impulses
idle and indecisive for the while. Still heat pressed heavily
through the house; the boards emitted a baked smell. Looking down
at her fingertips, she thought again of the gracelessness of the
place, then said quietly: "But I have no reason to ask anything
more than plain shelter." The sense of defeat was almost
overpowering.</p>

<p>There always had been in her a strain of lucid, self-examining
honesty; and even now she was able to explain that feeling of being
cast adrift. The Nan Avery who was important to herself and to
others, who lived in the midstream of things, who was full of
faith, no longer existed. Another Nan Avery sat on the trunk's edge
and soberly looked back into ruin. There was nothing left. Yet the
warning returned. "I must not go in for self-pity. I haven't the
right." And after that the mutations of her drifting thoughts
returned her to Dan Bellew. The oddness of it was that a few short
weeks ago she would have liked him&mdash;but now never
could&mdash;for in him were mirrored those qualities she no longer
trusted&mdash;a man's obvious strength, a man's distinct, almost
ruthless point of view. Her guard would always be against him; she
couldn't soften her instinctive antagonism.</p>

<p>She got up, impatient with herself, forcing her mind back to the
present and its necessities, wisely knowing that she had to drop
the curtain on what was done. Going out through the kitchen, she
surveyed the rear yard, the irregular line of fence, the sheds and
the barn. Half interested, she primed the pump. When the water came
spouting up she experienced a small feeling of encouragement. It
was such a small thing&mdash;yet so certain. Water and food,
sleeping and waking and the work of one's hands. "I have been
living beyond myself," she said and observed that the house had
been swept and that there was wood in the box beside the stove.</p>

<p>It was too hot to cook a meal, and so she made a lunch out of
cheese and bread and water. She changed into more comfortable
clothes and took up the job of unpacking. An ingrained feeling for
neatness and order nagged at the supplies piled in the middle of
the room, and she worked until her forehead was damp. Then, and
there she stopped.</p>

<p>"Why should I hurry? There isn't anything here but time." She
felt immeasurably better for having thought of it. Resting on a
trunk, she tried to visualize what she could do with the barrenness
of the house&mdash;how its unrelieved ugliness might be subdued.
The bedroom, of course, was first. Refreshed, she swept the room
thoroughly, knocked down the cobwebs, created one moderately clean
spot in an area of dustiness. She dragged in the iron bedframe,
which was part of Townsite's supplies, and put it up. She laid on
the springs and the mattress. She arranged the trunks where they
would take the place of chests and cupboards; from one of these
trunks she got her sheets and quilts and made up the bed, a piece
of a popular tune coming unbidden to her mind. It was, "There'll Be
a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight," and it reminded her of Jamie
Scarborough.</p>

<p>Out on the road a long column of men went by, headed into the
pass. Nan got the sound rather than the sight of them, engrossed as
she was with threading a wick into a new lamp. Nor could she help
considering Townsite Jackson's thoughtfulness. He had seemed to
forget nothing; had, in fact, remembered more items than she would
have remembered. And his talk had been very kindly, very shrewd,
strongly underscored with sympathy. Nan went out of the bedroom to
locate the can of coal oil&mdash;labeled by a potato in its
spout&mdash;and found Neel St. Cloud standing on the porch.
Somewhat startled, she straightened to an alert motionlessness.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said. "Should have given you more warning."</p>

<p>The low afternoon sun struck under his hat and sharpened his
smooth, smiling face, He stood there with a sort of negligent ease,
yet the slimness of his body and the taper of his shoulder points
were such as to suggest a military attitude. For one long moment of
doubt she recalled his easy, cynical manner and wondered if he
meant to use it on her. It would be natural of him to presume too
much. But she was mistaken. He took off his hat, and his yellow
head made a slight, courteous bow. He said gently: "If I might step
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you wish."</p>

<p>He walked through, stood against the wall, surveying the
quarters with a swift, estimating glance. "Had no desire to
interrupt you," he went on. "Only wished to pay my respects to you
as a new neighbor. My place is up beyond the pass&mdash;five
miles."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been told that."</p>

<p>His smile broadened. "I supposed you would. I am"&mdash;and he
paused over the wording of his sentence&mdash;"a rather established
character. Is there anything I can do to help?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I think," said Nan. Inwardly she was saying: "How like
Jamie in his surface manners."</p>

<p>He made a deprecatory gesture with one arm. "I don't want to
sound grandfatherly, Miss Avery, but if I were you I'd not worry
about things around here. To a stranger a great many ways of ours
appear odd. Maybe they are. One thing is pretty definite, though.
You can always have the help you need by asking for it. Range
people are that way."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Nan deliberately, "those people will find me
rather unsocial."</p>

<p>St. Cloud's eyes were momentarily keen and exploring. It was,
she thought, a reversion to his normal man's curiosity concerning
her. But he recovered himself quickly. "Solitude? You'll have no
trouble getting that. The valley is full of it. What I wanted to
say was that I go up and down this road three or four times a week.
Should you ever want anything from town, hail me. Please do."</p>

<p>"Thank you. There seems nothing now."</p>

<p>"There will be," St. Cloud said casually. "You'll always be out
of matches, or sugar, or nails. The stores, you know, are not just
around the corner&mdash;as they are in your town."</p>

<p>"How would you know anything about my town?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"You haven't the earmarks of this country," said St. Cloud.</p>

<p>She listened for the upswing in his voice that would convey the
question. But his politeness covered even that; he had not the air
of prying for information. He spoke in a matter-of-fact way. She
allowed the silence to settle, and St. Cloud&mdash;she thought
again that his manners were very alert&mdash;put on his hat and
moved to the door. "I can promise you," he said, "perfect peace and
shelter from my quarter, which is anything lying beyond the
notch."</p>

<p>"That," replied Nan, "is about all I ask."</p>

<p>"You will, of course, be unable to escape hearing a great deal
of gossip. You'll soon enough know all about us. My suggestion is
you strain the information through the fine screen of your own good
sense."</p>

<p>He was, she understood, asking that discount for himself. "I
have my own scale of values," she told him soberly.</p>

<p>He nodded, showing again a touch of speculation. "Some day, when
you are caught up, I might persuade you to visit my place? Smoky
Draw is almost a town. Other women are there, you understand."</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Nan.</p>

<p>He let it lie as spoken and went to his horse. Watching him to
westward in the direction Dan Bellew previously had gone, she
suddenly wondered what his inner reaction to that "possibly" had
been. Rather regretfully she wished she had not said it. The man
was obviously educated, and his kind read too many meanings into
plain speech. Dissatisfied with herself, she filled the lamp and
sought out the more immediately needed groceries. Sunset was not
far away; the valley was a-riot with a plunging, golden light.
Going out the back door to fill her brand-new water bucket, she saw
Henry Mitchell swinging up the slopes on his horse, followed by the
boy Lorrie on a bareback pony. Mitchell arrived in the yard, put a
leg over his saddle.</p>

<p>"Thought I'd drop in and see if I could help."</p>

<p>But his eyes passed through the house and around it; and she
knew he looked for Neel St. Cloud. It was apparent he had come here
out of a sense of responsibility. Remotely she thought she ought to
be grateful, yet an uncontrollable irritability grew stronger. She
had traveled three thousand miles to escape such an oppressive,
surveillance; she could stand no more of it. Her eyes went sharply
to him.</p>

<p>"Did Dan Bellew tell you to watch this house?"</p>

<p>"Why should he?" countered Mitchell.</p>

<p>"Please understand this: I am quite able to take care of myself.
All these offers of help are very kind. But I don't need help."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," said Henry Mitchell soothingly. He refused to be
offended; he was like all other men, discounting her clear desires
and clinging to the inevitable male assumption that she was a woman
and therefore to be watched, to be shielded. Nan felt anger warming
her cheeks. Nothing, it appeared, could shake a man's urge to be
protective. She meant to say something more definite, but old Henry
Mitchell spoke before her:</p>

<p>"A lot of little annoyin' things may come up. Your horse might
stray. You might have to lift somethin' heavy. Anything at all in
that line. Me or Lorrie will be on tap. Just call us. Lorrie, he's
nine and as good as a man."</p>

<p>Lorrie had flattened himself on the broad back of his pony and
was watching her with intent, lucent eyes. His face was round and
darkened by the sun. All he wore was a cotton shirt and a pair of
overalls which hung loosely to his too thin frame; and suddenly her
anger went away and left her so certain of this boy's needs.
Something very wistful and very shy lay mirrored in his wandering
glance.</p>

<p>"He don't see so much of women," said Henry Mitchell, slowly.
"Kind of interested in you. No, he don't see near enough of women."
The man's voice was softened by a slight regret. "Some things a man
ain't much good at."</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His granddad."</p>

<p>"Where is his mother?"</p>

<p>Henry Mitchell met the question with a quick blankness of
expression. "His daddy is dead."</p>

<p>The girl felt pushed away from something unfortunate. She said
softly, "I'm sorry," and walked toward Lorrie. For a moment she
thought he meant to bring his horse about and retreat; he
straightened, and one hand dug into the pony's mane.</p>

<p>"Lorrie," said Nan, "we're going to be pretty good friends,
aren't we?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Lorrie dubiously.</p>

<p>She wanted to reach up and smooth the tangled black hair, but
she knew better. "Sometime," she went on gently, "you might ride
over and show me the trails through the timber. I'd like that."</p>

<p>He was watching her very closely, and it occurred to Nan then
that his attitude of reserved and suspended judgment was the same
thing she had noticed in Dan Bellew. It seemed to be a frame of
mind men here were born with a slowness of decision that had to be
eventually sure beyond suspicion. Presently he said in a warmer
voice: "All right."</p>

<p>Nan, wondering why she should be so eager about it, smiled and
turned. Henry Mitchell's glance was abruptly grateful. "Any time,
Miss Avery, you want us two men, just call. Come on, Lorrie, and
don't sit on that horse like a squaw."</p>

<p>She watched them descend the slopes, the tall, raw-boned man and
the slender lad side by side. She said to herself. "They are great
friends, those two," and a quick recognition of the pathos there
came to her. All at once the harsh brightness of the earth
vanished, and a still twilight settled across the ridge. Pale blue
shadows filtered through the trees; the air began to take on a
brief transparency, and she saw the valley sweep away and melt into
the southern horizon. A faint breeze rose.</p>

<p>Immobile, watching the tremendous change, she thought: "It will
not be as hard to live with myself as I thought."</p>

<p>Neel St. Cloud cut due west from Nan's place, up and down the
rolling ravines. Not quite two miles onward he came into a small
flat bay of land that butted against the side of Squaw ridge.
There&mdash;at the junction of valley and high ground&mdash;set Dan
Bellew's Broken Stirrup, its face to the open south and its rear
darkened by the rising pine slope. Poplars made a pleasant circle
about the place; unseen water fell down a gentle drop and sent its
music across the dry, motionless air. Passing through the front
gateway, St. Cloud's face went smooth and noncommittal, the
sharpened cast of expression that comes to a man on unsure soil.
Dan Bellew sat in the shade of the porch, but he rose at St.
Cloud's approach and stood waiting till the latter had circled and
dismounted. St. Cloud took a seat on the steps, reached for his
tobacco. In the back angles of the place a blacksmith's hammer
suddenly ceased to ring; Bellew sat down again.</p>

<p>St. Cloud, absorbed with the making of his smoke, said, "Dry
summer," Indolently.</p>

<p>But Bellew brushed the invitation of preliminary talk aside.
Both big fists lay along the arms of his chair, his head tipped
soberly toward St. Cloud, "Neel," he said abruptly, "we might as
well get this straight. You and I are headed far the same crossing.
We stand a chance of collidin'."</p>

<p>"You've just discovered that?" asked St. Cloud, obviously
ironic.</p>

<p>"I've known it a long time."</p>

<p>"Of course you have," said St. Cloud. "You're no fool, Dan. If
you were, I wouldn't bother with you."</p>

<p>"I had to draw and kill a man last night," mused Bellew. "He
wasn't hunting me. He was after Jubilee Hawk. He had no particular
reason to bear grudge against Jubilee. He was doing a job because
he had his orders. Your orders."</p>

<p>"You sure?" drawled St. Cloud.</p>

<p>"There ain't any other answer."</p>

<p>St. Cloud shrugged his shoulders. "Let it ride like that,
then."</p>

<p>"No. I'm afraid not. You're determined to win. But you're not
too sure about it. So you figured to make it a little easier by
erasing Jubilee."</p>

<p>"If you think so, I'll not contradict."</p>

<p>"What's there in it for you?" challenged Bellew. "Supposin' you
place your men in office. What of it?"</p>

<p>"You don't see it?" queried St. Cloud. He flashed a sardonic
smile at Bellew. "You can't guess my hole card? Of course you
can't. But it is there. Make no mistake about that."</p>

<p>Bellew said evenly, definitely: "In the first place, you won't
win the election."</p>

<p>St. Cloud squared himself about. Into his deliberate stare crept
a harder, yellower flame of emotion. "Don't lay any bets on it,
Dan. I'll win. Nine days from now my sheriff will carry the
star."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>St. Cloud got up, threw his cigarette into the dust.</p>

<p>"Listen. There's too much law and order in the country. You
ought to know I've got no regard for it. You do know
it&mdash;damned well. Law and order kicked my father out of the
valley fifteen years ago, A bunch of pious hypocrites did it. Your
old man was one of the bunch that helped drive the St. Clouds back
into Smoky Draw."</p>

<p>"That's ancient history," cut in Bellew curtly. "Has nothing to
do with the present. The valley drove the St. Clouds out because it
couldn't afford to keep 'em."</p>

<p>"It has paid the St. Clouds ever since," said St. Cloud
arrogantly.</p>

<p>Bellew nodded. "The rustling has never stopped. You're a clever
man, Neel, but you'll be caught some day."</p>

<p>St. Cloud's mind was still on the fact of banishment.</p>

<p>All at once he was bitter, defiant: "Well, you've got rid of the
old man. But I'm still alive. I've lived back there in those damned
dreary hills most of my life&mdash;an outcast, by God! Your kind
has forced me to prowl that country, like same outlawed hungry wolf
skirtin' the edges of civilized territory! I've got the right to
fight back, Bellew&mdash;and that is what I'm doing! I'll win this
election, hands down!"</p>

<p>"One way or another," qualified Bellew. "Legitimately or with
the gun."</p>

<p>"I make no bones about it."</p>

<p>Bellew struck one fist heavily against the chair. But his voice
remained casual: "Two can play at that game, Neel. If you're layin'
down the challenge I'll pick it up."</p>

<p>"You've got to," answered St. Cloud abruptly. "I know who I have
to lick. It's you&mdash;no question of it. You carry the sentiment
of this valley around in your watch pocket. I don't know why, but
you do. I can cut off the people in Trail whenever I want to.
LeBoeuf's afraid of his shadow. Gunderson would rather make a
compromise than fight me. As for the nesters, they don't count.
You're the one that'll get these people organized against me, You
see I've got it figured. You're"&mdash;and St. Cloud's voice was
thin and resenting&mdash;"the fair-haired boy."</p>

<p>Bellew remained still a long while. Then he said, "All right,
Neel. I'll have to declare myself in."</p>

<p>"Don't guess wrong on that election," warned St. Cloud. "I'm
going to win it. It's been a long ambition of my life. When I
do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," prompted Bellew.</p>

<p>St. Cloud's grin was malicious and secretive; and all the
reckless, restless nature of the man appeared on his sharp face.
"No, I've said enough. But when I win, there will be a further
surprise for the valley."</p>

<p>"I'll fight fire with fire," stated Bellew. "Remember that."</p>

<p>"I guess we understand each other," was St. Cloud's even answer.
"You're the man I've got to lick. And will lick. So long, Dan."</p>

<p>He turned to his horse and in another moment swept away at a
dead gallop toward the hills. It was a signal for the curious ranch
crew. The Chinese cook appeared in the front door. Solano,
prematurely old and shriveled, walked from a hidden corner with the
intent air of having been listening. Link Medders, the foreman,
came over from the barn&mdash;youthful, but showing the soberness
of an early responsibility. He had a gray, smooth face and gave the
suggestion of unhurried competence.</p>

<p>"What did that lad want?" he asked Dan.</p>

<p>"Just explainin' himself."</p>

<p>"Not in ten minutes," objected Link Medders. "It'd take him a
month."</p>

<p>One last figure&mdash;Mike Shannon&mdash;sauntered up with a
blacksmith's hammer in his hand. Honest sweat dripped off a
currycomb mustache, and his solid Irish cheeks were red from heat.
Seldom-speaking, he only listened now.</p>

<p>"He's got something up his sleeve," muttered Bellew. "And it's
dynamite."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. RENDEZVOUS AT NAN'S</h2>

<p>LATE in the afternoon, two days following, Nan walked from the
cabin to see how her newly hung curtains looked and found Lorrie in
the yard, flattened on the back of a pony. A grave patience lined
his small face, as if he had been long waiting; nor did he say
anything now, but instead held out a package to her. Nan instantly
keyed down her sense of pleasure and accepted the gift with a like
show of casualness. The boy's shyness was as real as that of an
animal&mdash;and he had to be met without display. Opening the
wrapper, she saw a pan of warm baking-powder biscuits.</p>

<p>She said: "Thank you, Lorrie. These look mighty fine."</p>

<p>Lorrie stared at the distant horizon. "Yeah. Gramp's pretty good
at cookin'."</p>

<p>"It was very nice of him to remember me."</p>

<p>Lorrie looked at her with a false indifference. "I sort of
thought you wouldn't like it. Gramp said you might. You can cook,
can't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sure, All women can cook."</p>

<p>"But I don't believe I ever made biscuits."</p>

<p>He looked interested. "That's what Gramp thought. He told me to
tell you they only took a minute to make, and that you could have
his recipe if you wanted."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said the girl. "Like candy?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Someday when you're up this way, we'll make a batch."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lorrie. And afterwards he repeated himself
with a stronger inflection: "All right." Then: "You ought to have
some chickens for eggs, ma'm."</p>

<p>"Should, shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Think I know where I can rustle three-four," muttered Lorrie,
full of mystery. "Gramp went to town. Here's a letter&mdash;for
you."</p>

<p>He passed that to her, and when Nan's eyes fell on the bold,
familiar writing across the envelope the spell was broken. An
instant shadow, she realized, had changed her expression, and
Lorrie's keen eyes had seen it. Without another word he turned and
galloped down the road. Instantly sorry, she watched him go; and
thinking that she must be more careful and more patient, she went
into the house and opened the letter. The past had caught up with
her, to erase the small feeling of security the last few days had
brought. And James Scarborough's note was an exact image of
himself, fair yet insistent:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">This comes to you through your lawyer. I don't
know where you're hiding, and he won't tell. Nan, I don't deserve
this. Lucy got her divorce from me yesterday, and so that miserable
chapter is over. I wanted to make it up with you, now you've put
yourself beyond reaching. If this is your way of clearing up a bad
mess, I can't agree. I've got to make some sort of amend to you. It
is not a matter of pride, Nan. It simply is that I will not stand
by and let you fight the rest of your battle alone. I've got to
come and see you...I think you're somewhere in the West. The reason
I do is because I remember telling you one time about the isolation
of Montana. I believe that's where you'd run. If you don't write,
I'll never stop looking.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Jamie</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>She let the note trail between her fingers, trying to force that
old recurring misery out of her being. But it was not to be willed
away, not to be set aside at bidding. The power of the past was
very cruel. Why had she thought to run away from something that
followed and probably would continue to follow her through her
whole life? There was no surgery, she thought dully, that could
separate anyone from the effects of a mistake. It was like a burn
that would not heal. It was like cancer. Jamie's figure was quite
clear before her&mdash;deprecatory, deceptively slight, full of
gentleness and courage. Far better if he had been an outright
villain; then her anger could have destroyed him utterly.</p>

<p>She was thinking: "In just three days I did find a little
forgetfulness. It is here. But each letter that comes from home
will ruin whatever gain I make. I've got to stop it." And in that
desperately resolute mood she got out her stationery.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Jamie</span>:<br>

<p class="letter">This is the best way. You couldn't help me. If
you were here, what would you say or what could you do? I don't
want to see you again, and I don't want to hear from you again.
If you think anything of me at all&mdash;let me alone! I am
writing to the lawyer&mdash;telling him to forward no more
letters.</p>


<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Nan</span></p>

<br>

<p>She placed the note in an envelope addressed to Jamie and
inserted that in another envelope directed to Thomas B. Devlin,
Baltimore. To Devlin she wrote:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I'm sorry, but I want no more news from the
East. Turn back every letter that comes to you.</p>

<br>

<p>It left her very tired, ridden by the old depression.</p>

<p>Going to the porch, she watched the sun flame like fire behind
Squaw ridge and gutter out. The pale purple of twilight came again,
the soft beauty of another prairie twilight filtered in. Even now
the stars showed faintly in the sky; before long the wailing of the
coyotes would run down the breeze. All this she had come to expect,
to wait for. It wasn't hard to believe she could be a part of this
timelessness, this mighty enveloping rhythm of nature. She could
submerge herself in it&mdash;if left alone.</p>

<p>So thinking, she went about her chores. She watered the pony,
led him to the barn, saw that he had grain. She lighted the lamps.
She kindled a fire and got her supper. After the dishes were put
away she set to work on another pair of curtains. Sometime after
nightfall a rider came clattering across the road. A woman's voice
said, impatiently: "Whoa, you highstrung little idiot!" Looking
through the open doorway, Nan found the dark-cheeked girl of
Trail&mdash;Helen Garcia&mdash;standing there.</p>

<p>"Visitors welcome?" asked Helen. Nan saw the mark of disturbance
in the girl's expressive eyes.</p>

<p>Earlier that day Helen Garcia left Trail and rode straight west
to the lower tip of Squaw ridge, ten miles distant, and at about
seven descended into the Broken Stirrup back yard. Old Mike Shannon
was posted like a guard in the shadows. Alert to that; she
asked:</p>

<p>"Has it come to this, Mike?"</p>

<p>"If it's Dan you want, he's out, but he'll be back. G'wan in and
git some supper afore Chan throws it away."</p>

<p>Helen nodded absent-mindedly, went around to the front. Crossing
from porch to living room, she casually lighted a lamp and for a
little while roamed restlessly about, tidying up the room with a
kind of proprietorship. Afterwards she went out to the kitchen
where Chan was clearing up the supper dishes, helped herself to
what she could find, and ate with a hungry gusto. Then she heard
Dan returning and went immediately back to the front part of the
house to meet him, drawling "Hullo, neighbor" in the chestiest tone
she could summon.</p>

<p>Dan grinned down at her. "Hullo, Buffalo Bill."</p>

<p>She wore a corduroy split skirt, and an old jersey that hung
loosely from her small shoulders. One hand kept flicking a beaded
quirt against her trim boots.</p>

<p>"I'm getting mighty tired of eating Broken Stirrup hash and
browned potatoes," she complained. "It's all the Chinaman
knows."</p>

<p>"Applyin' for the job?"</p>

<p>Helen laughed. "Be careful," she warned. "I don't need much
encouragement."</p>

<p>He rocked gently on his heels, the broad mouth half compressed.
In here the shadows put a somber stain across his cheeks. Helen's
laughter went away. "Dan, you're running into something. You know
it, don't you?"</p>

<p>"What's worrying you?" parried Dan.</p>

<p>"Crossing the prairie last night I ran into a party coming down
from the pass, Looked like it was going past LeBoeuf's and across
the county line. Who else would it be but St. Cloud, Dan?"</p>

<p>"Out on a prowl," reflected Dan.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know,"</p>

<p>But Helen remained dissatisfied. "Look here. In the last couple
days five strange men get off the train and disappear from Trail. I
guess I can smell a sharpshooter as far away as anybody, That's
what they are. And they just vanish from Trail."</p>

<p>He said, gently: "I'm glad to know that, Helen. There's not much
doubt St. Cloud is recruiting."</p>

<p>"What for?" she repeated.</p>

<p>But he only shook his head, The girl was of a sudden foreboding,
"Dan, have you had a definite falling out with St. Cloud?"</p>

<p>He stared. "You're clever, Helen. Nothing gets by you."</p>

<p>"Then you have," she said forlornly. "Dan, that man won't
hesitate a minute to strike you in the back!"</p>

<p>He stopped her with a sudden motion. "What were you doing on the
prairie last night?"</p>

<p>Helen went on the defensive. "Looking around."</p>

<p>"You're a good soldier," was Dan's quiet answer. "But I don't
want you in this."</p>

<p>"How will you stop me?"</p>

<p>"By just asking."</p>

<p>Helen shook her head. "No, Dan. I won't sit by and watch you get
hurt. I'm not built that way."</p>

<p>He said, amused:</p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to hire you."</p>

<p>"You have."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>But she was at once elusive and gay. She tapped his chest with
the end of the quirt. "Quit worrying about me. I'm too much like an
Indian ever to be caught on the trail. Do you expect me to stay in
town behind a counter all my life?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Dan. "You belong on top of a horse, going
hell-bent somewhere. You won't ever wither and fade in a ladylike
style."</p>

<p>"Unless it be from a broken heart," said Helen tentatively.</p>

<p>"Which reminds me. I heard there was some man in your mind."</p>

<p>The girl's head snapped abruptly upward. Alarm rushed into her
eyes. "Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Jubilee. Who's the man?"</p>

<p>"He was fooling you," breathed Helen. "I'll break his neck when
I see him!"</p>

<p>"That's the girl."</p>

<p>Helen walked restlessly across the floor. She asked: "Seen that
Eastern girl lately, Dan?"</p>

<p>"No, I doubt if she likes us very well."</p>

<p>She came back. "She's pretty, Dan."</p>

<p>"All of that."</p>

<p>Helen looked aside. "Well, I've got to be going."</p>

<p>"I don't want you ramming around the dark so much. Remember
that."</p>

<p>She was on her horse and away like a whirlwind, passing the
stolid Shannon with a quick-dropped "Good-night, Mike!" The words
were automatic, for her mind was on the slight change that had come
to Dan Bellew's face with the mention of Nan Avery's name. Dimly,
distantly she saw her own heart's desire fading; and the cloud of
it was across her eyes when she arrived at Nan's and paused there
in the doorway.</p>

<p>Nan rose immediately. "You are always welcome. Come in,
please."</p>

<p>Helen walked through the doorway and relaxed in the extra chair.
Her glance went around the place with frank curiosity. "You know
how to fix things up," she observed. "Tanner left it like a
pigpen."</p>

<p>"Have you eaten?"</p>

<p>A glinting smile came into Helen Garcia's black eyes. "You're
learning our habits. Yes, thanks, I have."</p>

<p>Nan took up the hemming of some curtain material, feeling the
direct impact of the other's survey. "She's wondering about me,
wondering what I am," thought Nan and then heard Helen Garcia's
lazy question:</p>

<p>"Don't you get lonely?"</p>

<p>"I haven't had time yet."</p>

<p>"It is none of my business," reflected Helen. "But I don't see
your idea in picking this particular country."</p>

<p>Nan laid down her work. "Perhaps," she said quietly, "it was a
case of last resort."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to think so."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Nan, surprised.</p>

<p>Helen made an eloquent gesture with her two hands.</p>

<p>"It would be so sad. You were meant for nice things. You wear
clothes like you were born in them. Really you do. You've lived
among educated people, gone to dances and fine parties. Probably
never had to shake sand out of your things or scrub the dust off
your neck five times a day. You're used to so many things we do
without. There's so little here, actually, that you've been
accustomed to. I just can't see."</p>

<p>"Don't you like the country?"</p>

<p>"But that's a lot different. I started life in poorer
circumstances than you'd ever dream about. Whatever I manage to get
is so much more than I had before that I'm plain happy for my luck.
Nobody can be very sad over the things they never have had."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Nan, quietly, "the things I left behind are not
very important."</p>

<p>Helen frowned. "If I was taken away from here, away from my
friends and my riding, I'd be lost."</p>

<p>Nan found she had no answer to make. Helen's voice was quick and
concerned:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I never do have much luck minding my own
business."</p>

<p>Nan smiled faintly. "Don't feel too bad about me, my dear. All
of us have some fight to make." She slipped deliberately away from
the subject. "It's a long way from town. Where will you stay
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I often go on the tramp like this. It's a relief. I'm apt
to camp where dark finds me, at Gunderson's or LeBoeuf's or at
Broken Stirrup. I drift into Broken Stirrup so frequently that Dan
keeps a room cleaned out for me."</p>

<p>"Dan Bellew?" asked Nan, curious.</p>

<p>"He's the salt of the earth," said Helen Garcia.</p>

<p>It had the sound of being loyally, defiantly dragged in. Nan
made no reply.</p>

<p>"You've got him wrong," stated Helen. "When you're here longer
you'll see that."</p>

<p>"Does it matter?" was Nan's casual rejoinder.</p>

<p>"To a great many people it does. What you saw in Trail the other
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;I'd rather not think about that."</p>

<p>"You won't be able to avoid it," said Helen. "That wasn't an
isolated affair. It meant something. It was the beginning of
something. You're not in a very safe place&mdash;did you know?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Helen's dark head inclined to the north. "Those hills&mdash;"
she began, then straightened, looking through to the back door. Nan
felt sudden fear go through her. A man stood there listening. But
Helen said calmly:</p>

<p>"Come on in, Pete. I've been waiting here half an hour."</p>

<p>He came forward with a show of reluctance, uneasily watching
Nan. He was, Nan thought, not very strong and not very old. His
chest was thin, his face pinched. He did then a curious
thing&mdash;he backed into a corner and stood erect against it.</p>

<p>"This is my brother, Pete Garcia," said Helen. "Pete, don't
skulk!"</p>

<p>"There'll be a bunch comin' down the road in a little while,"
said Pete. "Well, I'm here. What was it you wanted to see me
about?"</p>

<p>"You've got to back out of this," said Helen.</p>

<p>Pete's face went hard and stubborn. "I didn't come here to be
preached at, sis. Quit it."</p>

<p>"Pete&mdash;you've got to come out of those hills and stay
out."</p>

<p>"If that's all you got to say, I'm gone," retorted the man.</p>

<p>Astonished, Nan suddenly caught on. These two had arranged for a
rendezvous in her house without her knowledge or consent. She felt,
in fact, temporarily dispossessed. Both were for the moment
oblivious of her presence. Helen had risen, the lithe young body
rigid. Nan broke in, suppressing a too obvious resentment.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you find it necessary to stage this quarrel in
front of me. I'll go out and leave you alone."</p>

<p>Helen raised an arresting hand. "Don't," she said. "There's
nothing you shouldn't hear."</p>

<p>"You sure?" asked Pete Garcia, embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Everybody in the country understands you've turned crooked,"
said his sister bitterly. "Miss Avery might as well know."</p>

<p>"I've heard enough," growled Pete Garcia, "Risked my neck coming
here in the first place. I can't be visiting folks any more, Helen.
I'd be suspected. I'd be considered a tale bearer."</p>

<p>"You've developed a set of morals all of a sudden," said
Helen.</p>

<p>"It's my skin I'm takin' care of."</p>

<p>"You've got to get out of this mess, Pete. There's going to be a
fight. You'll be on St. Cloud's side, against all the people you
know. Pete, you can't do that! Haven't you thought about it?"</p>

<p>"Made my choice," said the man, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"You didn't make any choice," said Helen, flaming up. "You took
the easiest way! Why, you darn fool, you'll be hurting the only man
that ever troubled to help you! You'll be riding against Dan
Bellew! Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"They've all treated me like a bum in this valley," muttered
Pete. "Why should I worry about 'em? St. Cloud's all right."</p>

<p>"That's all you've got to say?" demanded Helen.</p>

<p>The man looked at his sister, and for a moment his eyes showed a
hunted, harried expression. Then stubbornness settled at his lip
corners. Helen cried out desperately:</p>

<p>"All right. If you're too ungrateful to consider Dan, then
consider me! What are you doing to me, Pete? Don't you see? Here I
am&mdash;sister of a crook&mdash;sister of a St. Cloud rider! How
can I face Dan Bellew? What will he think of me?"</p>

<p>"He won't change," was Pete's dogged reply. "Everybody knows you
ain't like me. I got nothing against Dan. I wouldn't lift a finger
against him. But as for the others, they can go to hell. That's
final."</p>

<p>"I won't let you do it!" said Helen. Roused like that, Nan
thought critically, she was nearly beautiful. And somehow very
admirable. "Go on, Pete."</p>

<p>The man looked anxiously at Nan. "I'd rather not have you say
anything about this," he said. Without waiting for an answer, he
left as he had come, soundlessly through the back doorway. Helen
turned, tired and defeated.</p>

<p>"You think a great deal of Dan Bellew, don't you?" It was
something Nan hadn't meant to speak of.</p>

<p>Helen said a slow, disinterested, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Why did you ask your brother to meet you here?"</p>

<p>"It was the easiest place."</p>

<p>Nan asked coolly: "And perhaps you wanted me to hear something
of Mr. St. Cloud's character?"</p>

<p>"You've heard it. It is only what everyone knows."</p>

<p>But Nan was critical.</p>

<p>"I can do my own judging in my own good time," she told Helen.
"I suppose I should thank you for trying to enlighten me. But I
won't."</p>

<p>Helen went as far as the porch and paused. "You don't deserve
what will come to you." she murmured.</p>

<p>"What will that be?"</p>

<p>Helen shrugged her shoulders and passed on. A little later Nan
heard the girl's horse pound recklessly down the grade toward
Trail.</p>

<p>Pete went back to his horse which had been posted in the timber
and rode a circle through the higher hills. He hit the road
somewhere beyond the pass and about twenty minutes later came
against a series of stray shadows motionless in the night. At once
a voice, brisk and dry, challenged him&mdash;the voice of St. Cloud
whom he feared. St. Cloud said:</p>

<p>"Garcia?"</p>

<p>"I rode across the narrow end of the valley," grunted Pete. "And
saw nothing that looked like trouble."</p>

<p>"No evidence of other riders out?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>St. Cloud was silent for a long moment. Then his curt order
struck, into the waiting quiet: "All right, boys. Come ahead." The
line of shadows rippled across the lighter grayness of the road.
Pete fell in behind and so followed the party through the notch and
into the flat of the valley. Once, looking to his right, he saw the
Broken Stirrup lights cutting yellow holes through the black.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. RIDERS BY NIGHT</h2>

<p>MECHANICAL as the chore was, Nan could not keep her mind to the
sewing. This long day had come to an unsettling climax with the
visit of Helen and Pete Garcia, and that scene remained vividly in
her mind. It was of course none of her business, yet she could not
escape the feeling of being involved; something of the
oppressiveness that had weighed on her spirits the night of the
Trail shooting returned now to disturb her profoundly. The truth,
she thought soberly; seemed to be that nobody could remain neutral
in this country. People's affairs here were peculiarly interwoven.
One could not stand alone, even so desiring. The quarrel of the
Garcias, for instance, had its beginnings and its endings in the
lives of many others.</p>

<p>She rose, walked to the porch. The stars were very dim in a
velvet sky. A soft wind ran freely from the west, the barking of
Henry Mitchell's hound arrived in softly diminished currents of
sound to accent the loneliness of this still night. Helen Garcia
obviously had been fighting for Dan Bellew, fighting for his safety
and for his good opinion&mdash;and thus here was another situation
that entangled him. Thinking about it, Nan was remotely surprised
at recollecting how many stray circumstances had revolved around
the man. Around him and around Neel St. Cloud. These two seemed
magnetic poles on which the current of the land slowly and surely
fixed itself.</p>

<p>The loneliness was absolute. She never had felt it so keenly
before. Her own troubles lay darkling in her mind; and beyond those
was some new, strange emotion she could not define. Bellew's
strongly outlined face was very distinct before her, and she could
not help wondering what his attitude was toward this Helen, so
obviously, so wistfully in love with him. Not quite realizing why,
Nan made an abrupt decision. Putting on hat and jacket, she went
out to saddle the pony. Afterwards she rode westward in the
direction of Broken Stirrup.</p>

<p>She had the letter to the lawyer in her pocket for mailing, and
that was an excuse. But below the excuse was a prompting so unlike
her that she would not logically examine it. More or less aloud,
she said: "Why should I ride to him? I must not do it again." Over
a roll of land she saw Bellew's ranch lights, warm and heartening;
and for a moment she paused, on the edge of turning back. What
checked the impulse was a gruff query:</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Nan Avery," she answered, half startled.</p>

<p>The man advanced, stood beside her; a match made a sudden
crimson nest in his cupped hands. Her question was no less sharp
than his own: "And who are you?"</p>

<p>The light died. "Just Mike Shannon," said the man. "Go right
ahead."</p>

<p>She went on, perplexed at the little mystery his silently
stationed body made there. Passing down an alley of trees, she came
against the house's long porch and there dismounted. An open
doorway beckoned.</p>

<p>"I wondered," Bellew's voice said, "if you'd ever ride my
way."</p>

<p>He was in a black corner of the porch. He had been quietly
sitting there, but he rose now and walked forward. Her own voice
was coolly collected.</p>

<p>"Why should you waste your time wondering about me, Mr.
Bellew?"</p>

<p>He was faintly smiling. "Afraid it's one of those things I'm not
going to be able to avoid doing. Step inside."</p>

<p>Going in, she had another of her curiosities satisfied.</p>

<p>It was a big room, typically a man's living quarters. A few worn
pieces of furniture were scattered about. One comfortable rocker
faced a fireplace above which hung a photographed picture of
cattle. A rack of rifles inconsistently kept company with a
bookcase near by. Bellew pushed the rocker around for her, moved
over where he could watch her.</p>

<p>"I had a letter I wanted mailed," she said. "Will you be going
to town this week?"</p>

<p>"Mike goes in tomorrow."</p>

<p>"The one I met out yonder?"</p>

<p>"Give you a start?" asked Bellew, showing concern.</p>

<p>"No-o." She lifted the letter from her pocket and placed it on
the near-by table, wondering why she had come. The letter became a
flimsier and flimsier pretext. Slightly irritated she let the
silence remain at his disposal.</p>

<p>He said: "Getting along all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not too much to yourself?"</p>

<p>The calm, shrewd insight put her instantly on the defensive. "Is
that something else you've wondered about?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Bellew.</p>

<p>"Don't," Nan told him curtly.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to be inquisitive," said Bellew patiently.
"Rather not have you think it."</p>

<p>"No, you're trying to be kind, and I can get along without
kindness."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Don't believe I understand. You're two steps ahead
of me. And we're scrapping again."</p>

<p>Of course he didn't understand. But she understood him. His was
a man's mind, always seeking to reduce uncertainty to tangible
shape. They were a thousand miles apart. Once, too, she had
demanded an orderliness in her reasoning as well as in her life.
But there was nothing much left now, no logic, only a despair born
of her hurts. She would not again trust, not again share. The small
sense of relief at being here vanished utterly, and she felt once
more that rising antagonism she could not stave off. A quick, clear
thought came to warn her that it would probably always be so
between them. Another man she might ignore, but Bellew's insistent
strength threatened that inner isolation she meant forever to
defend.</p>

<p>He said very gravely: "And what could you be thinking about to
look so lost?"</p>

<p>She got up. "I'll run along."</p>

<p>"Did you come straight from your place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Meet anybody outside of Mike? Or hear anything?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Anybody ride through your neighborhood today?"</p>

<p>She watched him. "Helen Garcia dropped in for a moment."
Instinctively she avoided any mention of Pete. "But you probably
knew about that."</p>

<p>"How would I?"</p>

<p>"She was here, wasn't she?"</p>

<p>Bellew spoke in the manner of making his explanation
unmistakably clear: "She's often here. I think a great deal of her.
So does every other person in the valley." He followed her to the
porch, calling: "Solano."</p>

<p>A fatigued, disinterested voice answered; Solano's small bent
figure came into view. It was, she recognized, the man who had met
Bellew at the train.</p>

<p>"Take a little trip toward the south," said Bellew and walked
around the house. She was in the saddle when he came back with his
horse. "I'll ride along with you," he explained.</p>

<p>"That isn't necessary."</p>

<p>But for once he caught her thought. "You'll be under no
obligation to me," he said a little dryly. "I make this scout every
night."</p>

<p>Silence fell like a wall between them for a half-mile or better.
Nan thought of Lorrie. "Tell me," she asked "where is Lorrie's
mother?"</p>

<p>She thought his answer was a long time in coming. And it was
reserved: "Same as dead."</p>

<p>It piqued the girl. "You people believe in keeping your
secrets."</p>

<p>"As you desire to keep yours," said Dan: They were then
descending into a coulee. Dan's horse wheeled. Dan reached swiftly
over and caught Nan's reins, drawing her to a halt. Nan stiffened,
and Bellew murmured sharply, "Keep still."</p>

<p>The report of fast traveling was on them at once, swelling up to
a rapid rushing of hoofs along the bottom of the coulee. Riders
went by, making ragged silhouettes no more than a hundred feet
ahead, and a man's metallic voice struck up the slope. "Turn a
little left&mdash;keep closed up." After that the party swept away
southward.</p>

<p>Bellew's arm dropped. They went on down the incline into a risen
dust and up the yonder side.</p>

<p>"Who were they?"</p>

<p>"Just a bunch of riders in the dark."</p>

<p>But she realized it to be only a half-truth. "He knows," she
thought, "but the code is not to tell." There was no more talk
until they rounded in front of her house. Nan saw his face by the
lamplight; it had become more angular.</p>

<p>"A week from today," he said, "there's an election in town.
Usually always a dance at the same time, over Townsite's store.
Would you go with me?"</p>

<p>"You and I," Nan answered, "only succeed in being unpleasant to
each other. Why should we go on with it? Thank you&mdash;but
no."</p>

<p>He nodded, and wheeled away.</p>

<p>Their meetings, it appeared, would always end with this
abruptness. Stabling the pony, she walked through the back
doorway.</p>

<p>At once she noticed change. On the front-room table was a long
silk shawl.</p>

<p>Beside it lay a note:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Sorry I missed you. I had hoped for a pleasant
chat. You've no idea how much of a change that is for a lonely man.
Please do not misunderstand this gift. The evenings up here can be
very cold&mdash;and the shawl has been idle in my trunks for ten
years. It belonged to my mother. If the idea of a gift is not to
your liking, consider it a loan. Looking forward to another day, I
am most humbly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Neel St. Cloud</span></p>

<br>

<p>Lifting the shawl&mdash;it was richly, gorgeously
Spanish&mdash;she experienced a quick touch of fear. "I've got to
get this back to him," she said and laid the shawl aside with plain
distaste.</p>

<p>Solano left Broken stirrup at a slow lope, the small, rachitic
body loosely bent in the saddle. Two miles due south he crossed a
casual arroyo and there halted long enough to dismount and study
the ground by furtive matchlight. What he saw drew out only a
murmured grunt; but thereafter he made a right-angled turn and
proceeded at a faster gait. It brought him presently to a solitary
cottonwood and here again he repeated his surreptitious survey.
This time he aimed westward as rapidly as the pony would carry
him.</p>

<p>A quarter-hour later the looming bulk of Squaw ridge dropped its
footslopes dead to fore. Solano wheeled into timber and went up a
sightless trail.</p>

<p>Neither yet nor for another good twenty minutes was there any
obvious purpose in the circuitous wandering. But Solano knew his
destination, and when he stopped again he had made a four-mile
detour into the ridge and had come out on the valley floor at a
point where a rock monolith sat slightly removed from the main
course of the high ground. Here he loitered, smoking one cigarette
after another, until the muffled pacing of a pony drifted up.
Solano dropped his smoke, backed against the monolith.</p>

<p>The rider sent out a subdued call:</p>

<p>"Hello, there."</p>

<p>"Yeah," droned Solano.</p>

<p>"It's the second time in the hour I've circled this rock," said
the other severely. "Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't get away," replied Solano. "Finally Bellew sent me out
to have a look."</p>

<p>"What for? He suspect I might be riding tonight?".</p>

<p>"Dunno. He never said. Just told me to have a look."</p>

<p>"You've stuck pretty close to him the last few days?"</p>

<p>"In earshot most of the time."</p>

<p>"Learn anything?"</p>

<p>"Him and Hawk and Townsite had a long palaver at Trail three
days ago. I got most of that&mdash;but it was nothing you don't
know, St. Cloud. Dan's been around the ranch mostly since. Tonight
that Avery girl came to see him."</p>

<p>St. Cloud said interestedly: "So? I'm glad to know that. What
else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>St. Cloud seemed dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"You've got to brighten up your eyes, Solano. He won't sit idle.
He'll hit back. I've got to know how&mdash;before he does any
hitting. That is your job."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Solano. "But listen. For God's sake don't let
anybody discover this arrangement between us. If Broken Stirrup
catches on, I'm dead."</p>

<p>"You're safe."</p>

<p>"Keep it to yourself. Don't tell Clubfoot or Gasteen&mdash;and
don't tell Garcia."</p>

<p>"Think Garcia would squawk on you?"</p>

<p>"He's got a sister, ain't he? She's fond of Bellew, ain't
she?"</p>

<p>"I wonder," said St. Cloud and turned back into the farther
prairie. Solano waited a few moments, then aimed straight for
Broken Stirrup.</p>

<p>Perhaps ten minutes later a long-shadowed body dropped down from
the rough summit of the monolith and stood where Solano had
been.</p>

<p>"Thought so," said this one in a kind of surprised breath. "All
these recent tracks around here meant something. Knew damn well
they did. Six nights of waitin' ain't gone for nothin'. Sorry
business to run into treachery&mdash;and if I go tell Dan now he'll
run Solano clean over the Rockies." The tall form stood still. "No,
I better keep it to myself a little while longer. Give Solano rope
and he'll hang himself: Tell Dan later. That's the ticket."</p>

<p>Having decided it, the man found his horse, and cantered
east.</p>

<p>Fifty minutes later Henry Mitchell arrived home.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. THE SCALES TIP</h2>

<p>LORRIE halted at the intersection of the two high trails and
bent downward from the back of his pony. Watching him
sympathetically&mdash;in the elapsed week she had gotten behind his
barrier of shyness&mdash;Nan thought the youthful face could on
occasion be very shrewd, very mature. Yet it was somehow saddening
to see him so grave, to see him rushing so rapidly through boyhood.
Lorrie looked up, a sparkle in his eyes. "Somebody's been along
here this morning."</p>

<p>"How would you know?"</p>

<p>He made an explanatory gesture with his hands. "If these tracks
had been here overnight the dampness would of smoothed 'em a
little."</p>

<p>"Lorrie, where did you learn all this?"</p>

<p>He looked obliquely at her, as if afraid of skepticism.</p>

<p>"Gramp&mdash;he used to be scout with the cavalry. He tracked
renegade parties." And a little while later he added with a false
impartiality, "He's pretty good."</p>

<p>From this high point Nan looked across descending pine spires to
a valley rolling away beneath the nooning brightness. Her own house
stood visible two miles westward. In all other directions the
timber shut off the horizons. Lorrie's meandering explorations had
led them this far and here appeared to have an ending. Pointing
north, Nan said: "What lies over there, Lorrie?"</p>

<p>"Just a lot of canyons and trees."</p>

<p>"Shall we ride that way?"</p>

<p>He was at once reluctant and troubled. "It's an overgrown
trail."</p>

<p>"Some other time, then," she suggested.</p>

<p>"That's Smoky Draw country," he said hesitantly.</p>

<p>"What about it, Lorrie?"</p>

<p>He had odd reticences; Henry Mitchell, she thought, had taught
him that little-speaking habit. Presently Lorrie added a casual
afterthought: "If I was you I don't believe I'd ever ride beyond
this point. That ain't a good place yonder."</p>

<p>"We'd better turn toward home."</p>

<p>Single file, they passed down the trail and within a mile
arrived at the lower and more open part of the ridge. Two riders
went hastily southward on the valley road, ripping up the yellow
dust; and from this little elevation Nan saw Bellew's cattle widely
scattered across the upper end of the flats. Mitchell's house and
her own were gray squares against a chrome-and-tawny soil. The
summer's heat remained a constant thing, the sky was brilliantly
and flawlessly blue. She had the feeling that beneath the still
brightness of the day the earth slowly swelled.</p>

<p>"Where do you go to school, Lorrie?"</p>

<p>"There ain't any outside of Trail. I went there one year, a long
time ago."</p>

<p>It required a light touch. This lad answered better to
suggestion than to direct advice. "That's too bad. Other boys will
get ahead of you." They came across the rear of her place and found
Henry Mitchell waiting on the shady side of the barn. She could see
he had been slightly worried. Wondering why, she explained: "Lorrie
showed me the hills this morning."</p>

<p>"Nobody knows the country any better than him," said Mitchell
and moved away, pretending an interest elsewhere.</p>

<p>"If you'll stay awhile," said Nan, "I'll get something to
eat."</p>

<p>"That's nice, but we've got to go home."</p>

<p>She had seen Mitchell only once during the week. Looking at him
now, it came to her that he showed increasingly his age. The long
lined face was gaunter than she recalled; as he walked to his horse
she observed the distinct stoop of his ordinarily Indian-straight
body. In the saddle, he looked down, speaking for her ears alone:
"You notice the boy's wearin' his shoes? It's somethin' I never
could make him do. That's your influence, Miss Avery. He thinks a
great deal of you."</p>

<p>"I want him to."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad," said Henry Mitchell gently. "I want him to
amount to somethin'. He can be&mdash;he's got the makin's of a
fine, upstanding man. Same as his father would of been if he'd
lived."</p>

<p>"He's always welcome here, Mr. Mitchell. I like to have him
around."</p>

<p>"He'll come. As I said, he likes you. You know how to handle
him. One thing about the boy&mdash;he'll go through fire to keep
the good opinion of those he's fond of. If you get his trust you've
got it till the end of the world." Mitchell looked across the yard:
"It's taken a load off my mind. I won't be here
forever&mdash;things happen sudden in this country. I'd always
figured Bellew would take him if I went. He thinks Bellew is
absolutely right. But there's some things a woman does
best&mdash;and raisin' kids is one of them."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be worrying about yourself."</p>

<p>Mitchell's shrug was somehow fatalistic. "I'd like to be around
when Lorrie's twenty-one, just to see how much he resembles his
dad. But that's askin' too much. My life has been full of chances.
I've been mighty lucky&mdash;but there's always a last time to
everything."</p>

<p>He wheeled abruptly away. Riding beside Lorrie, he said
affectionately: "You sit like a squaw&mdash;straighten up."</p>

<p>Lorrie grinned; and then they went down the slope together, two
straight figures against the harsh light.</p>

<p>Presently she went in and got a cold lunch. Afterwards there was
nothing to do, and so she took a chair to the shady side of the
house and sat there, purposeless and reflective. The work of
establishing herself had brought with it a distinct happiness, but
that was done, and the leisure she dreaded so much lay ahead.
Looking down at her supple hands, she realized her trouble. "I was
never made to be a spectator. Never. I've got to be doing things.
Not to be useful would destroy me."</p>

<p>Bellew, she suddenly reflected, had known this about her; and
suddenly she wondered why, in the seven intervening days, she had
neither seen him nor heard of him. Utterly impatient with herself,
she got up.</p>

<p>"Why should he come? Haven't I refused all his offers? Nan
Avery, you fool, find something to believe in, and stick to
it!"</p>

<p>The echoes of a team ran up the road irregularly. Going about
the house, Nan watched two fine blacks whip a light buckboard
across the rutted yard and halt. Mrs. Townsite Jackson said, "Hello
there, lady," and dropped to the ground. She explored the place
with a glance that was bright as a magpie's.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "you've had ten days of this&mdash;and how
does it suit you?"</p>

<p>"No complaints," answered Nan. "I suppose you know this house
pretty well."</p>

<p>"I've lived in many like it," said Mrs. Townsite and sat
momentarily on the edge of the porch. "You can't trail around with
a man such as Jackson for forty years and not find yourself in some
odd places. He's dragged me to every corner of creation. I've heard
coyotes howl and Indians whooping it up. I've seen murder and
grief&mdash;and things you'd scarcely believe." She drew in a sharp
breath. "It's been sort of interesting."</p>

<p>"I like your husband."</p>

<p>"He's the best man I know," said Mrs. Townsite soberly.</p>

<p>"Come inside."</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsite rose and went through the door. Her black eyes
absorbed the details instantly, approvingly, "This shack never
looked like this before. You know how to fix things up,
sister."</p>

<p>"The trouble is," said Nan, "it's all done. What is there
left?"</p>

<p>"I know. You're like me&mdash;always running out of work. Not
the kind to fold your hands in silence."</p>

<p>"Well, what else is there for me to do?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsite went off on an apparent tangent. "How old are you,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-three."</p>

<p>"That's your trouble."</p>

<p>Nan showed her curiosity. Mrs. Townsite went blandly on: "I'm
not exactly a believer in the unqualified blessedness of
matrimony&mdash;I've seen too much misery and scandal. But there
isn't any other institution that will take you away from yourself
any quicker."</p>

<p>"That," was Nan's quiet reply, "isn't the answer."</p>

<p>"It will do," retorted Mrs. Townsite, "till women find a better
one. You should have married five years ago."</p>

<p>"At eighteen? I couldn't possibly have known any real thoughts
toward any man."</p>

<p>"No, and you won't at twenty-eight or forty-eight or
sixty-eight. That's the chance you take. What of it? You don't
seriously expect to be either right or happy more than half the
time, do you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>The older woman shook her head, sadly shrewd.</p>

<p>"Young people all have the idea life owes us something. It
doesn't owe us anything. What we get we pay for and work
for&mdash;and never are very sure then of getting it. Happiness
comes when we find we've made or won something we didn't have too
much right to expect. I don't like all this fa-la about happiness,
anyway. Nobody goes anywhere by sitting on the fence wishing. It's
like Jackson says, nothing tastes good unless you've sweat for
it."</p>

<p>"Pride?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," said Nan, slowly, "that it is enough."</p>

<p>"Why not? If we start from nothing, we ought to be proud of
whatever we earn. But, lands, why carry on like this? I came out
thinking you might like to drive into Trail and put up with us
tonight. It's election day. Townsite always gives a dance over the
store."</p>

<p>Nan had not realized then how anxious she was to get away from
the ridge for a few hours. The quickness of her reply surprised
her. "Yes&mdash;wait till I lock up."</p>

<p>"Don't change that pretty dress," warned Mrs. Townsite. "But
bring along breeches and boots&mdash;you may have to come back on
horse."</p>

<p>Nan went out, watered the horse and stabled him. She bolted the
rear door, rolled her riding outfit into a bundle, caught up a hat
and coat, and followed Mrs. Townsite to the rig. Mrs. Townsite sent
the rig rapidly down the slope. At Mitchell's house the girl waved
at Lorrie; then the road swung around a toe of the ridge and
straightened into the length of the valley. Far to the southwest
she saw the dust wake of a fast-traveling party. Mrs. Townsite
spoke:</p>

<p>"Sister, your business is your business. I think you're in
trouble and decided to run. Bless you, I hope you lick it. But
speaking out of considerable experience with the two-legged
creatures hereabouts, let me warn you. Don't dilly-dally with our
men. You can't treat them like your laddies back East. It would
seem like flirting. If they think you've made a contract, they'll
see you go through with it. . . . Ain't it a pretty day?"</p>

<p>"What have you heard about me?" challenged Nan, annoyed.</p>

<p>"St. Cloud's been to your place."</p>

<p>Nan's answer was faintly ironic. "The man you have all made into
the devil's image?"</p>

<p>"So we have," said Mrs. Townsite imperturbably. "We may be right
about that, or we may be wrong. We'll soon enough know."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Nan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsite shook her head. She had ceased to smile.</p>

<p>In those seven days Bellew made searches that revealed nothing.
Each night Solano reported no sight of the St. Cloud riders. Mike
Shannon camped on the lip of Smoky Draw pass and only once
witnessed the passage of men&mdash;an inbound party of four.
Apparently St. Cloud was idle. Link Medders, scouting the very
edges of st. Cloud's ranch, found the place crowded with
riders.</p>

<p>"He's been gathering every friend he could find for the
election."</p>

<p>"Why should he gather them up there?" argued Dan. "He doesn't
need to ride herd on his voters. They've got their orders. That
isn't the answer, Link."</p>

<p>"Then he's hiring new hands from outside."</p>

<p>"Yes; but they couldn't vote. What's he hiring 'em for?"</p>

<p>Two mornings before the election, Helen Garcia swept off the
prairie on the dead run and provocatively rounded Dan in his yard.
She said, in her chestiest tone, "Hullo, pardner," and looked down
with a gay, flushed face. "Where you going, so important?"</p>

<p>"Top of the pool."</p>

<p>"Right with you, mister."</p>

<p>She vaulted boyishly to the ground and fell in step, impatiently
whipping off her hat. The Broken Stirrup back yard went two hundred
feet forward to the rubbled edges of the ridge which curved
semicircularly around the ranch. Out of a small gorge of this ridge
ran a thin stream of water; beside the miniature gorge a rugged
trail rose at a forty-five-degree angle. Helen scrambled across the
rocks and said, "Whoa, Dan, I'm no goat. Gimme your paw."</p>

<p>Dan drawled: "Papa carry baby?"</p>

<p>"Baby scratch," retorted Helen and took hold of Dan's coat. Thus
towed, she came hilariously behind him. It was a stiff climb, but
brief. Four hundred yards onward the ridge leveled temporarily, and
the curving fissure made a wide abyss before them. Eighty feet
below lay the still, unsunned surface of dammed water. The drop was
sheer. At the bottom, below a falls created by the pool's overflow,
Mike Shannon worked with a pick.</p>

<p>"Still fooling around with this water?" inquired Helen. "What's
the idea?"</p>

<p>"Some home-made engineering," explained Dan. "We're building a
diversion tunnel and ditch. Afterwards I'm putting in a real dam.
Irrigation, my lamb, is the thing."</p>

<p>"Don't call me that," Helen said impatiently. "Can't you get it
through your head I'm a grown woman?"</p>

<p>Dan grinned. "Even if you are, what's wrong with the name?"</p>

<p>She looked into the chasm, sent a rock spinning through space.
"It's&mdash;it's kind of complicating, mister. But never mind. I
ran into something last night."</p>

<p>"I told you to quit riding after dark," said Bellew
unfavorably.</p>

<p>"I happened to be a couple miles over east of Trail, riding by
the tracks. You know where the trestle crosses that draw? Well,
there was a bunch of men camped in it. I got down and crawled along
the trestle and counted ten of them. Saw them by their fire and
didn't recognize a one. I'd guess they rode up from the south. That
draw is part of the old cattle trail, you know."</p>

<p>He accepted the information silently, thoughtfully, and walked
down the slope, Helen tagging behind. In the yard she said:</p>

<p>"I'm going to get hold of Pete and pump him, He knows what St.
Cloud is up to."</p>

<p>"No. If St. Cloud ever thinks Pete is carrying tales, he'll
slaughter the boy."</p>

<p>Helen's dark eyes were suddenly not far from tears. "Pete's put
his hand against you, and still you try to protect him. Dan, you're
awful damn kind!" She stepped into the saddle. "Listen to me. Don't
come to the election without your men. And don't get drawn into a
fight." She was away before he could answer, her little figure soon
dimmed by the distance.</p>

<p>That evening Dan sent a call down the valley, and the next
night, which was the Friday eve of election day, the five men he
had summoned met in his house. Two, Jubilee Hawk and Henry
Mitchell, were valuable for the personal examples they set. The
third, old Townsite Jackson, commanded a following because of his
unique position as first citizen. But it was to Tom Gunderson and
to Simon LeBoeuf that Dan looked for voting power. He told them
so.</p>

<p>"Lumped together, you fellows have about forty-five hands. It is
absolutely essential you get every last one of your men into Trail
tomorrow for voting. It will be very, very close."</p>

<p>Gunderson, a spare and active man to whom everything was
definitely white or definitely black, said: "He won't win, Dan. If
he does we'll run him out."</p>

<p>"He might not run," grunted Simon LeBoeuf, a great and awkward
figure, as unkempt as the worst of his riders. "I'd be willing to
bet he'll run a blazer of some kind on us. That's the St. Cloud
habit."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Dan. "That's what we've got to watch for."</p>

<p>Townsite said: "If he does win, boys, this country will run red.
I'm telling you."</p>

<p>"He warned Mitchell to quit riding around Smoky Draw," mused
Dan. "He's got something up there he doesn't want us to see."</p>

<p>"Maybe," suggested Mitchell, "he means to swamp the town
tomorrow with his men. Forcibly prevent people from votin'."</p>

<p>They sat deeply silent awhile. Jubilee finally spoke. "The first
jug-head to try that at the polls will get pounded."</p>

<p>"Careful," warned Dan. "It may be what St. Cloud wants you to
do."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, nevertheless."</p>

<p>"We've got to keep away from an open fight," said Dan, looking
at both Gunderson and LeBoeuf. "When you get your men voted, pull
them out of town. Here's another thing: Put your riders on the
trail tonight to remind the homesteaders about coming in. I guess
that's all."</p>

<p>The meeting broke up. But LeBoeuf, mounted and ready to go, had
a last sober word: "You don't carry help enough on this place, Dan.
If St. Cloud means to get anybody, it'll be you. That's been plain
to the whole valley for some time. I'll be in Trail by tomorrow
late afternoon." Then the group went cantering away.</p>

<p>The next day Dan carried on with the work around the pool until
about two, then left Chan in charge of the ranch and headed for
town with the others. Three miles into the prairie, he, remembered
having left one thing undone. "I clean forgot about those two
Mormon families up in the middle of Squaw ridge. Solano, you strike
off there now. We'll meet you in town." So, with Medders and Mike
Shannon, he reached Trail around four.</p>

<p>It was worse than he expected. The town was jammed. Men he had
not seen for months cruised the walks; groups of them collected in
the four corners of the square. Almost solid lines pressed
restlessly in and out of the Golden Bull, and he was quick to note
that the drinking had been heavy. The crowd spirit was electric;
after eight o'clock, he reflected, when the counting began, Trail
would be in effect a powder magazine at the mercy of any careless
incendiary.</p>

<p>His first chore was to stable his horse; then he led Medders and
Shannon straight to the courthouse to vote, finding Jubilee and
half a dozen others guarding the place; St. Cloud, it was evident,
also had his watchers on the ground. When he finished voting he
plowed his way back to the street and waited for Medders and
Shannon.</p>

<p>"You'd better rustle home," he told them. "Chan's all
alone."</p>

<p>But Link and Mike Shannon had obviously been talking it over.
Link's answer was definite: "Not now, Dan. This town ain't safe for
you. You're crazy if you think so. We'll just trot behind."</p>

<p>Dan shrugged and turned into the milling tide, at once
confronting Nan, Mrs. Townsite, and Helen. All three were hooked
arm in arm. Nan seemed freer and gayer than he had ever observed.
The crowd spirit, he thought to himself, had taken her away from
herself. Mrs. Townsite, too, appeared pleased with the hectic
atmosphere; but Helen was unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Bellew," said Mrs. Townsite, "do you smell powder?"</p>

<p>"You like to be right in the middle of a crush, don't you?"
drawled Bellew.</p>

<p>"Can't change my habits," sighed Mrs. Townsite. "I love to see
things move."</p>

<p>Helen said, soberly: "Will you be at the dance, Dan?"</p>

<p>He nodded, going past them, wondering at that last oblique
glance Nan Avery had thrown at him. There was a sudden jam in the
middle of the street as Gunderson's riders filed off the prairie. A
man straightened from the wall of the Golden Bull and cheered the
sight of them; and another man reached over and clapped his hand
across that one's face&mdash;the act of a thoughtful head. Dan
elbowed his way into Townsite's store. Townsite came over for a
hurried word.</p>

<p>"Figure this out. Part of St. Cloud's crew came in early, voted
and went out. The rest of that gang ain't showed yet. Neither's St.
Cloud himself. Where's LeBoeuf?"</p>

<p>"He'll be along."</p>

<p>"Come to the house for dinner. We've got the Avery girl."</p>

<p>Dan shook his head and left, mind centered on St. Cloud. There
was nothing he could do, Dan reflected irritably, but wait; turning
up the hotel steps, he found a chair and sat down. At five-thirty
Gunderson found him there.</p>

<p>"Where's LeBoeuf?"</p>

<p>"Late as usual. You better get your crew out of this place. It's
dynamite."</p>

<p>Gunderson said, "Not till LeBoeuf shows up," and instantly was
absorbed in the restless mass. Sometime beyond six Dan went in to
eat a tasteless meal; passing out later, he saw Neel St. Cloud
enter at the head of his column. Profoundly worried about LeBoeuf,
Dan looked at his watch. It was then seven, and the guitars and
fiddles were tuning up in Townsite's dance hall. Link Medders came
beside him; he sharply challenged his foreman.</p>

<p>"Have you located Solano?"</p>

<p>"Not here yet."</p>

<p>"LeBoeuf's got just an hour," muttered Dan. "That's cutting it
too fine."</p>

<p>Nan stood in a corner of the hall with a party that included
Helen, Mrs. Townsite, and some other women to whom she had been
recently introduced. Rows of bracket lamps flooded yellow light
down on the weaving couples; the rhythm of the music went on and
on, suiting the temper of these boisterous people who seemed never
to get tired. It turned insufferably hot, the confusion increased.
Townsite stood in the middle of the floor, frankly sweating, and
called the turns of a square dance; one man ducked in and around
the crowd, scattering wax. Babies wailed along one wall where a
double set of benches had been arranged for them; there was an
endless levee in front of the punch bowls. She had, she thought,
never seen anything so uproarious, so hilarious. Yet she could not
escape certain contrary signs. Detached as she was, the sense of
suspended judgment grew very strong in her; and she noticed men,
one moment openly amused, turn toward the stairs with an instant
soberness. Townsite strolled over, his chore completed, and stood a
moment with his wife. Their talk was brief and worried.</p>

<p>"Any news?"</p>

<p>"LeBoeuf didn't get here."</p>

<p>"Lands!"</p>

<p>Dan Bellew came in during the intermission, pausing to search
the walls; and she observed, with an acute interest, that his
appearance was enough to dampen the strong tone in the hall.
Townsite cut quickly over, and the two of them stood momentarily
near her. The sense of generous humor which she knew Dan to possess
was altogether gone; and his eyes, once touching her, passed by
without recognition. Helen stepped from the wall, caught his
sleeve, and said something that he answered with the smallest of
smiles; then the music began, and the two revolved away. She was a
little surprised that he danced rather well; somehow it hadn't
fitted into her picture of him. A moment later they were in the
center of the room. Helen had her face lifted toward the man. Both
of them were extraordinarily grave.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he know," thought Nan, unaccountably irritated, "that
the girl loves him?"</p>

<p>Something happened. The music stopped on a rising
tone&mdash;stopped raggedly. A man walked hurriedly into the hall,
a young, red-headed man. He saw Bellew, went over with a hand oddly
lifted outward. And as softly as he spoke, his words carried
clearly through the hush.</p>

<p>He said: "St. Cloud's got it, Dan."</p>

<p>She didn't know why it should be so, but a sharp sensation of
fear went knifing through her. Mrs. Townsite's "Oh, Lord!" was
heartfelt. Nan, strangely stirred, watched Bellew. Whatever his
faults, she quietly thought, he had the one supreme stark quality
of strength. It flowed out from him at this moment as a tangible
thing to draw and to comfort the dispirited, uncertain crowd. It
gave him an unquestioned leadership&mdash;every last soul in the
hall was now watching him. She wondered if it were not a visual
trick, until she discovered that she too had pinned her faith on
him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. TERROR</h2>

<p>POSTED there in the center of a hall gone dead still, Dan Bellew
felt Helen's two hands rigidly gripping his arm; and looking
briefly down, he saw she was close to tears. But it was Jubilee
Hawk that demanded his whole attention at the moment, for Jubilee's
temper strained against the hard muscles of his face, and a gusty
emotion ripped wickedly across the gray-green eyes. When the
redhead spoke again, it was with a singsong flatness:</p>

<p>"I'd hate to think LeBoeuf sold us out."</p>

<p>Dan said impassively: "What's done is done."</p>

<p>"Nothing's done. Something tough has started. It may be you, it
may be me, or it may be St. Cloud&mdash;but somebody's apt not to
get out of this town tonight."</p>

<p>"Don't lose your head now. We'll take our licking and we'll like
it&mdash;this time."</p>

<p>"Easy to say," muttered Jubilee.</p>

<p>Townsite and Gunderson quickly crossed the hall. Old Henry
Mitchell walked up the stairs and joined the circle. For a moment
nobody said anything. The roof had fallen in, and they were still
struggling out of the wreckage. Helen murmured a word Dan didn't
catch and slipped away. Dan put his two fists in his pockets,
stared at the others. "We'll take our licking and like
it&mdash;this time. Now we're going to get out of Trail before
trouble starts. Some stray fool might start shooting. No election
is worth a widow. Gunderson, you round up your men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It ain't so simple," said Gunderson. He jerked his head upward.
"Listen to that."</p>

<p>All the hall windows were open, and the deepening voice of the
crowd came in. There was a resounding smash out there, like the
collision of vehicles; a half-frenzied phrase javelined through the
turmoil. It woke angry answers, dangerously immediate answers. On
the far edge of Trail a gun began exploding.</p>

<p>"Somebody ought to kill that fool," muttered Dan.</p>

<p>"Somebody prob'ly will," retorted Jubilee, "Well, what are we
going to do?"</p>

<p>Henry Mitchell looked to the landing of the stairway and said,
very quietly, "Now we'll have some news." Solano limped slowly
across the floor, his thin body gone slack. He returned the united
scrutiny with a flitting briefness, placed his lackluster eyes on
Bellew. "He couldn't come," he said. "He ran into trouble."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I went to tell the Mormons. A mile south of them I saw a lot of
LeBoeuf's cattle milling off west of the ridge. Looked like a steal
to me, so I ran for LeBoeuf's and told him. He went out on the run
with the whole crew. I waited till six. Heard some firing. Then I
came on here."</p>

<p>His dismal voice trailed into silence; he looked dispiritedly
around the room. Dan made a motion of acquiescence at the group.
"There's St. Cloud's trump. He dragged LeBoeuf away
deliberately."</p>

<p>Henry Mitchell stared at Solano. "How was it you come so
properly onto this rustlin' business? You couldn't see anything
from the Mormon places."</p>

<p>"I went to the skyline trail from there."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Solano's eyes met Mitchell's and slid aside. "Always a habit of
mine to scout. That's what Dan pays me for."</p>

<p>Dan interfered, frowning at Mitchell. "Solano's my rider. I'd
trust him to the limit. Don't get the other idea in your head,
Henry. This was St. Cloud's trick. He timed it just right."</p>

<p>The sounding of the gun on the edge of town stirred Jubilee. He
repeated his question: "What are we going to do now?"</p>

<p>"St. Cloud's won the county," decided Dan. "Let him run it.
We'll find Gasteen, Jubilee, so you can hand over your star."</p>

<p>"Hand it?" grunted Jubilee. "I'll throw it in his face."</p>

<p>"Careful. We'll start nothing tonight. Not in this crowd. You're
coming home with me. Gunderson, you've got to snake your men out of
Trail."</p>

<p>Townsite made an empty gesture. "There is not one of us," he
said simply, "who can count on tomorrow. It is going to be just
hell. I'm not a scary animal, as you boys well know. But I make
this guess, and I make it because I know what happens to a country
when it becomes an outlaw strip: One or more of us will be dead
before the month is out."</p>

<p>Dan's answer was very soft: "We can fight back, Townsite."</p>

<p>"I propose to. When you want me, you know where to send for
me."</p>

<p>"More news," drawled Henry Mitchell.</p>

<p>It was St. Cloud. He came across the floor with a careless
stride, the yellow head thrown back and a high flush of high
pleasure on his mobile face. The sharp grin included them all and
dismissed them all, save Bellew. On Bellew his attention centered
fully.</p>

<p>"I told you," he said, amused, "I'd win this election."</p>

<p>Bellew's cheeks were shadowed and set. "By a trick."</p>

<p>St. Cloud showed a quick mockery. "Part of the game. I don't
deny it."</p>

<p>"I told you before that two can play at trickery."</p>

<p>"Within the law, I hope," said St. Cloud. "Don't put yourself
outside the law, Dan. There's a new sheriff."</p>

<p>Bellew let his answer drag into the profound stillness; and the
tenor of it was definite and final and unchangeable: "I want this
understood: I am going to smash you."</p>

<p>St. Cloud's cheeks went slimmer, sharper. The lurking malice
faded before a swift blaze of anger. He said nothing more but made
a slight, stiff bow and walked on to that end of the hall where Nan
Avery stood. Looking there for an instant, Bellew saw the man
smiling again, turned to the perfect cavalier; then Bellew wheeled
and went down the stairs to the street, the others trooping
thoughtfully behind, him.</p>

<p>Solano lagged behind, more obviously limping. As the others
walked into the street, Henry Mitchell abruptly pivoted, barred
Solano's way. In the semidarkness of the stairway he bulked hugely
over the little Broken Stirrup hand. "Solano," he said, "I let you
have too much rope."</p>

<p>Solano stiffened, placed one hand against the wall. "What's the
matter with you, Henry?"</p>

<p>Mitchell's big fist clenched. "You godblasted runt, you sold
your saddle! I ought to've settled the balance the other night at
Rooster Rock when you met St. Cloud. But I let you have too much
rope. I don't understand a yellow-bellied lizard like you, and hope
I never may. You're through on Broken Stirrup, Solano. You know
that, don't you?"</p>

<p>Solano stood motionless, the wind springing violently in and out
of his chest. That hand supporting him on the wall began slowly to
slip downward. His eyes went luminous with fear.</p>

<p>"You know it, don't you?" roared Henry Mitchell.</p>

<p>"If you say so," said the little man, sullenly,</p>

<p>"Shannon or Medders would tear you apart. Dan's too easy, All
he'll do is send you over the hill. But he wouldn't believe what I
told him, and anyhow I wasn't born to squeal. You're going to tell
him yourself tonight and fade out of here fast. Understand?"</p>

<p>"All right," muttered Solano. "I'll do it."</p>

<p>"You bet you will. I'm riding to Broken Stirrup in the morning.
If I find you there I'll drag you over Squaw ridge at the end of a
rope."</p>

<p>The edges of a suddenly compressed crowd spilled into the stair
doorway. A long yelling rose and died, and some sort of an uneasy
quiet took hold of those on the street. Henry Mitchell was
instantly restless, worried for his party out yonder. Closely
eyeing Solano, he saw another surreptitious drop of the little
man's arm. "All right&mdash;if you want it here," he muttered.</p>

<p>"No!" yelled Solano.</p>

<p>"Then get out ahead of me!"</p>

<p>Solano sidled around him, beat a hurried passage through the
packed ranks. More and more alarmed, Henry Mitchell elbowed his way
across the walk and out into the street. Down by the Golden Bull
was a pool of light, and right there seemed to be the trouble.
Somebody talked in rapid, arrogant phrases&mdash;Gasteen, he
thought, as he butted the impeding onlookers aside. Breaking into
the cleared, bright area, he at once knew the worst of the night
waited here for a too sharp word or a too sudden gesture. Gasteen's
raw hillbilly frame towered up in the yellow radiance, placed
against a solid row of St. Cloud hands. He had the sheriff's star
newly pinned to his vest, and his long lantern jaw thrust itself
obstinately toward Bellew, confronting him. Jubilee and Gunderson
were near by, and the two Broken Stirrup men; and over to one side,
suggestively massed, were all the Gunderson hands and the
additional Bellew sympathizers. The line of cleavage was definitely
drawn. Old Henry Mitchell had seen too much violence in his
lifetime not to feel the slow, cumulative advance of it now. Coolly
deliberate, he took his stand near Bellew.</p>

<p>"You are not tellin' me what to do," challenged Ruel Gasteen.
"Your days of authority are clean over. You'll pull no more
wires."</p>

<p>Bellew said: "You've got your star, Gasteen. But I want this
understood: Stay off Broken Stirrup ground. I never fed or
sheltered a St. Cloud rider, and I'm not beginning now."</p>

<p>Gasteen's gleaming eyes were red-shot, full of fury. "I told you
the night you killed Tom Addis I'd not forget it. I ain't. I want
your gun, Bellew."</p>

<p>"You're making an arrest?" grunted Bellew.</p>

<p>"I said I would."</p>

<p>Bellew's answer was smooth, frigid. "Your mistake. You are not
making this arrest, Gasteen."</p>

<p>"Don't try to slide out of it," warned Gasteen. "I'm not
bluffing. You know it. I do what I say I'll do. Pass over the gun
and come on to the lock-up."</p>

<p>Bellew's black head tipped forward; all his features were dark
and bitter-drawn. "We might as well get it decided now. You're
making the issue, not me. My answer is I'm not a football for the
Smoky Draw crowd to kick around. Your pants belong to St. Cloud. He
bought you a long time ago, and he's set you up in this job to be a
monkey on a stick. There never will be a time when I surrender to
you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of your reputation," said Gasteen implacably.
"I'm willing to make the try. And I'm askin' for that gun. It is
the last time I ask."</p>

<p>"No," said Bellew. The sound swelled into the utter silence.</p>

<p>Nan saw all this from a second-story front window of the hall.
The scene was directly below her, so near that she felt drawn into
it. Those two tall men faced each other, and their talk, deliberate
and barren as it issued from them, was freighted with an incredible
bitterness, a burning hostility. The words lashed like whips,
struck like blows&mdash;each one leaving an indelible mark on her
memory, each one pushing nearer to that climax even she could
foresee. The tension of the crowd increased; it reached up and
caught her in its insufferable grip, to produce a feeling of half
suffocation. When Bellew's "No" struck out, she involuntarily
stiffened, expecting a consequent explosion. In that moment all the
faces revealed by the saloon lights registered one uniform
emotion&mdash;a strained, blurred savagery. Gasteen's ungainly body
poised slightly forward at an angle; he had gone motionless. As for
Bellew, she had not seen him stir all through the parley. His will
seemed literally to beat against the new sheriff.</p>

<p>It could not last&mdash;it did not last. But the change was
unexpected. She heard a dry voice calling forward: "Just a minute
there." And then there was a swaying of bodies as the yellow-headed
St. Cloud made his way to the circle. It was as if he poured a
quick stream of water on fire. One hand waved Gasteen back.</p>

<p>"That's enough," he told the new sheriff. "You ought to know
better than to start a fight in this crowd."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of him," muttered Gasteen. "I want him to know
that."</p>

<p>"You've made your demonstration," rapped out St. Cloud. "Now
drift."</p>

<p>Bellew said emotionlessly: "So the tail of the dog wagged too
soon?"</p>

<p>"The metaphor is unfortunate, Bellew," answered St. Cloud, "but
we'll take that up later."</p>

<p>There was another long moment of deadlock. Then Bellew's black
head nodded, and he turned away, and the crowd, released from the
tension, began a slow milling. Nan swung from the window, tired and
restless. For the first time she observed that Mrs. Townsite and
Helen had been all this time watching through the same window.
Helen's face was white.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go on home tonight," Nan told Mrs. Townsite.</p>

<p>Mrs. Townsite's mind was elsewhere. "You can get a horse," she
said absent-mindedly, "at the stable."</p>

<p>Nan went down the stairs and back to the living quarters of the
Jacksons, behind the store. She changed into her riding clothes and
returned to the stairway hall, instantly bumping into Bellew, who
was apparently coming back to the dance. The sultry anger flickered
on his face. He spoke rather sharply: "The street's no place for
you until this crowd scatters."</p>

<p>"I'm going home. Where is the stable?"</p>

<p>"Ready now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He nodded to her, opened a way for her across the square. A
little short of the stable, deep in the confusion of the collecting
Gunderson party, they met Mike Shannon with three ponies in tow.
"Miss Avery will use yours," Dan told Shannon. "You rustle
another."</p>

<p>"Really, I'd rather hire my horse and ride home alone."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, that's not possible."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, not willing to make a point of it,
and accepted his hand-up. He stepped to his own saddle, escorted
her to the head of the restless Gunderson column; and a little
while later she was sweeping out of Trail. Henry Mitchell rode
directly behind her, Medders and Shannon were abreast. A little to
the fore, Bellew and Gunderson talked in a brief let-down fashion.
Among the others was a heavy silence; all the desert lay dark and
vague, and the stars were very frosty. Short of the halfway point
the Gunderson party faded off to the right at a full gallop; at
Mitchell's house the old man dropped out of the line with a sober
"So long, everybody." Medders and Shannon wheeled into a coulee
westward&mdash;and so Nan arrived at her own front yard, feeling
Dan Bellew's simmering temper like an actual heat. What she had
been thinking all along the road came out of her candidly:</p>

<p>"I'm glad for one thing&mdash;I'm glad the quarrel ended short
of bloodshed."</p>

<p>"A postponement," said Bellew indifferently.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you very well," Nan reflected. "In the hall
you ordered your men to avoid a fight. I liked you for it. On the
street, among all those people, you seemed willing to have one. Why
did you change?"</p>

<p>"Because the situation had changed," Bellew said briefly.</p>

<p>But the little devils of logic sat in judgment again,
criticizing him, condemning him. "Save for St. Cloud's intervention
there would have been a fight, probably a terrible fight."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You were willing to assume the responsibility of men being
killed. You were not willing for others to do so. Tell
me&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>He sat silent a moment, and she felt rather than saw his
friendless glance. "The difference," he said, "lies in the men
involved. The challenge was there. I had to meet it."</p>

<p>"But what harm could there be in an arrest&mdash;if you are sure
of your ground?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't," explained Bellew, "an arrest. It was a
challenge."</p>

<p>"Oh. Other men may act humble, to avoid the spilling of blood.
But humbleness is not for you. It amounts to that, then?"</p>

<p>They were coldly and civilly quarreling again. They were hurting
each other. She saw the rim of his hat rise, his shoulders
straighten. "I don't suppose I could make it clear to you," he
stated. "Probably not worth trying."</p>

<p>"Probably not. It seems quite queer, though, that the man you
all consider a conscienceless outlaw should be the one to quiet an
extremely dangerous situation. He, apparently, thought more deeply
of the possible widows than you did."</p>

<p>"Let it stand like that," said he laconically,</p>

<p>But she was suddenly, hotly angered. "No, I can't let it stand
like that! I am disappointed in you! I thought I knew you
better&mdash;and I thought I liked you better! It doesn't seem very
broad of you to rebel against a sheriff and risk a horrible scene,
just because you dislike him and are too proud to admit his
authority. You set yourself up to be law-abiding. Your acts make a
hypocrite of you."</p>

<p>He said nothing for so long a while that she slipped from her
saddle and handed over the reins of the horse. Bellew accepted
them; then spoke for himself:</p>

<p>"You don't get the angle of sagebrush politics. The transfer of
that sheriff's star means something more than you think it does. If
you want the thing plainly stated, it makes Gasteen's kind lawful
people. It makes an outlaw of me. Tonight I had to do one of two
things: either submit or announce the fact I was willing to be an
outlaw."</p>

<p>"You speak of Gasteen, but you mean St. Cloud. Why not say
so?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to talk about people in front of their friends,"
said Bellew and abruptly swung off with the led horse.</p>

<p>"I'm not necessarily&mdash;"</p>

<p>But it was no use talking at so much blank night. He had planted
his shot and gone, leaving her directly hit. Badly stung, she
clenched her fist and walked half blindly into the house, at once
knowing she could not let the rebuke stand. It was utterly unfair,
utterly untrue. "No man," she told herself bitterly, "has the right
to presume I've admitted St. Cloud to friendship! Dan Bellew shall
not presume it!" In the morning, she decided, she would ride
directly to Broken Stirrup and fight it out.</p>

<p>In spite of the evening's turmoil she fell almost instantly
asleep. Thus the sound of the single shot which later broke flatly
across the area came to her like the disturbing fragment of a
dream. It did not wake her. What did wake her, somewhat after that,
was a pounding on the house door and Lorrie's half-choked call.
"Miss Nan&mdash;Miss Nan!"</p>

<p>She sprang out of bed instantly, an odd premonition striking
through her, and hurriedly put on a robe. When she unbolted and
opened the door, the boy threw himself in, and his fists beat
against her body with an unconscious rage. His small frame was
racked by emotion, ripped by violent muscular spasms. The breath
strangled in his throat, and his cheeks were hot as fire. But it
wasn't fear, she knew. It was shock, it was outrage, it was
grief.</p>

<p>"They got Gramp!" he cried wildly. "They got him!"</p>

<p>"Lorrie!"</p>

<p>"They got him!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;my dear, dear boy! Who?"</p>

<p>But he had stopped speaking, and she felt the stiffening of his
body even as he clung to her for comfort. He would never, she
realized, answer that question; Henry Mitchell had taught him to be
a man. Tightly holding him, sharing the cruel pain of his tragedy,
she thought: "He is my boy to care for now."</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. THE WEAVING NET</h2>

<p>FRIDAY following the election, in the middle of another
blaze-hot afternoon, Nan walked around the house and found St.
Cloud waiting by the porch. He had come very quietly and was still
in the saddle. At sight of her he lifted his hat, smiling.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said, "it was a proper time to take up your
promise."</p>

<p>"What promise?"</p>

<p>His cheerfulness was disarming, a little apologetic.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm presuming too much. It's orily half an hour's ride
over to Smoky Draw&mdash;and I'm proud enough of my place to want
you to see it."</p>

<p>A sense of uneasy surprise passed through her, and she thought
instantly of Mrs. Townsite's warning. It was as she had suspected.
St. Cloud had read too much into her word, which had been without
encouragement.</p>

<p>"I think my exact answer to your invitation," she said,
determined to put him in his place, "was that I might possibly
come. Does that sound like a promise, Mr. St. Cloud?"</p>

<p>"To a lonely man&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you take too much for granted."</p>

<p>He further surprised her with the shrewdness of his
understanding. "You're drawing a line for me to see. You want it
quite plain between us&mdash;isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"I like you better for it," was his frank answer. "I won't
trespass, and I won't give the valley any grounds for gossip."</p>

<p>Nan was a little curt with her reply: "I am not worrying about
the thoughts of other people. What I do is none of their business.
I am quite old enough to make my own decisions. The point is, I
don't want you at any time to twist my words into something more
than they mean."</p>

<p>He watched attentively, deep interest framed in his eyes. "I
see. Then what was the meaning of that 'possibly'?"</p>

<p>"That was common politeness," said Nan. "It is clear to me now I
should have been blunter. Politeness out here seems to be a sign of
weakness."</p>

<p>Unexpectedly his smile returned. "You know, you're a very
positive woman. You've stopped me in my tracks. I admit the error
humbly, Now suppose we start all over, and suppose I make the
invitation again?"</p>

<p>He was, she realized, very clever. For while he accepted her
rebuff, he also accepted her stated independence of the valley's
gossip. It was in effect a challenge of her sincerity. She had made
the mistake again of asserting her freedom of thought too
forcefully and now could not afford to cheapen her declaration with
a refusal. But, even as she understood it, her silent resolve to go
with him was influenced by another consideration equally
independent. She was very curious about Neel St. Cloud. Not quite
trusting him, she had no sound basis for such distrust. It was
another point of pride that she wanted better evidence than the
hostile opinion of the valley people. Deep in her mind she
recognized, too, the influence of her resentment toward Dan
Bellew.</p>

<p>"It's only a little way up and a little way back," prompted St.
Cloud.</p>

<p>"All right. Wait until I write a note for Lorrie."</p>

<p>His brows went up. "You're keeping the boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Splendid thing for you to do," he said. "I'll saddle your pony
meanwhile."</p>

<p>She wrote the note and left it on the kitchen table, telling
Lorrie where she was going and when she would be back. Catching up
a hat, she went out and waited for St. Cloud to bring her pony
around. Afterwards they rode briskly into the throat of the
pass.</p>

<p>The note to Lorrie was unnecessary. Crouched behind a tilted
slab rock near the road, the boy saw them go, his bright black eyes
full of fury.</p>

<p>There was a padded echo as the small dynamite charge blew a
cloud of gravel and fine dust across the Broken Stirrup yard. Dan
and Jubilee and the rest of the crew came slowly out of shelter,
returning to the sloping edge of the ridge. The fumes settled
gently away from a newly created mouth of the diversion tunnel;
Mike Shannon lifted his shovel and started clearing aside the
blasted rubble.</p>

<p>"That's all," said Dan. "Day after tomorrow we'll go up the
canyon and blow out the plug in this tunnel. The pool ought to
drain overnight. Then we've got a good month ahead of us building
up the dam. I'm going to Trail and see if they've set those stock
cars out on the siding."</p>

<p>"Therefore," said Jubilee, "so am I."</p>

<p>The two swung out of Broken Stirrup at a casual gait.</p>

<p>Dan Bellew aimed a little east of the true course of Trail, but
after an indecisive half-mile he straightened back. Jubilee's
slanting lids compressed a little.</p>

<p>"Not going over to the girl's place?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That boy ought to be living on Broken Stirrup, Dan."</p>

<p>"He needs gentling. It was a fine thing for her to take him,
Jubilee."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but if Mrs. Wills ever gets her hands on
Lorrie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If she does I'll step in. Meanwhile, the less said about it the
better. Neither Lorrie nor the girl knows about Mrs. Wills."</p>

<p>Jubilee scowled against the slashing sunlight. "Nothing ever
comes out right in this confounded world."</p>

<p>They detoured through a scattered bunch of Broken Stirrup stock
and went cantering on down the valley with a long ribbon of dust
behind them. Gunderson's distant window panes, struck by the sun,
sent brilliant lances of light across the fiats. All the adjacent
folds of Buck ridge were alternately tawny and black. It was a dry
world, a motionless world waiting for the reviving coolness of
night. Bellew stared straight to the fore, features thoughtfully
engrossed; Jubilee was never still, but kept his glance turning
from one quarter to another, as if seeking some fact he could not
find yet knew to be present in this cloudless day. About three
o'clock the road dipped into the gentle draw and entered Trail.</p>

<p>They split here, Jubilee hauling up before the Golden Bull and
Dan going on to the railroad station. His stay there was brief and
concerned itself only with the livestock cars standing down the
siding; afterwards he went to Townsite's store.</p>

<p>"I don't seem to see Gasteen."</p>

<p>"He ain't been in Trail twice since last Saturday," grunted
Townsite. "Where you suppose a good St. Cloud hand would make his
headquarters? Up in Smoky Draw, naturally."</p>

<p>Dan sat on a nail keg and curled himself a smoke, brooding over
the chore. "Too quiet these days. You'd think this country was
dead. I wonder if St. Cloud's trying to put me asleep."</p>

<p>"Your next move is plain to me," stated Townsite. "I think
you're being damn careless runnin' that ranch with four men.
Fourteen would be more like it."</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" asked Bellew.</p>

<p>"This filtering in of hard mugs never seems to stop. They drop
off the trains and they pop up from every sagebrush."</p>

<p>"Sure. It's a safe country now for a crook. News like that
spreads fast." Bellew pushed his square shoulders upright. The
hazel surface of his eyes showed a concentrating attention. "Now I
wonder if such was St. Cloud's purpose in winning this election?
Easy way to get himself a following, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"A couple boxes labeled 'Machinery' was delivered to Major
Cleary other day," muttered Townsite. "But if I don't know the
shape of a case of rifles I'm a fool. Rifles for St. Cloud, of
course. It may interest you to know St. Cloud's been writing
letters to a couple of towns down the trail. First to Logan Gap.
Second one to Anna Creek. He got replies both times. See? Whoever
he is writing to is on the way north. Letters indicate it."</p>

<p>"Too bad," drawled Dan, "a postmaster can't open letters."</p>

<p>"This postmaster would," said Townsite soberly, "if it'd do any
good. Only St. Cloud wouldn't be careless enough to say anything
plain to the curious eye. Who's moving north&mdash;and what
for?"</p>

<p>"We'll know pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get more men on Broken Stirrup?"</p>

<p>"I'd just as soon have him think I was day-dreaming," mused
Bellew. "As it stands, I'm no safer with an army than with what
I've got. I'll do my recruiting when I know what I'm up
against."</p>

<p>Townsite's gesture was one of disagreement. He walked to the
closed-in corner that represented Trail's post office, found a
letter and brought it back. "Read this."</p>

<p>Dan smoothed the paper, studied the writing on it through the
trailing smoke of his cigarette:</p>
<br>

<p class="typewriter">POSTMASTER, TRAIL CITY, MONTANA:</span></p>

<p class="typewriter">
In the course of settling legal affairs this office is looking for
a Nan Avery, formerly of Baltimore, now thought to be in the West.
Do you know of her whereabouts? It so, please write and oblige.</p>

<p class="typewriter">James T. Scarborough</p>

<br>

<p>Townsite said suddenly: "Sounds like a form which he's probably
sent all over the country. I've figured a long time she was runnin'
away from something. Ain't my place to guess what, but it must be
important or this man wouldn't be queryin' postmasters."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Not allowed to give out information like that," said Townsite.
But he added afterwards: "What should I do? What would you do?"</p>

<p>Bellew got up, walked aimlessly around the room, cheeks drawn
solid. "Her life is her own, Townsite. It is none of our business
what she does with it."</p>

<p>"Ain't it?"</p>

<p>Dan flung up his head, touched by the older man's tone of slight
doubt. Townsite went on: "I'm not blind, my boy. You've made her
business your business already to the extent of protecting her. You
like her. You like her a lot. If I didn't think so, I'd never have
mentioned this letter. But if you want, I'll throw it in the
wastebasket."</p>

<p>"People seem to know my affairs better than I do," was Dan's
dissatisfied answer.</p>

<p>Townsite's words were gently kind: "Everybody watches you. We
all prospect on your next move. It ain't inquisitiveness&mdash;it's
interest. You can take that as a compliment."</p>

<p>Bellew said thoughtfully: "If she's hiding, we shouldn't
interfere. I think she's trying to get rid of something on her back
trail. Trying to forget it. Everything she does or says is more or
less colored by what is behind her. I feel that. She's been hurt.
This is her way out of it."</p>

<p>"So the letter dies here?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. If running away would do her any good, I'd say
let the letter go unanswered. But she'll never be happy as she is.
You can't ever successfully run away from what's in your head. You
can't bury something that's alive. That's the way it is with her. I
know of only one way to handle it."</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"Face it and have it out."</p>

<p>"Supposing it's something serious they want her for?"</p>

<p>"She couldn't do anything really wrong," Dan said swiftly. "You
know that."</p>

<p>"You won't get any thanks for this."</p>

<p>Dan shrugged that aside. "How will you get around the
regulations?"</p>

<p>Townsite grinned. "I'll just write and say I'm not allowed to
give out such information, but that if he writes a letter to this
office I'll see it's forwarded. He'd be dumb not to catch the
answer."</p>

<p>"She ought to have a showdown with herself," Dan mused.</p>

<p>"That's your way," pointed out Townsite. "It may not be hers.
Men and women don't think alike. Some women enjoy their
sorrows."</p>

<p>"Not Nan Avery. She's had the habit of being square with the
world. She isn't now&mdash;which is what worries her."</p>

<p>"There'll be a man in it."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Townsite stared. "That makes no difference to you, Dan?"</p>

<p>Dan's face was at once blank. "Why should it? Don't ask me a
question like that."</p>

<p>Townsite reached out and laid a palm on Dan's shoulder. "I
didn't know it was that bad with you, son."</p>

<p>Jubilee, feeling much better, idled out of the Golden Bull and
along the shady side of the street. He had once been marshal, once
sheriff, and the habit of squaring himself with his surroundings
was hard to break. Abreast the door of his former headquarters he
slowed down, looked in, and saw nothing. He cut across the yellow
dust, ambled through an alley, emerged to a side street well
screened by the interlaced tops of ancient locusts. At this point
his fruitless wandering betrayed itself; over on a porch Helen
Garcia swung gently in a hammock. Jubilee went that way and sat
down with the outer evidence of great weariness.</p>

<p>"The day," said he, "is a trial to the spirit."</p>

<p>Helen sat up. "Dan in town?"</p>

<p>"What of it?" grumbled Jubilee. "I'm here, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"That's some help," admitted Helen.</p>

<p>"Now I suppose you got to dash right over and see him," said
Jubilee.</p>

<p>But she relaxed in the hammock, looking very small, and let one
white arm trail to the floor. Her black eyes narrowed as the rest
of her slim face turned more and more sober. "You've been around
the ranch all week. Has Dan visited Nan Avery?"</p>

<p>"What for? To get his neck bit? Naw."</p>

<p>"They've quarreled?" asked Helen in a faint voice.</p>

<p>"It ought to be happy news for you."</p>

<p>"You don't know much, Jubilee. People never quarrel unless they
hurt each other. They don't hurt each other unless they care."</p>

<p>"Him and her?" Jubilee overdid it. "Not a chance."</p>

<p>"So you know it as well as I do," said Helen softly. "Everybody
knows it, I guess, except they themselves."</p>

<p>Jubilee pinched a smoke together, lit it, took a drag. He shoved
back his hatbrim irritably, and a loose coil of raw red hair
dropped across his forehead. The light points in his gray-green
eyes sharpened. His voice could hurt, as it did now. "It is about
time," he said roughly, "you put away your slate and your hoop,
Helen. You're too old for toys. While you're about it, put away
some of your kid dreams. There's a lot of pains with growin' up.
Better get 'em over with now."</p>

<p>"Dan?"</p>

<p>Jubilee dropped the cigarette and forgot to be curt. "I wouldn't
knock Dan for a million dollars. And I wouldn't hurt you for ten
times that. But it's no go. This girl don't change it, one way or
another. Point is, you'll do for Dan's small sister&mdash;that's
all. I know him better than any other man in the world. It's time
you caught on."</p>

<p>She was very still, her face oddly intent and shaded. "Why are
you telling me, Jubilee?"</p>

<p>He stared down the street, angular cheeks gone homely. "I don't
want to see you building yourself up for a worse fall. If it could
be otherwise, I guess I'd be mighty pleased. You're all the girl
anybody ought to want. You're swell. Helen. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why are you telling me?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I'm here," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"Mean that, don't you?" she said quite gently. "Thanks, Jubilee.
But I don't change easily. Maybe I'll grow out of it, maybe I
won't. I've known all you've told me for some time. I guess I can
step aside and not cry in public."</p>

<p>"I'm here," insisted Jubilee.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like being second best."</p>

<p>He got up, turned away. "Far as you're concerned, I'd be seventh
best and like it."</p>

<p>Her slow answer followed him: "You deserve something better than
that, Jubilee."</p>

<p>He went along the street, turned a corner stiffly, and crossed
the square to Dan, who waited at Townsite's. Both rode solemnly out
of Trail. A long time later, past Gunderson's, Dan explained why
they didn't take the slightly shorter route across the valley. "Got
a couple letters for Miss Avery."</p>

<p>"Find anything new?"</p>

<p>"No-o. Same things repeated."</p>

<p>Jubilee tipped his head to the brass-and-blue sky and grunted.
"It won't last. Can't. I'd give a leg to catch the inside of St.
Cloud's mind for ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Where'd you go?"</p>

<p>"Over to see Helen."</p>

<p>Dan suddenly grinned. "I'd like to see that happen,
Jubilee."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush," was Jubilee's aggravated answer. They passed the
vacant Mitchell place, both glancing silently at the rectangle of
fresh dirt on the higher ridge; they turned the last loop of the
road and crossed Nan Avery's front yard. Lorrie sat huddled on the
porch. When he saw them he sprang up and ran over to seize Bellew's
bridle. The youthful eyes were brooding, unhappy; his mouth was
very straight.</p>

<p>"I'm going home with you for good, Dan," he said.</p>

<p>"Hold on here, youngster."</p>

<p>Lorrie's fist clenched, his voice broke shrilly: "She rode up
Smoky Draw with St. Cloud! I'm goin' home with you, Dan! I won't
stay here another minute!"</p>

<p>Dan, Jubilee thought, showed worry. He spoke to Lorrie with an
accented patience. "Don't get her wrong, son. She doesn't know
about St. Cloud. She's only being neighborly."</p>

<p>But Lorrie was stubborn, beyond persuasion. "I can't help it.
She's had truck with him, and I won't stay. I liked her&mdash;I
liked her a lot, Dan. But if you don't let me go with you I'll run
away."</p>

<p>Bellew thought about it over a heavy spell of silence. "You
sure? You're going to make her feel mighty bad. She's trying to
make a nice home for you."</p>

<p>Lorrie shook his head, the outrage simmering in him, maturing
his young cheeks. It hardened him against all argument. Seeing
that; Dan suddenly got down and walked toward the house. "All
right. Get your things, and I'll write her a note."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. SMOKY DRAW</h2>

<p>TWO miles north of the pass St. Cloud and the girl entered a
heavy pine belt and at once got beyond the scorching heat of the
late sun. The road ran like a tunnel through the false twilight,
bending gently to the left; and then abruptly fell out of the
timber and into a shallow gulch that seemed a natural corridor
leading onward into the peaked hills. A dozen gray, paintless
buildings lay along the gulch. Turning before the nearest and
largest house of these, St. Cloud dismounted.</p>

<p>"My particular kingdom," he told her smilingly. "The name of
which is anathema to all the good Christian people of the
valley."</p>

<p>Nan instantly resented that faint suggestion of being classed
outside the valley group. He was, she thought, trying to make up
her mind for her as he had done before. Yet for the moment she said
nothing, but crossed the porch and walked into the house. She was
at once surprised. The room, quite large, had a full furnishing of
fine oak pieces&mdash;all good and all old&mdash;suggesting a past
period of life at once more polite and more formal. In one corner
stood a piano, obviously unused; above it hung a mirror framed
ornately with golden cupids. The fireplace was a huge thing faced
incongruously with marble, and near by, on a kind of pulpit stand,
lay a great metal-bound family Bible. An inner door led into the
recesses of the house. A stairway climbed stiffly to the second
story. Save for certain discrepancies this might have been the
living room of a fashionable Baltimore home; the mark of taste was
evidenced here, but of a taste covered with dust and neglect and
the rather heavily flamboyant additions of another hand.</p>

<p>She accepted the chair St. Cloud offered her, realizing that his
keen glance awaited her reactions. He had a certain eagerness that
somehow demanded an answer.</p>

<p>"How," she asked, "does all this come away up here?" It was, of
course, the expected question. He stood in front of the fireplace,
the soldier-straight body stirred by a characteristic, ever-present
restlessness.</p>

<p>"Ancestral belongings," he drawled. "Descended to an unworthy
son. All this stuff came around the Horn to Portland in 1860. My
father had it freighted to the valley. He could have gotten along
without it, but my mother was a proud lady and wanted all the
relics of the past around her. That," he added, shifting to irony,
"was before evil days came upon us."</p>

<p>"You once lived in the valley?"</p>

<p>His reply was interrupted by the opening of an inner door. A
woman's husky and strident voice came from behind Nan: "You'll want
supper at the same time tonight?"</p>

<p>Nan, quite curious, turned in her chair.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wills," said St. Cloud, "this is Miss Avery. Mrs. Wills is
my housekeeper. Her husband works for me."</p>

<p>Nan acknowledged the introduction silently. Mrs. Wills's eyes
were unhappy and too old, and her disposition, was written clearly
on a face that once had been buxomly handsome but now was scored by
acid lines of violent emotion. Her mouth, Nan thought, gave her
away. It was thin and compressed. She was, perhaps, thirty-five.
Thirty-five and controlled by a sulky, tragic temper. Her hair, a
frowsy yellow, showed gray threads. St. Cloud's answer was clearly
one of dismissal:</p>

<p>"Dinner at the same time, if you please."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills's direct stare was offensively knowing. But she soon
turned to avoid Nan's cool inspection and closed the door
definitely behind her.</p>

<p>"My father," went on St. Cloud, ignoring the interruption, "was
one of the first settlers in the valley. He grazed all the land
where LeBoeuf's place is now. I was born there. Yet here you find
me in this year of grace, 1899, camping in the wilderness."</p>

<p>Nan sat immobile in the chair, studying the gloved tips of her
idle hands. Her perceptions, always sharp and useful, were building
up St. Cloud's character for her. The allowances she had made for
him previously were less truthful now that he stood in his own
house. Behind the surface courtesy, below the surface pleasantry
was another person that kept eluding her understanding. He was
complex, he was contradictory; and these things were baffling in a
man. Baffling and untrustworthy, When she mentally placed him
beside Dan Bellew he suffered by the comparison, for Bellew's lucid
and straight-spoken character made St. Cloud seem less honest, less
substantial. Nothing, excepting that reckless, ironic face, was
clear-cut. He was, she thought critically, the shadow to Bellew's
substance. More acutely regretting her trip, she could not, reason
away the sense of being involved in something that was gray and
surreptitious and unclean.</p>

<p>St. Cloud had kept silent. Lifting her face, she caught the
intentness of his look. It was as if he tried to follow her
reasoning. Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"Do you believe what you have heard about me?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think that's more personal than necessary?" she
countered.</p>

<p>"I want your good opinion. I want that more than you
believe."</p>

<p>She shrugged it aside. "It would do you little good, even if you
had it. I warned you before not to read meanings into what I
say."</p>

<p>He took a quick breath, turned across the room and back. "You
came here because you were curious. Probably because you wanted
your own picture of me. All right. That's fair."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking for your confession," Nan told him dryly. "I
don't particularly care for explanations."</p>

<p>"My father had the best of everything out there in the valley,"
he went on, "until other cattlemen came in. There was friction.
Never mind what it was all about. Cattlemen, especially the big
ones, are graspers. They're used to power and they always want more
power. They made a target out of my father. They drove him beyond
the valley. Up here. Here's where he died. I'm the only one left.
I've inherited this accursed barren spot in the hills. It isn't my
birthright. My rightful place is down yonder. But here I am, like
the archangel, barred from heaven. In the opinion of those people
I'm worse&mdash;I'm a wolf skulking the edges of the
settlement."</p>

<p>She watched him, refusing to speak the answer he plainly begged
for. A darker, more suppressed mood rode him. "That's the
background. It may explain to you how bitter I am. Maybe it'll also
explain why I feel perfectly justified in taking whatever steps I
can to fight back. I'm fighting back, you know. And I do not
hesitate to use the same means they have used on me and my
family."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interrupted Nan. "You are telling me you'll
take what you can get, however you can get it?"</p>

<p>"As they did. Don't forget that fact."</p>

<p>The relentlessly logical mind over which she had no power drove
her insistently on: "You would force Dan Bellew off his place if
you could? You'd drive him out?"</p>

<p>The pleasantry had quite departed from his mobile features. Lips
and nose were thinner; the light eyes flickered mordantly. "You're
quick, you're very sharp-minded," he applauded. "The thing is
between Bellew and me. We both know that. I guess everybody else
knows it."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Nan. "Why should it be Dan Bellew rather than
anyone else?"</p>

<p>"The man," said St. Cloud half angrily, "is a god to those
people. Why should he be? Don't ask me. I only know he is. He's got
a damnable control over them all. They'd ride to ruin for him. Yes
they would!"</p>

<p>Nan found herself saying very quietly: "Loyalty is not given to
a man unless he deserves it."</p>

<p>His answer was abrupt, contradictory: "Make no mistake about
him. I had hoped you'd see him as he is, not as people think him.
Dan Bellew wants power, too. Just us much as any other man. He
wants to give orders, not take them. He was born with a heavy hand,
and he will not surrender."</p>

<p>She cut in: "You've not answered me directly. You mean
deliberately to fight him?"</p>

<p>His grin was rather saturnine. "So you must have things in black
and white? Listen to me. I am no spectator. I've got to be up and
doing. I wasn't meant for compromise or safety or sweet
reasonableness. If people hurt me, I will not turn the other cheek.
Never! I could not live as a poor man or a quiet one: I have
ambition&mdash;the same as Bellew has. I am a fatalist. The ending
doesn't matter, for it is sure to come anyhow. The years between
now and then are all that matter. Either I make a large
winning&mdash;or I come to a quick finish. The highroad for me or
the bottom of the canyon."</p>

<p>"All those words, boiled down," she said, "mean 'Yes.' That's
your answer?"</p>

<p>"I can say it no clearer," retorted St. Cloud; and at that
moment she thought she saw him exactly and completely. His words
betrayed him, and his body betrayed him, drawn rigid as it was, the
head tilted back and the face colored as if from drinking. For
herself, she meant to be final beyond the chance of another
mistake, she meant to close the door against him definitely.</p>

<p>"It is clear enough. You are setting up to be another Robin
Hood. Did you ever stop to think that, all the fiction and romance
set aside, he was just a common thief?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;here!" he broke in roughly. "Don't be so ready with
your judgment. I gave you credit for a better understanding. This
isn't the East, you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was any boundary line to ordinary
honesty."</p>

<p>His lips made a thinly angered line. Obviously on the margin of
blunter talk he turned toward the doorway. The girl's eyes traveled
over there as well, to see the chunky, off-balance body of Clubfoot
Johnson sidled against the opening. He had, she knew, been there
tor quite an interval; the air of absorbed attention lay on that
swarthy face which seemed so conscienceless and so cruel. The
coarse black hair tumbled across his forehead to increase his air
of cunning. He was grinning openly.</p>

<p>"Well?" challenged St. Cloud.</p>

<p>"Just a word," muttered the other man and made a furtive
gesture. St. Cloud mechanically excused himself and went out.
Rising, she heard the two go along the porch, heard them rapidly
talking. The inner door opened, and Mrs. Wills came hurriedly
through. Queerly disturbed, Nan wondered at the cold hatred she saw
mirrored on that prematurely haggard countenance; and more clearly
she felt the presence of an unbridled temper. It had done this much
to Mrs. Wills; in another few years the woman would be a common
slattern.</p>

<p>"How's Lorrie?" asked Mrs. Wills.</p>

<p>Nan was puzzled, but she answered calmly enough: "Very
well."</p>

<p>"Like his new home?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. Why are you asking?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills put her hands on her hips, openly sullen. "Why
shouldn't I? He's my son."</p>

<p>"Oh, not really&mdash;" said Nan, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>The other woman was instantly ablaze. "Oh, yes, really!" she
sneered. "Don't you suppose I can have a son? Well, he's mine.
Don't forget it, either. One of these days I'm coming after him.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But St. Cloud was returning from the far end of the porch, and
Mrs. Wills bit off the phrase and half ran through the inner door.
St. Cloud came quickly in, at once throwing a glance that way.
Afterwards he studied Nan with a more composed manner, plainly
seeking a friendlier ground.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "we don't know each other very well. Let's
not quarrel about it."</p>

<p>Nan's answer was ruthless: "Don't you know when you have been
rebuffed?"</p>

<p>St. Cloud grinned. "I'm a gambler, always hoping for better luck
next time."</p>

<p>She went directly past him, out to her horse. In the saddle she
looked around to catch the same intent and weighing expression. "I
shall see you again," he said. "I'm sorry I can't ride back with
you."</p>

<p>She put the pony to a quick trot and soon passed into the trees,
glad to have the gulch behind her. The sun had dropped below the
western rim, and the pervading cobalt blue of another long prairie
twilight washed the land. In the thickness of the timber was a
premature darkness. Beyond this wooded belt Nan turned to the left
and, instead of following through the pass, cut into higher ground.
Aimless as the act was, it only mirrored the confusion and the
heavy fears dredged up by the revelation of Mrs. Wills.</p>

<p>It was hard to believe that this woman, so nearly
self-destroyed, could be Lorrie's mother. Yet that was only the
initial shock. What plagued Nan as the pony took her upward into
the cupped irregularities of Buck ridge, what roused her to furious
defensiveness, was the threat of returning the boy to Mrs. Wills.
It was upthinkable; it was cruel. Normally fair-minded, she could
not now admit Mrs. Wills's rights. The whole case was summed up and
dismissed in one scornful thought: "If she was his mother, why did
she leave him like that?" No, she would not surrender Lorrie. Not
ever.</p>

<p>"I've got to watch him," she told herself. "I've got to keep him
in my sight."</p>

<p>But there was a shadowing uncertainty, a lingering doubt of her
position. Supposing Mrs. Wills did come for a boy legally her own?
To, what extent dared she resist the woman? If she did resist, it
meant only one thing&mdash;the use of a force she hated. She
recoiled from the possibility, but it would not let her alone, and
presently she found herself, wondering what Dan Bellew's answer
would be. Exactly at that point she saw the man in a new, far more
revealing light. In Trail on election night he had met a like issue
and had replied. What was right one day could not be wrong the
next; what was right was to be fought for. So he had
answered&mdash;Nan realized&mdash;without change and without
compronise. And in that moment she applauded Dan Bellew for the
very rigidity of purpose that had until now seemed nothing but
arrogance. The next moment her preoccupied eyes lifted and found
two men stationed in a gully below. The rest of it was purely
involuntary. Wrenching the pony back, she retreated quietly to a
protected spot and there halted.</p>

<p>They were two hundred yards away, and the evening had deepened
to the prairie's lovely dusk. But she recognized them. One was the
new Sheriff, the other was Solano of Broken Stirrup. Little as she
understood the laws of the range, she did know this to be wrong. No
Bellew man could have any possible business with that St. Cloud
outfit Bellew so urgently opposed&mdash;and so what she saw below
was treachery. Increasingly feeling the danger of her position, she
watched Ruel Gasteen swing an arm southward. Solano bent in the
saddle and spoke a few brief words. Afterwards he rode directly
into the farther pines. Gasteen went up the gully and also
disappeared, apparently bound for Smoky Draw.</p>

<p>Nan waited a good ten minutes before venturing forward. Beyond
another heavy stringer of the hills she saw her own house standing
darkly by the road and swung toward it. Sliding down the slope, she
suddenly realized she had some duty here. What it was, she couldn't
for the moment determine, so complicated and interwoven were the
articles of faith and action of this strange, mysterious land.
Beneath its serenity was the smoldering of conflicts and ancient
hostilities. Was that why all its people spoke so sparely and so
invariably watched the horizoos with half-hidden eyes?</p>

<p>She didn't see Lorrie, but thought nothing of it. Probably he
waited out on some high point for the flash of the house light to
beckon him in. Entering, feeling somehow guilty for her lateness,
she lighted the lamp and at once saw two letters from the East and
an open note on the table. The note, from Bellew, was very
brief:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Miss Avery</span>:<br>
<br>
The letters were in Trail, so I brought them, Lorrie has decided to
live with me. This is his decision, not mine. I believe you'll
understand why he is doing it.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dan Bellew</span></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. A WARNING DISREGARDED</h2>

<p>THE cruel and unforgiving briefness of that note left her
momentarily stunned. She felt a physical hurt, a kind of sick
emptiness, she had the odd illusion of Bellew looking across the
shadows at her without sympathy. Things, she thought dimly,
happened like this out here&mdash;bitterly swift and unexplained.
Turning toward Lorrie's bed, she found his personal effects gone,
and immediately a silent cry went protesting to her deepest being.
"Dan Bellew hasn't the right to do this to me! What have I done to
deserve it?"</p>

<p>But below this helpless unstrung feeling her temper slowly took
shape. She had always been a fighter, and if her courage in the
past few weeks had remained still and ineffectual it was because
she had deliberately recoiled from a world suddenly turned unkind.
Her strong pride had been beaten, but not her spirit. She had, she
abruptly realized, been wrong in one thing. She had been wrong in
believing she could build up a barrier that would protect her from
further hurt and intrusion. The truth was, she could not ever
escape the chances of living. This added catastrophe demonstrated
the flimsy quality of her isolation.</p>

<p>At once she was bitter and defiant, unable longer to remain
still. And her instinct to strike back usurped that cool
second-reasoning which always had so strongly colored her
personality, had so accented her charming individuality. Half
furious, she ran out to the horse and went galloping off toward
Broken Stirrup. Beyond the third coulee she caught Bellew's house
lights. Near the yard she heard Mike Shannon's challenge strike out
of the dense shadows, but she rode speechless past him, dropped to
the house porch, and walked swiftly in. Bellew's black head was
bent over a ledger on the table. He looked up at her, and even with
an angered phrase taking substance in her head she had time to see
he had somehow withdrawn his faith. The man's solid face was
deliberately noncommittal, as it had been that election night in
Trail when he turned to Neel St. Cloud.</p>

<p>Nan spoke impetuously, bitterly: "Am I being punished?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bellew. He didn't rise; his two big palms closed
together on the table's top.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Lorrie would do this on his own account."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know Lorrie."</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's unfair!"</p>

<p>Mike Shannon strolled up the porch and looked in. Dan waved him
back. "I asked Lorrie to think it over," he said. "He refused. I
told him that whatever you did was entirely right because you
thought it right. But that's no line of talk to make any impression
on a nine-year-old boy. He came with me. I don't want you to think
I drew him away. I've always thought he needed your help. I do
now."</p>

<p>"Then send him back to me."</p>

<p>Dan slowly shook his head. "He wouldn't come."</p>

<p>"What have I done that is wrong?" challenged Nan.</p>

<p>"You went to Smoky Draw."</p>

<p>"Is that wrong?"</p>

<p>"Lorrie thought so."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" pressed Nan.</p>

<p>"We're looking at it Lorrie's way, not mine," Dan reminded her.
For a little while she had nothing to say. The flush of her cheeks
deepened, temper turned her fine, direct eyes stormier and
stormier. She was profoundly aroused, deeply stirred. He could see
that clearly. He could see, too, some other strange shift in this
really beautiful girl. That air of aloof and critical disinterest
was quite gone. Her guard was down, and she was at a fighting
pitch. She was, he thought, swept clean away from that indifference
against which he had so frequently and painfully collided. She made
a picture of grace and vitality there against the
lamplight&mdash;the level eyes blazing at him, small fists
unconsciously closed. Her shoulders were rigidly square.
Fundamentally there was nothing placid or helpless about Nan Avery,
and the discovery queerly touched him.</p>

<p>"I want him back," said the girl, after the studied pause.</p>

<p>"You'd want me to drag him back by the fur of his neck?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not that way," said Nan swiftly. Then her anger became
a white-hot flame. "This pleases you, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," interposed Dan. "Get rid of the idea."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it does! Toward your enemies you are very hard. You
see no good in them&mdash;and no good in those that speak with
them. You sit there and you think I am getting exactly what I
deserve!"</p>

<p>"Do you see some good in my enemies?" countered Bellew, quiet
again. "In St. Cloud, for example?"</p>

<p>It was her turn to put him back on the main subject. "We're not
talking of St. Cloud now."</p>

<p>He nodded his agreement. "But you've got me wrong. I'm not
trying to rub it in."</p>

<p>Nan drew a deep breath, fell from anger to an anxious pleading,
"Listen to me. I want Lorrie back. If I've got to beg, then I'll
beg."</p>

<p>"Like him, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I love Lorrie," stated Nan.</p>

<p>"You'd go a long ways to keep him," mused Bellew. "You'd swallow
your pride. You're doing that now."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I like you the better for it," said Dan quietly. "If an apology
will do you any good, you've got mine. I'd figured you a little
selfish. I was wrong." He paused, scowling at the desk. "But I
don't see any way out of this."</p>

<p>"Why?" insisted Nan. "Why should he be so bitter toward me all
at once? I don't understand it." Facing him, the words came
reluctantly out. She was revealing more than she wished him to see.
"I know he feels certain things deeply. I know he is shy. I have
been very careful not to force myself on him. Really I have. I'd do
almost anything to gain his confidence. I thought I had it, and I
can't feel he would turn against me so swiftly."</p>

<p>"You went with St. Cloud," pointed out Bellew. It was to him a
complete answer. But to Nan it remained aggravatingly obscure. It
brought her head against the strange, unfathomable hatreds of the
land.</p>

<p>"What does that mean to him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm to blame for not speaking sooner. Lorrie's dad was a
mighty fine man. Lorrie's mother was a girl of the valley, but a
kind of a high jumper. When Lorrie was about two years old another
man got interested in her. There had to be a quarrel between the
men, and there was. This interfering party shot Lorrie's dad dead
and ran for the hills. Lorrie's mother followed and married him.
They're up in Smoky Draw now. Henry Mitchell took the boy. Henry
Mitchell never mentioned the woman to Lorrie, but it was the main
point of his life to let the boy know how rotten that Smoky Draw
crowd was. That's the whole story."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" cried Nan, feeling the futility of her
hopes.</p>

<p>Dan shrugged his heavy shoulders. "Maybe I'm to blame. But we
keep our scandal to ourselves out here. The habit of saying nothing
is pretty strong."</p>

<p>"I met Mrs. Wills."</p>

<p>Dan showed a fresh interest. "What did she say to you?"</p>

<p>"That she might come after Lorrie."</p>

<p>"Not in my time," grunted Bellew. "But if she feels that way
about it, Lorrie's better off on Broken Stirrup."</p>

<p>A side door came open, and Bellew raised a warning hand toward
Nan. Lorrie, heavy-eyed from disturbed sleep, stood on the edge of
the big room and stared across at the pair. Bellew spoke very
casually:</p>

<p>"Miss Avery feels pretty bad about your going away, Lorrie."</p>

<p>The boy said nothing. He looked directly at Nan, then soon
away.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to come back?" Nan asked him gently.</p>

<p>Lorrie shook his head, speechlessly stubborn. Nan's lips moved,
but she only said, "Good-night, son," and stood still until Lorrie
had gone back, shutting the door behind him. Bellew rose, turned
about the room.</p>

<p>"I guess that is all," said Nan, no inflection in her voice.</p>

<p>Bellew stopped in front of her. "You had your own perfectly
proper reasons for going with St. Cloud. I don't question them. But
you can't expect a boy to understand the fine-drawn distinctions of
your thoughts. With Lorrie it is either black or white." A darker
tone subtly took possession of his words. "For that matter, I guess
all of us in the valley look at it either as black or white. I
don't say it is very enlightening. But I do say we can't afford to
be either charitable or generous."</p>

<p>"I shan't bother you again," said Nan, turning away.</p>

<p>"It might be a good idea," pointed out Bellew, "if you'd come
over frequently. Might change Lorrie's attitude."</p>

<p>She shook her head, speaking with the same uncolored
listlessness:</p>

<p>"No use, I'm afraid. He's your boy now."</p>

<p>He walked with her to the porch. On the steps she hesitated,
thinking of the scene between Solano and Gasteen. Rather
indefinitely she thought she ought to tell Bellew about that; but
at this particular moment the affair seemed of little importance to
her, and such inclination as she had was changed by a recollection
of Bellew's phrase: "The habit of saying nothing is pretty
strong."</p>

<p>She had made many mistakes from not knowing the ways of these
people. She would not transgress again. That silently decided, she
got into the saddle and turned homeward, overpowered by a sense of
black defeat.</p>

<p>When she reached her yard, she suddenly felt the presence of
somebody on the edges of it, and she wondered&mdash;with a final
remnant of anger&mdash;if St. Cloud was paying another visit.
Putting up the pony, she went to the house. The distinct odor of
cigarette smoke lay in the front room; on the point of locking the
front door, she was quite startled to see it open before her. Pete
Garcia slid in, closed the door quickly, and backed away from the
immediate light. Knowing him to be Helen's brother, she wasn't
afraid, but the surreptitious air of the man and his roving, uneasy
manner caused her to challenge him sharply:</p>

<p>"What is it you want?"</p>

<p>Garcia got a sealed envelope out of his pocket and offered it to
her.</p>

<p>"Been waiting here about as long as I dare. I want you to take
this letter to Bellew."</p>

<p>"You're able to ride, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Me? Think a minute, ma'am. What would happen to me if I set
foot on Broken Stirrup? Take it. He's got to get that right
away."</p>

<p>"Not from me," said Nan impatiently. "I'm not your messenger or
his. You'll have to get your sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain't got time to ride to Trail," insisted Garcia. "Didn't I
say he's got to get this right away?"</p>

<p>Nan put her hands behind her, refusing the letter. "I won't be
involved in your affairs."</p>

<p>Garcia showed his irritation. His thin frame went very still,
and he seemed to listen for stray rumors beyond the house. The
brilliancy of his eyes increased. "I don't see how you can be so
foolish. Figure it out. If it wasn't blamed serious I wouldn't risk
my neck coming here, would I? I'm on St. Cloud's payroll, ain't I?
Well, why would I be dickering with Bellew if it wasn't powerful
important? Think it over. You see?"</p>

<p>"Get out of here and take your letter with you," ordered
Nan.</p>

<p>Garcia sighed, shook his head. He came forward with a
characteristic abruptness, laid the letter on the table, and swung
to the door. "See that he gets it right away. I'm not fooling
you&mdash;not me. If it don't reach him tonight, there sure will be
hell to pay. You're Dan's neighbor, ain't you? Well, then, do what
you're supposed to do."</p>

<p>Having delivered that parting injunction, the man sidled from
the ream and went across the perch at a dead run. Nan remained in
her tracks, hearing Garcia's pony beat up into the ridge. Turning
deliberately from the table then, she walked into the kitchen to
find something that would serve for a cold meal.</p>

<p>She had gone to Bellew's once this night; no power could take
her back to that scene of humiliation. At this hour nothing was
very important.</p>

<p>What Solano said to Ruel Gasteen at their meeting in the ravine
was:</p>

<p>"Dan's drivin' beef to Trail tomorrow sundown. He'll be going
along the Buckridge trail."</p>

<p>"St. Cloud will want to know that."</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, ain't I?" countered Solano and rode
immediately into the pines.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. Disaster</h2>

<p>AT FIVE o'clock the next afternoon Dan rode across the flats to
a point in Buck ridge behind the Mitchell place, there joining the
rest of the crew. Eighty head of three-year-old steers lay in an
easy pocket, waiting out the hot day. Dan said, "Time to go," and
thereafter the beef was turned into the twisting trail that led to
town. Solano cut through the brush and took the point of the herd.
Medders and Shannon rode the flanks; Dan kept Jubilee with him in
the dusty rear. Evening's cool came with sunset, which was Dan's
favored time for driving, and he established a slow pace to
preserve tallow. The cattle went steadily, darkness drifted down,
the rustling, scuffing echoes of the stock played against a
surrounding quiet. A breeze blew out of the west. Jubilee's match
burst crimsonly against the thickening shadows.</p>

<p>"Fifty-seven days without a drop of rain. We're due for a swell
bust of weather. I feel it."</p>

<p>Link Medders's sharp "Hi-hi-hi!" slid through the pall; the
march momentarily got hung up ahead. Dan's pony, needing no advice,
surged into the brush, threw a steer back into the ranks. Then the
forward motion was resumed. Link Medders cursed melodiously
again:</p>

<p>"Had a talk with Lorrie yet?"</p>

<p>"About Mitchell?"</p>

<p>"Ahuh."</p>

<p>"I asked him if he saw the man who fired the shot. He was in bed
and didn't. But he heard only one rider. Mitchell was standing in
the doorway with the light behind him. I don't see how Henry, old a
hand as he was, would do such a trick. Killer apparently was
waiting for that, probably been posted for some time. After the
shooting, Lorrie said he heard the man run into the timber."</p>

<p>"No question in my mind," mused Jubilee. "Don't forget Mitchell
was warned to quit riding around Smoky Draw."</p>

<p>"A guess is all we'll ever have."</p>

<p>"A guess is enough."</p>

<p>"For our purposes, yes."</p>

<p>A long riding silence fell. The cattle wet their feet at Lost
Miner creek, filed into the mile-long run of Redoubt gulch. Night's
blackness thickened here, the wind strengthened and turned colder.
Beyond this defile lay a flatly open area across which the narrow
column made an undulating progress. Part of a moon shed frosty
light on the ragged surfaces of butte and pine. They were high up,
and in the distance Gunderson's ranch lights cut glimmering points
through the low-lying fog on the prairie. Dan struck a match
against his watch.</p>

<p>"We're making good time. Trail by eleven."</p>

<p>Jubilee Hawk emerged from long reverie. "We've had about all the
breathin' spell we're going to get. St. Cloud is a restless man, my
son."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew."</p>

<p>"We are dealing with a fertile brain, a dangerous brain.
Medders, ride on up to Solano and tell him to slack off. We're
strung out too far."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Jubilee, "haven't you got any idea?"</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to forecast what St. Cloud will do. If I put up
my guard in one place he'd hit me in another. I see nothing very
clear&mdash;except an eventual fight." Paused, Bellew listened into
the night with his chin risen. His added words were very
thoughtful: "It will be bloody&mdash;and a lot of dying goes with
it. That's all I see."</p>

<p>"It's you he's trying to get."</p>

<p>"I don't feel it, somehow. Usually I smell trouble coming. This
time I don't."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it's you," insisted Jubilee.</p>

<p>Something was wrong with the column. It had lost its forward
momentum, and the rear beasts were straying out into the flats. Of
a sudden the line disintegrated, and all the men fell to a swift
circling. Link Medders called angrily to Dan: "I told Solano to
slow down, not stop! What the hell's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>Some definite pressure up to the fore recoiled against the
cattle strangely. Cutting against the strays, Dan shouted to the
little man somewhere ahead on point: "Solano!"</p>

<p>Solano's voice was faint, remote: "Yeah?"</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Dan stopped his pony, scanned the shadowed
earth. Down left, the margin of timber stood blackly against him.
To the right the ridge was broken by small stringers of land
showing jagged crests in the moonlight. Seeing that, he launched a
quick order to Medders:</p>

<p>"Take Solano's place. The man's asleep. We're a quarter-mile off
the trail."</p>

<p>The cattle kept drifting to the rear, gently pressing into the
riders. Jubilee shot abreast Dan. "Something funny here. What's
makin' 'em shy away?" He swung on then, set his horse against the
increasing mass of the steers. Shannon angled out of the obscurity
and said, "This is odd, Dan." But Bellew, not yet moving, only half
heard. A vague form detached itself from the nearest stringer of
land a hundred yards to the right.</p>

<p>"Solano&mdash;come over here."</p>

<p>That figure never answered. Instead it drifted silently forward
a short distance and halted; at the same time a whole series of
formless shadows rose to the rear of the man and came abreast. A
sibilant word sheered the dark, and all Bellew's nerves went tight
and cold. Almost conversationally, he called to Jubilee and to
Shannon: "I think this is it, boys."</p>

<p>"What?" grunted Jubilee. He wheeled, reached Bellew's side; he
swore tautly. "By God&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's there?" challenged Bellew.</p>

<p>"Watch it!" roared Jubilee and laid the full force of his pony
against Dan's. Both men went shifting back into the mass of moving
steers. That sibilant word again passed like a knife through the
dim light. "Down!" shouted Jubilee. Medders's voice came out of the
distance in aroused puzzlement: "What's the trouble back there? I
don't see Solano. Solano!" And then the utter silence of those
breasting figures over by the stringer of land was blasted apart. A
guttering row of muzzle lights flashed vividly; the concerted gun
detonations made an avalanche of sound that swelled across the
open, struck the far trees, and rebounded in pulsing fragments.
Jubilee's Apache yell lashed shrilly back. A steer beside Dan
grunted and fell instantly dead; the rest, hit by an immediate
panic, stampeded into the timber, the crushing force of their
retreat adding a wild note to the flat wail of a continuing
fire.</p>

<p>It was, Dan coolly thought, St. Cloud's trump play. That whole
group sat yonder in the saddles and fired as though at target
practice. The whole thing was thus dispassionately planned. All
this occurred to him in fractional intervals of time. He had drawn,
he had wheeled behind Jubilee and Shannon, who stood shoulder to
shoulder. He yelled, "One of you get behind that dead steer," and
plunged into a circling lope. The breath of following lead touched
him, the crying of a barrel-toned voice in St. Cloud's outfit rose
and fell, rose and fell. He saw the mass of a high rock dead ahead,
he cut about it and dropped there. He had that long line flanked.
Seizing his rifle from the saddle boot, he began smashing at them
with an enfilading fire.</p>

<p>His shots struck. A horse sagged, the rear end of that line
wavered, a man capsized and emitted one fading cry. But the heavy
voice lashed out insistently: "Rush him&mdash;rush him!" And
afterwards part of the outfit broke from formation and drove at the
rock. They were squared against the faint moonlight, their shapes
grew bolder before him. Bellew thought. "You fools, you're dyin',"
and laid his barrel on the steadying rock. He fired twice, saw the
targeted figures tragically melt; those saddle-empty horses pitched
across the advancing group, got it into a snarling tangle; his bolt
crashed another shell into its seat, and the veering muzzle
stiffened on a spreading torso that for one moment stood advanced
and alone in the confusion. The man was as good as dead then; but
as the rifle fired, the pitching horse reared up on its hind legs
and took the bullet in the chest. It dropped, and the rider went
sidewise to the earth. Dan Bellew relentlessly sought him with the
gun, lost him in the quick churning of dust. The man appeared on
his feet again and raced away with an up-and-down gait that
identified him at once. It was Clubfoot Johnson. The attacking wave
had spent its strength; those left alive retreated&mdash;and
Clubfoot Johnson seized a passing rider's leg and was pulled into
the sheltering dark.</p>

<p>The long line of St. Cloud hands had unmistakably broken apart.
A piece of it advanced on that dead steer behind which either
Jubilee or Shannon lay&mdash;and fell back; elsewhere in this mad
night a quick and furious fire lifted roiling layers of sound into
a sky gone oddly dark. Medders, near the trees, was singing out his
epithets with a blistering casualness. Then Dan caught one more
view of Clubfoot Johnson reaching for a horse. It was what he
wanted to see. Leaving the shelter of the rock, he trotted
forward.</p>

<p>The affair was over in three or less violent minutes, its
swiftness of beginning matched by an equally swift ending. The
Broken Stirrup hands were intangible shapes blended with the dark,
and St. Cloud's party had lost its initial advantage of surprise.
There was a long, arresting cry. The guns beat up the flat echoes
once more, and following that last volley the ambushers whirled and
weaved across the open area. Jubilee Hawk spent his last shots at
thin shapes. The firing quit altogether, uneasy quiet came
trembling back. For a long, motionless interval the Broken Stirrup
men waited, hearing St. Cloud's men crushing the earth beneath them
in departure and at last passing eastward beyond earshot.</p>

<p>Jubilee said: "Everybody all right?"</p>

<p>Solano's muted voice arrived from a distance: "Medders, what was
you hollerin' about before all this started?"</p>

<p>Medders spoke rapidly: "Mike&mdash;Dan!"</p>

<p>"That ought to teach St. Cloud a lesson," said Mike Shannon.
"How about it, Dan?"</p>

<p>Into the waiting silence no answer came. Medders and Shannon
walked slowly to the center of the area, paused there. Solano's
body made a still streak under the moonlight. Jubilee Hawk rapidly
hoisted himself to his knees.</p>

<p>"Hey, Dan!"</p>

<p>After another straining period Jubilee jumped to his feet. The
four men came together. Medders muttered uneasily, "He was behind
that rock a minute ago," and made for that position on the run. His
voice presently drifted back. "Not here."</p>

<p>"Mister Bellew," snapped Jubilee, tension shrilling his voice,
"don't be coy."</p>

<p>"Maybe he lit out after 'em," suggested Shannon.</p>

<p>"No," called Medders. "His horse is here."</p>

<p>"Good God!" rapped out Jubilee, "Don't just stand there!"</p>

<p>Medders ran toward the looming stringers of land, torso bent at
the ground. Jubilee looked at Solano, who hadn't yet moved. "Don't
stand there, damn you!"</p>

<p>"Stop cussin' me," said Solano, openly sullen. "My leg hurts.
They shot my horse from under me."</p>

<p>"I wish," snapped Jubilee, "they'd busted your fool neck."</p>

<p>"Why light on me?" complained Solano.</p>

<p>"You led us off the trail&mdash;you got the beef all balled up.
At a time like this."</p>

<p>Medders was a hundred yards off. He dropped to all fours
suddenly, and he called out: "Come here."</p>

<p>Jubilee swore. He leaped ahead, Shannon on his heels. He said:
"Him?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," grunted Medders.</p>

<p>There was a long, motionless shape on the earth in front of
Medders. Jubilee bent down. Medders let a heavy sigh out of him.
"His heart's workin'."</p>

<p>Jubilee reached for a match and struck it. The yellow glow slid
across Bellew's face and turned oddly crimson. Bellew's eyes were
half opened, and he breathed like a man sleeping; but a mask of
blood stained the whole left cheek from temple to neck. Jubilee's
hard, glittering eyes bent nearer and nearer. The match went
out:</p>

<p>"If it was a clean hole he'd be bleedin' worse. Looks like it
creased him."</p>

<p>"Light another match."</p>

<p>Jubilee obeyed. Medders's fingers gently crept across Bellew's
head. "I don't see anything else. Dan&mdash;come on, boy, sing
out."</p>

<p>The three of them hung over Bellew; and the last flicker of the
match showed the hungry anxiety of their brooding faces. In the
following darkness Mike Shannon took the lead. "It's a mile nearer
the ranch than it is to town&mdash;and better travelin'. You boys
get him home. I'll run for Trail and have Doc Nelson on the job by
the time you reach the house."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>Jubilee ran back for his horse, brought it up. Solano came
limping over and stood a yard away while Jubilee swung to the
saddle and the others lifted Bellew up to him. Then he said,
curiously: "What about the beef?"</p>

<p>"To hell with the beef!" snapped Jubilee. "Shannon, get
goin'!"</p>

<p>Shannon was already on his way, pounding across the clearing
into the broken terrain southward. Jubilee swung into the trail,
Medders behind him. Solano was left to himself.</p>

<p>"If he passes out on us," stated Jubilee in a barren voice,
"I'll ride to Smoky Draw, Link. So help me, I'll kill
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jubilee," said Medders, "it seems mighty queer to me how St.
Cloud knew we'd be in this spot at this time."</p>

<p>Doc Nelson reached Broken Stirrup a few minutes beyond ten
o'clock. Shannon was with him, and also Helen Garcia and Townsite
Jackson. Medders met them on the porch and silently pointed to the
lower bedroom. "Still breathin', but knocked clean dumb."</p>

<p>Helen let out a sharp sigh, following Doc Nelson into the room.
But in another moment she returned, paler than before, Jubilee
holding her arm. Nelson put his head through the door. "Boil up a
kettle of water and bring me a couple more lamps."</p>

<p>"Is it bad?" demanded Helen.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" grunted Doc Nelson. Jubilee motioned Chan to
the kitchen, himself going for the lamps. The others made a silent,
grim group in the living room. Helen turned from one end of the
room to the other, unable to halt, her eyes constantly reverting to
the bedroom doorway. Townsite rolled a dry cigar between his
teeth.</p>

<p>"How did this happen?"</p>

<p>"They were waitin' for us&mdash;that's all," growled
Jubilee.</p>

<p>"If Dan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" cried Helen,</p>

<p>Uneasy quiet returned for a little while. Solano slid quietly
into the room and paused, slightly removed from the group.
Jubilee's glance snapped over to the little man with an odd
alertness. "Solano," he demanded, "how did you happen to get off
the trail? You could ride that country with your eyes shut."</p>

<p>"Half asleep, I guess," muttered Solano. "Up most of last night
scoutin'. I let the pony pick the way."</p>

<p>Jubilee's mouth tightened. "Why would your horse leave a
well-beaten trail?"</p>

<p>"How in thunder do I know?"</p>

<p>"What difference would a half-mile make?" asked Townsite, deeply
interested.</p>

<p>"St. Cloud's boys were waitin' for us, wasn't they?" pointed out
Jubilee.</p>

<p>"Listen," broke in Solano, "I don't want to hear any more
nonsense like that. I'm the oldest rider on this ranch. I worked
for Bellew's father. I helped drive the first Broken Stirrup cattle
onto this range. Don't stand there and look at me as if I was a
chicken thief!"</p>

<p>"We got off the trail&mdash;and right there St. Cloud's bunch
met us," said Jubilee in a level, insistent manner.</p>

<p>"Probably he had us scouted from the moment we put the beef in
motion," said Solano. He stood with his feet apart, his flimsy body
apparently ridden by fatigue; and the secretive, dust-colored eyes
met and avoided the long, thoughtful inspection of the others. A
feeling of straining, speechless suspicion came into the room. Even
Helen. Garcia halted her aimless wandering and watched the little
man. Townsite thought to light his cigar, narrowly staring into the
match flame; and it was his next remark that broke the spell: "I
have told Dan it was a mistake to run so shorthanded. He should
have twenty men on this place. He won't see it."</p>

<p>"Different from now on," said Jubilee flatly. "There will be a
dozen of his best friends on Broken Stirrup by tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"That's the talk."</p>

<p>Medders broke in: "I don't think St. Cloud was in that party.
But I did recognize Clubfoot. Dan shot his horse down. It was
probably when Dan went after Clubfoot that he got hit."</p>

<p>"Of course St. Cloud wouldn't be along," muttered Townsite.</p>

<p>But Jubilee interposed a warning: "Don't discount his courage.
He'd been there if he figured it necessary."</p>

<p>"And now what do we do?" grunted Medders, "Take it and like
it?"</p>

<p>"That depends," answered Townsite and motioned toward the
bedroom; and once more a nervous, gloomy quiet oppressed them all.
Doc Nelson came out, bringing swift attention down on himself.
Helen Garcia stopped in front of him.</p>

<p>"How is it?"</p>

<p>"Bullet shaved three inches of skin off the side of his head,
and a small amount of bone, I think it's probably a case of
concussion. Won't know how bad it is for another couple hours.
Where's that water?"</p>

<p>Helen went quickly after it. She took the steaming kettle into
the room and returned to the group with round, frightened eyes.
Townsite gently patted her shoulder. "That boy," he drawled, "is
too tough to kill."</p>

<p>Helen said: "He looks so helpless!" Then she wheeled away. "I'm
going out. Be back very soon." She went to the porch, to her horse;
she climbed into the saddle and sat there a moment, watching the
strong light flooding out of Dan's room. Old Mike Shannon strolled
to the porch, saying, "Don't ram too far from this yard." But Helen
went off at a strong lope, not quite sure of her destination till
she topped a coulee two miles to the east and picked up Nan Avery's
house beam. Then she knew, and rode straight for that beacon. She
didn't bother to knock, but opened the door and walked in. Nan
Avery's head rose from an unfinished letter on the table before
her. Some flash of apprehension shone momentarily in her level eyes
and then was absorbed by a quick concern; for Helen Garcia's cheeks
were tragically drawn, the vivid features&mdash;overwhelmed by the
darkness of despair. It was so plain, so contagious that Nan rose
with a swift question:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>The smaller girl's shoulders dropped. She was not far from
crying. Her breath rose and fell rapidly. "Dan was shot down
tonight by St. Cloud's man."</p>

<p>"Helen!"</p>

<p>"Doc Nelson is taking care of him at Broken Stirrup."</p>

<p>"Is it bad?" breathed Nan.</p>

<p>"Don't know yet."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;how could anybody do that!" cried Nan.</p>

<p>"I told you once before," was Helen's dull answer, "you didn't
know this country."</p>

<p>Nan didn't hear. It was as if some strong support had been
withdrawn from her. She stood mutely there, physically sick. She
was thinking of Bellew with a kind of hungry interest, and the
solid, easy-muscled shape of the man came quite clear before her.
It was impossible to believe that anything could happen to him, so
lively and rugged were her pictures of him. He was, she told
herself faintly, too strong to be caught by the ordinary accidents
of life; he was a riding man.</p>

<p>"I've got to go over there, Helen."</p>

<p>"I knew that."</p>

<p>It was so wistfully said that Nan was roused to a more outward
interest. "Helen&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>Helen Garcia leaned wearily against the wall, watching emotion
play through the tall, fair Nan Avery. If she had any lingering
doubts as to her own share in Dan Bellew's life they were dispelled
now. This Avery woman who could be proud and aloof and untouchable
was after all only human&mdash;with the same feelings and the same
desires. It was very clear and very saddening. Like went to like.
Dan Bellew, who admired pride and courage and self-possession,
would be finding it in Nan Avery. That was the way it was; these
two were made for each other.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are in love with him."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;" began Nan&mdash;and swiftly closed her pale
mouth.</p>

<p>"That is so," said Helen. "I knew it days ago. People don't go
out of their way to hurt each other, as you two have done, unless
they feel something else."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you shrewd child."</p>

<p>"What good does it do me?" brooded Helen. "Well, we've got to
get back there."</p>

<p>But Nan suddenly straightened and went paler than before. "This
is all my fault! Look here."</p>

<p>Pete Garcia's letter still lay on the table. She took it up,
passed it to Helen. Seeing that handwriting, Helen said abruptly:
"How did you get it?"</p>

<p>"Your brother brought it."</p>

<p>Helen ripped the envelope nervously. The note was very brief,
and unsigned:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"St. Cloud is going to surprise you on the
drive."</p>

<br>

<p>"You never opened it?"</p>

<p>"He asked me to take it to Dan last night."</p>

<p>"And you didn't?" Helen's dark face blazed. "You ought to be
slapped!"</p>

<p>"I had been to Broken Stirrup once that day. I humbled myself. I
couldn't go again."</p>

<p>"So you let your pride interfere!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was that serious," said Nan slowly. "I really
didn't know."</p>

<p>"Haven't you been warned about Smoky Draw? How long are you
going to trust that yellow-headed killer up there? Oh, but you're a
fool!"</p>

<p>"Dan will have to know," Nan murmured.</p>

<p>"You bet he will."</p>

<p>"Tell him."</p>

<p>"Me?" said Helen. "What would Dan think of me for carrying
tales? Tell him yourself."</p>

<p>"You think that much of him, Helen?"</p>

<p>Helen Garcia swung toward the door, concealing her face with an
impatient, weary manner. "Let's get out of here."</p>

<p>Nan lighted a lantern and ran to the barn. She was soon back in
the saddle, and the two went side by side across the coulees to
Broken Stirrup. A little distance from the porch they came against
Mike Shannon's stationed figure. Mike said roughly: "You oughtn't
be rammin' around like this, neither of you. Dan's all right."</p>

<p>Nan felt a cool, streaming relief pass through her. Helen Garcia
murmured some indistinguishable phrase and jumped boyishly to the
porch. When they walked into the big room, Doc Nelson was pulling
down his shirt sleeves, jaded and ruffle-haired.</p>

<p>"He came out of it," he said. "Never know just what concussion
will do for a man. Sometimes it just blows out the light, sometimes
it doesn't. It's up to you to see he stays on his back three-four
days. I want that cut to heal. Go on in if you want."</p>

<p>Nan turned on her heels, paused at the open door. She felt
embarrassed for a moment at what she saw&mdash;which was Lorrie
standing at the head of the bed and trying not to cry. Dan lay flat
on his back, white bandages making a complete helmet around his
head. He grinned, faintly drawling:</p>

<p>"Do I have to get shot to draw you over here, Miss Avery?"</p>

<p>"This is my fault. I had a letter of warning brought to me. I
didn't deliver it."</p>

<p>"Honesty is a swell thing to have."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not trying to be angelic. I didn't realize what was in
the note. And at the time I didn't care. I'd just come from here. I
couldn't come back."</p>

<p>"Think no more of it. If the cards fall that way, there's
nothing you can do about it. The business was in the book before
you or I were born."</p>

<p>Helen Garcia stood in the door's opening, watching that scene
with a shadowed intensity. She had a quick, glad phrase framed in
her throat, and there it died; Dan never saw her. Dan's eyes were
absorbed in Nan Avery, and the strengthening light in them told
Helen the complete story. As quietly and as softly as possible.
Helen retreated, faced the silently grouped men.</p>

<p>"I'll go home with you, Doc," she said and went to the
porch.</p>

<p>Jubilee walked after her, rounded her in the semi-darkness.
"I'll take you home."</p>

<p>Helen lifted her pointed, passive face; the glow of her eyes
dimmed; "You belong here, Jubilee. But thanks. Jubilee, you're
nice. And you were right."</p>

<p>"Don't let it hurt too much," growled Jubilee.</p>

<p>"I guess I can stand it," murmured Helen. But there was despair
in her, and it came violently out: "Jubilee, it's so damned hard to
grow up!"</p>

<p>Jubilee put a hand under her chin. "Some people cry when they
lose. You ain't that type. Get it, Buffalo Bill?"</p>

<p>"Jubilee&mdash;I didn't ever know you were so kind."</p>

<p>The man cleared his throat, and his cigarette tip made a glowing
arc in the shadows. Whatever he meant to say was checked by the
approach of Doc Nelson. In another moment, Nelson and the girl were
riding off toward Trail.</p>

<p>Said Nan: "It was Pete Garcia who brought me the note,"</p>

<p>Dan tried to shake his head. "The boy will only get himself in
trouble. I've got to see Helen and have her tell him."</p>

<p>"She was here a moment ago," said Nan and turned to the living
room. Jubilee was just then coming in, and she asked him.</p>

<p>"Went home," muttered Jubilee, and his frowning glance locked
significantly into the girl's. Nan slowly nodded and turned back.
"She came with Dr. Nelson," she told Dan. "And then rode to tell
me."</p>

<p>"A fine kid."</p>

<p>Nan interposed a sharp correction. "She's more than that. She's
a wonderful woman."</p>

<p>Dan's tone was gentle. "That's right. I keep forgetting she's
grown up."</p>

<p>"Are you really going to let me off this easy?"</p>

<p>Lorrie slid off the bed and eased himself from the room with a
show of self-consciouness, That made Dan grin. "That boy has got
the sensitiveness of a woman. He feels he's one too many right now.
Look here, let's quit scrappin'."</p>

<p>"All right, Dan."</p>

<p>He put up a hand, and she came forward to take it. The pressure
of that big black fist was sudden and genuine. He had turned very
sober. "I told you once it wasn't possible for me to keep from
figuring about you. Remember that. Take it for whatever you
please."</p>

<p>"Would you mind if I stayed in the house tonight?"</p>

<p>"Feel comfortable if you would," Dan said. He was, she saw,
keeping his eyes open with effort; and disengaging his hand, she
quietly turned down the lamps and went out, closing the door behind
her. The men in the living room stopped talking with a telltale
suddenness, and for some reason their turning attention embarrassed
her. Somehow her calmness had gone, and almost defensively she
walked to the porch and on into the long roadway between the
poplars, quite responsive to the soft pleasantness of this night
and the silver beauty of the thin moon suspended in the south. She
had no power over the lifting, gay mood so abruptly possessing her;
and absorbed by it as she was, she almost collided with Mike
Shannon, who stood there by a tree silently smoking.</p>

<p>"Ma'm," said old Mike, "you like him, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;sure."</p>

<p>"This was my fault, Mike. I could have stopped it."</p>

<p>"Now I'd not be blamin' yourself. He's alive, ain't he? Well,
then."</p>

<p>Nan turned quickly toward him. "I have got to tell you
something. Perhaps I'm wrong&mdash;it is so hard to know what the
right thing is, and I have made so many mislakes. But all of you
should know this: Coming back from Smoky Draw last evening, I
happened to see that new sheriff, Gasteen, talking to Solano."</p>

<p>Mike Shannon's pipe slanted upward between his teeth. There was
a long pause, Then he said gently: "You're sure of it?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't be mistaken."</p>

<p>Shannon seemed to study the sky; she saw the stolidly honest
face settle. Yet his next phrase was oddly irrelevant: "It's late,
ma'm, Maybe you'd better stay over for the night."</p>

<p>"I thought to."</p>

<p>"Come with me." He led her back to the living room. "At the head
of the stairs," he explained, "is your room."</p>

<p>Nan went halfway up, turned.</p>

<p>"Good-night, gentlemen."</p>

<p>They were, she thought, fine-mannered people. Their hats came
off, and they all answered her with grave courtesy. And so she
passed up and into the room.</p>

<p>Mike Shannon said in a slow voice:</p>

<p>"Where's Solano?"</p>

<p>"Out somewhere," answered Jubilee.</p>

<p>Shannon looked from one to the other&mdash;to Townsite and
Medders and Jubilee. "The girl," he went on in the same gentle
manner, "said she saw Solano last evening talkin' with Ruel
Gasteen."</p>

<p>Jubilee's angular face broke into a hard, wicked shining. "That
squares with tonight's funny stuff."</p>

<p>"I might as well tell you," drawled Townsite, "I've suspected it
for some time. Henry Mitchell hinted it to me a couple days before
he died."</p>

<p>Jubilee started for the door, to be stopped by Shannon. "No,"
said the Irishman, "this man's been ridin' with me for years. I'm
bound&mdash;"</p>

<p>Solano came into the room with his catlike tread. Shannon took
out his pipe, tapped it against the side of the fireplace. "Well,
somebody's got to ride the circle before bedtime. It'll be Solano
and me. Come on, boy."</p>

<p>Solano hesitated. "I'm tired as a dog&mdash;" But Mike went up
to him and walked out with him, shoulder to shoulder. None of the
other three said anything for a long, long while. There was the
report of hoofs on the packed drive, a rhythmically dying scud in
the looser soil: beyond. Medders's face went more and more tacitu
and Jubilee Hawk stared straight against a wall.</p>

<p>It was Townsite who broke the lengthening pause:</p>

<p>"Nobody knows Shannon till they see his loyalty roused."</p>

<p>"Mike?" grunted Medders. "Mike would cut off his arm if Bellew
wanted it."</p>

<p>Jubilee said: "We've got the answer now to how Solano happened
to see Leboeuf's cattle bein' rustled. It was arranged by St. Cloud
he should go pull LeBoeuf away from the votin'."</p>

<p>"What would the little runt want to be that way for?" demanded
Medders. "Why, damn him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Two curt reports cut the outer stillness, killed Medders's talk.
Those three stiffened, and their faces turned to the door's black
opening&mdash;all changed to expressionlessness. Jubilee
muttered:</p>

<p>"Night's full of sounds. It's maybe a coyote dyin'."</p>

<p>"Get this straight," said Medders, "we're all telling Dan the
same story&mdash;Solano was killed by parties unknown."</p>

<p>"There's another who is not to know," warned Town site. "That
girl told us. It'd break her heart if she thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>One pony came beating back, neither hurried nor delayed.
Townsite turned and walked the length of the room, his head
dropped.</p>

<p>"This," he muttered, "is what a range war is like."</p>

<p>Mike Shannon came in. He said gently:</p>

<p>"I rode a ways with him. I told him to stop, and I called him
for what he was. He had his chance, and he took it when he saw what
was up. Had to give him a clean break, didn't I? It was my shot you
heard last."</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. THIS TURBULENT LAND</h2>

<p>GABE TRONO was a Mormon squatter with a wife, four yellow-headed
children, and a pack of hunting dogs in which he took considerable
pride. He had a cabin at the foot of Squaw ridge six miles below
Broken Stirrup, and he had twenty head of stock grazing alternately
on LeBoeuf and Bellew soil with no complaint from either rancher.
Gabe didn't own an inch of ground, and the beef was only the
natural increase from three cows long ago left to their own
devices. Things just happened to Gabe Trono; he was a great
believer in letting well enough alone. During the busy seasons he
rode for the big outfits, and that little labor fed the household
through the year. Otherwise Gabe could be found doing any
irrelevant thing&mdash;washing the Monday clothes, following the
hounds, or leading his flock on a camping trip that never had
destination or limit. The fact was, Gabe led a placidly
satisfactory life, neither eaten thin by ambition nor stirred to
pretensions of wealth. He got along, and his family was happy.</p>

<p>On this unimportant person the collecting storm next burst, at
once wiping out his substance.</p>

<p>It was three nights after Bellew's ambush on the ridge. Gabe had
wound up his eventless day. The small chores were done, the lamps
trimmed and lighted, his cob pipe drawing well. Mrs. Trono had left
the doors open to dissipate the odor of boiled cabbage, and Gabe
rocked himself in the cross draft of pungent evening air. The
children were in bed. "Tomorrow," said Trono, listening to the far
yammer of a coyote with a sense of deep ease, "I got to get at the
well." And then the coyote's wail was overborne by the steady fall
of hoofs rising from the northeast and coming rapidly on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trono stopped in her tracks. She said, a little anxiously:
"They're passin' toward LeBoeuf's again, Gabe. I wish they wouldn't
come so close."</p>

<p>"We never done them no harm," reflected Gabe. Yet he lowered his
pipe and ceased to rock, and he was keening the night like one of
his own hounds. The trembling impact of that party telegraphed
itself stronger through the earth; of a sudden the dogs began to
bay.</p>

<p>"Close the door," said Trono's wife.</p>

<p>"What for? It's a free country."</p>

<p>"I know, but I'm afraid."</p>

<p>The night party broke out of the enclosing dark, wheeled in
Trone's yard. He saw the curveting horses, the closing ranks. One
man moved deliberately into the steady beam of houselight. "Trono,
step out here a minute."</p>

<p>"Don't go!" whispered the woman.</p>

<p>"Now, now," cautioned Trono. But a slow and worried frown
settled across his face. That yonder man was clear in the light,
lopsided body and sullenly cruel countenance and all. Trono rose,
cast one doubtful glance at his gun standing against the wall, and
walked though the doorway. Wise in the ways of his country, he saw
that the group&mdash;twenty strong&mdash;was bent on business.
There was no friendliness in the men. Still, he kept his voice
casual.</p>

<p>"Hello, Clubfoot."</p>

<p>Clubfoot Johnson moved in the saddle. Mouth and eyes and hatbrim
made narrow, hard lines against the scorched-black cheeks. "Trono,"
he said, "get your family out of that shack inside of two
minutes."</p>

<p>"Lord sakes," muttered Trono. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Get 'em out!" barked Clubfoot.</p>

<p>Trono's anxious glance passed along the silent line of riders
and was then drawn off to the southwest, off toward LeBoeuf's. What
he saw yonder astonished him beyond measure. A great column of red
flame piled up into the sky. "Hey," he said, "what's burnin' over
there?"</p>

<p>"Another nester's shack."</p>

<p>"That's Nick Wales's. Say, boys, we ought to ride and help."</p>

<p>"We just come from there," grunted Clubfoot ironically. "Now get
out of that shanty and do it sudden."</p>

<p>Comprehension came to Gabe Trono with a catastrophic suddenness.
"No," he said strongly, "you ain't doin' that trick to me,
Clubfoot!"</p>

<p>"Ain't I?"</p>

<p>Trono's wife ran through the doorway. "Listen here, you
crooked-legged thief, why don't you let us alone? Don't you dare
touch this place! You hear? Trono is an honest man, and he never
raised a hand against St. Cloud in his life! You're not going to
burn our house!"</p>

<p>Clubfoot laughed. "Missis, you want your husband alive, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Trono's wife let out a gasp and said nothing more. She ran back
into the house. Clubfoot spoke over his shoulder: "Bill, go in
there and pile up anything that will make a quick fire. Sim, put a
match to the straw in the barn."</p>

<p>"Now, Clubfoot," pleaded Trono, "what's this all about?"</p>

<p>"We're burnin' you and Wales to the ground: That's a warning to
all nesters in this valley. If it ain't enough of a warning, then
we'll be back. Get to hell clear of the country, Trono. Don't let
daylight find you around here."</p>

<p>Trono's wife came out, herding the children in front of her. One
of the St. Cloud men passed in, brushing the woman roughly aside.
All this Trono saw with a heavy eye. The kids were scared, and that
hurt him worst of all. But he knew these men; and he understood on
what dangerous ground he stood. There was nothing to do. "Let me
get my belongin's out first, Clubfoot."</p>

<p>"You ain't got enough to worry about," jeered Clubfoot. "Let 'er
go, Bill."</p>

<p>A long lance of fire stabbed through the barn door, a roar
rising as the hay ignited. Trono moved stupidly toward his
children. He caught up the youngest and beckoned the rest to follow
him farther into the desert. The lamp in the house smashed to the
floor, the St. Cloud rider walked from the place with a quick
crimson glow behind him.</p>

<p>"Put up the sign," said Clubfoot imperturbably.</p>

<p>Trono's wife lashed at him despairingly: "Oh, you'll get your
reward one of these days! You're the cruelest thing that breathes!
Go tell that to St. Cloud! Tell him I'll be glad when Dan Bellew
kills him! I'll be glad!"</p>

<p>"You're through in this country," said Clubfoot. "Don't forget
it. And let me tell you somethin': Don't go to Bellew's or
LeBoeuf's. If you do, Trono, your life won't be worth much."</p>

<p>"Is there no pity in you?" cried Trono's wife.</p>

<p>"I never had any use for a nester, missis. Far as I'm concerned,
you ain't even people. Come on, boys."</p>

<p>The barn shook with the swelling heat, and in the house the
licking tentacles ran hungrily up the walls. St. Cloud's men went
beating away. Trono felt the heat on his face, and he retreated
again and put down the youngest one. His wife was crying bitterly;
Trono put a hand awkwardly to her shoulder.</p>

<p>"We've started before, and we can start again."</p>

<p>"Trono, I loved that house, and now we've got nothing&mdash;not
even clothes!"</p>

<p>"Never mind. They let the horses out of the barn. I'll get 'em
for you and the kids to ride. Wait right here."</p>

<p>"Where will we go?"</p>

<p>"Bellew's."</p>

<p>"You were warned not to do that."</p>

<p>But this easy-going man's temper was rising. "I ain't that
certain to scare," he said gutturally. "By God, they'll pay me
back!"</p>

<p>Clubfoot's men had driven down a stake with a cardboard on it.
Trono went over there, guarding his face against the heat, to read
the sign:</p>

<p>NOTICE TO ALL NESTERS: LEAVE THE VALLEY BY DAYLIGHT OF THE
FOURTEENTH OF THIS MONTH. NO EXCEPTIONS AND NO EXCUSES.</p>

<p>"He'll pay for every inch of it," gritted Trono, turning about
the solid flame that had been the barn. His two horses were
drifting off, and he spent a good twenty minutes getting them.
Afterwards he hoisted his family aboard and started off to the
north, to Bellew's. His wife had ceased crying, but the youngest
was whimpering. Trono walked on with that little wail in his ears,
hurt and shamed and outraged by it. He never looked back.</p>

<p>Clubfoot led his band diagonally across the flats to Henry
Mitchell's place and left it a high plume of crimson against the
night's dark. He went on to Nan Avery's house and called roughly.
"Come out of there, you!" This evening's destruction woke all the
illicit, brutal pleasure of which his sullen mind was capable. He
was pleased with himself, proud of his luck. Yet his trail was
written vividly across the prairie sky, and from time to time he
looked with some degree of uneasiness off to the quarter where
Broken Stirrup lay. Having no answer from the house, he went in,
found it empty. He kicked over the furniture, made an inflammable
pile against a wall. One of Nan's dresses hung from a clothes
hanger, and he came out with this, maliciously grinning.</p>

<p>"Neel might like this trinket."</p>

<p>Fire began to glow behind the shanty windows, but Clubfoot made
no immediate move to go. He sat in his saddle, watching the blaze
catch hold, eyes reflecting some of that fire's hot heat. "She's
got herself to blame for this. Neel would of took her. But she gave
him the mitten. She's a fool. Any woman that turns St. Cloud down
is a fool."</p>

<p>"Why you suppose she did?" said one of the crew.</p>

<p>"Dunno," said Clubfoot, puzzled. It was past his understanding.
There was little room in his warped mind for such oddities of
conduct, no light and no shade; nothing but a faith in the man who
owned him that was like the fealty of a serf, "She'll regret it in
another week," he muttered. "Let's go, boys."</p>

<p>When he reached Smoky Draw he slid from the saddle and tramped
into the big house with Nan's dress hanging over a thick arm. He
tossed it to a table, the evilness of his blackened visage deepened
by a humorless smile. St. Cloud stared from that dress to Clubfoot
and angrily hurled his question at Clubfoot:</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Just burnt the place. Girl wasn't there. Found the dress. Sort
of a trinket for you, Neel."</p>

<p>St. Cloud said with a sort of breathless quiet: "If you ever
touch that woman, Clubfoot, I'll slice the heart out of you.
Understand me?"</p>

<p>"Why, chief, I did nothin'," countered Clubfoot plaintively.</p>

<p>"Had I wanted that dress I would have asked for it."</p>

<p>"Yeah," mumbled Clubfoot.</p>

<p>"You did what I told you to do?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Clubfoot, once more grinning.</p>

<p>That grin, which more widely spread the grimy evil of Clubfoot's
character across his face, exploded Neel St. Cloud's rage. His
words were brutal and contemptuous and insolent beyond measure: "I
ought to smash you with a whip! Maybe I've got to spend the rest of
my life among dumb animals like you, but by God, you'll at least
mind me! Get out of here!"</p>

<p>Clubfoot departed as one whipped; nor was there any power in him
sufficient to raise his head to the yellow blaze in St. Cloud's
eyes. Clubfoot knew that mood and feared it. This misshapen man was
that primitive, answering only to the emotions of loyalty and
fear.</p>

<p>There was another meeting of the stalwarts at Dan Bellew's
house. Gunderson said, as he had said before: "If we've got to
smash him, let's do it now. He doesn't scare me."</p>

<p>"Take your time," put in LeBoeuf dryly. He sat in a chair, his
wide bulk crowding it; and a settled worry camped on his face.
"There's no big rush about doin' something we'll have to do sooner
or later. I want to know what St. Cloud's intentions are."</p>

<p>"Ain't they plain by now?" queried Townsite. "He tacked those
warnings all over the valley."</p>

<p>"Why?" persisted LeBoeuf, whose mind kept worrying at the
problem.</p>

<p>Dan Bellew lay propped half upright in his bed. He mended the
burst seams of a cigar, he lit it; he smiled faintly at Nan, poised
in the doorway. Then the small show of humor faded, and he turned
to LeBoeuf. "Testing out his luck."</p>

<p>"It's holding good," said LeBoeuf grimly. "The Mormons moved out
this morning. They passed me as I was on my way here. Leavin' the
country."</p>

<p>"What?" grunted Jubilee. "They won't scrap?"</p>

<p>LeBoeuf had a more discriminating view: "Why should they scrap
over something which don't concern them very much? It ain't their
land&mdash;it is ours."</p>

<p>"They live on it," pointed out Link Medders.</p>

<p>"Plenty more land to live on," stated LeBoeuf. "When a man's got
a wife and a herd of kids to consider, he ain't so eager to buck up
against bullets." He turned his heavy head toward Gabe Trono, who
stood in the background. "Never gave you no reasons, uh?"</p>

<p>"Clubfoot said St. Cloud was running all nesters out. That was
the story."</p>

<p>"It ain't the answer by a long jump and run," meditated LeBoeuf.
"And he never gave you a chance to get your belongin's?"</p>

<p>"No. He burnt us out complete."</p>

<p>"There's the size and substance of St. Cloud for you," LeBoeuf
drawled.</p>

<p>"Was there any previous doubt?" asked Townsite gently.</p>

<p>Bellew shifted in the bed. "Trono, the sensible thing for you to
do is obey St. Cloud's order. No use for you to throw in with us.
Next time any St. Cloud man caught you he'd kill you. I've got a
quarter-section south of town you can move on."</p>

<p>Trono's sun-baked cheeks settled to a greater stolidness. "I
can't do that, Dan. He burned me out. Everybody knows I'm a
peaceable fellow. Never raised my hand against nobody. But I can't
swallow this. No, sir, I can't."</p>

<p>"Somebody's going to get hurt," said Dan quietly,</p>

<p>"That's all riglit."</p>

<p>A considering silence fell over them all. Faint currents of air
entered the room and disturbed the heavy tobacco smoke. Nan
withdrew, her light steps tapping across the barren floor. At the
sound Dan's eyes lifted and followed the girl's sure slender body
as far as the kitchen. He didn't realize it, but that slight shift
of interest was observed and understood by every other man in the
room. They were watching him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gunderson, "the man's powerfully recruited. We'd
better brace him now before he gets any more help."</p>

<p>"The truth is," reflected Dan, "he's scarin' the nesters away to
cut that much support from under us."</p>

<p>"Look here," proposed Gunderson, impatient to arrive at
something definite. "Why don't we go up to Smoky Draw tomorrow
night and burn it out?"</p>

<p>"Too obvious," said Dan. "St. Cloud would expect us to do some
such thing. Anyhow, I'm in this deal, and I can't ride for a few
days."</p>

<p>"In that connection," said LeBoeuf, "when are you going to
increase your crew? You're more exposed than any of us."</p>

<p>"Well," broke in Gunderson, "is it to be some more waiting and
watching?"</p>

<p>"Just that," said Dan. "The worst thing we could do would be to
try and outguess St. Cloud. Let him make all his false starts and
fake moves. When he tires of feinting and comes for the
showdown&mdash;then we act. Not before. We'll have to strengthen
our patrols. My men will scout as far as the Pinnacle. You boys
send your patrols to that point. In case of trouble, get a rider on
the road."</p>

<p>Gunderson was dissatisfied and said so. But LeBoeuf, the older
and steadier man, nodded his head in agreement. He rose, which was
the end of the parley. Presently they all filed out of the bedroom;
but after they had gone, Dan called Jubilee back.</p>

<p>"Go to Trail and get as many good men as you can find. I leave
it to your judgment, but I would like Peach Murtagh and Joe Gatch
if you can locate them. Do it quietly, and warn them to say
nothing. Don't bring them with you. Each man is to drift here after
dark."</p>

<p>"The same as done," said Jubilee, turning out. He narrowly
avoided colliding with Nan, at that moment entering with a tray,
and afterwards he flashed a brief, amused glance at Bellew and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Nan put the tray across Dan's lap, punched an extra pillow at
his back, and sat on the edge of the bed, watching him. It was a
little difficult for him to eat, and this unaccustomed handicap of
movement always roused a slight sense of rebellion. Seeing that
rise now, a glow of amusement touched her eyes.</p>

<p>"Humbleness, Dan, is always the hardest virtue to acquire."</p>

<p>"Are you laughing at me?"</p>

<p>"No. Preaching at you. You can't help yourself. You hate to be
confined like this. It just outrages your sense of
self-sufficiency."</p>

<p>"Wisdom in that. All I can do is lie here and think. I don't
like it. I'm not a thinking man."</p>

<p>"So there have been no compensations?"</p>

<p>"You're here."</p>

<p>Nan colored a little. "I wasn't fishing for compliments."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a compliment. It was a statement of fact. Why have
you gone to all this trouble of waiting on me?"</p>

<p>"Making amends."</p>

<p>Dan scowled. "If it is just the payment of a debt, consider it
paid. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Now, now," said the girl. "Let's wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lorrie ambled into the room, a little embarrassed at finding the
two adults so engrossed with each other. He said, after a moment's
awkward silence, "Be all right, Dan, if I ride up into the ridge?
Link said I better ask."</p>

<p>"Sorry, old man. All Broken Stirrup hands are confined to
quarters today. We might have company&mdash;and I'd need you."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Lorrie, gravely. "Hadn't thought of that. Gettin'
better?"</p>

<p>"Be in the leather right soon now."</p>

<p>Lorrie's eyes glowed against the absorbed darkness of his face.
He said, "That's mighty fine," and put both hands in his pockets
and started out. He had looked only once directly at Nan, and then
with an air of uncertainty. Nan glanced at Bellew, making an odd
gesture; then she spoke to the boy:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Lorrie, I went over to Smoky Draw. I didn't know
about that place."</p>

<p>Lorrie stared through the doorway. "Sure you didn't," he
answered. "That's all right, ain't it?" Then he added, "Sure,"
indefinitely and went out. Nan sat very still on the bed, a shadow
across her eyes.</p>

<p>"That," mused Dan, "was a wonderful thing for you to do."</p>

<p>"It was an apology."</p>

<p>"He didn't have one coming."</p>

<p>"But I can't let things stand this way, Dan! I don't want him to
feel so foreign toward me!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Dan said firmly, "you have offered the peace
pipe. Don't do it again. It is up to him now."</p>

<p>"If there was anything I could do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't. He's got to learn to be a gentleman sooner or later. Got
to figure out this give-and-take business all by himself. If he
doesn't, he's not the boy I think he is. In any event, you don't
want his affection if it has to be coaxed."</p>

<p>Nan got up, smiling again.</p>

<p>"You're very fair, Mister Bellew."</p>

<p>"Now don't run off and leave me picking at the covers all
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to think out?"</p>

<p>"That's done. I know all the answers."</p>

<p>"To everything?"</p>

<p>"To everything," said Dan and met her eyes directly. "If I'm
wrong about one of those answers, Nan, I'm wiped out."</p>

<p>Nan turned her back to him, glancing into the living room. "I
should hate to see you hurt. Do you know how much I'd hate that? I
know what it is to have the ground simply drop away&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hoofbeats skipped nimbly across the dry, still air.</p>

<p>There was a swift flurry at Broken Stirrup's door, and a girl's
husky voice said: "Stop that, you dumb beast." Dan chuckled at the
sound of those quick and sure steps in the living room. And when
Helen Garcia paused in the doorway, her alert and boyish figure
swaying slightly from inner restlesness, he drawled:</p>

<p>"Buff'lo Bill, howdy."</p>

<p>"Who's this strange man wearing a nightcap in Dan Bellew's bed?"
said Helen.</p>

<p>"Where've you been?" Dan grumbled. "I've missed you."</p>

<p>"You're a poor liar," stated the girl. Her glance met Nan's and
remained engaged for a long sober moment, then whipped back to Dan
with a kind of subdued brightness. Nan said nothing, but slipped
quietly from the room.</p>

<p>"Feeling all right?" asked Helen. She stood in her tracks, slim
hands crossed before her.</p>

<p>"Terrible."</p>

<p>"You won't die," decided Helen. "Just feeling ornery. Don't like
to lie on your back and watch flies crawl across the ceilin', do
you? Good for you, just the same."</p>

<p>"Where's your sympathy?" complained Dan.</p>

<p>Helen's voice sank from the flippant note. "You don't need
mine," she said gently. "Well, I've got news. I spied a column of
St. Cloud's men marching down that same gully under the railroad
bridge last night. Followed 'em too: They faded southeast.
Something over there draws 'em powerful strong."</p>

<p>"So?" muttered Dan, full of interest. Then: "When are you going
to quit that?"</p>

<p>"Told you once I was one of your crew, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Now look here, honey&mdash;"</p>

<p>Helen turned swiftly on her pointed boot heels. "Cut that out,
mister."</p>

<p>"I'd like to give you a wallopin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's the boy," applauded Helen and turned to him, the glimmer
of humor showing through. "Be good&mdash;and don't fuss. See you
sometime. So long."</p>

<p>"What's the rush?" asked Dan.</p>

<p>But Helen had gone from the bedroom. She went rapidly to the
porch. Nan stood there, looking away at the fogged heat of the
afternoon. "Nice of you to leave the room," said the younger girl.
"Always thought you were a good sport. But it wasn't
necessary."</p>

<p>"Helen, do you feel badly toward me?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>But Nan didn't answer the question. It was unnecessary. Its
meaning lay between them plainly. Helen's sharp, mobile face was
for once quietly composed. "No," she said, "of course not. That's
the way things happen. I'll get over it."</p>

<p>"I wish I thought so."</p>

<p>"Believe it," said Helen swiftly. "That's what I'm doing." She
touched Nan with a brief pressure of her fingers, strode down to
the horse, and presently was streaking across the flats in the
direction of Squaw ridge. That strict expression on her dark cheeks
never gave way; but in her eyes was a cloudy, wistful hunger. "He
was the first man ever to show me a kindness. He's been so darned
white&mdash;like a father. That's the trouble&mdash;like a father.
He can't change from feeling like that. So&mdash;I guess I've got
to do the changing."</p>

<p>It was then only one o'clock. She reached the high ground of
Buck ridge near two-thirty and went cantering across that clearing
which had been the scene of Dan Bellew's ambush. Afterwards the
trees absorbed her mysteriously; nor did she appear from them again
until the long and oppressive day had gone dark. Taking station
beside the main trail to town, she sat idle as the night deepened
and the stars broke more brilliantly through the velvet sweep of
sky. The moon, filling from quarter to half, hung low in the south
as if suspended by a giant cord; and all the remote voices of the
hidden creatures began speaking from thicket and cairn. Surrounded
by this mute beauty, this pervasive melancholy, Helen Garcia
scarcely moved through the ensuing half-hour.</p>

<p>"I would have been good for him," she thought sadly. "But so
will Nan be. I wonder if he knows he loves her? Well, it makes no
difference. I've got to see this thing through."</p>

<p>Points of sound broke the silence northward and died out. A
moment later the fast fall of a pony's hoofs strengthened and
neared. Helen straightened and drew a swift breath. She moved a few
yards back on the trail, crossed to a more open area, and reined
around. Afterwards those quick impacts were muffled in some deep
arroyo. Helen said audibly: "I've got to stop him before he gets
deeper in this mess." Then rider and horse came streaking down the
trail.</p>

<p>Helen slid her horse fore and aft into the trail and sharply
challenged.</p>

<p>"Draw up there, Pete."</p>

<p>The rider's form weaved far back. He said, in a brittle, nervous
voice, "Dammit!" The pony beneath him felt the obstruction ahead
and grunted from the quick tensing of his muscles.</p>

<p>"Want to talk with you, Pete."</p>

<p>Pete turned, rode beside her. He was breathing hard, and his
torso kept swaying from side to side. "Don't ever do that again,
Helen! I almost drew on you!"</p>

<p>"You're nervous as a cat. Blame the miserable sort of a life you
lead."</p>

<p>"No preachin'! How did you know that I'd be along this way?"</p>

<p>"You ride it every night. What for, Pete?"</p>

<p>"Don't try to pump me."</p>

<p>"What's down in the south that interests St. Cloud so much?"</p>

<p>The man said anxiously, "What do you know about that?"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Kid," pleaded the man, "keep out of this. You don't understand
what sort of an outfit you're snoopin' at."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do. Listen, St. Cloud's going to break out again,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"You figure it."</p>

<p>"Soon?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. Stop trying to pump me!"</p>

<p>"What's down in the south that he's looking for all the
time?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Then Garcia said reluctantly: "Bad
medicine. Now don't ask me any more."</p>

<p>"You've got to get out before any more damage is done!"</p>

<p>She expected anger, yet this slack brother of hers for once
showed a streak of reason. "I wish I could, kid," he said. "I'm
tellin' you straight&mdash;I made a bad mistake joining that bunch.
It ain't like I thought it was. It's worse. Those fellows don't
give a damn for anything. They're pretty tough, You get it? They'd
even put a bullet in you if they thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then get out of it."</p>

<p>Garcia's answer was foreboding: "Too late. If I tried I'd die.
I'd never ride far enough to get clear of St. Cloud. He's cold as
ice. Yesterday he half killed a man with his bare fists for talkin'
too strong. No, I've got to play this through."</p>

<p>"You know what will happen to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't see any end," muttered Garcia. "Whichever way things
go, I don't see how I'll come out on top. The valley's against me.
St. Cloud doesn't trust me much. I'm walkin' a rope, and one day
it's goin' to bust."</p>

<p>"You poor kid."</p>

<p>"Yeah," grunted Pete, "ain't I? I've learned my lesson, and it
won't do me any good. I'm finished. But you keep out of it. Don't
try to see me any more. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Pete."</p>

<p>But he was flailing down the trail and soon beyond sight and
hearing. Helen sat immobile in the saddle awhile, thoughts burning
into the substance of this affair. "It will be soon," she
reflected, "and it will come from the south. I've got to get Pete
out of it. I've got to."</p>

<p>She turned the pony toward town; the fugitive voices of the
night creatures began softly speaking again after her
departure.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. ST. CLOUD HITS TWICE</h2>

<p>JUBILEE reached Trail around three o'clock of that afternoon and
ran unexpectedly into a visiting St. Cloud party. Sidling into
Townsite Jackson's rack, he got down with a trigger-quick feeling
of personal danger. Four men loitered on the store porch and ceased
to speak as he approached; looking elsewhere along the street,
Jubilee recognized the sign of some sort of an arrangement. Quite a
group stood by the sheriff's office farther down. A pair of hands
strolled heavy-footed along the front of Major Cleary's hotel. A
bunch came along from the railroad station and entered the saloon.
This apparent purposelessness impinged sharply on Jubilee's roused
senses, and so did the lack of other townspeople; Those had
withdrawn, leaving the streets to the St. Cloud outfit. Jubilee
walked around his pony and stepped to the porch with a lazy lift of
his muscles. The four in front of him were motionless&mdash;a
politic immobility as admonitory as the clanging of a brass gong.
One of these men was posted athwart Townsite's door. Jubilee
halted, casually speaking.</p>

<p>"If you ain't rentin' that spot, Sim, move aside."</p>

<p>Sim was built like a pole; his head came down, and one half of a
mirthless mouth pinched in a cigarette while the other half let out
the slipping syllables.</p>

<p>"How's it feel to be plain folks again, Hawk?"</p>

<p>The man, Jubilee saw, was full of liquor. That made it worse.
Jubilee knew the makings of a bad jam lay right here, and his
natural shrewdness warned him to take care. There was no accounting
for the acts of a drunk. He said mildly: "Pretty good, Sim."</p>

<p>"You was a lousy sheriff," said Sim.</p>

<p>"I've heard it said before."</p>

<p>"Our meat-chawin' man is shore full of humbleness today,"
sneered Sim.</p>

<p>"Move aside, Sim."</p>

<p>"Move me aside!"</p>

<p>"I can do that, too," said Jubilee, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>One of the others broke lit abruptly. "Get out of the way,
Sim."</p>

<p>Sim showed surprise. The avid mouth widened and then closed
entirely. He drew himself along the wall, gesturing with an
exaggerated courtesy. Jubilee passed into the semidarkness of the
store, hearing a quick, muted talk spring up behind him. Townsite,
rising from behind a counter, said curtly: "What you doin' here
today?"</p>

<p>"What's all this about?"</p>

<p>Townsite shrugged a shoulder. "I don't know what brought 'em.
But they're mean over something. Now you go back to your horse and
fade."</p>

<p>"To hell with that!"</p>

<p>"They'd like to rip-rap you out on that street. Use a little
judgment."</p>

<p>But the tom-toms were beating up Jubilee's reckless spirits.
"I'm hoistin' no white flag to those monkeys. Townsite, I've got
recruitin' orders."</p>

<p>"About time."</p>

<p>"Seen Murtagh or Gatch lately?"</p>

<p>"Gatch is in the saloon, where he oughtn't to be. Murtagh's out
of town."</p>

<p>"I'll see Gatch."</p>

<p>"Don't go to that saloon, you fool."</p>

<p>Jubilee made a flat, pushing gesture with one hand and walked
into the bright sunlight. The St. Cloud men were gone from the
porch. He saw the Sim fellow at that precise moment shouldering
into the saloon. Jubilee thought, "It's a demonstration that they
own Trail. I'm going to have a sweet time&mdash;-"</p>

<p>He wheeled over the square, intercepting a man just then leaving
the Star stable. "Hello, Cartwright."</p>

<p>Cartwright whipped himself about. Alertness went out of his
eyes, and surprise came in. "What you doin' here. Jubilee?"</p>

<p>"Want a job?"</p>

<p>Cartwright said shrewdly, "Broken Stirrup?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"I'm your cooky. Say, if you want those five lads down at Willow
Springs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good boy. Get 'em. Now don't go out of here like you was on
business. Bring these fellows across the valley after dark. Say
nothing&mdash;say less than that."</p>

<p>"Billy Burt is campin' out on Long Creek."</p>

<p>"Pick him up. Or anybody else you see that's ridden with
Dan."</p>

<p>A brace of St. Cloud partisans swung around a corner and walked
slowly past. Jubilee said rather loudly, "If you see any of that
beef driftin' on Buck ridge pick it up and Dan will pay you." He
went along the walk, proceeded up Railroad Avenue, and breasted the
saloon door. He gave one covert side glance that revealed more of
St. Cloud's party drifting down toward Major Cleary's hotel; and
then he passed in. The left half of his vision embraced Joe Gatch
standing alone at the long bar; the right half stretched to include
the quarrelsome Sim and six others grouped around a rear table. He
knew none of the six; they were strangers to the land, imported on
St. Cloud's order.</p>

<p>He walked toward Gatch, who stood with both arms idle on the
counter and a half-filled glass between them. Joe Gatch's face was
bemused, taciturn. But the glance he flashed on Jubilee had that
same element of relief and surprise the latter had witnessed in
Cartwright the moment before. Gatch's eyes went the other way,
touched the withdrawn barkeep. He said quietly: "You're a fool for
bein' here, Jubilee."</p>

<p>Jubilee held up a finger to the barkeep, got his glass and
poured himself a jot. The barkeep retired again, as if promising no
talk with these two. There was a murmuring among the St. Cloud
hands. Jubilee said in the same monotone: "Where's Peach
Murtagh?"</p>

<p>"I can find him."</p>

<p>"Do that. Bring him to Broken Stirrup tonight. Quietly, my
boy."</p>

<p>"If I ever get out of here," muttered Gatch.</p>

<p>"So," said Jubilee with a stronger emphasis, "if you see any of
that stray beef, tell Dan about it."</p>

<p>Sim broke out of his position at the table and walked rapidly
across the room, bent his body against the door and disappeared;
his passing seemed to be a signal, for the other six faded through
the rear way&mdash;and the saloon was thus left to Jubilee and
Gatch and the barkeep. Gatch drew a deep breath, pushed his whisky
distastefully away. "I was here and they moved in on me. I thought
I was a goner, till you showed up. Watch your step. You're big game
for those mugs. Gasteen's in town."</p>

<p>"Broken Stirrup&mdash;tonight," said Jubilee and walked to the
street. This aimless milling around was familiar to him, being the
time-worn prelude to trouble. Restless anticipation lay in the air,
the sense of a purpose not quite definite. Sim, he saw, had crossed
the square and stood now near his, Hawk's, horse. The rest of the
crowd made a kind of loose skirmish line from Townsite's to
Cleary's hotel. He thought once of crossing the street and skirting
that line, but the suggestion died of its own futility. "This is no
way to play poker," he told himself bitterly. A hard, collected
anger cleared his mind entirely of doubt; his part in this was as
plain as breathing. He understood that with a sudden spectator's
understanding. And then he went directly on to the square.</p>

<p>Out on the near desert the afternoon's train lifted an
undulating "whoa, whoa, whoa" across the crisp stillness. All those
moving men had lifted a fine screen of dust across the square.
Certain things hit him with remarkable clearness&mdash;the shadows
along the east walls. Townsite standing in the store opening,
Cleary's fat body spilling over a hotel porch chair. These were
incidentals, coming unbidden into a scene that narrowed down at
each pace to so many men blocking his path and so many apertures
between them. He thought: "I'll take that nearest opening. If it
closes on me, I'll waste no time arguing&mdash;"</p>

<p>He expected it to close, but it didn't. His shoulder brushed
another shoulder, and he felt the attentive faces wheel around and
watch him turn the rack and step up to Townsite's porch. "What's
the matter with their scheme?" he puzzled. "Something's
wrong&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lank Sim broke that locked stillness With a ripped-out oath.
Sim moved along the rack in angered hurry. He ran up the steps.
"Gasteen wants you in the lock-up, see? If he ain't here to do it,
I'll do it! Come on, now!"</p>

<p>"Hold that," challenged Jubilee.</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<p>"You're a worse fool drunk than sober," grunted Jubilee, caution
frayed thin.</p>

<p>It was flame applied to powder. Sim's gangling arm swept
semicircularly downward, knees and torso springing with the
intensity of his effort. Townsite's chesty roar of warning to the
others on the street rolled over Jubilee with a tidal massiveness,
"Stand still, all you brush poppers!" Jubilee took a catlike step
aside, watching Sim's shoulders rise. He never saw Sim's
gun&mdash;only the upper half of the man reacting to this deadly
play. Down Railroad Avenue came the clanging bell, at the
transcontinental and the quick release of live steam. Jubilee,
finding Sim's face a rigid mummy's mask, let his hammer fall at the
high point of the traveling gun's arc. That beating, barking echo
exploded the tense calm of the street; Sim staggered half around
from the striking force of the .44 slug. His own bullet ripped an
aimless track across Townsite's wall, and he fell off the porch
awkwardly, landing in the powdered dust.</p>

<p>Jubilee stretched his long legs backward, whipped himself inside
of Townsite's doorway, wondering why those other St. Cloud men had
not opened. He saw why a moment later when the metal blue snout of
Townsite's rifle dipped and disappeared. Townsite sidled away from
the doorway. "You didn't materially damage him. Jubilee."</p>

<p>"I can't drop a drunk," growled Jubilee. "Now what've we
got&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trouble!"</p>

<p>The yonder calm was grimly overbearing. Sim's half-wail rode the
stillness. "Somebody come give me a hand. For God's sake&mdash;"
The deep blast of the engine's whistle rattled Townsite's loose
windowpanes; the train moved out, steam snorting from its
cylinders. Poised in-side the doorway, Jubilee saw a small file of
men coming down Railroad Avenue, headed by Ruel Gasteen. Gasteen
rolled forward, his clodhopper's gait swaying the ungainly body
from side to side. He cut across the square, halted; Jubilee made
out the flash of the man's eyes, the formidable stubbornness that
afterwards arrived. Gasteen tilted his head to Townsite's
store.</p>

<p>"Hawk, come out of there."</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied."</p>

<p>"You don't get away with it!"</p>

<p>"Come an' take me," taunted Jubilee. "This is a good place to
make a scrap."</p>

<p>"I'll camp on you till you're starved out! Hear me?"</p>

<p>"Ever hear of anybody starvin' in a grocery store? Mister, I
pick my places."</p>

<p>A cool assured voice said, "Pardon, gentlemen," and a small,
slight-figured man cut deliberately through the St. Cloud ranks and
walked across the square. The act was so indifferent to the
situation that Jubilee marveled, and then placed the fellow as a
pilgrim; no man knowing the country would so place himself between
fire.</p>

<p>"What have we got here?" grumbled Townsite.</p>

<p>"You name it."</p>

<p>The fellow turned into the store and halted. He put down a small
grip, and he surveyed the pair with a mild, shrewd glance.
Momentarily diverted, Jubilee observed that this stranger had a
face that might be misleading; it was a kind of neutral face, very
mannerly, soft and yet definite enough, schooled to a certain
blandness of expression. His clothes were Eastern, tailored to
him.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sakes," protested Townsite, "get out of that
doorway."</p>

<p>The stranger smiled. Some flicker of greater light appeared in
his eyes; and his glance, turning behind to the street and back to
those two obviously beleaguered, was somehow casual and
comprehending. Afterwards he lifted his grip and walked away from
the opening.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, if you have another gun&mdash;"</p>

<p>Townsite only grunted. Jubilee said, "Don't ever sit in a
strange game, Mister."</p>

<p>"The only fun I've ever got out of a rather dull life," said the
man, gently, "is doing just that. I think you can trust me with a
Colt. I carried one in Cuba for two years. There's four ounces of
Spanish lead in one of my flanks right now."</p>

<p>"Hawk," called Gasteen, "you're goin' to the jug. Come outa
there."</p>

<p>Jubilee, who either liked or disliked a man instantly, grinned
at this stranger. The fellow was as softly flexible as an old
glove, but his character somehow bit in. "This don't concern you,"
he said to the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Of course not. But it will when I take a shot at those boys,
won't it? The odds seem a bit uneven right now."</p>

<p>"Hawk," rapped out Gasteen, "you want&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something happened then. Gasteen quit talking abruptly and
wheeled his body defensively. The St. Cloud men broke from a long
motionless rank and spread as if faced by a new opposition. The
steady "clop" of ponies ran off the prairie, down the small ravine,
and into Trail's precincts. A hallo came forward. Gasteen made a
flat, dismissing gesture with his hand&mdash;and the St. Cloud men
gradually faded into shelter. Two riders cantered across Jubilee's
vision&mdash;LeBoeuf and LeBoeuf's riding boss; and then a heavy
column of LeBoeuf hands spread into the square. It looked like the
whole ranch crew. Jubilee walked to the porch.</p>

<p>"Been a little argument, but I guess Gasteen's changed his
mind."</p>

<p>LeBoeuf said slowly: "If he ain't, we'll change it for him."</p>

<p>"There'll be another time;" announced Gasteen stiffly.</p>

<p>"Sure. Always is. Where you goin', Jubilee?"</p>

<p>"Broken Stirrup."</p>

<p>"Come along. Townsite, I'm leaving six of the boys
here&mdash;for your use."</p>

<p>Jubilee turned back, hearing the stranger speak. "You're
Townsite Jackson? I have your letter. My name is James
Scarborough."</p>

<p>Townsite said "I guess you've come a long way to have your ears
chawed off. Jubilee, take this man to Broken Stirrup. He's come to
see Miss Avery."</p>

<p>LeBoeuf escorted Jubilee and Scarborough half across the valley
and then turned off. The two men continued on. Deeply curious,
Jubilee now and then sized up this Scarborough from the corner of
his vision. The fellow rode well enough on the borrowed horse, and
he seemed to be at home in these surroundings, A mile from the
Broken Stirrup ranch, Jubilee was impelled to say: "If you come
here for peace, you sure picked the wrong time."</p>

<p>"Peace? Lord, I wouldn't know what to do with it if I had
it."</p>

<p>"You won't like this country."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. I should like to have been born in it. There
is such a thing as being brought up in the wrong environment. There
is such a thing as being bred to books and business and polite ways
and being utterly ruined thereby. It would have suited me better
never to have seen a school or an office or a drawing room. Square
peg in a round hole. There's thousands like that, Hawk. Here's one
of them."</p>

<p>"With which," thought Jubilee, "we will now gracefully wiggle
out of this rush of words before exposin' a total ignorance. But I
still like him." He led Scarborough straight to Broken Stirrup's
front door and got down, politely waving the stranger ahead of him.
His sharp eyes told him something then. Scarborough's manners went
smoother and more repressed, but there was a quick play of inner
excitement that flickered strongly in the gray eyes. The living
room was empty. Jubilee went on into the bedroom and found Dan
shored up by pillows, irritably awake.</p>

<p>"The gentleman's name is Scarborough. He's come to see Miss
Avery. This is Dan Bellew, of Broken Stirrup, Scarborough. He et
something that put him on his back and made him even more damn
disagreeable than he usually is."</p>

<p>"Jubilee," said Dan, "on your way out, shut the door."</p>

<p>"Without slamming," drawled Jubilee and obeyed.</p>

<p>Dan twisted his body upright, looked at the standing Scarborough
with a long, unsmiling straightness. "You stepped into this,
Scarborough."</p>

<p>Scarborough nodded. He said, gently, "Go ahead."</p>

<p>"Jackson showed me your letter. It was my suggestion that caused
him to answer it and disclose her whereabouts. Whatever harm comes
of it is due to my meddling. That's the first paragraph of the
first part. Now then. Nan Avery came here all cut up over
something. Putting one and one together, which isn't always good
arithmetic, I judged she was running away. After your letter came,
it looked to me as if you might be the man she was running from.
And that is the second paragraph of the first part. The rest is
short and simple. Her business is her business, and I had no right
to interfere. But in the short time she's been here I've seen one
thing pretty clear&mdash;she hasn't been able to shake whatever she
ran from. The only medicine is to bring that past right up to the
present and do something about it. This is why you're here."</p>

<p>Scarborough's face showed a faint humor. His words were slow,
rather wistful: "Mind if I tell you that you have a good head?"</p>

<p>"I hate to see her facin' ghosts," Dan said curtly. "Whatever
your part may be in this, you've no right to be proud of it, and
you ought to do what you can to straighten it out."</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose I came?"</p>

<p>"At first I thought just to follow her," said Bellew. "I think I
had you wrong. You don't look that sort."</p>

<p>"White of you to say so. Now look here. You ought to know the
story&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. It is none of my business."</p>

<p>"You're quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Why should it be?" grunted Bellew.</p>

<p>Scarborough leaned on the end of the bed, lips wryly crooked. He
shook his head. "Give me a little credit for seeing below the
surface, too, Bellew. I think you ought to know. Nan and I belonged
to the same crowd back in Baltimore. Nice people, all of us&mdash;"
Scarborough's inflections were ironic&mdash;"first families, quite
polite and genteel, and pretty dull. Nan's got the spark of life in
her. I have always been a man who wore civilized customs with some
protest. Well, take two mild rebels such as we were. We liked each
other. Always saw the same ridiculousness in certain things and
laughed at them. Everything perfectly proper, you understand. But
the catch was, I happened to be married."</p>

<p>Dan shifted his weight, scowled. "This is not my business," he
repeated.</p>

<p>"My wife instituted a divorce action," went on Scarborough, "and
named Nan as corespondent. The thing was damnable, outrageous. Nan
didn't deserve that. There wasn't the least shadow of anything like
irregular intimacy between us."</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"But my wife had to cook up some grounds for action&mdash;so she
took the one that would hit Nan. I'm not blaming anybody but
myself. I shouldn't have allowed myself to be even civil to
Nan&mdash;not in Baltimore, in that set. Nan had to go through the
trial, listen to the lawyer suggest a lot of dirty things. Maybe
you know what it meant to her." Scarborough's two hands made a
futile motion on the bedframe. "It was the sort of grimness she
always hated. If you'd seen her come off the witness stand..."</p>

<p>"Her friends stuck by her. Why shouldn't they? But she felt it.
I think it came near to breaking her heart. That's why she ran
away. The reason I'm here is, I feel I've pretty well wrecked her
life. I've got to do something about that."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Scarborough shook his head. "I had an idea, but it seems no good
now. Look here, Bellew, I love Nan. She's about the most gallant
lady I've ever seen." Then he added, more quietly, "I came out here
to see if she wouldn't marry me. I can see now that it isn't the
answer."</p>

<p>Bellew said, "Why?" tonelessly.</p>

<p>Scarborough only shook his head. A horse fiddled into the hard
dirt of the yard. Nan's voice, slow and easy, came through the
window: "You made a quick trip of it, Jubilee."</p>

<p>They heard Jubilee say, "Dan would like to see you, ma'm."
Scarborough straightened. His body went around, and he said wryly:
"Well, here's where I take my beating." Nan's fingertips drummed
the panels of the door lightly and then she came in, flushed from
her ride and a pleased tilt to her straight shoulders. She saw Dan
first and started to speak; Scarborough's shift from the wall
brought her eyes over to him.</p>

<p>She said nothing for a long-drawn-out pause; nor did she appear
greatly surprised. It was a different, more subtle reaction. The
fine light faded from her face, and stillness came to it. Bellew,
cheerlessly watching, silently cursed himself for his part in this.
That which had seemed sound reasoning at the time of the letter
looked now like the stumbling, blundering act of a fool. The color
died slowly from her cheeks and left her lips formless against the
white, even teeth.</p>

<p>Scarborough said, without moving: "Sorry, Nan. I had to get this
straight somehow."</p>

<p>Nan's answer was devoid of expression: "Jamie, you seldom do the
wrong thing. But this time you have made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Please go to the living room&mdash;both of you," muttered
Dan.</p>

<p>The door closed against them, and he heard them walk uncertainly
across the room, still held by silence. There was finally one
murmured phrase from Scarborough and after that Nan's voice rose
strongly. Dan lifted his bed-still knees and tried to find some
comfort for his cramped back. It was suddenly dark in the room, a
late twilight fading from the window. The creek water made a
pleasantly fluid sound across the shadows, and he could hear his
crew making a great deal of noise in the kitchen. All this was
apart from him; all this only accented his feeling of being thrown
back on his own resources.</p>

<p>It was not that he regretted this self-dependence. His own
father had taught him to make his own decisions, to shoulder their
consequences; and that discipline was his strength. In Bellew was
an almost selfless modesty; yet he was candid enough to know that
people expected much of him. People placed their faith in him,
often made of him a court of last resort. And so, when he felt the
inevitable discouragements come to him, he had nowhere to turn; he
was&mdash;and the thought was ironic&mdash;supposed to be immune
from doubt. This was the part he had to play.</p>

<p>So it was not the making of decisions that bothered him now;
rather it was the error of that decision which had so touched Nan
Avery. As those voices rose and fell beyond the thin partition, it
became more and more clear to him he had overstepped his judgment.
Perhaps for a man his act might have worked. Men were always better
off when they cleared the back trail, left nothing behind. They
didn't always do it, but it was a freer world for them when they
did. How could he have been stupid enough to think a woman's way
was a man's way? They hadn't the same purposes, the same values.
Women&mdash;and this was a new and nebulous notion to
Dan&mdash;never saw and never wished to see things in straight
black or white. They compromised with the past; they were supple
and wise, knowing that a definite ending was seldom to be had.</p>

<p>"I've blundered it," he told himself bitterly. "What comes now
is my fault."</p>

<p>The yonder talk dropped off. They were coming back. He was
somehow eager to know what the answer was, but when they came in
they were only shadows against the lesser dark of the doorway, and
he had no view of the girl's face.</p>

<p>"Scarborough," he said suddenly, "did you tell her how you got
here?"</p>

<p>Scarborough's answer was on the edge of humor: "I couldn't very
well do that."</p>

<p>"She ought to know," Dan muttered. "Nan, he wrote Townsite,
asking if you were in the country. I saw you making no headway out
there on the ridge&mdash;so I told Townsite, to let Scarborough
know. You can blame me."</p>

<p>Nan's voice was infinitely gentle: "You thought you were helping
me, Dan?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't curiosity."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I shouldn't ever accuse you of that."</p>

<p>"That's all. You set out to whip a peculiar sort of problem. I
didn't think you were doing it. All I could see was to bring the
whole thing to a head, get you started one way or another
again."</p>

<p>"Jamie," said Nan, half under her breath, "there is your
answer." She turned and slipped away. Scarborough cleared his
throat, his outline motionless.</p>

<p>"Light that damned lamp, please," said Bellew.</p>

<p>Scarborough obeyed. His fingers, Bellew noticed, were awkward
with the match, and as the lamp wick took hold and spread out an
even yellow radiance Scarborough's face appeared tired and old;
otherwise, there was no expression on it.</p>

<p>"If it is any of my business," Bellew said irritably, "what did
that mean?"</p>

<p>"The answer is," Scarborough murmured, "I lose."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about this?"</p>

<p>"You don't get this. There's nothing to do, The story's written.
The ending will be a better one than I could furnish." Then
Scarborough said, casually, feelingly: "Thank God."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>Scarborough's glance was momentarily intent, curious. "Let it
ride. Do you mind if I stay on for a few days?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to settle that with Nan."</p>

<p>"She won't mind," said Scarborough; and Bellew again caught that
accent of wistfulness. "I mean nothing to her one way or another.
I'm out of the picture. Her past is out of the picture. It's
gone&mdash;she's laid it aside, and it doesn't hurt her any
more."</p>

<p>"This sudden?"</p>

<p>Scarborough's tired eyes cut across Dan, passed on. "Maybe," he
said, "she's found something."</p>

<p>"What would that be?"</p>

<p>Scarborough was swayed by a momentary irritation. "Don't be so
confounded obtuse!"</p>

<p>Nan came in with Bellew's supper on a tray and laid it across
his lap. Odd quiet settled throughout the room. Jamie Scarborough's
glance followed that little scene between the two with a shadowed
interest. Nan's slender hands moved in front of Dan with a swift
thoughtfulness; her attention crossed to Scarborough, bright and
illuminating. Dan's fork lifted and paused. "Listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>Neither of the others heard. But Dan's peremptory hail beat
across the darkened quarters:</p>

<p>"Jubilee&mdash;come here!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" said the girl.</p>

<p>Jubilee came on the run. He reached the bedroom door, started to
speak; and then the soft depth of the night was disturbed by a
swelling rhythm of sound. Jubilee wheeled, ran toward the kitchen.
Dan laid his fork on the tray. "Please put it on the table." Broken
Stirrup was caught up in quick motion. Doors slammed to the rear.
Shannon's hail sounded, through the yard. "Trono&mdash;you git
inside that stable." Medders and Jubilee were murmuring brief
phrases on the porch.</p>

<p>Scarborough showed a livening interest. "If you have an extra
gun&mdash;"</p>

<p>The far rhythm broke into definite beats and measures. Nan,
watching Bellew's face anxiously, saw it firm up. He said, quietly:
"Thanks, but the gun's no good right now. I think you're about to
see something of interest."</p>

<p>A heavy cavalcade trotted into the packed area. Jubilee's
challenge went bluntly out: "Who's that?" Spurs and bridle chains
jingled, saddle leather squeaked against shifting bodies; the porch
drummed to their advances. A voice said brusquely, "I told you
there was another time comin', Hawk. Rest easy. You're in no
position to do otherwise." Afterwards the living room filled up
with them. Ruel Gasteen bowed his head under the bedroom doorway
and came to a stand.</p>

<p>"Bellew," he said in that falsely even voice, "take this
whichever way suits you&mdash;with protest or without. Makes no
difference to me. I've got nineteen men out there."</p>

<p>"St. Cloud's got tired of waitin', I see."</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>"Let's have it."</p>

<p>Gasteen tapped his coat. "I've got a warrant here for Jubilee.
He's goin' back to the Trail lock-up."</p>

<p>Jubilee shouldered around Gasteen, yellow lamplight cutting
deeper and sharper angles across his cheeks. Lorrie slipped past
both of them and stood at the head of the bed, stiffly defiant. "I
thought so," grunted Jubilee. "Sim Gearin made a pass at me in
town, Dan. I pinked him."</p>

<p>"One excuse or another," muttered Dan.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the answer goin' to be?" challenged Gasteen.</p>

<p>Dan's somber stare burned on Gasteen, turned to Jubilee. They
seemed to say something to each other across that stifled silence;
Jubilee's head fell into a faint nod. "You'd like a play, Gasteen,"
grunted Dan. "But you won't get one. Jubilee will go."</p>

<p>"Where's your high-and-mighty manner now?" taunted Gasteen.</p>

<p>"In due time. That's all?"</p>

<p>"No." A tight smile slid along the sheriff's mouth&mdash;like
the creep of acid across dissolving tissue. "Mrs. Wills has got an
order from the court directin' me to bring Lorrie back to her. He
goes with me now."</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" exclaimed Nan and moved from the wall's
shadow.</p>

<p>Gasteen arched his brows. "Well&mdash;well!"</p>

<p>"Don't let them do it, Dan!"</p>

<p>Lorrie put a hand against Dan's chest. "I ain't goin'."</p>

<p>Dan's quietness grew into a heavy, ponderable thing. His eyes
whipped to Jubilee again. Something in it shook the dangerous
rigidity out of Jubilee, settled him more quietly in his tracks,
Dan put his arm on Lorrie's stiff shoulder.</p>

<p>"Lorrie, when you're a rider the first thing you do is to follow
orders. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right. You go with this man."</p>

<p>"Dan!" breathed the girl.</p>

<p>But Scarborough, standing near, touched her arm. Lorrie's eyes
were on Dan, strangely mature. He said, "Sure," in a muffled tone
and went out into the other room. Dan looked grimly at Gasteen.
"Anything else Neel St. Cloud wants?"</p>

<p>"That'll be all, this time," growled Gasteen. "When you crack
the whip, they jump, don't they?" He stepped aside from the doorway
and watched Jubilee pass through it with a strict alertness. Then
he followed, and his surly order cleared the riders out of the
room. Nan turned, running across that room to the porch. There was,
a fiddling of hoofs, a swift break. Gasteen went off on the dead
run. The after silence was like the emptiness following wind.</p>

<p>Scarborough came toward the bed; his eyes wide and interested.
"Bellew," he said, "they believe in you."</p>

<p>Bellew pushed the covers aside, slid off the edge of the bed. He
stood upright, supporting himself along the wall, swaying a little
from that natural vertigo of the bedfast. "Well, the holiday is
over," he muttered. "Get my pants out of that closet, will you?"
Then he was calling: "Medders&mdash;Shannon&mdash;come in
here!"</p>

<p>Nan stood on the porch and saw them go; saw Lorrie's small body,
straight and somehow pathetically courageous, dim into the night.
And for as long as the sound of that departing group remained in
the evening's air, she stood very silent. Dan's talk crossed the
living room, quite brittle. She heard his temper crowding him, she
heard him moving. The rest of the men were going into the bedroom.
Even Chan came in from the kitchen, his heelless slippers slapping
against the floor.</p>

<p>She said: "Not in that woman's hands&mdash;not in hers." And
then she went quickly down the steps. One of the ranch ponies stood
waiting&mdash;whose, she didn't know. Nevertheless she seized and
threw up the reins and climbed to the saddle, Of one thing she was
very certain: What she meant to do now would never meet with Dan's
approval, and therefore she had to slip away without it. Gently
cruising the length of the poplars, she passed the dim arch of the
gate and drifted three or four hundred yards into the night; after
that she hauled the pony about, pointed to the black outlines of
hills in the northeast, and gave the beast its head.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. CAUGHT</h2>

<p>NAN went rapidly on across the coulees, reached the charred
remains of her shanty, and turned into the pass. Beyond the pass
she caught the scent of disturbed dust, a sign of recent travel;
and a little later; in the deep blackness of the trees, she was
startled by a muted, arriving sound. Instantly pulling off the
road, she heard rather than saw a column run freely by, bound out
from the draw. After that she went on, attained the rim of the
draw, and saw the few lights of this forbidding habitation pierce
the shadows. There she paused, unsure of herself.</p>

<p>The instinctive thought of defending Lorrie lay behind her ride.
Now that she faced St. Cloud's quarters, she was at once challenged
by her common sense. What could she do? If, as she believed, St.
Cloud had pulled Lorrie out of Broken Stirrup to hurt Dan, what
could she say to soften the man's temper? To argue Dan's case was
obviously hopeless. To argue her own meant a complete reversal of
her published attitude toward St. Cloud; and he was too clever a
man to miss the opportunism of that. There remained only the
welfare of Lorrie himself. But she had no faith in the
argument.</p>

<p>"This is&mdash;is monstrous!"</p>

<p>She dreaded going down there. All her perceptions warned her
against the people living along the gulch&mdash;illicit, cruel,
unscrupulous people who would have no compunctions regarding her.
St. Cloud alone had the outward show of a gentleman; but it was a
thin veneer. Behind that flimsy mask was another man, whose
ultimate limits of audacity and primitive desires she could only
guess at. One thing was very certain: when she entered that black
slash in the earth she was entirely at his mercy. Yet with all that
considered&mdash;within the space of a few foreboding
moments&mdash;she knew she had to try. And so she urged the horse
down the twisting trail, reached the bottom of the draw, and faced
the lane leading between the double row of houses.</p>

<p>Here she paused again, struck by a rather curious fact. Smoky
Draw seemed empty&mdash;or nearly so. She made out one man crossing
the far end of the lane, passing from house to house. And after he
disappeared there was no sign of life. Most of the houses were
dark, the lights of the others were dim, suggestive of vacancy. She
was rather careful in checking this thought, watching all those
windows for inner movement. The fellow she had first observed came
out of the lane, went back to his original point, and again
vanished. All this while she had heard no murmur of speech.</p>

<p>The idea that came to her then was wild and improbable. She
didn't believe in it. Nevertheless it governed her subsequent act,
which was to pull her pony back to the farther emptiness of the
gulch, dismount, and run lightly toward St. Cloud's house. She
climbed the porch steps and halted long enough beside the open door
to command a view of a room without occupants; then she stepped in
and aside from the lane of light, the breath in her small and
quick; an instant later she retreated to the doorway and was
prepared, to slip out of it.</p>

<p>Somebody moved across the floor above. A woman's hnskily unkind
voice sounded down the stairs. It was Mrs. Wills's.</p>

<p>"Me, your own mother! Get in that bed and stay there! I know
you'd run out of here if you could. That window is locked, and this
door will be. You've been spoiled. Mind me from now on or I'll give
you a whipping you won't forget in a hurry!"</p>

<p>A door slammed, was audibly locked. Mrs. Wills's feet emerged on
the stairs as Nan slid out to the porch and stood in the
half-shadows. She heard the woman move aimlessly around the room
for a bit. After that another door clicked, and, venturing a
glance, Nan saw that Mrs. Wills had gone back to the rear of the
house. Without considering the next move for what it might do to
her, Nan slipped in, rapidly crossed to the stairs, and went up.
All that second-story hall was dark; and, poised there, she got the
strident echoes of Mrs. Wills now somewhere outside:</p>

<p>"I don't trust him, Harry. Watch that window. The first time I
catch him out of the room . . ."</p>

<p>Across the blackness of the tipper hall lay a pencil streak of
light, seeping through a keyhole. Nan went swiftly to it, dropped
on her knees, breathing: "Lorrie!" A man's voice rolled along the
street: "Well, that's your lookout, not mine." She tapped the door
panel with her fingertips and called again, more urgently. But
there was no answer; unnatural stillness held the room. The light
went out, leaving Nan deeply puzzled, deeply fearing. There was
afterwards a cautious, grating noise, like a knife chewing across
wood.</p>

<p>"Lorrie!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills's rapid steps beat across the lower floor; the stair
steps squeaked. Nan rose and wheeled into the nearest protection
she could find, the open entry of a bedroom across the hall.
Crouched there, she heard Mrs. Wills come up and try the knob of
Lorrie's door. Sudden confusion filled Smoky Draw; echoes fell into
it strongly, and one long hail ran from end to end. Mrs. Wills said
angrily, "You get to bed or I'll come in there with a strap," and
returned to a living room crowded with men. Hearing
them&mdash;hearing St. Cloud's talk ride curtly above all other
speech&mdash;Nan felt oddly shocked and weak. She was trapped.</p>

<p>St. Cloud said, with a cutting civility: "Get some coffee for
us, Mrs. Wills. And stay away from that boy."</p>

<p>"He's my kid, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"You're a long time remembering it," was St. Cloud's
contemptuous observation. "Everybody get out of here but Gasteen
and Clubfoot. But don't go to bed. We'll be riding again."</p>

<p>Nan leaned against the doorframe. A faint cross draft of wind
touched her, and it occurred to her there must be an open window at
the end of the room. But the possibilities of that fact left her
indifferent; for after her first violent sweep of fear she knew
that she could not run. She had not made this trip merely to
retreat in panic; not while Lorrie was a prisoner within the house.
So she stood fast, unable to see a way out, yet absorbed by what
went on below. Boots scuffed across the living room to the porch.
Mrs. Wills spoke angrily and apparently left. There was the clink
of glasses. St. Cloud said:</p>

<p>"So you took Jubilee out of Broken Stirrup and sent him to
jail?"</p>

<p>It was Gasteen who answered, with a queer admixture of
subservience and certainty. Detached as she was from the scene, Nan
got that faint arrogance which could not quite rise completely free
of fear. St. Cloud, she thought, ruled with the whip. He was the
master, compelling obedience.</p>

<p>"Like you told me. Bellew was too wise to fight back. That man
plays his cards well. You'll have to watch out for him."</p>

<p>"You're finally learning that?" grunted St. Cloud, full of
irony. "It is a wonder you didn't lose your head and make a fight
of it there."</p>

<p>"We could of wrecked the place. But you didn't order it
done."</p>

<p>"That's the penalty I take for having a bunch of lunkheads. If I
let you do your own thinking&mdash;you immediately proceed to get
in a jam. So I have to hold all of you to strict chores. And
another opportunity is passed up."</p>

<p>"I don't like to be talked to like that!"</p>

<p>"Shut up. If I had a man, if I had just one man I could depend
on to do the right thing at the right time without a set of
blueprints, I'd feel better about the next forty-eight hours.
Clubfoot, what was south of Trail?"</p>

<p>Clubfoot's voice was flat, without the least modulation of
intelligence. "They're about ten miles below the town. I told 'em
to wait till I got your word."</p>

<p>A short silence followed. Then St. Cloud said quickly, "I guess
we're ready to make the move. We'll never be in better shape. But I
wish the next two days were over."</p>

<p>"What you worryin' about?" demanded Clubfoot. "We can lick the
valley with both hands tied."</p>

<p>"That's fool talk. You've got no more understanding than a jack
rabbit. These people will fight like hell."</p>

<p>"We got more men."</p>

<p>"What kind of men? Border jumpers that love their own skins the
best. If things go good they'll stand the gaff. If things get tough
they'll break. That's the nature of a crook every time."</p>

<p>Gasteen said morosely: "A fine thing to say about your own
crew."</p>

<p>"Well, they'll have to do. I can't put this off. Now listen very
carefully. Take half of the outfit, Clubfoot, and ride down there
south of Trail. Pick up that bunch and bring it into the valley by
way of LeBoeuf's range. You should have all that done no later than
noon tomorrow. I'll be watching from the pass with binoculars. When
I see you I'll start moving. Understand?"</p>

<p>There was apparently a silent assent, for St. Cloud went on: "As
for you; Gasteen, you are to ride to the boys camped on Buck ridge.
Stay there till I send you further word by Pete Garcia."</p>

<p>"What's the play to be?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. Get Garcia for me."</p>

<p>Nan distinguished Clubfoot's uneven walk across the lower room.
Gasteen said uncertainly: "You're splitting the crew into a lot of
pieces, Neel."</p>

<p>"Tactics." More steps sounded in the room. St. Cloud spoke
again: "Ride to Trail, Pete. Locate all the boys hanging around
town and tell them to drift over to the outfit on Buck ridge."</p>

<p>Something happened before St. Cloud had quite finished his
speech. A man came running in. "Say&mdash;we've found a pony down
at the foot of the draw."</p>

<p>Cold reaction stabbed Nan's body: She stiffened beside the wall,
thinking: "I can't stay here."</p>

<p>St. Cloud's challenge was alert and hard. "Branded?"</p>

<p>"Broken Stirrup."</p>

<p>All the men moved below. St. Cloud's call stopped them
summarily: "Here&mdash;here. No Bellew hand would be that kind of a
fool. There's something to this&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nan thought dismally, "It was a mistake to hide." Her mind was
made up; she had but one alternative. Decided on it, she left the
bedroom, hearing Clubfoot explosively speaking. She went along the
hall and reached the stairs; and she felt her knees go weak with
each descending step. It was not until she was halfway down the
lower room and its occupants spread before her&mdash;that she was
discovered. Clubfoot's lowering, primitive cheeks whipped around
and his eyes hit her with something like a physical shock. He
yelled exultantly, "There you are!"</p>

<p>St. Cloud wheeled slowly. His nerves, Nan had sufficient
presence to observe, were not to be reached by such interruptions
as this. His expression remained undisturbed. A lighter, higher
flame quickened his glance, and that was the only shift. Yet this
man was something else than the St. Cloud of a week ago. The queer
chemicals of his body had changed him, even to the outward
featuring. Paused at the bottom of the stairs, and feeling the deep
antagonism of all those glances, she realized the pose of ease and
high, careless humor had gone from him. He was what his own
dangerous acts inevitably made him&mdash;a still, slim-bodied man
with a countenance stained by the somber bitterness of his fertile
brain. Cheek and nose were compressed; the slanting light touched
up the discontent and the rebellion of his character. All this she
saw at a glance, meanwhile feeling weakness pulse through her.</p>

<p>Gasteen started to speak. He said, "Well, we've got&mdash;" and
was checked by St. Cloud's curt gesture. St. Cloud's question was
almost conversational:</p>

<p>"You came on account of the boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why did you hide?"</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"You'd have gotten him away&mdash;that's what you were trying to
do?"</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Nan.</p>

<p>The unrelenting calm of his manner was broken by a flash of
admiration: "You've got spunk. I wish I had more of it on this
ranch."</p>

<p>"Don't let her fool you!" cried Clubfoot. And at that moment
Mrs. Wills came hurriedly in from the rear. She cried out in
strident anger: "What's she doing here? St. Cloud, she's not going
to get the kid back!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Nan asked, all at once filled with energy. "Lorrie
doesn't want you, Mrs. Wills! You have no right to him&mdash;not
even if you are his mother."</p>

<p>"I'd like to slap your face!"</p>

<p>St. Cloud pointed his finger at Mrs. Wills. "Shut up."</p>

<p>The room turned still; the doorway filled with curious, immobile
faces. "Who is it that wants him?" asked St. Cloud. "You or
Bellew?"</p>

<p>"I want him," said Nan. "Mr. St. Cloud&mdash;never mind your
feelings toward Dan Bellew. It is Lorrie I'm thinking of."</p>

<p>"I am thinking of him," St. Cloud drawled. "At the same time I
can't help thinking of you. And since you are so closely associated
with Bellew, I am also thinking of him." His voice carried a thin
cynicism. "Why bother, Miss Avery? If you want a son, there are
other ways of getting one."</p>

<p>Clubfoot tittered. Nan flushed. She divided her glance between
St. Cloud and Mrs. Wills. "Oh, be fair! If it will help any I'll
pay you for the boy. If it is a bargain you want, all right!"</p>

<p>"How much?" demanded Mrs. Wills quickly. But it was not to her
Nan looked for a reaction. It was to St. Cloud; and she thought she
saw sly shrewdness rise into his speculative eyes. Gasteen broke
in:</p>

<p>"Don't let her fool you, Neel. This smells like some of Bellew's
politics."</p>

<p>"How much have you heard?" challenged St. Cloud.</p>

<p>"All that you've said."</p>

<p>"See?" grunted Gasteen.</p>

<p>St. Cloud shrugged his shoulders. "You walked into it, Miss
Avery. I can't let you go back to Broken Stirrup with all this
information in your head. You'll have to stay here till I can
afford to let you go."</p>

<p>"When will that be?" Mrs. Wills rasped, knowingly.</p>

<p>"Will nothing induce you to let Lorrie go?" pleaded Nan.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said St. Cloud. "You were a fool to think you could
get away with it. You've got yourself tangled up in Bellew's
affairs. You should have stayed out of them. Maybe you could pull a
man around your fingers back East. It won't work here."</p>

<p>Nan looked around her, catching the malice in every watching
eye. Nothing in all her experience matched this scene with its
utter lack of sympathy, its crouched cruelty, Of a sudden her fine
courage let go, and she turned swiftly up the stairs, deeply
relieved when she reached the upper landing and got out of
observation. Paused there, she heard St. Cloud say:</p>

<p>"That kid might be a point in this game. Mrs. Wills, you take
him to Trail tomorrow and catch the evening train East." Afterwards
the man's tone quickened, fell ncross the room with a harsh energy:
"Get moving, everybody! This business has got to get done in a
hurry. Garcia, what are you delayin' for? You should have been gone
fifteen minutes ago!"</p>

<p>Pete Garcia set out for Trail, but never reached it that night.
For, somewhere along the heights back of the Gunderson ranch and in
the deeply timbered stretches of the route, his horse galloped
around a bend and met disaster. Pete had no warning of it, could
not set himself against it. There in almost pure darkness the
pony's forefeet charged into a series of ropes arranged across the
trail from tree to tree. The effect of it was to carry the horse
out from under himself; he went instantly down on his neck and
rump, somersaulting, Pete left a saddle that had become a flying
springboard, flailed through the black and landed on his skull
yards away. The momentum of the fall rolled him half again that
distance, brought him up against a log. There was no more motion
left in him then; the light of consciousness died.</p>

<p>A man ran out of the trees and dropped down. Helen Garcia's
strained voice came across the small clearing:</p>

<p>"Is he badly hurt, Tom?"</p>

<p>"No," said the man, after a moment. "He's just out. I figured
the pony would slow down for the bend. It was an easy fall."</p>

<p>"Thank God."</p>

<p>"Now you scatter and leave the rest to me," urged the man. "This
ain't a safe trail. I'll tote this boy back into the hills and
teach him to play cribbage for a couple of weeks. When things blow
over, you let me know."</p>

<p>"He's got to be out of it, Tom."</p>

<p>"He'll be out of it, all right," the man muttered. "Go on, now.
Leave everything to me and don't worry."</p>

<p>Helen's "That's swell of you, Tom," came gently on through the
dark. "Nothing on him that would give us an idea?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' but cigarette papers. St. Cloud wouldn't make that
mistake."</p>

<p>The girl wheeled, reached the trail, and went southward along it
at a reckless, slashing pace. She circled down the slope, came out
to the valley beyond Gunderson's, and was in town shortly before
nine-thirty. Leaving her pony at the stable, she went straight to
the jail. The jailer was Gasteen's man, but he was tractable enough
and let her go to the second-story corridor running between the
jail cells. There was a lantern hanging in front of Jubilee's
cubicle, and when he saw her, dusty, a little pale, and a slight
droop to her firm mouth, he showed a quick irritation.</p>

<p>"You've been told often enough, Helen, to draw out of this."</p>

<p>She glanced along the corridor, said in a half-whisper: "I've
got Pete roped out of trouble."</p>

<p>"Won't you ever be shut of other people's grief?"</p>

<p>"I wish you were free! I dread what might happen if Gasteen went
wild. Or that beast Clubfoot. Don't you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now listen," cut in Jubilee, "don't shoulder my sorrows."</p>

<p>"I'm one of the bunch, Jubilee," said Helen quietly. "What kind
of a person would I be, not to worry about you? I don't see why Dan
doesn't come and knock this darned jail apart."</p>

<p>"Part of the game, kid. Dan figures I'm useful here, so here's
where I stay."</p>

<p>"You," said the girl in the same soft manner, "would do anything
for him."</p>

<p>"So would you."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I guess so. But you're a swell fellow."</p>

<p>"When," asked Jubilee dryly, "did you come to that funny
idea?"</p>

<p>"I've had you wrong for a long while. All I saw was a kind of a
man that didn't care. Would it hurt your feelings if I said you
were like Dan in one thing?&mdash;you've got a lot of sympathy and
patience in you, mister."</p>

<p>"The congregation will now rise and sing number six hundred; Get
on your way."</p>

<p>"Let me stay a little while. You&mdash;you're a comfort."</p>

<p>"So's a hammock."</p>

<p>"Don't be tough. You can't swing it."</p>

<p>Jubilee's long fingers closed around the iron rods. "Kid, I can
stand a lot of things&mdash;but not sisterly kindness from you. You
know how I feel."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't fool you, Jubilee. And I wouldn't fool myself. I'm
kind of honest that way. Maybe&mdash;maybe this isn't so sisterly.
I told you I could grow up, didn't I?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. INVASION</h2>

<p>NAN'S absence was noticed at breakfast time. "She went for a
ride last night," said Shannon concemedly. "I know it, because my
pony was gone. I paid no heed to it, thinkin' she'd turn the brute
into the corral when she come home."</p>

<p>"Her bed ain't been slept in," added Link, from the second
floor.</p>

<p>Dan said: "When did you miss your horse, Mike?"</p>

<p>"Right after Gasteen pulled out."</p>

<p>"Saddle something and see where her tracks go," ordered Dan. He
made a restless turn about the room. "Either she went out for a
little air, or she had something on her mind. She knew it was
dangerous to ride alone&mdash;and she probably would have told me.
Unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jamie Scarborough filled the pause: "Unless it was something she
figured you wouldn't approve of."</p>

<p>"Lorrie," said Dan. "That would be it. It made a pretty deep
dent in her when Gasteen took him."</p>

<p>He shook his head, went in to eat. For a moment he laid the
worry aside and studied the new hands Jubilee had recruited for
him. They had drifted in during the night&mdash;and here they were,
all men he knew very well. Looking along the table, smiling a
little, he said: "Fifteen more homely faces to feed. You'll earn
your grub, but I'm glad to see you."</p>

<p>Peach Murtagh grinned. "We got to eat somewhere, Dan."</p>

<p>"All right, listen to these pearls of wisdom. If I'm not around,
you'll mind Link Medders. If he's not on hand, Jubilee's the man.
Should we be out of sight, you'll take orders from Peach. Think you
can handle these saddle bums, Peach?"</p>

<p>"I can lick any one of 'em."</p>

<p>"Further deponent saith not. What comes will come. You're all
old enough to know what to expect. Now hark to the articles of
indenture, and mark 'em well. No man moves out of this place unless
definitely told to do so. No man lifts a gun except by my order or
example. No man leaves a job I put him on until it is finished or
until his breathin' apparatus ceases to function. I will further
add that since most of you look shy of tallow, don't founder
yourself on Broken Stirrup's canned peaches."</p>

<p>They were through breakfast and in the yard, idly waiting, when
Mike Shannon came back. "No luck," he said, showing worry.
"Gasteen's riders made two trails, one straight to town, the other
to Smoky Draw, She went one of those ways, following the tracks.
There ain't a sign of a single horse elsewhere."</p>

<p>"That means Gasteen took the boy to St. Cloud all
right&mdash;and sent the rest of his party back to Trail. Well,
she's gone to town. Apparently had some scheme."</p>

<p>"Why not after the boy?" queried Scarborough.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't risk getting into St. Cloud's hands again."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure. Nan would do anything she felt she had to
do."</p>

<p>"What's the percentage in her running up against all the odds in
Smoky Draw? No, I think the other bet's the best. Trail."</p>

<p>"You're going?" asked Scarborough. And seeing Dan's nod, he
added, "If I'm not in the way, I'd like to tag along."</p>

<p>"Mike," ordered Dan, "get Scarborough a horse. All right,
everybody rides this morning."</p>

<p>They were soon in the saddle. Shannon presently led out a
stringy little beast with calico eyes and a long neck. He said
casually, "It's the best I could do, Dan," and banded the reins
over to Scarborough. There was then a thoughtful pause. It was one
of those inevitable little scenes not to be denied these people who
loved a good practical joke. Scarborough stood grave, coolly
scanning the semicircle. The point of the thing was, of course,
Jamie Scarborough's glaring contrast to the country. All these men
were weathered to the bronze shades of the land itself, skins a
uniform saddle brown; they were long-membered and heavy-boned, a
kind of Indian calm possessed them. By comparison, Jamie
Scarborough's well-groomed body was strikingly incongruous. In
effect he was a puzzle to be resolved one way or another. Dan
caught a subdued glint of understanding in Scarborough's face, and
he said lazily: "Beware of an Irishman bearing gifts."</p>

<p>Scarborough chuckled, and what followed was no greenhorn trick.
He looped the reins over the pony's head in quick synchronization
with his upward spring to the saddle. The horse settled, snorted
chestily, and made three tentative crowhops across the packed dirt;
and then halted meekly as the reins snapped a disciplinary pressure
along his jaws. There was no more to it than that. Dan's drawl was
a little ironical: "Somebody's sold, but I guess it isn't you
Scarborough."</p>

<p>The cavalcade went beating down the poplar-lined ranch road with
an easy cohesion, into a valley overcast by a cloud-filtered
sunlight the color of burnt amber. The portent of change was in the
air, the thick feel of an atmospheric tensity about to burst. Even
at this hour the heat was a still, surcharged thing that played dry
and electric on the skin. There was no sight of the clear sky; Buck
and Squaw ridges were faint streaks beyond a condensing pall.</p>

<p>"You'll see a violent break of weather before night," Dan said
to Scarborough.</p>

<p>The course was straight southwest for twenty silent minutes; but
at that point Dan swung and made it a southerly ride. Scanning the
horizon for explanation, Scarborough noted a forming ball of dust
in that direction. Bellew spoke again:</p>

<p>"I should warn you. You're building up a mess of trouble by
identifying yourself with me. If I should offer advice, it would be
to get a room at the hotel in Trail and take the part of a
spectator."</p>

<p>"There's some possibility of action?"</p>

<p>"There's a certainty of it, my friend."</p>

<p>"Lovely&mdash;lovely," murmured Scarborough.</p>

<p>"No," countered Bellew with a degree of sharpness, "it
isn't."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wish to be in the way. If I am, say so. But I'd like
to assure you I'm no tourist out for a summer's vacation. I can
pull my weight in this."</p>

<p>"Why should you want to?"</p>

<p>"When I like a man, Bellew, there are no reservations,
equivocations, mental hesitations."</p>

<p>"This isn't your sort of thing."</p>

<p>Scarborough shook his head, quietly indifferent. "My life in the
East is closed out. Whatever happens now is of no consequence at
all. It is of no importance, of course, but I went up San Juan Hill
last year with Teddy. That was my first taste of action. I liked
it. I liked this country. Some men are born into the wrong
environment and never manage to get out of it. I think I may stay
here."</p>

<p>"Without book or bank?"</p>

<p>"Culture and civilized surroundings? Well, I have fed at that
spring. It holds no nourishment. When a man is educated away from
elementals, he grows anemic. The classics won't help you, Bellew,
when you've got to make up your mind to kill or be killed. The
strength to meet that issue comes out of the grass roots."</p>

<p>"Idealization."</p>

<p>"Wait and see how it it works," said Scarborough calmly.</p>

<p>Dan brought the column to a halt. The distant dust fumarole
parted and let a fast-traveling rider through; that rider halted
cautiously a half-mile away, then came on. When he rounded in front
of Dan the whole group saw the steam-wet flanks of his horse.</p>

<p>"Hello, Luke."</p>

<p>The rider stood restfully in his stirrups. "I was bound your
way. LeBoeuf tells me to tell you he's sighted somethin' damned
funny in the south. Big herd pointed this way. We sight couple
thousand critters and about twenty riders. What's it mean we don't
nowise know."</p>

<p>Dan shook his head. "That's an odd one." Then his eyes went into
the far southern strip ridden by pulsing haze. Scarborough, closely
watching, had the illusion of seeing the earth turn to powder
before him. Bellew's hazel glance flickered back to the rider.
"Tell LeBoeuf I'll be in Trail soon. If there's anything new, send
me word. If it looks like I'll need him, I'll call. If he needs me,
tell him not to delay asking."</p>

<p>The rider wheeled, the Broken Stirrup outfit went on at a
quicker pace. "Book or bank wouldn't help you to make a decision
like that," mused Scarborough. "Dammit, man, I'd give away all my
ancestors to have your beginnings. Didn't I say it?&mdash;your
learning comes from the grass roots."</p>

<p>But Bellew's mind was elsewhere. The heat became something
tangible to push through, that brassy pall grew thicker, distorting
the shape of the sun. Sweat seeped beneath Scarborough's hatbrim
and left salt in his mouth. They passed a band of cattle standing
motionless on the short, crisp grass and reached the valley road.
Bellew paralleled it for a hundred yards, glance roving its dusty
surface; afterwards they fell into the gentle draw leading to
Trail, and so reached town.</p>

<p>The street was quite empty of citizens till Townsite Jackson
stepped from the store. Dan, still in the saddle said:</p>

<p>"Any news?"</p>

<p>"Something's happening in the south,"</p>

<p>Dan turned. "Link, take a couple of boys and ride three or four
miles that way to see if you can spot anything. This thing is
coming to a head. Townsite, is Nan Avery here?"</p>

<p>"Why, no."</p>

<p>"You're sure?" Dan said sharply.</p>

<p>"She never showed here."</p>

<p>Bellew's eyes went to Scarborough. "You must be right. She went
to Smoky Draw, willingly or otherwise. Come on."</p>

<p>He was in motion and as far as the sheriff's office before the
rest of the group could follow; Scarborough came along quickly,
breath deepening in him, and he reached the office door in time to
hear Bellew speak to the jailer:</p>

<p>"Sorry, Nick. You lose a guest."</p>

<p>These men, Scarborough thought, had an enormous self-composure.
Good luck or bad didn't shake them out of a consistently level
mood. The jailer got up and reached for his key ring. "I recognize
the odds; Dan," he said and walked up the stairs while the small
room filled with Broken Stirrup hands. Then he came back, the slim,
sorrel-headed Jubilee chuckling behind. That perfect casualness
continued. "No charge for the accommodations, Nick?" asked Jubilee
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I'm not collectin' the bill," was the jailer's pointed answer.
"I just work here."</p>

<p>Jubilee walked to a wall, took down his belt and gun.</p>

<p>The satisfaction with which he strapped the belt around him was
open; nor did Scarborough miss the extra gesture. Jubilee opened
the gun, looked at the shells, replaced it. There was a call from
the street, and Broken Stirrup filed out. Link Medders had
returned. "I saw that herd, all right. It's 'way off west, passin'
into the valley near LeBoeuf's."</p>

<p>"That's our next stop," said Bellew.</p>

<p>Broken Stirrup rose to the saddle again. A lithe, vivid girl
Scarborough hadn't seen before came around a corner quickly,
signaling. Both Bellew and Jubilee rode across the street. Silently
waiting, J amie Scarborough's analytical mind broke up that
three-cornered scene and rearranged it shrewdly. The girl looked at
Bellew, speaking carefully and quickly. She was uncommonly pretty.
Bellew's head nodded once, and afterwards he turned back.
Apparently the scene was over. Yet there was one last act which
would have escaped a less observant person than Jamie Scarborough;
the girl's hand touched Jubilee's arm, and the sudden smile was so
clear, so candid that there could be no mistaking the thought
behind it. Jubilee's slanting grin appeared and disappeared; then
he turned his horse.</p>

<p>Broken Stirrup trotted out of Trail, turned west beneath a
gathering, blackening ceiling of clouds. Jubilee rode beside Dan;
Scarborough fell behind as the pace changed to a steady run and the
murmured talk of the ranks ceased. There was something in the wind.
Bellew's clipped words drifted to the rear: "This is probably it,
Jubilee. He's makin' his bid now."</p>

<p>"What the hell? He ain't got a shred of right."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Who is to enforce the law against him?"</p>

<p>"I know, but there's a limit even he don't dare monkey
with."</p>

<p>"I've told you we're dealing with a man who has a fertile
imagination."</p>

<p>"Look ahead."</p>

<p>They were paralleling low buttes; and now, in the intermediate
distance, a gray, sinuous line broke out of those buttes and
advanced sluggishly into the valley. Dust rolled up like smoke;
riders shot from the line, circling in the foreground. Even
Scarborough knew what it was. All this talk about cattle coming up
from the south now stood materially yonder; a herd was pushing into
the valley. Bellew's "That's it" was very flat. Link Medders,
altogether silent during this ride, abruptly bent down, drew his
rifle out of its boot, and passed it to Scarborough. "Shoulda
oughta hadda short gun on you," he grunted. "But this'll help."</p>

<p>"They spot us," called Jubilee.</p>

<p>The line of cattle passed endlessly out of the hidden ground,
moved farther into the cloudy valley; but the riders of that outfit
were swinging off, making a compact arrangement, All this was now a
matter of a mile. Bellew kept the pace; his body swung in the
saddle.</p>

<p>"Keep your shirts on," he warned the crew.</p>

<p>"Heavy bunch," grunted Medders. "Wise, too. They're comin' this
way so as not to stampede the beef."</p>

<p>Bellew said, "Easy," and slackened the gait, That opposite crowd
made a wider and thinner barrier while one man advanced a little to
the front of it. There was, Scarborough saw, some unwritten
sagebrush tactics involved here; for he was picked up in a like
movement of the Broken Stirrup ranks. They were drifting. The long
Broken Stirrup column described a straggling arc, lost all shape,
and regained it again surprisingly. When the thing was done,
Scarborough found himself in a motionless half-circle, looking
across the yellow earth to a group motionless as statues. The man
in the foreground sat askew, one short leg half thrown across the
saddle, two gleaming eyes staring out of a heavy head. Dull black
hair straggled across his brow, leading Scarborough to reflect he
never had seen features so dully animal, so sullenly sly.</p>

<p>"Clubfoot;" called Bellew, "what've we got here?"</p>

<p>"What's it look like to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't judge you people by looks."</p>

<p>"Well," grunted Clubfoot, "what you see is what you see."</p>

<p>"Bound across the valley for Smoky Draw?"</p>

<p>Clubfoot stared, let the silence remain momentarily. The burning
heat suddenly began to blister Scarborough's skin. When he touched
the metal of the rifle before him it stung his fingers. That
grotesque figure took up the talk with a kind of dogged reluctance.
"We ain't goin' to Smoky Draw. We're spreadin' the beef in the
valley."</p>

<p>"On whose range?" drawled Bellew.</p>

<p>"What difference does that make? Yours or LeBoeuf's or
Gunderson's."</p>

<p>"So that's it?"</p>

<p>"That's it," mocked Clubfoot. He stirred, put his malformed foot
into a shortened stirrup; he flashed a swift glance behind him, as
if reassuring himself of solid support. "I wouldn't try it if I was
you, Bellew. We got enough boys here to catch anything you want to
pitch."</p>

<p>"I notice that," said Bellew. "Twenty-five strangers. By any
chance did you buy this beef? Or did those boys find it?"</p>

<p>Clubfoot's answer was again sardonic: "What difference does that
make?" He caught Bellew's lift of head, and he put in another quick
thought: "Don't expect LeBoeuf to be here in a hurry. He's got lots
to think about at home. So've you." Clubfoot's false grin made a
smear across his lips. "Look up the valley and you'll see some
more."</p>

<p>Scarborough turned, and at that instant he said to himself:
"This St. Cloud is a fellow to watch." Long spires of dust raveled
high in the northern area where lay the pass; cattle were coming
out of there&mdash;another herd entering the valley. His interest
shifted, and he laid his attention on Bellew, who sat erect and
calm in the saddle. He had only a profile view; but that was enough
to give him Bellew's fined-down features. The adjoining Jubilee's
cheeks were awash with violence; and ill-repressed temper formed
yellow points of light in his eyes as he kept them on Bellew. The
grouped Broken Stirrup hands were immobile. "Make up your mind,"
muttered Clubfoot, strain riding his talk. "Take it or leave
it."</p>

<p>Bellew only said, "Come on, boys;" and put his pony half around.
The outfit fed in behind, two and two again, racing away.
Scarborough thought: "That's strategy," and looked around to see
the opposite bunch still rooted. Jubilee's erupting words were
cataclysmically vivid. They rose and they fell like brandished war
clubs. Medder's expression was utterly stolid, as if the man
refused himself the right to think. "A good first sergeant,"
Scarborough observed.</p>

<p>Distances were deceptive. One moment that advancing cloud had
been far off; within a mile it was close at hand, another compact
string of riders suddenly racing on uhead of the cattle. Jubilee
went silent again&mdash;some low word from Dan effecting that
change. If there had been defensiveness and slight uncertainty on
the part of that other lawless bunch, this one showed none of it.
They all streaked forward, gear metal slicing bright blades of
light into the oppressive murk; and their course was head-on. Dan
spoke again:</p>

<p>"Keep cool."</p>

<p>That advancing outfit deployed on the gallop, came against the
Broken Stirrup group in a kind of blanketing movement, and halted
with a suddenness that lifted rapid whorls of dust. One man paced
ahead&mdash;one restless man with features of cameo sharpness.
Everything about him was alert, restless, arrogant.</p>

<p>"This is it, St. Cloud?" called Dan.</p>

<p>"Your answer should be interesting," the restless man said.
There was an outward idleness to him, Scarborough noted; but it was
only a mask covering an inner intensity, a lightning nervous
energy.</p>

<p>"My answer can wait."</p>

<p>"It has before," said St. Cloud cynically.</p>

<p>"It can again. My compliments for a play well worked. You intend
to make us fight for our own range."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't put it that way," St. Cloud drawled. "I'd just say I
am now moving into the valley, lock, stock, and barrel. The
wanderer returns to his first home."</p>

<p>"Of which you don't own a legal inch. It's pretty raw even for
you to try."</p>

<p>"I told you I'd come back."</p>

<p>Bellew bent forward. "Supposing the valley doesn't do anything
in reply? Supposing we sit tight and just wait?"</p>

<p>St. Cloud's manner of negligence left him. His answer was
impatient: "You can't afford to. There's room here for just so much
beef. Mine or yours; but not both."</p>

<p>"Still," pointed out Bellew, "your scheme won't work unless we
get together and hack at you. Maybe we could better afford to sit
by. How long can you support your riders? They're eatin' you up in
pay right now."</p>

<p>"You won't sit by," challenged St. Cloud angrily.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I won't let you, you fool!"</p>

<p>"That's what I was waiting for," said Bellew. "All right,
boys."</p>

<p>Scarborough was caught up in the forward rush. Broken Stirrup
passed across the front of St. Cloud's line, kicked up the yellow
soil. The silent Link Medders reached over and took back the rifle;
Jubilee's talk ceased. The tall ranch trees lifted ahead of them,
and at three o'clock of that insufferable afternoon they were, home
again. Nan had not returned.</p>

<p>Bellew called a council in the living room. Jubilee and Medders
and Peach Murtagh came in. Scarborough offered to leave but was
told to sit still. "There's no question of it now. Miss Avery's at
Smoky Draw. I wanted to pump St. Cloud on that, but felt I'd get
nowhere. There's the chance he's holding her as bait&mdash;figuring
I'll attack that place. If so, he'd of course have a trap set for
me."</p>

<p>"I'll eat turkey," offered Jubilee. "You passed up two fights,
and I thought you did it wrong. But that fellow has deliberately
placed his strength at different points so that the valley can't
make a solid party. What he wants is to tackle us one at a
time."</p>

<p>"You've got it."</p>

<p>"You're goin' to try to get together with Gunderson and LeBoeuf
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. One thing is still unexplained. Presumably
that lower outfit is to cover LeBoeuf. And presumably St. Cloud's
own immediate party is to watch me. Which leaves Gunderson. Who is
covering him? Did you notice that Gasteen wasn't in either
party?"</p>

<p>"Back in Smoky Draw, maybe."</p>

<p>"St. Cloud leans on him too much to leave him there, out of the
play."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Take a man and cross Buck ridge. Scout it for anything you can
find hiding around Gunderson's. You know the hideouts in that
district best."</p>

<p>Jubilee got up. "Be back an hour after dark," he said.</p>

<p>"How about my going with you?" suggested Scarborough.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Jubilee happened to be rolling a cigarette,
and he kept his eyes on it throughout the operation. When he lifted
them they were quietly humorous.</p>

<p>"Come along."</p>

<p>They were soon away. After that the afternoon dragged through
its stifling peak. The crew ate a delayed dinner, sat under the
locusts. Looking down the valley, Bellew watched St. Cloud's
contingent drifting gradually with the cattle, keeping his
attention there all through the remaining light. The man would, he
knew, put himself at the head of the party most likely to be
useful; and if that were so, then those shapes thinning out in
first dusk would soon strike. "For it's me he's after, and it's me
he'll come for. He's got too much fat in the fire to delay. This is
his ace in the hole, and he'll play it without delay. Probably I
can expect the ball to open tonight. Or does he expect me to open
it?"</p>

<p>Dusk fell into dark&mdash;an early, lowering dark. A rider came
down off Squaw ridge and through the back yard, a Leboeuf hand
looking tired. He never got off his horse.</p>

<p>"LeBoeuf says if you've got anything figured, not to count on
him now. It looks like he's goin' to have a fight on his hands
tonight. He can't risk movin' out."</p>

<p>"So that end of the sack is puckered up," decided Bellew. "All
right. Tell him to play it that way. We'll make out here."
Afterwards he called into the shadows: "Everybody ride."</p>

<p>It was then nine o'clock, and Jubilee had not returned with
Scarborough. Bellew warned Chan: "If you hear anything coming, get
back into the canyon and stay there. Take Trono's family with you."
Then he led the outfit down the poplars and into the open. The moon
was an exact half-circle and very dim; a congested fog shifted with
the dark, thickening the shadows. Nothing stood in silhouette;
nothing suggested yonder movement. For a little while he idled
straight eastward across toward Buck ridge, tentatively expecting
to intercept Jubilee. Yet after half an hour of this he
straightened around to the southwest and quickened the pace.</p>

<p>"We'll try for Gunderson's," he told Medders.</p>

<p>Hard on the heels of his statement one lone report rolled
faintly across the night and seemed to die at their feet. Halted
and acutely listening, Bellew at last heard the echoes crackling
again, more and more frequent. Somewhere down the valley,
apparently originating from Gunderson's, a steady fire opened and
was maintained. The column came up around him, waiting. Bellew's
mind closed suddenly down. "St. Cloud has got Gunderson blocked
off, too. If his men are spread out that thin, he can't have
anybody left in Smoky Draw. I don't give a damn where he hits. I
know where I'm going to hit."</p>

<p>Wheeling through the dark, he settled into a fast gallop, bound
for Smoky Draw. Behind, the firing seemed to increase. A heavy drop
of rain spat against his hatbrim.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>17. THE FLAME SIGNAL</h2>

<p>THE smell of the ridge was overpoweringly aromatic; resinous
scent of pine blended heavily with the pungent, suddenly dampened
dust. Water sluiced off bent boughs, and the rising wind shook flat
sheets of it into Scarborough's face, thoroughly soaking him. All
in the space of a half-hour this had happened, filling the parched
and oppressive air with the gusty makings of storm; he had the
illusion of a thirsty earth swelling. Meanwhile he tailed patiently
and silently after Jubilee Hawk, quite lost in a world without
order. The trail bent interminably across arroyo and flat,
insinuated itself into blacker depths. Through the trees all things
were formless, and in the occasional open area a few blurred
outlines lent a ghostly impression. He lost the sense of time
completely.</p>

<p>Jubilee's subdued murmur fell back: "Always like this. Never no
sufficiency of anything. Either she burns or she floods. It's goin'
to be one hell of a night." Afterwards the man's shadow vanished.
Scarborough gave his pony free rein and drifted around a tricky
turn to collide with Jubilee, halted on the margin of another open
space. Jubilee said: "Know where you are?"</p>

<p>"Not the faintest idea."</p>

<p>"On the heights back of Buck ridge&mdash;one mile from
Gunderson's. Wait here."</p>

<p>Jubilee's horse remained; Jubilee's body slid on, leaving no
wake of sound. Scarborough was strangely stirred by the sudden feel
of isolation, and his introspective mind played with the thought of
having intruded upon a wilder world whose inhabitants resented him.
Below the rush and slap of the wind the voice of the night
creatures came strongly. The deep brush churned out echoes that
were like water falling off the heights, Jubilee returned, spoke
before Scarborough could register the man's presence: "Follow
close." They turned off the trail, ponies' shod hoofs clacking
briskly against rougher surfaces. They rose steadily, stopped
again. Jubilee said:</p>

<p>"Smell anything?"</p>

<p>"Pines&mdash;some sage&mdash;wet ground."</p>

<p>"That's all?"</p>

<p>"Horses."</p>

<p>"No smoke?"</p>

<p>Scarborough keened the air again. "I get that. Pretty
faint."</p>

<p>"Good boy! Wait." Jubilee was gone once more, but this time for
only a small interval. When he returned he was breathing harder,
and his shadow made restless motions from side to side. He talked
in quick, suppressed phrases: "Dan was right. They're just beyond,
in a canyon. A small fire bumin' under a ledge."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Put here to pull something on Gunderson. We stumbled onto
'em&mdash;that's luck. Now we got to do some figurin', old
boy."</p>

<p>"You're sure it wouldn't be Gunderson's men hiding down
there?"</p>

<p>"What for? If he meant to make a play, it would be out on the
prairie. The point is, he's got to be warned. But we can't afford
to go tell him and risk losin' touch of these fellows, You got any
answers?"</p>

<p>"It's your party."</p>

<p>"And a damn wet one," said Jubilee. A coyote's dismal yammer
fled before the filling wind. "You're up to your neck in
something," muttered Jubilee.</p>

<p>"If I didn't like it I'd say so."</p>

<p>"Good boy! Pull your rifle from the boot. Leave the horse as
is."</p>

<p>Scarborough obeyed. Jubilee's added explanation was very terse:
"We settle down on the edge of that canyon and we get busy. When
Gunderson hears the racket he'll know somebody's on his back
doorstep. It may be fun, mister, Or it may not be."</p>

<p>Scarborough followed Jubilee's bobbing shadow up a quicker
slope, along a slight barrier of broken rock, and out to a kind of
shelf. Jubilee went to his stomach, sibilantly cursing the water.
Following suit, Scarborough saw the vague slash of the canyon
directly below. He was, he discovered, posted on the extreme edge
of a wall that went at least sixty feet straight down. The fire he
saw instantly&mdash;a thin and whipping blaze sheltered by an
overhang of the canyon wall. He could make out no figures around
it, beyond the radius of firelight lay a solid blackness. Jubilee's
talk was almost conversation: "Aim at the fire. Don't
hurry&mdash;we'll be here for a while."</p>

<p>His bolt clicked and made a clean, hungry echo against the
throaty rumor of the storm. Scarborough, feeling an odd calm go
through him, waited for the shot; but the sound of it was greater
than he expected and seemed to tear a hole through the night,
echoes bounding away before the wind. One red eye of flame leaped
from the body of the fire and fell aside. He saw movement then. A
faintly visible body circled that lower light. His downtrained gun
tried to follow. After his shot, the mushrooming points of a
replying fusillade spotted the dark depths. There was no question
of the number involved after that; the volleyed echoes raced away,
down the slopes of the ridge.</p>

<p>Dan crouched on the higher edge of Smoky Draw and looked into a
street apparently empty. One light showed out of the end
house&mdash;St. Cloud's house; otherwise the long row of buildings
huddled darkly beneath the beating rain. Link Medders crawled from
the thick brush and slapped his wet chest. "Went all along the back
of the buildin's. Didn't see nothin'&mdash;didn't hear nothin'."
The rising wind began to pound at the trees, began to boil through
the draw. Curdled blackness lay all around.</p>

<p>"They'd be mighty still," said Dan.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt we'll run into somebody."</p>

<p>"That light is a snare and a delusion. We'll leave it strictly
alone. What we're going to do is start at this end of the street
and walk along the edge of the walls&mdash;on the east side. Get up
closer to me." His voice had risen against the boiling accents of
the storm; and he stopped speaking until all the hands had made a
small circle about him. "They can't see into this any better than
we can. If it's a big party here, I'm guessin' poor. Link leads
off. Everybody else follow him. Straight down, toward the big
house. Flat against the walls. Don't get exposed in front of any
doors or windows. I am going across to the opposite side and fire a
shot somewhere near the mouth of the canyon. That ought to draw
something. If it does, you'll locate the source."</p>

<p>Link said, "This gettin' separated is dubious," but Bellew was
moving away then. He put one quick reminder across his shoulder,
into the teeth of the wind: "Trono stays back to hold the horses."
The group, when he turned ten yards away to look, was somewhere
behind a screen of darkness that seemed to thicken and thin with
each fresh assault of driven air. He went down the incline rapidly.
He crossed the level bottom, got against the far slope. But instead
of pursuing his way to the rim of the draw, he swung and walked
along that narrow way existing between the canyon wall and the back
ends of the buildings. He had no particular need, he saw, to be
careful, for the rain drummed heavily on the roofs, and the sound
rushing through the draw was like the dashing of a wild current. At
each corridor between buildings he paused, saw nothing. Five full
minutes later he had reached the foot of the draw&mdash;where the
main road came down&mdash;without locating the least sign of
defense. The thought of elapsing time troubled him, knowing as he
did that it was quite likely St. Cloud might attack Broken Stirrup,
find it empty, and come back to the hills. Lifting his gun, he let
the hammer fall on one shot; that shot whipped into the high air
and fled away in raveling echoes.</p>

<p>There was no immediate answer; nor did Bellew wait for one. The
sense of needed haste pushed him across the street to the side of
St. Cloud's house. Pulling himself to a window, he looked in once
and ducked back from the lane of light shining out. In so far as he
had been able to see, nobody held the lower room; and with this
judgment he hurried to the rear of the place, came to the door
there and shoved it in front of him. As he did so a cross current
reached the lamp standing on the table and snuffed out the flame.
Darkness seized the room.</p>

<p>Bellew stepped in, closed the door, and shifted aside, shoulder
blades to the wall. All the outside rumors filled the house,
upstairs and down, with uneasy echoes that blurred his focused
attention. Yet the air of emptiness possessed the place. He felt
it, he grew sure of it; and acting on that impression, he moved
toward the lamp and reached for a match. The porch boards squeaked.
The front door came open, slammed against the inner wall. He said,
"Medders," sharply and stood still until his foreman's voice, very
calm, came back: "Listen, Dan, I think this joint's deserted."</p>

<p>"So do I." His match touched the lamp wick, the yellow light
made fan-shaped shafts across the room. Medders came in with an
alert side twist of his body, followed by a part of the crew. He
had no need to indicate what should be done. Medders was across the
room instantly, opening that inner door leading to the kitchen; the
others blocked off the front and rear silently. Dan went up the
stairs three at a time, wheeled into a bedroom. He tried another
match, Whipped it out; and then Medders came on up, bearing the
lamp. It was only a moment's exploration that netted nothing but
the sure fact of this house's utter vacancy. In one room he saw a
lot of women's clothes thrown carelessly on the bed.</p>

<p>"I sent the men back to try all the houses," grunted Medders.
"But we'll find nothin'. Minute I hit this street I knew we'd have
no party."</p>

<p>They went down to the living room and waited while the hands
drifted in from the search. Dan looked at his watch, stared over at
Medders. Medders said casually: "God bless this rain, Dan. We can
do what we wouldn't otherwise dare to do."</p>

<p>"She must have been here earlier. There were just two places she
would have gone, here or Trail. She didn't go to Trail. Therefore
we've got to figure that either she started for Trail and was
caught or came here and was caught. Only one answer. St. Cloud's
got her hidden."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Medders. "He moved her and Lorrie out of your
reach."</p>

<p>Dan shook his head. "We're wasting time, Well, St. Cloud will
never come back to the draw." Walking to a corner of the room, he
dropped the lamp. The flame went purple and then flashed
brilliantly into the spilling oil. All the men stood there soberly
for a little while watching the flame catch hold of the wallpaper.
Dan ripped down a curtain, laid it on the spreading fire; he
capsized a chair atop it and afterwards stepped back.</p>

<p>Medders spoke. "These houses will burn like powder, but the
timber's too wet to catch. God bless the rain." And, watching the
cloud gather across Bellew's hazel eyes, he added quietly: "Don't
worry. The man's too busy to do any harm."</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here."</p>

<p>They went to the porch, and Medders sent a man back for the
horses. A little later they had to move into the street, pushed out
by the quickening heat of the fire. Medders slipped quietly away
and didn't reappear until the horses came down; then they all filed
out of the draw. Paused a moment on the rim, Dan watched long
fingers of flame lick through St. Cloud's doorway.</p>

<p>"I built little bonfires in some of the other joints," said
Medders. "Just to be sure."</p>

<p>"Wherever he is," grunted Bellew, "he'll soon see the signal
risin' out of the hills. We're coming toward the end of this
business, Link, but I don't see any certain conclusions."</p>

<p>They filed into the black stretch through the timber,
overwhelmed by the slash and crack of the heavy branches above. A
fine spray of pine needles fell down, sharply stinging the flesh.
Medders came abreast Bellew. "It's likely he'll do the same to
Broken Stirrup. You'd thought about that, Dan?"</p>

<p>"It's part of the risk. I came to Smoky Draw to ruin whatever
outfit he'd left there, and to get that girl out of trouble.
Neither's happened. Now we've got to look another place. We're
dealing with a man we can't depend on to do the usual thing."</p>

<p>"Where next?"</p>

<p>"Gunderson's."</p>

<p>"Eighteen men ain't much should we meet that yellow-haired devil
out there."</p>

<p>"It will do."</p>

<p>"Which I was about to add," put in Link. "No, by Jupiter, he
ain't touched Broken Stirrup!"</p>

<p>The cavalcade same into the pass and went through. All the
valley lay dark, and no streak of flame broke the western edge
where Bellew's ranch stood. They passed the site of Nan's former
cabin ran down the easing grade by Mitchell's, and straightened
into the flat road, bound for Gunderson's. Dan let his pony go,
more and more obsessed by unexpected disaster in the offing. He
said something of that to Medders, shouting it through the bite of
the heavy rain: "He refused to do what we thought he might do. The
man's got a mind like a razor!"</p>

<p>Something else was alive in his head, displacing all other
considerations. This thing had gone on through three years, growing
unenduringly bitter; spreading fear over the valley, touching
everybody with that premonition of a reckoning one day to come. The
day was here. No doubt of that now. And the reckoning lay somewhere
on the flats in the dark of this tempestuous night. The burning of
Smoky Draw was only a gesture, a minor act, in the struggle between
himself and St. Cloud. Whatever else was clouded and uncertain, one
thing was as inevitable as the rising and the setting of the sun:
nothing would be final, and no answer would rise out of this play
now going into its bloody, bitter stage until he and St. Cloud met
face to face and one of them died. Let Smoky Draw burn, let all the
man's crew desert him, St. Cloud was not to be beaten until a
bullet got him. That, Bellew told himself as he breasted the thick
and driving substance of the night, was the murderous issue of this
fight. That was it&mdash;the two of them facing each other down the
length of their gun barrels.</p>

<p>Medders said: "I pick up the shooting."</p>

<p>Attenuated echoes whipped past with a javelin
thinness&mdash;many reports that lifted and fell, sometimes spaced,
sometimes crowded in sudden, snarled bursts. Beyond doubt the fight
was heavy and drawn out&mdash;and at Gunderson's ranch. Dan played
his pony for the last measure of speed, bothered by the tricky
visions of the night. Barriers of cloud seemed to float across the
road and pass away, leaving definite shadows due ahead; and then
they plunged into a pocket of darkness. A moment afterwards he knew
something lay off there, barring the route. Those outlines came up
so swiftly that he had to wrench his horse out of the steady run
and veer aside.</p>

<p>"Cattle!" yelled Medders. "What in hell they doin'
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>The beef was moving toward them in a collected mass, drifting
with the wind. Dan turned, skirted an almost solid edge of stock.
That pressure stopped the cattle, pushed them slowly back. Dan
called out: "We'll go around this bunch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" yelled Medders. "Wait!"</p>

<p>Dan reared up in the saddle, hearing the abrupt beginning of a
new sound on the right, out toward the open valley. It was too
unmistakable to be missed; one moment there had been no such rumor,
the next moment a collecting, rushing noise drove at him. A great
cry sailed forward:</p>

<p>"Straight ahead&mdash;that's them!"</p>

<p>"St. Cloud!" yelled Medders.</p>

<p>Dan halted. "Hold it!" he cried and knew then he was in a fight.
A long, ragged line broke through the darkness&mdash;wide enough to
smother his own party completely and wide enough to tell him he was
definitely outnumbered. This was St. Cloud's long-delayed and
long-maneuvered play.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>18. A MATTER OF VIEWPOINT</h2>

<p>THE room to which Nan went after the scene with St. Cloud was
the same one in which she had hidden; and such was her fear of the
man that she ranged from one dark wall to the other, expecting
anything, expecting everything. Perhaps five minutes afterwards
Mrs. Wills came up, drew the door shut and locked it, her acid
voice coming through the panels. "You fool&mdash;you crazy fool!"
Nan, at once very weary, sank full length on the bed.</p>

<p>It was low ebb for her. She had been, she realized, mistaken:
Not so much in making the trip&mdash;for she might have been
successful in it&mdash;but in going away from Broken Stirrup
without leaving an explanatory note. What hurt most was that
another burden had been placed on Dan's broad shoulders. So
thinking, she turned and tossed on the bed, believing she would
never sleep, determined not to sleep. Yet sleep came; and when she
woke, stiff and cold, a sultry daylight was shining through her
window and the door was open.</p>

<p>She went into the hall, conscious of an outer quietness. Nothing
moved along the street, and the house itself carried only a faint
sound of activity. She descended the stairs reluctantly and found
Mrs. Wills rocking in a chair, Mrs. Wills's eyes filled with the
old hardness; lines sprang around her petulant mouth.</p>

<p>"You can go to the kitchen and wash. There'll be some breakfast
for you on the table."</p>

<p>Nan went on through the long dining room and into the kitchen,
meeting the curious inspection of the cook. She felt a little
ridiculous before him as she scrubbed off the dust of last night's
trip, and was glad to finish and go back to the dining room where
her meal had been placed. This one mark of consideration seemed
odd&mdash;the more so when Mrs. Wills came in and stood without
speech at the far corner. It was a grudging gesture, and Nan had
the notion that this meal might not have been kept for her unless
St. Cloud had ordered it so. She ate little, soon walked out to the
porch. It was around ten, the air heavy and oppressive, the sun
obscured by a thickening haze. A few men sat in front of a barn
toward the head of the canyon, a few horses were tied at a rack, a
dog skulked across the deep yellow dust. She could not conceive of
a more dismal habitation for people; this little canyon was a
dreary pocket gouged out of the surrounding hills, made the more
unbeautiful by the flimsy houses strung along it. Turning
impatiently back, she discovered Mrs. Wills standing in an attitude
of watchfulness, crouched unfriendliness mirrored in the slattern
eyes.</p>

<p>"What am I supposed to do?" asked Nan.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where is Lorrie?"</p>

<p>"Where you won't see him," snapped Mrs. Wills. "You've got nerve
interfering with my child."</p>

<p>"It is an unpleasant thought&mdash;that he is your child."</p>

<p>"Yes?" exclaimed the woman. "Well, wait awhile and you'll make a
few mistakes in life, too. If you ain't made some already."</p>

<p>Nan shrugged her shoulders. "I don't want to fight with you.
I'll apologize for the remark. Would money interest you at
all?"</p>

<p>She noticed, as before, cupidity appear in the woman's face at
the mention of money. Mrs. Wills straightened, and one hand played
across the frowsy yellow hair. Then the manner was replaced by
morose resignation. "Don't talk about it. St. Cloud would kill
me."</p>

<p>"I thought you said he was your boy?" challenged Nan.</p>

<p>"You don't know St. Cloud."</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"Then you shouldn't have to ask such a question."</p>

<p>"What is he going to do?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills showed her contempt. "How do you suppose I know? But
if I'm any judge of the man, he's trying to find out if Dan Bellew
is going to come after you tonight."</p>

<p>"Dan&mdash;" began the girl and severely checked herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills, alert again, said, "What's that?" But Nan shook her
head. She had made many mistakes; she would not make this one. To
conceal what that hard-eyed woman might read, she walked to the
bookcase and opened it. The volumes were all old, catholic of
content. A history of the Jews rubbed shoulders with a life of
Senator Benton; somebody had shown a taste for reading, but it was
not Neel St. Cloud. For as she idly lifted the books she saw the
dust caked on the page tops. This little library was another outer
surface of the man&mdash;plausible but meaningless. What he really
was lay behind all the show of manners; a man unscrupulous,
overleaping, treacherous.</p>

<p>She thought of that again when, beyond four o'clock of a day
that dragged across her nerves almost unbearably, St. Cloud rode
into the draw with a long file of riders behind him and came to the
house.</p>

<p>He had no immediate word for her, his former gallantry was
thrown aside. He spoke to one of the men in an edged manner somehow
quite savage. Strain drew the smooth face into thin lines, made it
openly malicious and bitter. His eyes, red with sun and dust,
burned a path around the room and halted on Mrs. Wills.</p>

<p>"Get your things together. Get the kid."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Do what I tell you!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills went up the stairs quickly, saying no more. Nan came
toward St. Cloud, full of fear. "Please let me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had the air of seeing her for the first time; and that air
was unforbearing and arrogant. "The information will do you no
good&mdash;and Bellew no good. When the big man of the valley comes
dusting up here tonight to get you, he won't find Lorrie. He'll
find you, but not the kid. The kid is going out of the country on
the night train east. I'd put you in hiding, too, except that
you're bait to draw the sucker."</p>

<p>"How," said Nan quietly, "do you know he's coming here
tonight?"</p>

<p>St. Cloud's eyes were alive with grim interest. "What makes you
think he won't come?"</p>

<p>She said nothing, and St. Cloud, coolly measuring her, finally
said: "You women are all alike, trying to play a high game. A
little of this and a little of that&mdash;a little of anything it
takes to win your point. Let me tell you something you won't like:
There is no woman born that hasn't got her price. Every last one of
you is crooked somewhere."</p>

<p>"That's the kind of women you know," murmured Nan.</p>

<p>"An outcast has no chance to know another kind," muttered St.
Cloud. "If there is another kind, which I don't believe. Women are
the same as men. No man is any better than he ought to be. Even
your beloved Bellew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is big enough to whip you!" cried Nan. "You're rotten!"</p>

<p>"Soon know about that," St. Cloud snapped. He turned on Mrs.
Wills, who came down the stairs with no other luggage than a bundle
wrapped in paper; and he walked to the porch with her and spoke
some swift word that seemed to find a sensitive point in the woman.
She looked up and said, "Neel," in a begging voice. His answer was
to push her to the steps. Nan thought, "You're a scoundrel, to
boot," and watched Mrs. Wills climb to a waiting saddle, After a
moment Lorrie, already mounted, came up from another part of the
street. He looked directly ahead of him, and so never saw Nan. For
her part, she knew the futility of a scene and stood where she was.
Heavy-hearted, really desperate at the thought of his being carried
beyond her, she watched the pair pass out of the draw. St. Cloud
shouted an order through the muggy heat and returned to the
room.</p>

<p>"You're not through with me," he said to Nan, levelly. "I am
meeting Bellew tonight. After that, I'll be back."</p>

<p>He unbuckled his gun belt, threw it aside, and took another down
from a peg beside the mantel of the fireplace, striding to the
street. Going as far as the door, she watched him swing up at the
head of his men and follow Mrs. Wills into the timber. For some
reason or other she counted that group, There were twenty-two of
them; and after they had faded from sight she looked to the other
end of the street and discovered five hands left behind, near the
barn. The cook came across the room, staring over Nan's shoulder at
the departing outfit. Turning away from him, Nan noticed
uncertainty creeping into his fixed vision. He murmured some brief
word under his breath and walked out to the small group
remaining.</p>

<p>There was nothing she could do. She walked aimlessly about the
room, at loose ends, depressed by a stifling atmosphere. Blue vapor
settled heavily along the canyon, the cooked smell of boards and
earth swelled through the heat. So close was this late-afternoon
air that the kicked-up dust in the street made stationary layers on
it. Once more looking out toward the barn, she observed the men
there to be risen and engaged in an absorbed conversation; the cook
was returning, and rather than meet him Nan went back to her
sweltering room and dropped full length to the bed.</p>

<p>"If I could only get away from here," she thought and clenched
her fists beneath her head. To be helpless like this produced a
slow ache as real as physical hurt. She could not lie still, she
could not relax. One thought kept turning and turning through her
mind: St. Cloud believed Dan would come to Smoky Draw this night.
If he believed so, he would come back and wait in the shadows.
Would Bellew come? If he came, would he watch for just such an
ambush? "If," she groaned, "I could only get away!"</p>

<p>Twilight arrived, and a faint electrical pulsing in the air. The
men were below, eating supper. One of them came to the stairway and
called up, his tone neither kind nor unkind. She tried to make her
answer casual: "No, thanks. I'd rather not eat." After that
darkness covered the canyon rapidly, prematurely. The surcharged
air began to revolve before the faint pressure of wind. Boots
dragged along the lower floor, and an intermittent conversation
crept up the stairway. At first she paid it little attention; later
the greater irritation of the words pulled her from her own dark
reflections. They were, it was plain, quarreling amongst
themselves. Out of the endless murmur small phrases were
distinguishable. She heard St. Cloud's name mentioned; Bellew's,
and her own. One chesty voice kept riding into all others,
insistent and stubborn. There was an explosive interchange of
sentences, the falling of a chair, a freighted silence. In the
interval of silence she heard the first rain skirmish across the
roof.</p>

<p>She was abruptly startled to realize her name was being
peremptorily called. Going to the hall, she found a man at the foot
of the stairs, striking the flat of his fist against the banister.
"Come on down," he grunted, "Don't be so slow."</p>

<p>She descended, feeling an unusual strain in her knee The cook,
who had called her, backed away to a side of the room and so placed
himself as to watch five others arranged near by. The cook's
cigarette threw thin smoke over a set, dogged face. All the rest
appeared heckled and jumpy; and they looked at her with an
irritable dislike. The cook said:</p>

<p>"Well, it's decided?"</p>

<p>One of the others made a flat, futile gesture. "You decided
it."</p>

<p>"Then it is," announced the cook. "Ma'm, your horse is standin'
at the porch."</p>

<p>"Well?" breathed Nan.</p>

<p>"Get on it and go."</p>

<p>"Free?" Nan murmured unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"This is bad enough," growled the cook, "without you to be here
and make it worse."</p>

<p>Nan came alive; an instant haste got hold of her, for a moment
swept her self-possession away. She tumed to the stairs,
remembering her hat in the bedroom, but on the verge of going up
she abruptly wheeled toward the door. The cook said:</p>

<p>"Go where you please. But you better stay away from Broken
Stirrup. You figured to ride there?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Don't. Bellew won't be there. St. Cloud will be."</p>

<p>Nan's eyes fell to the center table, saw St. Cloud's discarded
gun and belt. "May I take that?"</p>

<p>One of the hands said, "No," curtly. The cook contradicted him.
"Entitled to some protection, ain't she? Sure, take it."</p>

<p>Nan seized the belt, went to the door. She turned, staring at
the cook, wonder in her mind. "If I ever see you again, I'll thank
you."</p>

<p>The cook shook his head, gone grim, "You'll never see me or any
of these boys again, We're fadin'."</p>

<p>Nan cried, "Thank you!" and ran across the porch to the shadow
of the horse waiting at the steps. She climbed up, hung the belt
over the saddle horn, Rain came slanting out of a pitch-black sky,
stinging her cheeks. Her only protection against the elements was
her riding breeches and a thin hickory shirt, and she was soon wet;
yet she felt no cold and no discomfort as she put the horse up the
canyon's slope and ran freely through the dismal trees. And her
mind was settled. Whatever the value of the cook's warning, she
meant to ignore it and run straight to Broken Stirrup&mdash;to warn
Dan if it were not too late.</p>

<p>Yet when she reached the pass her eyes went instantly to the
west, to the place where Bellew's ranch lights should be cutting
bright points through the darkness, and found no lights there.
Nothing but shadow and uncertainty. Some sustaining hope went out
of her then, a leaden fear took its place. She halted, trying to
use her reason and finding it of little account. Only one thing
came out of all the confusion&mdash;she could not help Dan. The
long-delayed fight was moving toward its conclusion. Somewhere in
this miserable black he rode; somewhere Neel St. Cloud waited. She
could do nothing. So only one thing remained.</p>

<p>She went forward, alive to the passing of time, on down the
slope into the fiats. A far-off fissure of lightning appeared, left
a pale glow in the memory. There was a wind rushing out of the
south, gathering momentum over the treeless valley, blasting the
rain before it, throwing Nan's breath back into her lungs. Caught
and shaken by that force, she bowed a bare, dripping head and
kicked the horse on. Somewhere&mdash;she could guess nothing of the
distances&mdash;faint shots leaped up and were tossed across the
fiats. The farther she went the stronger they grew; and when she
raised Gunderson's ranch lights to the east, she thought she knew
where the fight lay. It prompted her to pull off the road. A great
circle took her about Gunderson's; downwind she lost all rumor of
firing. After that her course was pure speculation, and she put her
faith in the laboring horse; and when, immeasurably later, she
sighted Trail's glow, she was surprised at her luck.</p>

<p>The town huddled beneath the heavy fury of the elements. Water
sluiced down porch corners, fogged the bright windows, lay ankle
deep on the forming mud. One man's face she saw staring out of the
saloon; elsewhere was silence, desolation. Past the sheriff's
office, she turned against the railroad station house and went in.
Somewhere the long blast of a train whistle rose and was flung
forward; the agent came quickly out of his office, headed for the
door. "Wait," said Nan. "Did a woman come in here this evening with
a boy?"</p>

<p>"No," said the agent. "Better get some dry clothes on."</p>

<p>"Has there been a train either way in the last few hours?"</p>

<p>"No. Excuse me&mdash;that's the eastbound."</p>

<p>Nan leaned against the wall, mind ragging away at this affair.
Then St. Cloud had lied to her&mdash;as she ought to have expected.
Lorrie had been taken elsewhere. And in all the length and breadth
of this savage land, where was she to look? Unconsciously she
clenched her hands. She was, she discovered, numb from the beating
of the wind; her soaked clothes dragged against her skin. There
seemed no answer&mdash;no clear way&mdash;and more or less in
despair she walked back into the furious night. A headlight's cold
beam washed across her, and the engine went clanking by, firebox
guttering, drivers pushing the weight of the train to a deliberate
halt. The conductor stepped down, lantern idling against the
shadows of the station runway. Nobody got off. She heard the agent
saying, "Siding at Red City for Twenty-two," and started for her
horse. Somebody stumbled in the shadows, and somebody came running
through the dark, toward the line of cars. Idly posted, Nan saw it
to be a pair hurrying past the engine; and then, as the diagonally
placed gleam of the firebox hit them, she pulled herself erect and
ran forward&mdash;at Mrs. Wills, whose one hand held and pulled a
reluctant Lorrie.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Nan. "Wait!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills stopped, dragged the boy beside her. The engine's
light slid across one half of it face haggard with temper and
exertion. Her hat was so much loose pulp on her head, and she
ripped it off in passionate haste, the yellow hair falling
down.</p>

<p>"You're not going to stop me!" she yelled. "Where&mdash;where
did you come from?"</p>

<p>"You'll not take him!" challenged Nan.</p>

<p>The fireman bent far out of his cab; the agent and conductor
walked up, the conductor saying impatiently, "If you people are
going to get aboard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" screamed Mrs. Wills. "Let me alone or I'll mark that
face of yours till you'll never look in a glass!"</p>

<p>"Lorrie&mdash;do you want to go with her?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'm!"</p>

<p>"Let him go," said Nan. Mrs. Wills started on. Nan stepped in
front of her, raised her clenched hand, struck the woman an
outraged blow across the face. The breath spilled out of Mrs.
Wills, her shrill scream was half-mad. "I'll kill you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wills, I've got a gun hanging on that horse! If you don't
let him go I'll use it!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wills's shoulders drooped. She was, Nan thought distantly,
a sorry figure there; a spent, unstable creature jerked mercilessly
about by fear and rage. But there was no rage left. It dropped
away, leaving her stupidly settled.</p>

<p>"You lost him long ago," Nan said in a gentler voice. "Get on
the train yourself."</p>

<p>"What else can I do?" moaned the woman. "I'd never dare go back
to Neel. Oh, God, my life's a mess!"</p>

<p>The conductor swung his lantern in a short circle; the engine's
bell rang metallically through the riot of wind. Mrs. Wills dropped
Lorrie's arm, her face in the shadows. She said, "Good-bye, kid,"
and went after the conductor. Lorrie walked over to Nan, putting
his shoulder against her as the cars slid past. Mrs. Wills vanished
inside.</p>

<p>"We hid in a barn on the edge of town for an hour," said
Lorrie.</p>

<p>"Lorrie, that was your mother. Don't think badly of her. Don't
ever do that."</p>

<p>"Let's go home."</p>

<p>"Home?"</p>

<p>"Our home's Broken Stirrup, ain't it?" asked Lorrie, a little
anxious.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He said nothing more for a little while. Presently she felt his
hand grope into hers. "Well, you're wet. Maybe you want to stay in
town. Whatever you say."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;we'll go home. I'm anxious about it, son."</p>

<p>He turned off, calling back: "I'll meet you at the square. Those
horses are in that barn yet."</p>

<p>The agent came out of his office, carrying a coat, and got to
Nan as she swung into her saddle. "Here," he said, "put this on
before you're washed away. I never saw anything like that
before."</p>

<p>Nan thanked him, slung the coat around her shoulders. "You're
kind," she said, thinking all the while of Bellew. It made her
words seem distant, and she realized it, adding, "very kind." Then
she went on down the street. Lorrie was already there; and
together, quite silent, they galloped out of Trail into the desert.
She spoke only once.</p>

<p>"You'll have to be the guide, Lorrie. Stay well away from
Gunderson's."</p>

<p>It was after this, a good hour afterwards, that Jubilee Hawk
came gaiting into Trail holding Jamie Scarborough in his arms.
Jamie's hat was off, and the lights of town struck a pale face that
seemed to sleep. Jubilee wheeled at the square, cantered across a
sidewalk, and dropped to the mud, bringing Scarborough down after
him. He carried Scarborough like a baby, Scarborough faintly
smiling as if the jest were on him; Jubilee kicked at a house door
and groped it open, intruding into Doc Nelson's front room and into
a comfortable family circle.</p>

<p>"The first shot," said Jubilee bitterly. "It simply broke his
lower leg into sections. He's lost a bucket of blood."</p>

<p>"On the sofa," said Nelson, matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>Jubilee spread Scarborough along the couch with a strange
gentleness. Scarborough was still smiling. Nelson came out of
another room with a tray of instruments and laid it on the floor;
his gray glance scanned Scarborough's face, read it for what it
held. This scene was old to him; he could not remember the number
of men who, borne hurriedly out of a troubled night, had lain on
that sofa. And as his knife slashed back a trouser leg, he was
thinking of another thing.</p>

<p>"It's started, Jubilee?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. How does it look?"</p>

<p>"I guess we'll straighten him out." Doc Nelson was like that.
"You can't kill these small, meek-looking men. The big ones die
quick; the little ones survive, to get shot again. Where's
Bellew?"</p>

<p>"I wish to God I knew," said Jubilee morosely. "Well, if it's
not too bad&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jamie said quietly: "Go on back. Sorry you had to lug me
in,"</p>

<p>"They weren't headin' for Gunderson's," stated Jubilee.</p>

<p>"Probably a wide-open contest right now. Somebody was on our
trail all the way to town." Jubilee walked to the door, paused
there. "You're a game guy, Scarborough."</p>

<p>"I wish I were in the rest of it. Doc, if you hear me squeal,
pay no attention."</p>

<p>"Get out of that lighted doorway," said Nelson sharply.</p>

<p>Jubilee went back to his horse, rode along the street and across
the square to Townsite's. Going in there, he found an empty store.
"Old codger's heard of this and probably is on the road to
Gunderson's now. Damn funny how fast the smell of blood travels."
He went around, got a box of .44 cartridges, filled the loops of
his belt. And hurried as he was, ingrained honesty halted him long
enough to take the counter pencil and write on a piece of paper:
"Hawk&mdash;bx .44's." Impatience boosted him out of the store,
into the rain-laced street. He circled the hitch rack, reached for
the reins, and cast one oblique glance at the saloon. Nobody stood
there; and afterwards the old habit of inspection turned his head
toward Cleary's botel. Nobody there, either. Gripping the horn, he
started his upward swing. What struck him then, he didn't know. It
was some kind of a force that literally repelled him from the seat,
an odd premonition telegraphed through the murk to record on his
nerves. His glance flashed back to Cleary's, back to the saloon.
Ruel Gasteen stood just outside the saloon doors, those doors still
swinging from his outward passage; and Gasteen's body was a fair,
motionless shape against the broken background of light.</p>

<p>Jubilee's right hand still hung to the horn. He thought, "That's
who followed me," and then he added, "It's eighty-five feet as I
once paced it." There could be no question of Gasteen's purpose.
This was war and no quarter to any man; other than that, Gasteen's
rigidity was a signal plain as day. Men stood so when they thought
of killing or being killed. Gasteen's lips moved. Some sound was
plucked away by the racing wind, and some word was framed on his
long lips and lost identity behind the silvering screen of rain.
Jubilee said conversationally, "It might as well be now," and let
his hand drop from the saddle horn. It plunged on down, struck the
gun butt and recoiled with it. Gasteen's body broke at the middle,
his own arm raced backward. Saloon light raced fragmentarily along
the dark metal barrel of his gun, and it was his first shot that
beat the wind and the rain apart and sent a cracking echo across
the four sides of the square. Clotted mud slashed Jubilee's leg, a
fact only dimly recorded as his eyes took a long sight. His
answering fire broke the steady roar coming out of the sky, and his
slug made a clean breach of that taut figure across the square. It
shook Gasteen, it blasted the life out of Gasteen. The man was dead
even as he made a half-turn and collapsed on the dark walk.</p>

<p>Two people ran out of the stable, one leaping for the hotel
porch. Jubilee held his gun cocked against the sky. "If there's
more of 'em," he said coolly, "I'll wait right here," and he
watched with a close-eyed interest until a small figure raced into
the edge of his vision and sloshed across the muddy pools. Helen
Garcia's voice beat into the wind:</p>

<p>"Jubilee&mdash;Jubilee!"</p>

<p>Those men he at last recognized and dismissed. Helen's hand
gripped his arm with a fierce pressure. "Jubilee, I was
afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, Buffalo Bill, don't talk to me like that unless you
mean it,"</p>

<p>Helen's body swayed with the whirling drafts; her sharp face
pointed up to him, full of quick emotion. "Why do you suppose I
ran&mdash;why do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"If that's an answer," said the man, "I'll be back to hear it.
I'll be back."</p>

<p>"It's come to that, Jubilee?"</p>

<p>"The ball's rollin'," grunted Jubilee, climbing to the leather.
"So long, kid."</p>

<p>Helen lifted a hand, her bare arm wet with rain, water streaking
down from her eyes. "All I can do is wait, Jubilee! If I could
follow, I would!"</p>

<p>Jubilee spurred away and was absorbed by the darkness. A later
flicker of lightning outlined him fugitively at the head of the
gentle grade; then deeper night came down with a pealed-out crash
of thunder.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>19. WHAT'S TO BE WILL BE</h2>

<p>ALL St. Cloud's guns were alive, flat detonations beating
through the wailing wind. Stock-still&mdash;his men equally
motionless behind him at that moment&mdash;Dan Bellew's mind hurled
itself savagely at the barrier ahead, only to realize a sure defeat
as the odds stood. Lightning licked across the sky, and beyond the
heavy crystal screen of rain he viewed St. Cloud's men as a camera
would catch them, that instant of pale glow freezing them into
postures. They were then in the act of spreading, each rider and
each horse vividly outlined; afterwards the ensuing darkness
released them from the illusion of being transfixed, and the
flickering muzzle lights danced wanly along a ragged line.</p>

<p>Bellew wheeled full about, shouting at the solid shapes of his
people. "Get behind the cattle! The cattle between us!" He raced
away, feeling the edges of the herd shift and recede. Jubilee
Hawk's voice lifted a long and resonant wolf cry indescribably
affecting. One man&mdash;Dan never knew which&mdash;clung doggedly
beside him, turning as he turned, matching pace for pace; there
was, then, an irregular corner to this mass of stock, and Dan
turned it and ran dead on. When the next knifing, electric-blue
streak split the shadows he saw the St. Cloud party across a sea of
solid cattle backs.</p>

<p>"Turn!" he bellowed. "Keep together&mdash;and turn! Push this
beef against 'em!"</p>

<p>Link Medders's call was downwind, very faint: "That's
it&mdash;break 'em up!"</p>

<p>"Keep together!" roared Dan.</p>

<p>He shoved his pony against the swiftening current of the herd,
and fired point-blank at the leaders. Sudden volleys cracked out to
either side of him; very dim were the yonder guns of the Smoky Draw
crowd, whipped away by the torrential rush of the storm. Sage stems
pricked his skin, and water roped down hatbrim and shoulder. But
the beef was breaking. He could feel panic take hold of that mass
and go shuddering through it. After that, the pressure fell off and
he was rushing behind a stampede.</p>

<p>"Keep together!"</p>

<p>Link Medders's wolf howl reechoed, and the signal caught hold of
the thigh-and-thigh Broken Stirrup riders, lifting weird answers
mto a world gone mad. Link Medders, cold as ice in a thing like
this, had fashioned an identifying signal out of the moment's
needs. Thereafter it rose and fell, continuous and intermittent.
The herd had broken. Dan passed stray cows rolling off on other
tangents, he galloped into a widening breach; catching the deep
pound of hoofs on either hand. The muzzle flashes to the fore lay
suddenly wide apart, and at the next shuttering glow he saw one
group of St. Cloud's men huddled compactly in front. They were not
more than a hundred feet away, faced toward him. In the foreground
was a figure at once recognizable from the torso so heavily seated
in the saddle; it was Clubfoot Johnson, his eyes stretched wide by
the lightning. Darkness squeezed in.</p>

<p>Dan said aloud: "St. Cloud drew Clubfoot's men away from
LeBoeuf! I'm fighting most of his outfit!" His voice lifted
massively: "Keep together&mdash;straight ahead!" Broken Stirrup
bayed. One thin and turning shape slid across Bellew's path, and he
drove a bullet at it, seeing nothing afterwards. He was, suddenly,
jammed into that recoiling group, leg squeezed against another
saddle's side. Powder's heat breathed along his cheek, his eardrums
rang from the close report; he fired again and saw the fellow fall.
The horse bucked away. A howling figure came up from behind and
passed on, yelling, "Bellew&mdash;Bellew&mdash;Bellew!" Broken
Stirrup struck with a heavy shock. Somebody went down, horse
collapsing at Dan's feet. Dan's pony reared up and over and
on&mdash;and then all cohesion was lost in the bitter man-to-man
combat under heavens rolling out long fanfaronades of thunder.</p>

<p>The lightning made guttering flashes, illuminating a scene of
strewn havoc. Cattle ran down the valley in scattered lines; rider
wheeled in front of rider, a figure sprawled quite dead below Dan.
That stampede, he saw, had ruined St. Cloud's ordered charge; the
outlaw's ranks, caught in the frenzied flood of livestock, were so
many fragments thrown off in every direction. Riderless beasts
careened aimlessly across the eerie earth, men afoot were running
blindly. He saw one other thing before the black closed down; he
saw something like solid opposition forming up to the
east&mdash;the nucleus of another attack. Instantly wheeling that
way, he lifted his call. Answers came hallooing back, but he was
alone as he charged the spot where he last had seen the arranging
St. Cloud line, alone and identified by the previous flash of
lightning. He realized that when he heard the pony wince in a
manner almost human and felt the beast tremble throughout. He was
out of the saddle before the animal fell, out of it and warned by
an onlunging shadow ahead. Sure as he was of that man's politics,
he hallooed to be certain; the answer he got was a streaming
crimson slash against the gloom. A boot, too, clipped his shoulder
in passing, and at that broadside figure he drove a bullet,
wheeling as the man went by and dropped from the horse. But it was
not a hit. The man was up, running forward and just visible. For
one long moment quite still, Dan caught the crush of other riders
traveling by, the consequent belch of fury just beyond. Broken
Stirrup and Smoky Draw were engaged again; again the tremendous
yelling played into the roaring reports of the elements. Somebody
cried, "Bellew&mdash;Bellew!" But Bellew, drawn into himself,
smashed two shots at the figure crouched now near him and let an
empty gun hang at the end of his arm.</p>

<p>"Bellew&mdash;God forever damn you!" It was a spending
blasphemy, full of ancient hatred, and it wailed thinly away. There
was a long burst of cold light out of the sky, but Bellew knew
without the light who died there fifteen feet away. Clubfoot
Johnson's grotesque body rolled over on the black earth and stopped
face down. Bellew said "Good!" in a grinding voice, eyes following
a single rider who was racing on away from this field altogether.
It was all he saw, just a man and horse turning fugitive; after
that, blind murk was rent by a ricocheting roll of titan tic
thunder. He stood there, something growing in his head. "He was
traveling straight northwest, That's to Broken Stirrup." A long
yell kept beating at him from one quarter and another, carrying his
name insistently forward. "Who would be going there?" he asked
himself. "Who'd have any reason to do that?" Then his tone lifted
stridently: "Medders! Shannon! Murtagh!"</p>

<p>The circling horsemen drove instantly inward.</p>

<p>"Bellew!"</p>

<p>"Shannon? I want your horse!"</p>

<p>Shannon sprang down, thrust his reins into Bellew's fist. "Why
didn't you call sooner? We got this licked&mdash;by God, we got it
licked!"</p>

<p>"St. Cloud's runnin', Mike, and his crew will be scattered in a
minute. Keep together!"</p>

<p>He sprang up and spurred off, Mike's strong yell in his ears.
The wind came with him, the bite of the rain was at his back. But
the firing made milder sallies across the prairie. It was weaker,
more ragged, spaced out. And, scratching the horse with his spurs,
he knew the story out there was nearly told. St. Cloud was no
coward. He would not run unless he felt the game going wrong. And
in running he would take the direction where his own dark talents
might still find use. That was Neel St. Cloud: versatile mind
finding one more thing to do. He meant to burn Broken Stirrup, then
pass on. Bellew understood the man's tricky nature well enough to
realize that St. Cloud was consigning his followers to whatever end
awaited them. They could die or they could run. Neither alternative
meant anything to him; St. Cloud had no regard, no loyalty, no
compassion.</p>

<p>Broken Stirrup's light broke into the slanting rain, making
star-shaped points across the black; and at intervals he saw St.
Cloud's horse pass through that beam. The man was not far away; he
could not, Bellew calculated, much more than put his feet on the
ranch porch before he, Bellew, would be on top of him. Thinking of
that, Bellew let the reins lie slack and awkwardly thumbed fresh
loads into the cylinder of his gun. The fight, it occurred to him,
had taken place rather near to Broken Stirrup, for he still heard
an occasional report whip by him on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>The house lights brightened, the silhouettes of the poplars
appeared. He saw St. Cloud drop at the porch and pause there; but
that was momentary, for the man heard pursuit pounding up behind,
and he wrenched himself around to meet it. Bellew reined in,
dropped to the earth a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>"St. Cloud."</p>

<p>St. Cloud pivoted, ran along the face of the house, turned into
the yard. Bellew wondered about that, was puzzled by it. Racing
forward, he cut wide of the corner and caught St. Cloud's bulk pass
the kitchen lights, still retreating. Somewhere beyond, the man
loosed a bullet that went aside. Then a shotgun boomed hollowly
from some part of the house&mdash;and Bellew understood St. Cloud's
avoiding tactics. The man fired again, farther away.</p>

<p>"St. Cloud!"</p>

<p>The man's voice came back, labored and venomous: "Come on!"</p>

<p>Bellew would have lost him altogether, but a second bullet left
its muzzle wake high against the shadows. That was from the canyon
trail. Reaching the foot of the slope, Bellew groped from one rock
to another, rising with the quick grade. He slid around the pine
butts, assailed by the crying of the gale in the tree tops, by the
deep reverberation of trapped air in the canyon beside him; St.
Cloud's voice was very thin:</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<p>The ending, one way or another, was a certainty, a thing of
short moments waiting somewhere in this small area that ended at
the rim of the gorge just above. Bellew said to himself, "He plays
his chances right down to the bitter end" and halted at the base of
another tree. He could see nothing in the shadow-ridden region, But
he knew approximately where St. Cloud had to be; somewhere, not
more than eight feet off, level with him, backed by a chasm
affording no more retreat. Thinking of that, Bellew coldly admired
the man. If St. Cloud had planned a setting, there could not have
been a better one. Advance and retreat stopped here. All that
remained was a final stand.</p>

<p>"St. Cloud&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man's voice was irregular, taunting: "Come and get me!"</p>

<p>"How far," muttered Bellew, "do I have to follow you? Your
game's up."</p>

<p>"You're askin' for a surrender?" rasped St. Cloud.</p>

<p>"You know better. I don't want that."</p>

<p>A shot lashed at him, unexpectedly, hungrily. He marked the
point of light, held his fire.</p>

<p>"You'll never get it!" shouted St. Cloud.</p>

<p>"I told you once&mdash;"</p>

<p>St. Cloud fired again. The bullet bit at the pine's bar with a
small squealing sound. Bellew's gun, trained on the last flash,
kicked roaringly back. "I told you once we get in each other's way.
You're through."</p>

<p>The thin, sardonic answer failed to come. Bellew picked up a
strange sibilance in the roiling currents of the hill side&mdash;a
kind of rasp that had no counterpart in his experience. "Another
trick?" he challenged.</p>

<p>The man fired twice, headlong. Bellew's mind was relentlessly
tallying those shots, There had been six; it was problematical
whether or not St. Cloud had had time to reload. It was, he
repeated mentally, problematical. There was no mercy in him, no
softness; he wanted to crush and destroy that yonder figure.
Stepping away from the tree, he walked slowly forward. He put a
shot into the black; he placed two more rakingly after it. St.
Cloud's voice was quite near and quite slow: "No man is quick
enough to match me! You're not!"</p>

<p>Bellew placed him. Bellew charged. But that vague shape wheeled
before his eyes, staggered on. Bellew yelled, "You fool&mdash;" and
sucked back the rest of the warning. St. Cloud had plunged on into
that narrow fissure whose bottom lay sixty feet below.</p>

<p>"You fool," Bellew repeated, all the animus fading from his
voice. "There's no escape that way."</p>

<p>Some sound came crying up the slopes, rousing him. He turned,
unutterably weary, lax with the passage of a strain that had been
with him, sleeping and waking, for so long. He was, at that moment,
like a house abandoned after long tenantry; and as he went
loose-muscled down the grade toward a brightly glowing door, he
kept thinking:</p>

<p>"He didn't know the pool was drained dry. He meant to escape
that way. It's all done&mdash;it's over&mdash;tomorrow is another
day." It absorbed him, as would some bright novelty; and he went
across the yard toward the door with his eyes fastened on a figure
there and not recognizing it until a voice, running violently down
all the notes of relief, said:</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;thank God!"</p>

<p>It cleared his mind, it lifted him freely and fully. Nan Avery's
supple form swayed out, and her hand drew him on into the
enveloping warmth of the kitchen. Lorrie stood stiffly by, eyes
glowing like fire.</p>

<p>"We came home, Dan," said the girl gently.</p>

<p>"That's the way it is, Nan? You're sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Lorrie turned swiftly, went out of the room, face showing acute
embarrassment. Sharp-struck echoes rose in the yard, and a call
imperatively hailed the house: "Bellew!"</p>

<p>On the heels of it, Jubilee Hawk, adrip from hat to boots, came
striding through the living room. He paused on the threshold of the
kitchen door, heavy-angled face severe.</p>

<p>He said, "St. Cloud's outfit is a complete wreck scattered all
the way from here to the state line. Where's St. Cloud?"</p>

<p>Bellew looked down at her. He said again: "You're sure,
Nan?"</p>

<p>"Here," she said abruptly and lifted her arms. "Here I am."</p>

<p>Jubilee Hawk made a funny noise through his nose, wheeled back
to the living room. "Me," he advised himself, "I've got to track
clear back through this damn weather to get my welcome, whilst his
is right on the premises. Things always come out just right for
that guy."</p>
