<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. THE TAKING OF TRESKIN, THE
RUSSIAN ASSASSIN.</h2>

<p class="first">IT is not <i>inapropos</i> for me to preface the
remarkable story I have to tell by stating that, speaking in a
general way, I am not in sympathy with things Russian. In spite
of what may be said to the contrary by those who have an interest
in misrepresenting facts, there is pretty conclusive evidence
that the great and unwieldy Russian nation has in many respects
scarcely emerged from mediaeval barbarism. It is impossible for
any free-minded person to travel through Russia at the present
day without being made painfully aware of this. It might very
aptly and somewhat epigrammatically be said that every man in
Russia who rules is a tyrant, and every man who does not rule is
a slave. Freedom, as we understand it, is unknown in the
dominions of the Czar. The press is muzzled, the mouths of public
speakers are muzzled, and if a Russian or a foreigner dwelling in
Russia holds views that are adverse to the ruling powers, let him
not express them if he values his liberty, his happiness, his
life. The stranger travelling in the country is liable to be
pounced down upon at any moment by some Government myrmidon, who,
in his narrow-mindedness, thinks he sees an enemy in him. And woe
betide the man who gets within the clutches of the law. Under
some frivolous pretext or another he may be detained without
trial and without examination, until he moulders and his heart
rends in twain with unbearable despair, suspense, and hope
deferred.</p>

<p>The Russian form of government is as despotical as it is
obsolete, while those entrusted with its administration are not as
a rule men distinguished by marked ability or enlightenment, but
they are those who have friends at Court, and who have given
evidence of being haters of the people. In no other country in the
world can you find people sunk in such besotted ignorance as are
the masses of Russia. Foreign literature of all kinds is absolutely
unknown to them, while such native papers as may come into their
hands are written through Russian spectacles, and with the
fear&mdash;which is almost greater than that of death&mdash;of the
Government censor. Hundreds of persons are at the present moment
languishing in Siberia for no other reason than that in some
unguarded moment they allowed their feelings to betray them into a
too free expression of opinion. Then followed the inevitable
result. They were arrested, accused of being "dangerous to the
State," subjected in some cases to a trial that was all a farce,
but as often as not there was no trial at all. They were then kept
in some dreadful prison for periods ranging from months to years,
and finally had to march with chained gangs into Siberia. To the
world generally all this is a matter of tradition, if not of
history, but to those who have travelled in the country with open
eyes and unshackled minds it is more than tradition; it is a
pitiable, a hideous truth.</p>

<p>Although I have thus freely expressed my opinion on the
Government of Russia, let it not be supposed for a single moment
that I countenance in any way the methods adopted by the
revolutionary societies in their efforts to redress their wrongs.
Tyranny cannot be arrested by still greater tyranny, while the wild
justice of revenge can in the end only serve to bring disaster on
the heads of the weaker party. Yet, if ever political crimes can
find justification in shameless oppression, they can do so in
Russia; and in Treskin's case this was particularly so. The
agitation that was caused in England at the time Treskin was
arrested in London through my instrumentality will not be forgotten
by those whose memories can carry them back for a generation. I
venture to think, however, that it will add to the interest of my
story, if I relate it in all its detail, from the very beginning to
the pitiless end.</p>

<p>Some time before the Crimean War a young Pole by birth, named
Egór Treskin, was living in St. Petersburg; he was employed as a
clerk in a bank, and being very studious, and very industrious, he
devoted his spare time to teaching languages in one of the public
schools. In this capacity he met a young lady, who was destined to
become his wife. She was a Russian, and an orphan. Her father had
held a Government appointment as an inspector of mines, and in that
capacity had ample opportunity of seeing the iniquity of the
Russian exile system. Moved to deep pity and sympathy by what came
under his notice, he allowed his feelings to get the better of his
discretion, and his complaints of the tyranny and cruelty that were
practised by governors, managers, overseers, and others, were many
The result being he incurred the hatred of this class of people,
and became a marked man. Revenge was not long in following. He was
denounced as a conspirator. By some means he was lured to a house
of a well-known political suspect, who was under surveillance. The
man was then accused of having visited this house. He could not
deny it, and was at once arrested. In this country such a thing
would be laughed at, for here you may spout treason and act treason
to your heart's content, and nobody will take any notice of you.
But in Russia it is different; only let the faintest whisper of
treason be breathed against a man in that benighted land, and the
chances are it seals his doom.</p>

<p>In this unfortunate fellow's case, he had too many political and
other enemies for him to hope to escape from the effects of the
accusation. The more he tried to explain, the more deeply did he
seem to become involved. He was like a bird which once gets the
ensnaring lime upon its wings. All its efforts to free itself from
the tenacious substance are futile, and serve but to exhaust it. So
in Russia with a man who is suspected of treason. Hope has gone for
him. He can never be the same again. In the case I am citing the
man was detained, first in one prison and then in another, for five
years, and, having been financially and socially ruined, he was
transported to Siberia, leaving a delicate wife behind, and three
young children&mdash;two sons and a daughter, Catherine. The
mother, soon after the departure of her husband, died, and the
children were brought up by a relative. Three years later the
father was shot in attempting to escape from his place of
exile.</p>

<p>When Egór Treskin first made Catherine's acquaintance, she was
about twenty and very beautiful. Her father, however, having been a
political prisoner, his children were subjected to a shameful
system of espionage. Catherine, in particular, had suffered great
annoyance, but she resolved to live it down, and was desirous of
qualifying herself for a teacher. Treskin fell in love with her,
and as soon as that was known, he was secretly warned that she was
a member of a tainted family, therefore must be tainted herself.
This was infamous, but, unhappily, it is common in Russia. Although
Treskin knew, no doubt, the seriousness of the warning, he allowed
love to prevail, and married Catherine. The first year or two of
their married life would seem to have been happy enough. A child
was born to them and there was nothing apparently to disturb their
serenity. But the ways of the Russian Government are inscrutable
and mysterious, like those of the "Heathen Chinee." One day, during
Treskin's absence at his business, two police officers entered his
house, and arrested his wife, on the baseless and shameless charge
of conspiring against the State. When the husband returned he found
that his wife had been dragged off, with her helpless infant, to
some prison. Distracted, he flew to headquarters, and begged to
know, firstly, of what his wife was accused; secondly, where she
had been taken to; thirdly, he craved to be allowed to see her.
With the brutal cynicism so characteristic of the Russian official,
he was told that he had better go away and hold his tongue, lest he
himself should be placed under arrest. It was hinted that he had
chosen to marry a suspected woman in spite of warning given to him,
and he must therefore abide by the consequences.</p>

<p>For two long, dark, dreary, and dismal years Treskin moved
heaven and earth in his endeavours to try and see his wife and
child, but without effect, until at last it was intimated to him
that she was to be exiled to Siberia. Broken-hearted and almost mad
with grief, he vowed that he would accompany her. At last, with a
diabolical refinement of cruelty, he was allowed to see her as she
was on the eve of departure for the far east of Siberia. She had
grown haggard and old with suffering. Her baby was dead, and it was
only too evident her mind was unhinged.</p>

<p>Treskin applied for and obtained permission to accompany his
unhappy wife, and they travelled together for many dreadful months,
suffering the horrors of the steppes, and the hardships and
privations of the dreadful journey. Poor Catherine's strength was
unequal to the strain, and somewhere in the Trans-Baikal provinces
she was stricken with mortal illness, and on her deathbed she told
her husband a revolting and fearsome story in which a high Russian
official, Count Cherékof, who was an inspector of prisons, was
implicated. She said that she had intended to keep the shame and
suffering she had endured a secret, but felt that she could not die
until she had revealed it to her husband.</p>

<p>Over his dead and outraged wife's body Treskin swore an oath to
God that he would be revenged, and having buried her in a convict's
grave he set his face westward again, brooding deeply over his
shame and wrong. In due time he found himself once again in St.
Petersburg, but he was so changed that his most intimate friends
failed to recognize him. Secretly and silently he allied himself
with the enemies of the Government and became one of the most
dangerous of conspirators, most pronounced of Nihilists. His wrongs
had turned his heart to stone and he was pitiless, terrible, and
deadly.</p>

<p>I cannot follow his career in all its details during the three
succeeding years after his return from Siberia, but it may be
summarized as one of arch plotting against the Government and the
institutions of his country. There is no doubt his wrongs and shame
had made him a dangerous and insidious enemy, and it is certainly
remarkable that during this period he managed to elude vigilance
and escape suspicion.</p>

<p>It would seem that during all this time he never forgot his
enemy, but no opportunity occurred for him to carry out his deadly
act of vengeance. Count Cherékof had been sent on some secret
mission to France and England. But Treskin evidently knew how to
wait. He bided his time, and his time came at last. The Count
returned to Russia, and for some reason or other was soon after
entertained at a public banquet. That night late a note was slipped
into the Count's hand as he was in the act of leaving the place
where he had been entertained. The note was from a lady of his
acquaintance, and begged for an interview. The Count, it appears,
had drunk freely, and probably it was due to that that he displayed
a recklessness which was fatal to him. He told his servants that he
had an appointment to keep, and though he was pressed to allow
attendants to accompany him he refused to do so, saying he was
quite able to take care of himself, and, hiring a public carriage,
he was driven to a street in the northern part of the city. There
he alighted, and what followed is shrouded in mystery to a
considerable extent. But what is certain is that he went to a house
at the top of the street and a little later that house was found to
be on fire. An alarm was raised, the engines were called out, and
the fire extinguished before much harm had been done. On entering
the smoking building, the firemen found on a bed in one of the
rooms the body of Count Cherékof. He was partly undressed. A dagger
was thrust up to the hilt in his breast, and a bullet had
penetrated his brain. Attached to the handle of the dagger by a
piece of ribbon was a card, on which was written:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Thus are my wrongs avenged, and<br>
Thus are destroyed the enemies of the people."</p>
<br>

<p>It was pretty clear now that the Count had been lured to the
house under false pretences, and there assassinated. Whether the
house had been wilfully set on fire to hide all traces of the crime
or not was not proved; but in all probability the conflagration was
accidental, otherwise what would have been the use of the card on
the dead man's breast?</p>

<p>The strange tragedy, of course, caused an immense sensation in
Russia, for the Count belonged to a very old and aristocratic
family, being closely allied, in fact, to the Royal family itself.
The Count, however, had never been popular amongst the people.
Between the Russian nobility and the lower classes there is a wide
line of demarcation, and they hate each other. Oppression in its
very worst form is exercised by those in power, and consequently
they are detested. It can well be understood, therefore, that the
Count's dreadful and tragic end begot no sympathy amongst those
over whom he had so long tyrannized, but official and aristocratic
Russia was stirred to its depths. The murder showed that the people
were still dangerous and to be feared, and something like a panic
displayed itself amongst the high-born and the favoured ones of
royalty who knew in their hearts that they were all marked men and
would meet with a similar doom to that which had overtaken the
Count if opportunity presented itself. They lived, in fact, over a
mine that might at any moment explode, and so a wail went forth
about the inadequacy of the police, and a bitter demand was made
that the Count's slayer should be brought to justice. Arrests were
made wholesale and indiscriminately. It was as if a fisherman,
wishing to catch some particular fish, cast his net into the sea
and drew up thousands of other fish which he destroyed in the hope
that the particular one he wanted might be amongst them.</p>

<p>It came out then that for some little time previous Treskin had
been suspected, and now he was sought for and could not be found.
His lodgings were searched and evidence discovered that he had been
mixed up in a revolutionary movement that, had it succeeded, would
all but have turned Russia upside down. The officials were aghast,
the nobles terrified, for the conspiracy was so widespread, its
aims so sweeping. More wholesale arrests followed. Men, women,
young and old, as well as delicate children, were immured in the
dreadful prisons, and the lady&mdash;a Miss Dicheskuld&mdash;who
had sent the letter to the General, which was the means of luring
him to the house, was, of course, arrested. There had been an
intrigue between her and the Count. He had treated her badly, and
in order to avenge herself on him, she had readily joined the
conspirators. The letter she had written led the Count to suppose
that she was desirous of a reconciliation, and so he had fallen
easily into the trap set for him.</p>

<p>This unfortunate young woman was threatened with death if she
did not denounce her co-conspirator, and under the fear of this
threat she confessed that it was Treskin's hand that had done the
Count to death.</p>

<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that law in Russia is based
upon a system of <i>persecution</i>, not prosecution as it is in
most countries that lay claim to be ranked amongst the civilized
nations of the earth. Let a man once bring himself under the
cognizance of Russian law, and for ever afterwards, so long as he
may live, he is a marked man. He can no more escape from its meshes
than can a fly escape when once it has entangled itself in the web
of the crafty spider. Only too painfully was this exemplified in
the case of Treskin's ill-starred wife, and such cases might be
multiplied <i>ad infinitum</i>. The people of the Czar's kingdom
are ruled by terrorism in its worst form. The chained slave may
writhe under the lash, but he cannot resist it. The caged tiger may
roar never so loud, but his roaring has no effect on those who are
protected by the iron bars. Give the Russian masses freedom, and
what should we see? A mighty whirlwind of human passion&mdash;the
result of centuries of cruel wrong, of hateful greed, of bitter
oppression, of the exercise of power against right&mdash;sweeping
from one end of the great Empire to the other&mdash;a whirlwind
that would smite the nobles into the dust and hurl the Czar from
his throne, crushed and shattered. This expression of feeling is
the outcome of knowledge that has come to me since I unhappily gave
up Treskin to his pitiless persecutors. Had I known then what I
know now I would have allowed my right hand to have withered before
I had stirred a limb to aid the hunters.</p>

<p>If Mademoiselle Dicheskuld thought that in denouncing Treskin
she would save herself, she must have been singularly ignorant of
her country's law, or otherwise she was the victim of some strange
delusion. Death might have been her portion otherwise. As it was,
something more dreadful than death was meted out to her. After the
hideous mockery of a trial that was not a trial, but an outrage on
justice, she was sentenced to banishment to Verkhoyausk, in the
Arctic solitudes of Northern Asia. What became of her I know not,
but that she perished long before the awful journey of thousands of
miles was ended is only too probable.</p>

<p>It might be thought that this act of pitiless vengeance would
have satisfied the dripping fangs of the hideous monster termed
Russian justice; but not a bit of it. Treskin still lived. Treskin
was still at large. What mattered it that his wretched wife had
been cruelly persecuted and done to death? What mattered it that
his heart had been wrenched and torn and his brain turned by the
shame and wrong he had suffered at the hands of a titled scoundrel?
All that counted for nothing. He had slain the scoundrel, and that
was a high crime in the sight of the Administration. He must be
hunted and tracked until snared, and then&mdash;ah, what then! We
shall see.</p>

<p>Everyone who has travelled in France knows to what an extent
police espionage is carried on in that country, but it is nothing
compared to what the espionage is in Russia. There your dearest
relative may be in the secret pay of the law, and your lightest
whisper against the powers that be may lay you unexpectedly in a
prison; and yet great crimes are committed, men and women escape,
and revolutionary meetings are held. Nevertheless when once a man
is suspected, he may be certain that he will have no peace. He will
be shadowed night and day. His goings out and comings in will be
marked. He is, so to speak, watched through a microscope, so that
the most trivial act, which elsewhere would be treated with
contempt, is magnified into an offence of the greatest importance.
And when the hue and cry has been started it is taken up and
repeated from every province, every town, village, and hamlet, and
from every housetop, every street corner, every bazaar, market, and
shop. A "suspect" who is wanted is, in the most literal sense,
hunted. There was no exception made in Treskin's case. He was
denounced as one of the most dangerous conspirators and criminals
who had ever shown themselves in antagonism to the beneficent
institutions of their country, and to the benign and humane rule of
the "Little Father," the White Czar. Such a blackened ruffian must
be taken. For the good of the countless millions of the free and
happy people of enlightened Russia, he would have to be made an
example of. The very earth would throb with indignation while he
walked upon it. What mattered it that he had been wronged,
outraged. What mattered it that his wife and babe had been torn
from him, and murdered in the name of the law? What mattered it
that his home had been broken up, his life blighted, his heart
shattered? These were petty trifles unworthy of serious
consideration. A noble of Russia had been assassinated by a
plebeian, and a noble of Russia couldn't do wrong, and so his
slayer would have to be taken. It is one thing, however, to make
resolutions, and another to carry them out. Russia was ransacked,
but Treskin found not. By the extensive circulation of public
announcements people were warned of the serious penalties they
incurred if they gave harbourage to the hunted criminal, or
afforded him shelter or support of any kind.</p>

<p>As is usually the case under such circumstances, the officials
and the police were seized with a sort of panic. They saw
conspiracy in the most harmless gatherings of the people, and
wholesale arrests were made. But still the man who was so very much
wanted was not forthcoming. Amongst the class to which Count
Cherékof had belonged there was loud discontent expressed at the
failure of the myrmidons of the law to seize the dreadful
Treskin.</p>

<p>They declared that, so long as he was at large, no one of
position could sleep safely in his bed. But protest, grumbling, and
fear were unproductive of any result, unless it was of proving how
unjust and unreasonable men and women can be. Treskin had gone,
and, when two years had passed, it may safely be said that in a
general way he was forgotten. Russia is always so busy with
imprisoning, slaying, or sending political and other offenders to
Siberia, that her attention cannot always be occupied with an
individual, and so the excitement begotten by the death of Count
Cherékof died down, and Treskin's name was uttered no more until
one day a strange chance placed his enemies in possession of a clue
to his whereabouts.</p>

<p>The clue was furnished to them in this wise. There had come to
England as an exile a man by the name of Joseph Pushkin. He was a
Russian who had groaned with sorrow at the iniquities of Russian
officials and the injustice of Russian law. Of good birth and with
ample means at his disposal he might, had he been disposed to
suppress his feelings and keep his thoughts to himself, have lived
unmolested and have even gained high office in the State. But he
was made of different stuff. His was not the nature to remain
silent when he saw his humbler countrymen smitten into the dust
with oppression and wrong; so he raised his voice, he used his pen,
he brought all his influence to bear in a useless endeavour to
sweep away the abuses which were such a standing disgrace in the
country of his birth. But it was as if a man had attempted to
overturn a mountain by pressing his shoulders against it. Pushkin's
efforts were just as futile. He was persecuted, he was imprisoned,
then banished to the wilds of Siberia. He managed, however, to make
his escape <i>en route</i>, and succeeded in reaching our own land
of liberty Then he went about lecturing in order that some truths
of darkest Russia should be known to the enlightened people of
these islands. In one of these lectures he alluded to Treskin's
case. He did not mention him by name, but told the story of the
wretched man's life as evidence of the barbarities that Christian
Russia could perpetrate in the name of justice and right. One of
the lynx-eyed spies, who resided in England in the pay of Russia,
recognized the hero of the story. This spy was a woman, be it said
to her disgrace. She was a writer in the public press, and having
more regard for the blood-money that was paid to her than she had
for the truth, she constantly described the Czar as a just and
humane man, and Russia as a country of beneficent and righteous
laws. When she learned that Treskin was in England she lost no time
in sending word to her employers, and then there came to London one
Prevboski, a Russian detective of considerable fame in his own
country. He was authorized to demand Treskin's extradition on the
grounds that he was not a political refugee, but a common murderer
who had been guilty of a revolting and cold-blooded crime. Of
course, it goes without saying not one word was uttered of the
fearful wrongs that Treskin bad suffered.</p>

<p>The arguments that Prevboski used, or rather the representations
he was authorized to make in the name of the Government of his
country, prevailed here, and after considerable discussion it was
decided that Treskin should be extradited. But then came the
question, Where was he? He had to be found, and the duty of finding
him devolved upon me.</p>

<p>At this time my mind was a perfect <i>tabula rasa</i> so far as
Treskin was concerned. Up to then I had never even heard his name,
consequently I was in entire ignorance of his story, though I knew
a good deal of Russian administration and Russian life, my
knowledge being derived from residence and travel in the country. I
was therefore not prepossessed by any means in favour of Russia.
But I did not allow this to weigh when I undertook to look for the
fugitive. He was represented to me as a scoundrel of the deepest
dye. His crime was pictured as of exceptional atrocity. His victim,
it was said, was one of the kindest, most just, virtuous, and
humane of men. The cause of the crime&mdash;so I was
informed&mdash;was an insensate and utterly groundless jealousy on
the part of the "trebly-dyed villain" Treskin.</p>

<p>Now, making allowance for over-colouring and exaggeration, which
your Russian official is much addicted to, it appeared as if
Treskin was a vulgar murderer undeserving of sympathy; and it was
to the interest of law and order that he should be taken.</p>

<p>Prevboski was a very typical Russian, or rather let me say he
was a typical Russian official, for between the official and
non-official there is a vast difference. He believed&mdash;or
affected to believe&mdash;that the masses were very much like the
wolves which haunt the wild and lonely steppes and the weird dark
forests of his native land. They were dangerous when free, and
chains and bars were the only things to keep them in subjection. He
considered the mode of government and the forms of administration
peculiar to his native land perfect, and a model for all other
countries, and he regarded the Czar as a ruler by Divine right, who
could not err, and who could commit no sin. Prevboski spoke no word
of English, so that he was at a disadvantage, and it was arranged
that he was to remain quietly in London and wait the result of my
efforts.</p>

<p>Necessarily a good deal of publicity had been given to the fact
that an application had been made for Treskin's extradition, and
this made the task of taking him more difficult. For to be
forewarned is to be forearmed, and unless he was an absolute fool
he would take means to effectually conceal himself.</p>

<p>The reader need scarcely be told that in London there is a
relatively vast Russian population. Many of these are exiles by
necessity; others have banished themselves in the hope&mdash;often
a delusive one&mdash;that they will secure a share of English gold.
But under any circumstances they enjoy a freedom here impossible in
their own country; nor need they go in fear of molestation by the
authorities unless they break the law. A great number of these
people are Jews, and they may be found congregating together in
little colonies in the East End. I began my quest by going into
these colonies and making inquiries calculated to elicit some
particulars of Treskin's whereabouts. Of course I had been informed
that Pushkin had alluded to his compatriot in his lectures, and,
therefore, the natural inference was that Pushkin knew where the
fugitive was. But it was not in the least likely that he would
betray his hiding-place. Having failed, however, in my East End
search, I deemed it desirable to get into touch with Pushkin, and
he being a public man it was not difficult to find him out.</p>

<p>I ascertained that he was a daily visitor to a restaurant in
Soho which was kept by a Russian and was mainly supported by
Russians. Here, having supped or dined in Russian fashion, he was
to be found nightly, when in town, absorbed in his favourite game
of chess, of which he was a passionate lover. I, too, began to
frequent the restaurant, and had soon scraped acquaintance with
Pushkin; and being myself a fair hand at chess I was enabled to
challenge him and so strengthen the acquaintanceship. He was a
reserved man under ordinary circumstances, but I soon learned that
he could be drawn on Russian subjects, and waxed warm and indignant
when the government of his country was alluded to. After a time,
when I became more familiar with him, I traded on this weakness,
and one evening ventured to ask his opinion of Treskin.</p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, "they will never take Treskin&mdash;at
least, I hope not. It would be a crime if the British Government
should give him up."</p>

<p>"But he has been guilty of a crime," I remarked.</p>

<p>"He has," answered Pushkin, as an angry light gleamed from his
dark eyes; "a justifiable crime."</p>

<p>"But surely you do not mean to say that murder is justifiable,"
said I.</p>

<p>Pushkin looked at me steadfastly for some moments, then he made
answer:</p>

<p>"Sir, are you not aware that there are times when murder is not
murder? When to remove a tyrant, an outrager of women, an oppressor
of men, finds acceptance in the sight of heaven."</p>

<p>"I was not aware of that," I replied, somewhat ironically.</p>

<p>"Then you have much to learn," he retorted.</p>

<p>"So far as my knowledge extends," I said, "I have always
understood that we are scripturally informed that 'vengeance is the
Lord's.'"</p>

<p>"And yet we read in the Scriptures of men slaying men," he
answered with something like a sneer on his face. "But do you not
believe that there are times in our human affairs when a man may be
made an instrument in the hands of God to remove a tyrant from the
earth which he encumbers and darkens?"</p>

<p>I declined to express an opinion on that point, preferring to
keep my views to myself; but I urged upon Pushkin that his
countryman had certainly outraged man's laws in taking upon himself
to slay a fellow without trial and without warning. This caused the
Russian to become more and more excited. He declared that Treskin
had done a great and noble act; that Count Cherékof, being so full
of iniquity and evil, his death was in the nature of a blessing,
and that Treskin, instead of being prosecuted, should be hailed as
one of the saviours of society I dissented from this view, whereat
Pushkin grew more angry, and he vowed solemnly that he would do
everything that lay in his power to do to defeat the "infamous
design," as he phrased it, of the British Government to give up
Treskin, and he added with fiery emphasis:</p>

<p>"But, take my word for it, sir, Treskin will not be given up,
for the simple reason that Treskin will not be found."</p>

<p>"Unless he is dead," I responded, "I should say it is highly
probable that sooner or later Treskin will be unearthed."</p>

<p>"Treskin is not dead," cried Pushkin, with a bitter smile, "and
yet he will baffle the hunters."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, as if I wished him to understand I was
indifferent one way or the other, but my views did not coincide
with his, for I thought that, even if I myself failed in the task I
had undertaken, somebody else would in all human probability
succeed.</p>

<p>My argument with Pushkin had conclusively proved one thing to
me, which was that he was not likely to betray his friend if he
could help it. But it was very evident that he was aware of
Treskin's hiding place, and I set to work to try and think out some
plan for getting his secret from him. The only reasonable one, as
it seemed to me, was to shadow him, in the hope that he would
afford me a clue. Before leaving him on this particular night I
said, as a sort of parting shot fired apparently at random, and yet
with a definite and deliberate aim:</p>

<p>"Well, if your friend is still in England, you may depend upon
it he will be tracked down in time."</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend is still in England," was the answer, with a
smile of self-assurance, "but you may depend upon it he will not be
tracked down."</p>

<p>To some extent Pushkin had given himself away in his answer, and
my object was so far served. He had admitted that Treskin was still
in the United Kingdom, and deductively I felt it highly probable
that he was in London, because London, being such a huge place, and
its population made up of such a heterogeneous collection of
nationalities, a man may more easily hide himself there than
elsewhere. In London it is not a difficult matter for a man to lose
his individuality, so to speak. You become part and parcel of a
great whole, but the immensity of the mass of which you are a
composing atom causes you in a general way to be no more
conspicuous or distinguishable than one grain of sand is
distinguishable from another grain of sand on the seashore. This
may seem little more than theory, but it is daily borne out by
fact, and many a hunted man has been able to lie <i>perdu</i> in
the teeming Babylon until the scent has grown cold, and then he has
slipped away for good and all. However, vast as London is, it
narrows one's sphere of inquiry and action when you are assured
that the person you are seeking is one amongst the millions. To him
who watches and waits the law of chances are in his favour, and
these chances are immeasurably increased when the watcher brings a
trained mind to bear on the task he has in hand; for then chance is
reduced to something like certainty. There is an old proverb which
expresses the fundamental essence of a great truth. It is, "Birds
of a feather flock together." He who makes a study of human ways
knows how apposite the proverb is to men and women. The ignorant
gravitate to the ignorant; the refined to the refined; foreigners
to their kind, and so on. A study of this law, which may be said
for all practicable purposes to be immutable, enables anyone
acquainted with the habits of a particular person whom we may be
anxious to discover to turn to the quarter where he is most likely
to discover him. Acting on the principle, therefore, I deemed it
highly probable that, assuming Treskin was in London, he would be
within touch of his compatriots, and particularly with Pushkin. So
I watched Pushkin with, if I may so express it, a sleepless
vigilance. I was morally certain that sooner or later he would
inadvertently deliver his friend into my hands. Let me add point to
my statement already made that at this time I believed Treskin to
be a mere vulgar assassin, whose deed called for the very severest
punishment which his fellow-man could award.</p>

<p>It was about three weeks later&mdash;that is, three weeks after
I had commenced my shadowing of Pushkin&mdash;that I tracked him
one day to a villa residence in the "classic regions" of St. John's
Wood. It was a small detached house standing in about half an acre
of well-kept ground. On the gate was affixed a brass plate bearing
the legend, "Madame Marie Lablanc, Teacher of Languages."</p>

<p>Pushkin remained in the house about two hours. Then he came out
and went away. A dozen reasons, of course, might have been advanced
to explain the motive of his visit to madame, but I said to myself,
"When a man goes to a house and stays there for two hours, he must
be well acquainted with the inmate or inmates, therefore the
assumption is that Pushkin is very familiar with Madame
Lablanc."</p>

<p>Arguing thus, I felt sure that madame and the man I was
shadowing were friends. That being so, it was likely the lady might
be in possession of information, which would be valuable if she
could be induced to impart it. Lablanc was a French name, and I was
curious to know what connection there was between this French lady
and Pushkin, the Russian. A few inquiries pushed in the proper
quarter elicited the fact that Pushkin was a pretty frequent
visitor to that villa, and as it did not seem to me probable he
went there for the sake of studying foreign languages, I thought it
curious, to say the least, and I resolved on interviewing Madame
Lablanc.</p>

<p>Three days later I knocked at the door of the villa, and
inquired for madame, and a natty maidservant showed me into a small
parlour that was strongly impregnated with the odour of stale
tobacco. In fact I sniffed that odour the moment the front door was
opened for my admission, and this was pretty conclusive evidence
that someone residing there was a heavy smoker. A few minutes later
the door of the parlour was pushed open, and an exceedingly pretty
woman of about thirty years of age entered, and with a slight bow
inquired my business in the English tongue, that bore not the
slightest trace of a foreign accent.</p>

<p>"May I inquire if you are Madame Lablanc?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she answered, "lam madame's niece."</p>

<p>"But you are not French," I remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, my aunt has English connections by marriage," was the
somewhat haughty answer.</p>

<p>"I had no intention of being rude," I said apologetically. "May
I see your aunt? I wish to make some inquiries about her terms for
teaching French and German."</p>

<p>"I will give you a prospectus," replied the lady.</p>

<p>"I should prefer if you will allow me to see madame," I
answered.</p>

<p>"Well, you will have to wait for a little while, as she is
engaged at present."</p>

<p>I intimated that I was quite prepared to wait, and the niece
left me. Twenty minutes or so later the door once more opened, and
there entered a solidly-built, neatly-dressed woman with grey hair
worn over the temples, brushed behind the ears, and done up in a
knob at the back of the head. She wore dark blue spectacles, so
that it was impossible to see her eyes, but she had a sallow
complexion and a haggard, careworn-looking face. She spoke English
fluently, but with an unmistakable accent, and her manner was
subdued and reserved. She told me that she taught seven different
languages, including Polish and Russian. The result of my interview
was I arranged to take lessons in French and German, and to
commence on the following day. French I spoke fluently, and German
well, but I did not tell her that, and true to the appointment I
was there on the following day at the appointed hour. I should
mention that she had asked me if I wished to receive my instruction
in a class or privately. Of course I decided on the latter, as my
purpose would be best served thereby.</p>

<p>There was something about Madame Lablanc that struck me as
peculiar. Her voice was harsh and rough, her movements ungraceful,
her manner reserved, cold, and brusque. My aim, of course, was to
find out if she knew anything of Treskin; but she was so strangely
reserved that I did not think it likely she would allow herself to
be drawn out, for certainly she showed no disposition to give
information on any subject except that in which she was engaged,
namely, her teaching. Once or twice I ventured to ask her a
question about Russia, and she promptly snuffed me out by saying
peremptorily:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you are here to learn, not to question, except in so
far as you may require explanations of any point you don't
understand."</p>

<p>I bowed as if thoroughly rebuked, but I resolved to try what I
could make of the niece. The one difficulty in the way was to get
an interview with her, for let it be borne in mind that I had to be
very careful not to arouse suspicion. Chance, however, favoured me.
On leaving the house one day I met her returning to it. I stopped
and spoke to her, flattered her aunt, and said I thought she was
very clever.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the lady, "she is. She is far too clever to have
to grind her life away in the mere drudgery of teaching."</p>

<p>"Why does she not take to something else?" said I.</p>

<p>"What can she take to," replied the niece with some show of
irritability. "She is no longer young, and the struggle to live
nowadays is fearfully hard. The competition is so keen in every
walk of life."</p>

<p>"True, true," I murmured sympathetically. Then after a further
brief conversation I was about to part from her, when I stopped and
said suddenly, as though the thought had only just occurred to me,
"By the way, do you know Pushkin, the Russian?"</p>

<p>Her face coloured, and she seemed to me as if she was confused,
nor did she answer me straight off; for her reply was: "Do you know
him?" with an emphasis laid upon the "you."</p>

<p>"By sight," I said; "and I saw him coming from your house one
day."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered, recovering herself; "He does come,
though rarely. He took English lessons from my aunt."</p>

<p>"Really! That is rather strange, is it not?&mdash;that a Russian
should go to a French lady to be taught English in England."</p>

<p>"I don't know that there is anything very strange about it. It's
a free country, and people can do as they like."</p>

<p>"Certainly, the country is free enough," I responded. "If it
were not there would not be such an influx of foreign scoundrels
who find their native land too hot to hold them. There is a man by
the name of Treskin, for instance&mdash;a brutal assassin, as I
understand, who has managed to find snug quarters here, and to so
far elude those who would like to meet him."</p>

<p>My remark caused the lady to grow very pale, and she seemed for
some moments to be strangely agitated. Then in a voice that
decidedly quivered she answered, almost passionately:</p>

<p>"Treskin is not a brutal assassin. That is only the tale told by
his enemies, and if you knew anything of Russia you would know that
if a man has given offence to the Government, and the thousand and
one fawning and lying sycophants who do its despotic bidding, he is
for evermore marked, and no lie that human brain is capable of
forging is considered bad enough to tell about him."</p>

<p>"You espouse Treskin's cause warmly," I said, looking at her
fixedly, for I had no doubt from her manner and the way she spoke
that she was well acquainted with him.</p>

<p>"As I would espouse the cause of anyone who was oppressed," she
answered with composure, for she had quite recovered herself now.
"Treskin is a cruelly oppressed man, and I pray to God that the
hounds of his infamous Government will never get on his track."</p>

<p>"I should say myself that it is almost certain they will."</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;a strange, sneering, chuckling sort of laugh;
a laugh full of meaning, although its meaning was obscured to me
then, and she said:</p>

<p>"You may safely venture to wager heavily that he will not be
taken. But excuse me. I must go. Good-day." With this abrupt
termination to our conversation she turned round and hurried off,
and now a feeling took possession of me that I was at last on
Treskin's track. It was obvious that he could be no stranger to
this lady, and from the warm manner in which she defended him it
seemed to me probable that he might be her lover. At any rate I
determined to keep in touch with her, impressed with the belief
that ultimately I should succeed in obtaining from her some clue to
the fugitive's whereabouts. The emotion she had displayed when
Treskin was discussed proved conclusively that she might be excited
to a pitch when she would in all likelihood make some admission
which would prove valuable to those who were seeking the
fugitive.</p>

<p>It was about a week later, during which I had not seen the
niece, that I was with Madame Lablanc one morning reading German
with her. It was cold weather, and she wore a loose sort of
dressing-gown lined with fur. She rose somewhat suddenly from her
seat to stir the fire, and in doing so something from an inside
pocket in her gown fell heavily to the floor. To my astonishment I
saw that it was a revolver. I stooped and picked it up, when with
an angry movement she snatched it from me. The next moment she
looked abashed and confused. "Excuse me," she stammered,
apologetically, as she thrust the weapon into her pocket again. "I
am a stupidly nervous woman and for years have carried a revolver,
though I don't believe if the necessity were to arise I should have
the courage to use the thing. Indeed I don't even know how to use
it."</p>

<p>Her manner of saying this was insincere, and carried no weight
with me, for I was sure that she could be a very ugly antagonist
indeed with a weapon like that in her hand. Nor did it seem to me
in the least likely that she was ignorant of its use, as she
pretended to be.</p>

<p>"It is a somewhat dangerous toy for a lady to carry about with
her," I remarked, "and you will pardon me for saying that you must
be impressed with an idea that an occasion may suddenly arise when
you will find it necessary to defend yourself with that
weapon."</p>

<p>"Defend myself from whom and what?" she asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Madam," I answered, "I am not the keeper of your thoughts."</p>

<p>The discussion was not continued, as she resumed the reading
lesson we were engaged upon.</p>

<p>This little incident of the revolver was not lost upon me. It
set me pondering, and I began to compare notes, with the result
that I came to the conclusion there was a good deal of mystery
about Madame Lablanc which required explanation. When next I
visited her I scrutinized her closely, and felt convinced that the
grey hair which was such a conspicuous feature, and which was so
carefully done up, had never grown upon her head. It was, in fact,
a wig, but so admirably made, and simulated Nature so closely, that
it was well calculated to deceive anyone. Now, why should she wear
a wig of this kind? And why did she carry a revolver? To the first
question I answered to myself&mdash;"For some strong reason she is
concealing her identity." To the second&mdash;"Should her disguise
be penetrated she would bring the weapon into use, either against
herself or against someone else."</p>

<p>That night I called upon Prevboski, the Russian detective.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen Treskin?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No. But I have numerous photographs of him taken at various
times and in various positions."</p>

<p>The photographs I carefully inspected, studying the features, in
fact, in all their detail, and gradually a suspicion that had been
haunting me became less vague than it had been, and when I returned
the photographs to the Russian I felt almost sure that I had at
last been successful in my search, and had found the much-wanted
Treskin.</p>

<p>"I want you to accompany me the day after tomorrow," I said to
Prevboski, "to a certain house, and bring some of those photographs
with you."</p>

<p>"Have you discovered Treskin?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>I intimated that I had some reason to think we should discover
him; so the arrangement was made, and on the appointed day
Prevboski and I presented ourselves at Madame Lablanc's residence,
were duly admitted by the servant, and ushered into the room where
I had been in the habit of having my lessons. We waited some little
time before anyone came to us. Then there entered the niece, who
eyed the stranger keenly and suspiciously.</p>

<p>"This is an acquaintance of mine," I said. "He is a Russian, and
is desirous of learning English."</p>

<p>This latter statement was true, in fact, for he was very
desirous, indeed, of acquiring a knowledge of the English tongue,
though he had no intention then of becoming a pupil of
Madame's.</p>

<p>"Does he not understand English at all?" asked the niece still
looking at him.</p>

<p>"I don't think he understands a word," I replied.</p>

<p>"But has he means to pay for his lessons? You will pardon me
asking that, but we know from experience that Russian refugees who
come to this country are often in sore pecuniary straits, and my
aunt cannot afford to teach for nothing."</p>

<p>"I think, miss, that I may venture to assure you that if this
gentleman should take lessons he will most certainly pay for them.
But perhaps your aunt will see him. She can converse with him in
his own tongue, and satisfy herself."</p>

<p>The niece assented that that was perhaps the best course, and
she left the room; but the expression of her face and something in
her manner gave me the idea that she was troubled and anxious.
Presently she returned in company with her aunt, and I noted that
Madame, so far as I could judge, fixed her eyes on the Russian. But
I inferred this more from the aspect and position of her face, for
the blue spectacles made it impossible for me to see the eyes. She
put a few hurried questions to Prevboski in the Russian language,
and he answered her as rapidly; and I was conscious that her
anxiety increased. On our way to the house I had mentioned my
suspicions to him, and it was evident he was influenced by them,
for with a sudden and adroit movement he snatched at Madame's grey
hair, partly tearing it away, and revealing the fact that it was a
wig. With a wild cry of alarm the niece sprang between them, and,
throwing her weight against him, hurled him back, while the
<i>pseudo</i> Madame Lablanc got between us and the door, and,
drawing a revolver, covered us, while a look of despair and stern
determination was on her haggard face, or rather his face, for we
had found Treskin, and the niece, as was soon made manifest, was
his loyal and devoted wife.</p>

<p>"Do not attempt to touch me," he cried in a half-frantic tone,
"or, as the sky is above, you are dead men."</p>

<p>The tableau was certainly a dramatic one, for this desperate,
hunted man was not likely in such a moment to be influenced by any
thought of the after consequences if his threat was carried into
effect. My companion and I were certainly at a disadvantage, for
between us and Treskin stood his beautiful wife; unarmed, it was
true, but ready to sacrifice herself if needs be. If we made a rush
at him, we would have to hurl her out of the way, and in the brief
seconds required for that, Treskin could send his bullets speeding.
There was the chance, of course, of his missing; or, on the other
hand, of his hitting her or us. Anyway, we wished to avoid a tragic
ending to this dramatic affair; but before we could take action,
Treskin backed to the door r opened it, and backed out, while his
wife covered his retreat. Then, acting in concert, Prevboski and I
darted forward, and gained the passage in time to see the
unfortunate man disappearing up the stairs, and in a few moments a
door slammed violently.</p>

<p>We followed with all speed, and hammered on the door of the
front bedroom, where he had sought refuge. Suddenly the door was
flung open, and Treskin, stripped now of his false hair and blue
spectacles&mdash;which, by the way, were as much of a necessity as
part of his extraordinary disguise, for he suffered from some
affection of the eyes&mdash;stood in the threshold. There was no
anger, no fire, no passion in his face; it was a wonderfully
gentle, mild face, and more like a woman's than a man's.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, in a voice that was heart-cutting in its
pathetic sadness, "I yield myself your prisoner. It is useless my
fighting against the stars or trying to avert my destiny. I have
been a fool to suppose I could long elude the scent of the Russian
bloodhounds. But I am a political refugee, and the English
Government dare not give me up. You must give me a little time to
collect my papers, to put my affairs in order, and to console my
beloved wife, whose devotion to me is worthy of being immortalized
in an epic poem." Turning to me he handed me the revolver, which up
to this moment he had held with his finger on the trigger, and he
said, "You have done your work well, and lured me into a trap; but
I suppose it is your business, therefore I will not blame you. You
are an Englishman, however, I presume, and I may therefore look for
fair play at your hands. I could expect none from this man,"
looking contemptuously at Prevboski; "he would treat me as if I
were a wild beast."</p>

<p>I hastened to assure Treskin that he would receive every
consideration, and his first act was to descend the stairs in
search of his wife, whom he found lying in a swoon on the floor of
the room. Bending down, he raised her with an infinite tenderness,
and as he kissed her white face he sobbed like a stricken child. A
man who could weep over a woman, as he wept then, could have very
little of the savage in him. I am not ashamed to own that it
affected me, and I was obliged to turn away. But Prevboski looked
on with stolid indifference, and grunted out an expression of
impatience.</p>

<p>An hour later we conveyed the unfortunate Treskin to prison, and
so far my part ended. The disguise that he had assumed and so well
kept up had thoroughly deceived everyone not in his secret, and he
had been able to earn a good income by his linguistic
accomplishments. He had been married to his English wife about a
year. She was the daughter of highly-respectable people, who had
made a small fortune in business and retired. Her love and devotion
to her wretched husband were of that nature which passeth words;
and, with an eloquence of a broken-hearted woman, she pleaded his
cause in the public press and told the moving and pathetic story of
his life, every detail of which was subsequently confirmed. But,
notwithstanding this, and in spite of an almost universal protest,
he was given up and conveyed to Russia with Prevboski&mdash;the
poor, grief-stricken wife accompanying him; for no persuasion,
neither on his part nor on that of her relatives, could prevent her
from sacrificing herself, for truly it was a sacrifice.</p>

<p>As most people are aware, it is not an easy matter for anyone
here to follow the career of a prisoner in Russia, for the ways of
the Russian prison administration are mysterious and dark, few
outsiders are able to learn what goes on behind the iron bars and
the ponderous doors which all too securely guard the victims of
so-called justice. But from special sources of information I
ascertained after a considerable time that Treskin was kept for a
whole year in prison before he was brought up for trial. Then it
was a hideous mockery to try him, for his brain had given way, and
he was far gone in consumption. Nevertheless, be it told to the
eternal disgrace of those who were responsible for it, he was
sentenced to banishment, his destination being Northern Siberia. In
due course he started on the dismal and dreadful journey,
accompanied by his heroic wife. But when the Ural Mountains had
been crossed he was in a dying state. He had, indeed, been dead to
the world for some time, for his mind had quite gone. He was left
behind in an <i>étape</i>, where he lingered for a few weeks, and
then departed to where man's persecution could no longer affect
him. His wife, who had so far borne up with heroic fortitude, broke
down utterly crushed and shattered beneath the blow, and in a
moment of unbearable sorrow she put an end to her own wrecked life.
It is a pitiable story, and I end as I began by saying bitterly
indeed do I regret that ever I played any part in the taking of
Treskin.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. LABOUR LOST: THE STORY OF A
SCHEME THAT MISCARRIED.</h2>

<p class="first">EVERYONE who lays claim to the possession of
even ordinary powers of observation, must frequently have been
struck by the way in which mere chance seems to influence and
control the lives of human beings. Some trifling and unforeseen
circumstance has often been the means of entirely changing one's
destiny. Read the histories of prominent men and women, kings and
queens, statesmen, lawyers, clergymen, authors of both sexes, of
soldiers, and sailors, and it will have to be admitted that
"chance" is a factor in the human sense which frequently upsets
all our calculations. It will, of course, be admitted that
"chance" is but another name for luck, good or bad as the case
may be, and people may be found who deny the existence of such a
thing as luck; but Professor de Morgan, who was one of the
greatest of mathematical writers this century has produced, and
whose classic on "The Theory of Probabilities" is too well known
to need more than a passing reference here, was firmly convinced
that some people were born naturally lucky and others unlucky. He
himself says, "The assertion that there is something in luck is
one which I do not think of questioning;" nor will any other man
think of questioning it unless he is singularly obtuse, or
singularly blind to the signs that come in his way. Indeed, if
anyone who has read thus far will pause to take a retrospective
glance at his own life he will perhaps be surprised to see how
often that life has been influenced by what appears as strokes of
bad or good luck. My story will, I think, lend peculiar point to
the foregoing argument, which has an undeniable appositeness to
what I have to tell. I might with perfect justification of the
title have called this story "By the Spin of the Halfpenny," for
it was due to the twirling of that humble coin of the realm that
the events I am about to narrate were brought about.</p>

<p>It chanced one summer in the distant past that I was rusticating
with a dear friend in the historic precincts of the grand city
which has not inaptly been dubbed the "Modern Athens" by some
enthusiastic Scotsman. The natural beauties of its situation no one
can deny, but there are certain architectural excrescences which
detract a good deal from its artistic beauty. Nevertheless,
Edinburgh has a fascination all its own, and is particularly
attractive in the long, warm days, when blue skies and bright
sunshine lend a charm to even the most squalid of places. The
friend I allude to has long since been numbered with that mighty
majority of the human race, between whom and us is the mystery of
unbroken silence, and which oft prompts the lonely-hearted to
dumbly exclaim:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Oh, for the touch of a vanished hand,<br>
And the sound of a voice that is still!"</p>

<br>

<p>The grip of ray friend's hand was that of an earnest, genuine
man; and his cheery voice was like the mellow strains of a silver
flute. We had been long "acquain," and we had wandered through many
strange lands, and seen many strange scenes together. Ah! and alas!
how evanescent are the joys and pleasures of life, and all too soon
we gaze with tearful regret on the white tombstones of our dear
ones dead and gone! But I must not moralize, though the temptation
to do so is strong when one remembers companionships that Death has
destroyed. Well, my friend and I had been spending some
delightfully pleasant days in the northern city, when, as we were
lounging and enjoying our matutinal pipe, after a hard day's work
the previous day, he suddenly exclaimed, with the easy familiarity
warranted by long and tried friendship, which had been unmarred by
even the lightest rift or the tiniest shadow:</p>

<p>"I say, Dick, old fellow, what are you going to do to-day?"</p>

<p>"Loll and dream, for I am tired," I answered.</p>

<p>"Bosh," said he, with his wholesome laugh, "You'll do nothing of
the sort. I shall carry you off somewhere."</p>

<p>"No, you won't, dear boy, I'm in for a day's laziness."</p>

<p>"You are in for a day's outing," he returned. "The balmy
atmosphere and bright sky woo one to Nature's bosom. That touches
you? Eh?"</p>

<p>I asserted with emphasis what he already knew, that I was one of
Mother Nature's most devout of worshippers; but I added that there
were times, owing to the weakness of the flesh, when even a devotee
preferred the dreamy indolence of the lotus-eater to the toil of
the pilgrim; and at that particular moment, and in that particular
instance I wished to sup of the drowsy mandragora and see
visions.</p>

<p>"By Jove," he cried cheerily, "when a fellow talks of seeing
visions it's a sign that he is growing mentally weak. Now, then,
I'm going to take you off to Stirling, thence we'll do a tramp
across the Trossachs, and as we go I'll read out '<i>The Lady of
the Lake</i>' to you, for it's one of my favourites, and I'm letter
perfect in it. That will clear the cobwebs from your brain, and
you'll talk no more of visions unless it be visions of the
beautiful 'Lady of the Lake.'"</p>

<p>"Get thee behind me, tempter of tempters," I growled. "I fain
would be alone, and yet you tempt me with a song of enchantment,
and I am weak."</p>

<p>"Aha, you yield," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, I am as inflexible as tempered steel."</p>

<p>"The spin of a coin of the realm shall decide it," said he. "Are
you on?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I cry 'heads,' and I'm sure to win."</p>

<p>He drew forth from his pocket a halfpenny, tossed it into the
air with a dexterous jerk of the thumb, and let it fall upon the
table.</p>

<p>"It's tail," he roared, as the coin settled, and so it was. "The
fates are against you; so stir yourself. There is a train in half
an hour, and see to it that the tobacco pouch is well filled. Fail
at your peril. Come, time and trains wait for no men. At least
trains do sometimes, but not for humble men like us."</p>

<p>Who could resist such a delightful despot as he was? I therefore
tacitly complied with his imperious command, and having procured my
hat and stick and light overcoat, we set off to the station, and
soon were enjoying that superb view which is seen from the "Queen's
Seat" on the wall of Stirling's ancient Castle. If we had ordered
weather to our own liking, we could have had nothing better than
the sample we were favoured with on that glorious day. A few fleecy
clouds that resembled nothing so much as drawn out white wool,
flecked the azurine sky, and there was a clearness&mdash;a
plate-glass-like atmosphere, not often experienced in the northern
regions of the kingdom. The passionate larks soared upwards with a
burst of melody that seemed to gush forth like a flood, filling the
palpitating air; and mingling with it was the rythmical murmur of
flowing water, while the senses were lulled with the aroma of the
scented breeze that blew over vast expanses of field and wood. My
friend felt the influence of these things as much as I did, for
deep in his manly heart was a rich vein of pure sentiment that
found its expression in a worshipful silence, and so we spoke not,
but gazed dreamily over the quivering landscape, each thinking the
thoughts that were in accord with his respective temperaments, and
the particular mood of the hour. Suddenly our dream was broken by
the soft voice of a woman exclaiming&mdash;"Isn't it lovely!"</p>

<p>The "lovely" jarred upon my senses, for it is a verbal barbarism
for which women are responsible; and turning I beheld a gaily
dressed pretty woman of about twenty-five in the companionship of a
sour-visaged, dark complexioned man upon whom she was leaning with
her gloved fingers of both hands interlocked about his arm, and her
brown eyes fixed on his face as if she were pleading to him to at
once endorse her verdict with regard to the "loveliness" of the
landscape over which the wand of summer had been passed, and called
forth all its innate beauty, until in colouring, artistic finish,
and detail, it presented a perfect picture of living nature.</p>

<p>The man was forty if he was a day. His hair was cut close, and
mingling with its almost jetty-blackness, were grey streaks. His
cheeks and chin were clean shaved; but a grey-streaked moustache
drooped not ungracefully over his lips. His face was not a good
one. There was a shifty foxiness in the dark eyes, and a certain
cast of feature not altogether easy to describe, which irresistibly
suggested an evil, a plotting mind. As you looked at him, and took
in the points of his physiognomy you could not associate him with a
rugged, frank, outspoken disposition.</p>

<p>You who are disposed to deny that something&mdash;and a big
something too&mdash;of the human mind cannot be read in the first
glance you get of a face must have studied your fellow-men to
little advantage. Although I could lay no claim, even in the
smallest degree, to the wonderful gift which distinguished the
renowned Lavater, I had, both intuitively and by experience, the
power of drawing certain more or less accurate deductions from
expression, contour, and detail of the face. And so I found myself
studying this man until I was sure of two things. Firstly, that he
was an enemy to well-ordered society; secondly, that at some time
or somewhere I had looked on him before.</p>

<p>His style of dress was flashy and vulgar. The cut of his
trousers&mdash;tight at the knees, bell-shaped at the
bottom&mdash;clearly indicated the coarse and narrow understanding
which is utterly incapable of distinguishing between meretricious
gaud and true art. He wore a loud crimson necktie, held in position
by a jewelled ring, the jewels of which might or might not have
been genuine; it was impossible to tell from that distance. He had
rings on his fingers also&mdash;far more than any man of refined
taste would care to wear. His coat was a rakish, cheap-cut garment,
and on his gaudy, speckled waistcoat reposed a massive,
cable-patterned chain, with numerous seals pendant therefrom. He
wore a broad-brimmed, soft felt hat that was posed not ungracefully
on his head, and which served in a minor degree to redeem the
vulgarity of his personal appearance.</p>

<p>If I had been asked there and then to have passed a verdict upon
this individual I should have said that he possessed within him the
<i>prima materia</i> of an unprincipled adventurer; one who had no
respect for the laws of <i>meum and teum</i>; and to
whom&mdash;given a certain concatenation of
circumstances&mdash;human life would have had no sacredness.</p>

<p>As the well-known proverb "Birds of a feather flock together"
expresses an irrefragable truth, I need only say at this juncture
the lady who accompanied him was neither his superior nor his
inferior. She was on a level with him. I have remarked that she was
pretty So she was, but it was a coarse prettiness that would only
bear looking at as a whole and not in detail. By the law of
affinities she had been drawn towards him by having something in
common, that something existing in a similarity of tastes, ideas,
and aspirations. The relationship in which they stood to each other
was in one sense not difficult to determine. They were lovers; that
was evidenced in her pose, her look, her general manner, and they
had the appearance of a very newly-married couple on their
honeymoon tour.</p>

<p>Now, having surveyed and weighed, so to speak, this commonplace
couple, and drawn my own inferences as to the value they were
likely to set on the rules of ethics generally recognized by well,
self-governed people, I might have dismissed them from my mind, and
turned to the more agreeable contemplation of the superb panorama
which engirt us round about, and was enhanced in picturesqueness by
the hoary towers of the time-stained castle, had it not been for
the fact that the man's face awakened some dormant memory. It was a
phantom memory&mdash;as intangible as a phantom, as fugitive as a
phantom. I had seen the face before, but where, when, and under
what circumstances I could not possibly recall just then. When your
brain is filled with many photographs of people you have seen and
known at some far-off time you cannot always put your finger on any
particular one that happens to have become faded and dingy by the
lapse of time, and say, "That is So-and-so," and fix the date of
your meeting.</p>

<p>The man replied to the woman's remark by saying:</p>

<p>"Yes, it ain't bad; but I want some grub. I'm precious
hungry."</p>

<p>Then he looked down into her upturned face with an endearing
expression, and they moved away.</p>

<p>For some moments I stood gazing after them with an aroused
curiosity, and trying to drag forth from the storehouse of my
memory something wherewith I might identify the gentleman. Suddenly
like a flash of light the remembrance I sought came to me. He was
by birth a Welshman, whose real name was Llewellyn Jones, but who
passed under many <i>aliases</i>. I had been largely instrumental
in bringing him to book many years before for an audacious forgery,
and as he had been previously convicted he received sentence of a
long term of imprisonment. As I recalled this I further remembered
that he was regarded as a clever and daring rascal, who flew at big
game.</p>

<p>"What is he doing here?" I asked myself. "What is he up to? Has
he just married that woman? Does she know the life he has led? Is
she an innocent dove that has been lured into the fowler's
net?"</p>

<p>I had little hesitation in answering "No" to the latter
question. She was not dressed in the plumes of a dove, nor were her
features expressive of a dove's guilelessness. It was infinitely
more likely she was a helpmate in the fullest sense, and that she
was willing to follow him in his course, whether for good or ill.
Ill it would be no doubt, for a man ingrained with rascality as he
was was not in the least likely to suddenly turn saint.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that I was more than ever interested in these
people now that I had determined his identity, and I resolved to
learn something more about them. If he was leading an honest life
well and good. There would be no harm done, since he would be
unaware of my solicitude about his welfare, and if it were
otherwise I might be able to render some service to the State by
spoiling his plans if they were opposed in any way to the law. My
friend had drawn from his pocket a small sketch-book, and was
amusing himself&mdash;he was very clever with the pencil&mdash;by
rapidly sketching in outline little bits of the landscape, so I
turned to him and said:</p>

<p>"I will leave you here for a while. I want to try and solve a
riddle. I will be back soon. Wait for me."</p>

<p>He merely nodded an assent to my request, for he was absorbed in
his amusement, and I moved off in the track of Jones and his
companion. I sighted them just as they were going out of the Castle
gateway, and followed them to an hotel, where I soon ascertained
they were staying under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Cotswold. They had
arrived the previous night, and had intimated their intention of
departing on the morrow. They had come down from Edinburgh, and
from inquiries they had made it was gathered that they intended to
pursue their journey through the Trossachs, and proceed to Glasgow.
The manager of the hotel regarded them as a newly-married couple,
as they seemed very loving to each other, and Mr. Cotswold was
looked upon as a man of some importance, inasmuch as he had
received numerous telegrams although he had been there so short a
time. "Numerous telegrams" was evidently a standard of
respectability and importance, according to the views of that
particular hotel-keeper.</p>

<p>Of course, I breathed no word of suspicion against the
reputation of "Mr. Cotswold," who was considered to be a good
customer, for he had ordered wine freely the night previous at his
dinner. But I telegraphed in cipher to certain official quarters
asking if any information could be given me concerning Llewellyn
Jones, who had been convicted of forgery. In due course I received
for answer the following:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"NOTHING AT PRESENT KNOWN OF JONES. HE WAS
DULY DISCHARGED AFTER SERVING HIS SENTENCE, AND IS SUPPOSED TO
HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY."</p>

<p><br>
In the meantime, that is between the despatch of my telegram and
receipt of the answer, I had returned to my friend who had been
anxiously waiting for me, as he was bent on a pedestrian tour. But
I explained to him the little business I had in hand, which was
either to justify my suspicions or satisfy myself that Llewellyn
Jones <i>alias</i> Cotswold was leading an honest life. So my
friend yielded to my request that we should only make a short
stroll, and return to the hotel in time for dinner. On getting back
from our walk I found the telegraphic answer to my question
awaiting me, and if it did nothing else it proved that for the time
being at least Mr. Jones had passed from the ken of the people who,
it might be supposed, had some interest in keeping an eye upon
him.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten by those who are disposed to think that
there was no justification for watching Jones that he came into the
category of an habitual criminal, that the law of averages was all
in favour of an habitual criminal, after a long term of
imprisonment, reverting to his old ways. For my own part, I was
morally certain that Jones was still a dangerous person. But under
any circumstances, if for no other reason than that of gratifying
an idle curiosity&mdash;if you so will it&mdash;I was determined to
know what Jones's little game was. When I had last brought him to
book he had been described as "a single man," and there was every
reason to believe that description was accurate.</p>

<p>Now, however, it appeared as if he had joined issues with one of
the opposite sex, and had united his destiny to hers; and as I felt
certain she belonged to the same <i>genre</i> as he did, it seemed
to me in the highest degree probable that when two evil things came
together evil would be the result. So as I had time on my hands I
thought I could not spend it better than by trying to discover how
Jones got his income. It was a very interesting problem, and one
which&mdash;in the interest of truth and right&mdash;was well worth
solving.</p>

<p>During the afternoon "Mr. and Mrs. Cotswold" were absent; they
hired a carriage and pair, and went for a long drive. That act
argued that they had a well-lined purse; and the argument was
strengthened by the little incident which I learnt casually that
that very morning Mr. Jones, or Cotswold, as he called himself, had
obtained change for a twenty-pound Bank of England note at the bar
of the hotel. Now, was it not a legitimate question to ask:</p>

<p>"How was it that this man&mdash;a convicted forger&mdash;who had
but recently come out of prison, was so well provided with
money?"</p>

<p>The question was one which I felt ought to be answered
correctly, and I resolved that I would answer it. I was no longer
desirous of dreaming the dreams of the lotus-eater; nor of enjoying
the drowsiness, begotten of the potent mandragora. All my faculties
were keenly alert. I had been suddenly presented with a problem,
which was well calculated to afford me the keenest interest, and I
settled down to my self-imposed task with a feeling, that if it was
not enthusiasm that spurred me, it was something very much like it.
My friend and I passed the afternoon in strolling about, and he
having the artist's love of the beautiful, watched with rapt
admiration the western sun working out prismatic effects of colour,
as it slowly sank in the fervid sky, and&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Turned the cloddy earth to glittering gold."</p>
<br>

<p>It was all very beautiful. The sky was a burning glory of
fretted fire, and in the amber light the inanimate things of earth
seemed transfigured and to take on a splendour, until there was
suggested to the beholder&mdash;at least to me&mdash;those
wonderful and daring flights of genius which Martin gave evidence
of when he gave to the world his great picture&mdash;The Plains of
Heaven. Gradually the colours faded and the purple of the gloaming
stole softly over the scene. Then we rose from the mossy bed on
which we had been reclining, and made our way back to the hotel,
which we reached as a noisy gong was calling the hungry to
dinner.</p>

<p>A goodly company in point of numbers sat down to the <i>table
d'hôte</i>, and my friend and I secured seats on the opposite side
of the table to that at which Jones and his wife sat. I had reason
to suppose that there was no likelihood of Jones recognizing me,
for when I ran him down on the last occasion I had scarcely ever
come in personal contact with him, and my plan was to endeavour to
draw him into conversation after dinner, when the gentlemen retired
to the smoking-room&mdash;I had already ascertained that he was a
smoker&mdash;and by means of carefully guarded questioning find
out, if it could be done, where he was domiciled, and if he was
really on his honeymoon tour. A little incident, however, that
occurred during the dinner-time, saved me the necessity of that
course, and here again the law of chance or luck&mdash;call it what
you will&mdash;favoured me.</p>

<p>When the dinner was about half over a waiter brought in a letter
to Jones, who, with manifest eagerness, tore open the envelope,
unfolded the letter, perused it with a gratified smile, whispered
something to his wife as he handed the letter to her to read. She
too read it with a smile of gratification, and they exchanged
looks, which indicated unmistakably that the information contained
in the letter afforded them complete satisfaction. The woman then
returned the paper to her husband, who at once proceeded to tear it
and the envelope into pieces, which he cast behind him into a
fireplace, which, for the nonce, had been turned into a little
arbour of living plants in pots. When the dinner had ended, and the
guests departed, I strolled round to that fireplace, picked up
every shred of the torn paper, and slipping them into my
pocket-book I went to the bedroom I had engaged for the night. Then
lighting the candle I sat down at the table, and arranged all the
pieces in their proper order. This, as may be supposed, was not
done without a considerable amount of trouble, but when at last I
succeeded in my task I found that the envelope bore the Manchester
postmark and the date of the previous day, and the superscription
was:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">John Cotswold,
Esq.</span>,<br>
Royal Hotel,<br>
Stirling, N.B.</p>
<br>

<p>The letter itself was written in cipher, of which the following
is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="1900031h-images/FoundAndFettered-1.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>It will be seen from this table that there were nineteen signs.
9 was repeated eleven times, and the next highest was *, while v,
2/4, and &mdash; only appear once. Now, as everyone knows, amongst
the most frequently used characters in the English language are E
and I, and bearing this in mind I felt that I had got the key to
the enigma.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="1900031h-images/FoundAndFettered-2.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>Let me proceed to explain. I noted that 9 occurred most
frequently, and * followed next in order. As E is more frequently
used than I, I tried E to begin with, thus:</p>

<p>E 2 2</p>

<p>Now came the question, what did the 2 stand for? I tried various
combinations without getting any further. The twenty-second letter
of the alphabet being V, wouldn't fit in. Then it flashed upon me
that the 2 was probably used as a divisor, and L being the twelfth
letter in the alphabet the 2 might stand for it. Twice 6 being 12,
I therefore got the word&mdash;</p>

<p>E L L</p>

<p>That, however, conveyed no intelligible meaning; but the double
L suggested naturally that A should be substituted for E, when the
word</p>

<p>A L L</p>

<p>appeared. Assuming that to be correct, it was clear that as A
was the first letter of the alphabet it was represented by 1. This
helped me on, and I at once jumped to the ninth letter, which, of
course, is I. But now I was perplexed by the *, which was a
frequently-used sign. Yet it evidently did not represent E, so I
tried N T F; but having regard to the number of times it was
repeated in the cipher, S seemed the most likely, and it gave
me&mdash;</p>

<p>ALL IS</p>

<p>In order to determine the next word&mdash;and having discovered
that 2 stood for L&mdash;I wrote down the following&mdash;</p>

<p>ALL IS LL</p>

<p>The points represented the missing letters, which I at once
filled in by W E.</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL.</p>

<p>Here I had a perfectly intelligible phrase, and it determined
that W and E were represented by 4 and 5. "But, why," I asked
myself, "did 4 stand for W, and 5 for E?" The vowel was the 5th in
the alphabet, but W certainly wasn't the fourth. "Yes, it is," I
mentally exclaimed. "It is the fourth from the last letter," and as
I could account for the 4 in no other way, I was content to let it
stand so.</p>

<p>After a little puzzling I took (14) to stand for a single
letter, and N being the fourteenth in the alphabet I got this
sentence&mdash;ALL IS WELL. N.</p>

<p>Two letters were wanted to follow the N, and it was necessary
that one should be a vowel, and by trying all the vowels I hit upon
O, which at once suggested T, which gave me the word <i>not</i>.
The next following in the cipher was +5. Knowing that 5 stood for
E, I put down the sentence&mdash;</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT E</p>

<p>It was difficult to find a single letter that would make sense,
so that it seemed pretty clear + must represent two letters, and
after various trials I was sure it was TH.</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE</p>

<p>Knowing what S L and I were represented by, I was now enabled to
expand the sentence:</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE SLI TEST</p>

<p>G H were evidently the letters wanted here to fill in the
blanks, so I had <i>slightest</i>, and now knowing the signs which
stood for the G H, I was helped on considerably. Let us see now
what we can make of it.</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN O.</p>

<p>Here it was obvious that a letter was wanted where the dot is,
and P seemed the most suitable, so we get <i>of</i>, and the
expansion can be proceeded with:</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF S S I ION.</p>

<p>The context was of great aid here, for could it suggest anything
but <i>suspicion?</i></p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF SUSPICION.</p>

<p>We at once see that U is represented by Ø and P by Ï. With this
knowledge the next word was easy enough.</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF SUSPICION. SUCCESS I
THIN.</p>

<p>No one could be blind to the necessity of putting K after the
<i>thin</i>, which turned it into <i>think</i>; K being represented
by [], we are now able to read:</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF SUSPICION. SUCCESS, I
THINK, IS CE TAIN.</p>

<p>Here we discover that the sign is R. It was now only necessary
to determine the meaning of 2/4, the figure 6, and V, to read off
the whole of the cryptograph; and I took it that 2/4 stood for the
second fourth letter, that is the fourth from A, which of course
gives us D; while 6 in the order of things would be F, and V was Y
with the tail cut off, so the communication ran thus:</p>

<p>ALL IS WELL. NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF SUSPICION. SUCCESS, I
THINK, IS CERTAIN. WILL PROCEED NO FURTHER UNTIL YOU RETURN.</p>

<p>Eureka! I cried, as I thus solved the secret which had so
strangely come into my hands. The cryptograph was by no means a
difficult one, though it took a little time to puzzle out; but
having once got the keynote the rest was easy, as will be seen when
the cipher and the solution are read together.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">

<br>

<p>With the knowledge I possessed of the antecedents of Llewellyn
Jones&mdash;or Cotswold, as he now called himself&mdash;this cipher
letter was not to be ignored. It was pregnant with a great meaning;
and to my way of thinking pointed unmistakably to villainy. This
decided me on the course to take, and I resolved to watch him. The
following day by arrangement my friend returned to Edinburgh to
square up at the hotel and forward me on my luggage, and I kept in
the wake of Jones and his wife as they proceeded through the
Trossachs to Glasgow, where they put up at a temperance hotel.
Their next movement was a trip down the Clyde to Arran and back,
and after two days spent in Glasgow they left by the night train
for Manchester, where I soon found out they had secured apartments
in a very respectable house in Strangeways, kept by a widow lady
named Higginbottom, who took in lodgers as a means of
livelihood.</p>

<p>Judicious inquiries elicited the fact that Jones had taken the
apartments in the name of Cotswold. He represented himself as an
engraver by trade; said he was going to be married, intended to
make a honeymoon tour in Scotland, and on his return settle down to
business. This was all Mrs. Higginbottom knew about him, and, of
course, she believed his statements. In order that I might the
better keep an eye upon Jones until I had satisfied myself that I
was either right or wrong in my suspicions, I secured temporary
lodgment in a house on the opposite side of the street, and from
this coign of vantage I was enabled to watch him, nor had I long to
wait for developments. A visitor called upon him; a powerfully
built, thick-set, short man, who in general appearance was
suggestive of a bull dog. And a little later the two men went out
together, and proceeded to Salford, which is now a division of
Manchester separated by the River Irwell, once a clear pellucid
stream teeming with fish; for long a repulsive open sewer, and now
within measurable distance of becoming a great waterway "for ships
that cometh from the sea," as the Irwell is to form part of the
Manchester Ship Canal.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Since this was written the Canal has been
opened throughout its entire length, and ocean-going ships are to
be seen at Salford and Manchester.]</p>

<p>At the period I am dealing with, Salford was a most undelectable
neighbourhood. For the most part the people who resided there were
factory operatives, and the huge mills that gave employment to so
many thousands of men, women, and children, ground away the lives
of the poor operatives at the same time that they spun fortunes for
the owners. Innumerable tall chimneys poured forth dense
suffocating clouds of black smoke which grimed and clagged
everything, and hung over the place like a pall of death, as indeed
it was; and what the smoke failed to do in the way of poisoning the
atmosphere, the chemical manufactories completed.</p>

<p>Salford was, and, for aught I know to the contrary, is a
dreadful place. Confining myself to the past tense, the people were
a wretched lot; stunted of limb, pallid of face, and gloomy of
disposition&mdash;as well they might be; for who can live for years
in a poisoned, reeking, darkened atmosphere without being tainted
with the gloom of his surroundings? In one of the most densely
populated parts of the place, and in a narrow dingy street, stood a
branch office of the Mid-Lancashire Banking Company. The company
occupied these premises as temporary tenants, until a new building
they were erecting in Chapel Street was completed. The street was a
street of incongruities. There were huge factories with their
smoke-emitting chimney shafts; howling wastes of plots of lands,
which were made the receptacle for all sorts of rubbish, and were
the playgrounds for the wretched, half-naked street arabs, and the
miserable children who swarmed in the neighbourhood; there were
several ramshackle hovels of houses where the fluff-covered,
reeking, pale-faced operatives of the mills found shelter; and
there were, here and there, many tumble-down wooden sheds which
were used as storage places for carts, vans, and lumber of various
kinds. There were a few hucksters' shops, and a farrier's forge.
The bank premises stood at the corner of a narrow alley that was a
thoroughfare to a parallel street, at the corresponding corner was
a two-storied house of the style and build usually found in such a
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>To this house I tracked my men one unusually dark and choking
day. The atmosphere was suggestive of a greasy, filthy sponge that
had been soaked in liquid mud and soot. Grime, grime, grime was
everywhere, and not a ray of brightness to relieve the Dantesque
gloom. A sickening odour of oily waste pervaded the air, while the
senses were dazed and the very ground trembled with the awful roar
and burr of the factory looms. It was truly a busy scene of
toiling, sweating humanity, but oh, what a hive! How the wan
toilers drooped and coughed as they passed along the black and
muddy street, or bent wearily over the looms in the mills. In this
part Grod's fair earth was polluted and damned in order that a few
men might reap fortunes, while the labourers broke their hearts in
the awful struggle to prolong their blighted lives from day to
day.</p>

<p>As soon as ever I saw Jones and his companions enter that house
I scented mischief. I found out by a little inquiry that the place
had been occupied for something like three months by a man who gave
the name of John Asquith, who lived alone, apparently, and was
supposed to be a mechanic, though nobody knew where he worked. He
allowed it to be understood that he had taken the house, which had
been untenanted for a long time, in anticipation of being married
shortly, and when he came to the neighbourhood, he brought with him
a small cartload of ramshackle furniture. There wasn't much of it,
as may be gathered from the fact that a donkey was able to draw the
lot. Asquith was looked upon with some dislike, though I could get
no better reason for this than that he did not associate with
anyone, and was very reserved. There was an air of mystery about
him that the humble folk of the neighbourhood did not like; for
squalid, miserable, and unwholesome as they were, they were
sociable folk, and given to telling each other their grievances; to
pouring their woes into each other's ears, and to learning all
about each other's little petty affairs. They therefore tacitly
resented anyone coming amongst them who was not as they were, and
did not as they did.</p>

<p>When Asquith went first to live in the house he was visited
occasionally, it had been noted, by a man and woman, who had been
seen to go late in the afternoon and leave early in the morning,
thereby raising the supposition that they had stayed all night From
the description I gathered of this man and woman I had not much
doubt that they were Jones and his wife.</p>

<p>All this to my mind was gravely suspicious. Asquith had not
rented the house for any legitimate purpose, of that I was
convinced. Some conspiracy was going on; some devilish plot being
hatched, some cunning wickedness being worked out. Jones's previous
record, and the cryptograph which I had succeeded in solving at
Stirling made that pretty evident. Jones and Asquith were
confederates, and the woman was in their confidence. Soon it began
to dawn upon me what the conspiracy probably was, but until I had
got good and reliable data to go upon I did not wish to take any
action, or cause any alarm in the neighbourhood, and of course I
was particularly anxious not to do anything calculated to frighten
the birds into flight before my net was properly spread. Therefore
my policy was a waiting one, no less than a watching one.</p>

<p>On the day in question Jones stayed a long time, and when he
left night had fallen, the whirr of the machinery had ceased, the
lights in the factories were out, and weary workers had gone to the
hovels that they called "home." I followed in his wake, and after
traversing several streets he paused before an ironmonger's shop,
and peered through the fog-blurred and dripping windows. Presently
he entered the shop, and after a time emerged again, carrying with
him a short, powerful pick and a spade. Then he made his way back
to the house. All was silent; the neighbourhood seemed deserted
now. The feeble gas lamps were powerless to penetrate far into the
murk. From a distance they looked simply like dull, glowing spots
on a black cloth. I took up my position at the entrance of the
narrow court which formed the thoroughfare between the parallel
streets, and of which I have already spoken. Not a living thing was
visible, nothing was stirring, a silence like the silence of death
had settled on the neighbourhood. You looked up, impenetrable
darkness was there; you looked around, darkness still, hardly
relieved by the points of flame which constituted the lamps. The
windows of the house occupied by Asquith revealed nothing. They
were evidently well shuttered. My ear applied to the door failed to
detect any sound. But presently I spread out my pocket-handkerchief
on the wet, slimy pavement of the court, and, kneeling down, placed
my ear as near the pavement as possible and listened intently for
some time. Then I got the sign I had been seeking, and, rising,
hurried away to my residence, for my work was finished for the
night.</p>

<p>Between ten and eleven the following morning I returned to the
neighbourhood. The factories were in full blast, and from the
various chimneys dense columns of smoke were rolling forth, while
there was a clatter of iron-shod clogs on the greasy stones as the
workers passed to and fro. All this, of course, was a sign of life,
and of the stir of life; of the beat of energy and the pulse of
industry. But, somehow or other, those great factories seemed to me
like huge Plutonian dungeons where human slaves toiled away their
wretched lives spinning gold, in order that rich men might become
richer and enjoy the fat and the fruits of the earth, while the
spinners starved and rotted in an atmosphere which was as poisonous
as the poison of upas trees or of the pestiferous air exhaled in
the Javan "Death Valley," where not even a blade of grass will
grow, and nothing that draws breath can live.</p>

<p>Entering the office of the Mid-Lancashire Bank, I asked to see
the manager in charge, and, having sent him my card, I was
presently conducted to his sanctum, which, what with bright fire
and good furniture, was like an oasis in the midst of a
blight-stricken wilderness. But even in that room there was the
fluffy atmosphere, and the nauseating reek of oily waste. You
couldn't get away from them so long as you were under the shadow of
those roaring factories.</p>

<p>The manager's name was Thorpe. He was a little grey-headed
gentleman, with a sad, sallow, and wrinkled face. He rose as I
entered, and extended his hand to me, while a weary smile played
about his mouth. He probably thought I wished to become a customer
of the bank.</p>

<p>"What can I have the pleasure of doing for you?" he asked, as he
pointed to a chair and resumed his own seat.</p>

<p>"Has it ever occurred to you, sir, that your bank might one day
be robbed?"</p>

<p>He looked startled, and stared at me. Then with a little laugh
of uneasiness, said:</p>

<p>"Every bank no doubt is more or less liable to such a
contingency, but in most cases it is a remote contingency, for
every possible precaution that human forethought can suggest is
taken to safeguard the property a bank holds in trust."</p>

<p>"That I fully understand," I replied, "but it doesn't quite
answer my question. What I wish to know is, if you have any fear
that this particular bank may be robbed?"</p>

<p>He looked at me searchingly with his small, dull eyes, and then,
with some peremptoriness, demanded to know why I questioned him. I
hastened to explain who I was, and that I had some reason for
believing that an attempt was being made to get into the bank. He
smiled again&mdash;a sort of incredulous smile&mdash;as he answered
me.</p>

<p>"This bank is unusually well protected," he said, "and I do not
think any attempt would be successful. We established our branch in
this particular neighbourhood for the convenience of the factory
proprietors, who every week want large sums of specie in order to
pay their hands, and, though we are only temporary occupants of
these premises, pending the completion of our new place in Chapel
Street, we have taken extraordinary means to protect
ourselves."</p>

<p>"You have cellars below, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but they have been made unusually strong."</p>

<p>"In what way, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"By an extra thickness of brickwork all round the walls, and
then an iron sheathing inside that again."</p>

<p>"On what day of the week have you the most money in the
vaults?"</p>

<p>"On Thursday, as Friday is the pay-day for the mill hands, and
usually from fifteen to twenty thousand pounds are drawn out."</p>

<p>"Is all that in gold?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;mainly so. Sovereigns and half-sovereigns
principally, but of course we also provide a considerable amount of
silver."</p>

<p>"How is the money brought to the bank?"</p>

<p>"In bullion boxes, which are conveyed here in charge of trusty
servants and the assistant manager of our head office. The money is
then placed in my charge, and only I and my confidential clerk have
keys of the vaults. On Friday morning the money is brought up in
bags as we require it."</p>

<p>Having listened to these particulars, I said to Mr. Thorpe:</p>

<p>"Now, sir, I don't wish to alarm you unnecessarily, but I have
no doubt in my own mind that a very cunning and daring scheme is
being worked out for gaining access to your vaults by someone who
must be well acquainted with the fact that you keep a large sum of
ready money down below every week end. I should like to frustrate
that scheme, and will do so with your assistance, but I consider it
of great importance that you should keep this matter secret for the
present."</p>

<p>"But you have not yet furnished me with any proof of the
accuracy of your assertions."</p>

<p>"If you like to remain here this evening after the bank closes,"
I answered; "together with your confidential clerk, and as many
other people as you may think necessary, I will furnish you with
proof, unless I am very greatly mistaken indeed. I suggest that you
have two or three constables, and we shall have to remain a little
time in the cellars."</p>

<p>The poor old gentleman looked so distressed that I felt quite
sorry for him; and he took some time to ponder over my proposal
before he answered me. Then as if he felt the responsibility to be
a little too great for him he said:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that we ought to take my confidential clerk into
our confidence. He is a clear-headed man, and his suggestions and
advice will be valuable."</p>

<p>Of course I assented, and the clerk was called in. His name was
Griffin. He was between thirty and forty, with an intelligent face,
and clear, searching eyes. I repeated to him what I had told his
chief, and when I had finished Mr. Griffin said, addressing the
manager:</p>

<p>"I think, sir, we should allow Mr. Donovan to guide us entirely
in this affair. It is hardly likely he would make the statement he
has made unless he had exceedingly good data to go upon. Nor is it
advisable at this period that anyone else should be let into the
secret, for the rascals who may have designs on the bank, if they
get the slightest hint that they are being watched, will take
fright at once and abandon the scheme. If we can take them
red-handed so much the better, and the more crushing will be the
defeat."</p>

<p>"Then what course do you suggest, Mr. Griffin?" asked the
manager.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, since Mr. Donovan assures us that he can furnish us
with proof, what I suggest is this:&mdash;You and I and Mr. Donovan
should descend to the vaults whenever he likes."</p>

<p>"Very well," returned the manager; "let it be so. Then will you
be here this evening, Mr. Donovan, after the bank closes?"</p>

<p>Assuring him that I would, and an hour being fixed, I went away.
Necessarily I experienced some anxiety lest I should not be able to
give him the assurance I wanted to give him, of the attempt that
was being made to get into his cellars. When I saw Jones carry the
pick and shovel into Asquith's house, it was, as it were, a
handwriting on the wall; and when I bent my ear to the greasy
pavement of the court, and heard the dull thud of the pick as it
was being used beneath, I was convinced my surmises were correct.
The rascals were digging a tunnel beneath the pavement so as to
open up a means of communication with the bank cellars. It was, of
course, a very daring scheme, involving them in an immense amount
of labour, and exacting unlimited endurance and patience. But the
rascals had, no doubt, made their calculations very well. They had
noted the juxtaposition of the house to the bank. The two buildings
were separated merely by a narrow court. The conspirators had also
made themselves well acquainted with the business of the bank, and
learned that every week end a large sum of money was temporarily
placed in the cellars, to be drawn on as acquired, in order that
the toilers in the factories might receive their wages. If an
entrance could only be effected into the cellars when the money was
there, what a haul would reward the exertions of the daring
thieves, who, with ordinary caution, might be able to get clear off
with a fortune! I knew Jones to be an exceedingly clever rascal,
with a great deal of business aptitude and knowledge, and, from
what had already come to my knowledge, I could not doubt but that
he was the leading spirit in the affair, and the whole scheme was
possibly due to his genius; and had it not been for the truly
extraordinary chance which enabled me to get on his track, his
labour and ingenuity, unworthily as they were being employed, would
have met with reward in the shape of success.</p>

<p>In accordance with the arrangement, I presented myself at the
bank at the stated hour and found Mr. Thorpe and Mr. Griffin
waiting for me. The manager was suffering from great agitation and
excitement, and I noted that he carried a ponderous oak stick with
a formidable knob at one end, as though he thought he might
suddenly be called upon to defend himself against a whole legion of
robbers. Both he and his clerk were provided with a small but
powerful lantern, and each had a key of peculiar construction to
open the doors.</p>

<p>At the top of the stone steps that led down to the cellars was a
stout iron-lined door, and that opened we were confronted with
another door halfway down, and at the bottom of the steps was a
solid iron door which might have defied the most industrious of
burglars. When this last barrier had yielded to the legitimate
keys, and had swung back on its powerful hinges, our nostrils were
filled with a mouldy, damp smell like that which comes from a
newly-opened vault where decaying humanity lies and rots. We
advanced into the cellar. It was vaulted and paved with square
flags, and the walls were sheathed with iron. It was almost
impossible to breathe until the doors had been open for some
minutes, as there was no other way of ventilation. When the three
doors were closed the vault was air-tight, and I shuddered with a
sense of horror as I thought of the hideous suffering anyone would
endure who happened to get shut in accidentally. Ranged round in
piles were oblong boxes, which were wonderfully suggestive of small
coffins, but they contained that for which men sell their souls,
and which endures when men have passed away and are forgotten.</p>

<p>Advancing to the end of the vault, the end nearest the basement
of Asquith's house, we became very silent and listened with bated
breath, our ears close to the iron-bound wall, and presently there
came to us the dull but unmistakable sounds of a pick. The rascals
were at work, and from the distinctness of the sounds it was pretty
evident that the burrow had reached within a short distance of the
bank wall.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked the manager with trembling lips and
white face.</p>

<p>"It means," said I, "that two scoundrels, one of whom has
already served a long term of imprisonment, are in
league&mdash;and, for aught T know, there may be more in the
plot&mdash;and are working industriously from the house at the
corner there, to effect a secret entrance into these cellars. For
what purpose I need scarcely explain, but men who have legitimate
business with a bank do not usually construct a secret tunnel in
order to get communication with the bank's strong room.</p>

<p>"My God! this is dreadful," groaned the poor manager, as he was
overwhelmed with the sense of the responsibility that rested on his
shoulders. "What is to be done?"</p>

<p>I smiled at his distress.</p>

<p>"Pray don't let the matter trouble you so much."</p>

<p>"Trouble me! How can I help its troubling me?" he exclaimed. "I
have been a trusted and faithful servant for fifty years, and if
this dastardly scheme succeeded I might be blamed for not having
taken all due precaution to safeguard the treasure committed to my
care."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," I answered him, "this is mere hypersensitiveness.
Even suppose that I had not forewarned you, and the scheme had
succeeded, how, in the name of common sense, could any blame attach
to you?"</p>

<p>He groaned, and passed his thin hand through his scant grey
hair.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose to do?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"The answer to that is clear. We must take these rascals
red-handed, then the punishment that will be meted out to them will
be such that they will hardly have the chance again of working ill
in this world. We will let them go on with their work, but under
our secret surveillance. When the right moment comes we will adopt
means to render their escape impossible, and they will find
themselves caged like rats."</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe was not altogether disposed to fall in with my
suggestion. He seemed to think it would be better to at once make a
police raid on Asquith's house, but as I pointed out to him that
though there would undoubtedly be presumptive evidence of their
guilty designs, an indictment might fail owing to the difficulty of
affording legal proof that the prisoners intended to get into the
bank. At any rate, so long as the fellows had the means of paying
lawyers they could throw no end of difficulty in the way of the
prosecution, and if lawyers are only paid they will employ all the
powers of their wretched trade to prove the devil himself a
maligned gentleman, and his character as white as driven snow.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffin quite supported my views, and so it was arranged
that I was to be free to take any course I thought proper.</p>

<p>As we could do nothing more that night we left the cellars,
carefully locking the doors after us, and I was glad to get into
the upper regions once more, for bad as the oily, reeking air of
the neighbourhood was it was preferable to the oppressive
stuffiness of those vaults&mdash;the storehouse of so much wealth
which had attracted the cupidity of Jones and his companion. But
gold breathes not. Neither, damp, time, nor aught else can affect
it. It endures for ever and ever, while man, who for the sake of
the yellow dross will fiercely slay his fellow, passes away after a
brief span, and crumbles into dust.</p>

<p>My next step was to obtain a key that would fit the door of
Asquith's house, and one day, having assured myself that no one was
on the premises, I entered with one of the local police
superintendents. We found a miscellaneous collection of tools of
all kinds, including crowbars, picks, shovels, wedges, and the
like. From the cellar a tunnel was being driven in the direction of
the bank cellar, and the dirt and <i>débris</i> that was brought
out was piled in all the lower rooms, and a little square backyard
was full. We calculated that the workers had only about another
yard to get through before being in contact with the bank walls,
and to break a hole in the brickwork and the iron sufficiently
large to admit of a man entering would be a comparatively light
task to such desperate and determined men, who had not been
deterred by many yards of solid earth and rock&mdash;for rock had
been encountered, and had to be cleared away with the help of steel
wedges and a sledge hammer wielded in a restricted space, and under
great difficulty. Such industry and perseverance were well worthy
of a better cause. But Jones &amp; Co. were playing for a big
stake, and after labour would come the reward. At least so they
hoped, and so it might have been had my dear friend on that fateful
day in Edinburgh not spun his halfpenny, which decided that I
should go with him to Stirling.</p>

<p>Of course, we disturbed nothing whatever in Asquith's house, but
left everything just as we found it, and from that day we arranged
to have a nightly guard in the bank.</p>

<p>For three long weeks this vigilance was kept up. The progress of
the workers was necessarily slow, and they had to work under every
possible disadvantage. At last, however, we were made aware that
they had reached the basement wall, and the following night they
made their attack upon it. The brickwork was soon broken through,
and then they were confronted with the iron lining. That required
different treatment to bricks and mortar, and we heard the
scratching of a pair of callipers as a circle was traced on the
iron, and this circle would have to be cut out. That part of the
work required to be carried out as speedily as possible, for as
soon as ever they broke through the iron their plot would be
revealed to the first person who entered the cellar. The robbers,
therefore, could only count upon a few hours in which to cut away
the iron and carry off the boxes of money, and that would have to
be done during the time that intervened between Thursday night and
Friday morning, because it was on Thursday afternoon that the large
amount of money was placed in the strong-room ready for the Friday
morning's run; and it was hardly supposed that Jones &amp; Co. were
ignorant of that fact.</p>

<p>It was then Tuesday, but we did not relax our vigilance the
following evening, though, as I anticipated, the workers did not
work. On Thursday night I had with me six stalwart companions, and
we concealed ourselves in the vault, ready and anxious for the
<i>dénouement</i> of the startling little drama, while outside four
plain-clothes constables were stationed, with instructions to keep
a sleepless watch on Asquith's house. We were aware that the two
men and Jones's wife were there that night, and we felt sure we
should trap them so that escape would be impossible.</p>

<p>Within half an hour of the bank being closed the rascals
commenced work with a drill. The process they adopted was to drill
a series of holes all round the line of a circle, by which means
they would be enabled to remove the circular plate of iron, and
thus have a large opening to enter and exit by. Steadily they
worked; the drill pierced rapidly, and through the holes made the
rays of the light they had shot in long pencils. Two hours passed.
The excitement was intense, for we knew the supreme moment was at
hand. At last the circular plate that had been cut out fell with a
clang on to the floor, and through the opening came a flood of
light from three or four lanterns suspended in the tunnel, and by
that light we saw Jones and his brawny companion stripped to the
waist, save for their flannel singlets, and looking grimy and
sweaty after their labour, while behind them, with eager, curious
face, was Mrs. Jones, who peered at the hole with anxious, greedy
eyes. The wealth she had no doubt been dreaming of seemed to her
now to be within grasp, and possibly visions of the things wealth
can procure passed before her mental gaze.</p>

<p>Asquith came through the hole first, and as he wiped his
perspiring brow with the back of his grimy hand he said:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad that bit of work's over anyway. It's been a hard
job, mate, eh? But the rhino's ours; that's something, and our
plans have been so well made that before the sleepy cops can wake
up we'll clear out of the blooming country."</p>

<p>"All right, Jack; but don't let's waste time now," called out
the woman. "Pass the stuff out. My fingers are itching to handle
some of it."</p>

<p>"Don't burst yourself, Liz. You always were so blarsted
impatient. Let me get my breath first." Here he pulled a flask out
of his trousers' pocket and took a long swig of its contents. That
done, he smacked his lips, screwed on the top of the flask, which
he restored to his pocket, and then, telling Jones to hand him a
jemmy which was lying on the ground, he advanced into the cellar,
and proceeded to prise off the lid of one of the bullion boxes.
That was soon done, and his great strength&mdash;for he was a
powerful man&mdash;enabled him to carry the box to the opening, and
Llewellyn Jones and his wife at once began to fill a sack they had
brought with them with the sovereigns the box contained. Now had
come our moment of action. At a signal from me, my men sprang
forward and pinned Asquith, though he struggled and fought
desperately. The shock of our sudden appearance caused Jones's wife
to drop down in a dead faint, while he, with a cowardly regard for
his own safety only, fled, but only to fall into the hands of the
watchers outside the house.</p>

<p>The stupefying amazement, the chagrin, the exasperation of these
men, when they found that the result of all their months of labour
was lost, may be far better imagined than described. Their plans
had been well made, well carried out, and success must have seemed
certain to them, as day by day they advanced in their work, and no
doubt success would have crowned their efforts had it not been for
the spin of the coin.</p>

<p>When the evidence against the man came to be worked up, it was
found that Asquith's real name was Robert Corn well. He was a
native of Manchester, and the son of respectable people, who had
formerly kept a broker's shop in Hulme, which is one of the
divisions of Manchester. He had been a wild, reckless young man,
however, and spent many years on the gold diggings of Australia,
but had done no good for himself, and at last returned home. The
woman was his sister. She had been in domestic service, and had
made the acquaintance of Jones one night at the theatre. There is
reason to suppose that at that time she did not know anything of
his shady career. At any rate through her intimacy with him he and
her brother were brought together, and she, it would appear,
readily lent herself to their schemes and plans. And a robbery
committed at the house where she had been in service previous to
marrying Jones&mdash;for married to him she was&mdash;was traced to
her, and the money she thus secured enabled her and her husband to
go on their little jaunt to Scotland. Thus their scheme was
frustrated, and their labour was lost.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to say that each of them received a most
exemplary punishment, though a desperate attempt was made to prove
that the woman simply acted under the controlling influence of her
husband. That plea might have had weight had it not been proved
that she had been guilty of the robbery at the house where she had
been in service.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. HENGALD THE DREAMER</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR nearly three years there lived as a lodger in the house of a
struggling artist named Hendrik Peterfield a lady who was known as
Mrs. Sybil Felstead. For reasons that will presently be understood
it is necessary that I should give some particulars about this
lady. But first let me say that Mr. Hendrik Peterfield was a young
married man, with a wife and two young children. He had come to
London to seek his fortune as many another had done before him, and
inclination no less than tastes had directed his footsteps to the
classic neighbourhood of Hampstead, beloved alike by poet and
artist. Peterfield was tempted to take a house beyond his means,
and as he had little or no connection he had to eke out a miserable
existence of genteel poverty by doing such work as he could obtain
for book illustration and for illustrated papers. It was at the
best but a sorry business, and between hunger and duns he'd a sore
time of it, until one day the good fairy of struggling genius
placed a stroke of good luck in his way. It is not always that she
does this to those who tempt fate with pen or pencil, for as often
as not struggling and unrecognized intellect starves and rots, and
drops into its grave unknown and unsung. But it was not so in
Peterfield's case, for at a moment when he was sunk into the depths
of a dark despair owing to his inability to meet the claims of
sundry creditors, including a merciless landlord, who had given
twenty-four hours' grace only for the payment of half a year's rent
then overdue, a lady, elegantly dressed, stepped from a cab, and
knocked at his door, induced to do so by a card in his parlour
window, which set forth that "apartments" were to let. He had
resisted for a long time the temptation to resort to this
questionable mode of increasing his income until his wife had
persuaded him that, for the children's sake, he ought not to be
ashamed of doing anything honest that would be likely to bring in
the means to enable him to pay his way. So, with a sigh, he
yielded; the card was placed in the window, and almost the first
applicant for particulars of the apartments was the lady in
question, who at once described herself as "Mrs. Sybil
Felstead."</p>

<p>She stated that being somewhat delicate in health, she had been
advised to remove from Kennington, in the south of London, where
she had been living for six years, and try the more bracing air of
the northern heights. She had been struck&mdash;so she
said&mdash;by the picturesque appearance of Mr. Peterfield's house,
and it really was a picturesque place, for it was an old-fashioned
building, with two oriel bay windows in front. It stood in about
half an acre of ground, and was partly covered with ivy and
Virginia creeper, and the artist's wife, being a woman of taste and
feeling, had the curtains and blinds at the windows very nattily
arranged, while the garden in front was prim and neat. The most
casual passer-by, if he had cared to note, must have been struck by
the neatness of the surroundings, and he would probably have
reflected that the people who resided in the old-time house were
not without artistic feeling, and artistic feeling they had without
doubt. These little matter-of-fact details are touched upon, as
they serve to show how like draws like, and had it not been for
them the probabilities are Mr. Peterfield would have had the
bailiffs in his house in a few days, and in his despair and wounded
pride he might have done something desperate. As it was, the lady
calling herself Mrs. Sybil Felstead expressed herself as "charmed"
with everything&mdash;the apartments, the house, the artist and his
wife, and their two children&mdash;and she announced her intention,
if Mr. and Mrs. Peterfield were agreeable, to move in on the
morrow.</p>

<p>The young people were not used to letting apartments, and in
verity they were not what is termed "practical people." They had
none of the huckstering spirit of the trader within them, and knew
infinitely more of art&mdash;both of them&mdash;than they did of
the world in general, and human nature in particular. Such people
are apt to aim at living in an ideal world of their own creation,
and so long as things go smoothly it's all right. But when they
have to fight with the wolf and the tempter, and to deal with the
pitiless spirit of greed, covetousness, selfishness, and other sins
of the human heart, it is all wrong. Nevertheless, Mrs. Peterfield,
although neither hucksterer nor mercenary, ventured to hint to Mrs.
Felstead that in such cases it was perhaps not unreasonable to look
for a reference, whereupon the elegantly dressed young lady smiled
sweetly at what possibly she thought was the simplicity of the
artist's wife, and, opening a Russian leather satchel she carried,
she drew forth a cheque-book with the remark&mdash;"Perhaps the
best reference I can give you is a cheque for a quarter's rent in
advance."</p>

<p>As the rent she was to pay for the suite of rooms she had agreed
to take was four guineas a week it necessarily followed that a
quarter, or thirteen weeks, would amount to the substantial sum of
£54 12s. The artist and his wife both protested, but the lady was
pressing, and they yielded. She declared that she was so charmed
with the place and them that there was no fear of her removing in a
hurry, and when they ventured to hint at possible contingencies she
laughed sweetly again, and said she was quite prepared to take the
risk. So the cheque was duly drawn out and left uncrossed, and,
being on a city bank, providing that she really had an account
there, the impecunious artist could possess himself of the money
within an hour or so.</p>

<p>Now, dear captious reader, if there be any such amongst those
who follow my narrative, and you, still more captious critic, if
you are disposed to find fault with Mr. and Mrs. Peterfield for
being thus easily satisfied, must make every allowance for the
circumstances in which they were placed. And, moreover, they were
not worldly people&mdash;in the objectionable sense of the
word&mdash;and intending no evil themselves they suspected none in
others. But whatever may be said or thought, the fact remains that
the cheque was accepted, and then the lady proceeded to explain
that she was very quiet, studious, fond of music, retiring in her
habits, and not given to visiting much or receiving visitors. She
further explained that she was married, though owing to reasons she
could not state, but which were perfectly legitimate, she could not
live with her husband for the time being, but that he occasionally
visited her. Owing to a shyness, however, that was "an absolute
disease with him," he could not bear to be seen, and she expressed
a politely-worded hope that when he came he might not be made the
subject of prying curiosity. So, a tacit understanding having been
arrived at on this point, the lady took her leave until the
following day, when she was to arrive and enter into possession of
her apartments about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Peterfield proceeded to the bank, presented
the cheque, which was promptly honoured, and with, it is reasonable
to assume, a heart that had lightened in a corresponding ratio to
the increased weightiness of his purse, which had been so long
well-nigh empty, he returned to the bosom of his family, and
proceeded to the disbursement of some of the most pressing claims
against him. Thus it seemed as if the shadow which had hung over
his little household had lifted, and the sun of prosperity was
about to break forth. The following day, near about the hour Mrs.
Felstead had named, she drove up in a hansom followed by a
four-wheeler, which was simply filled with her personal luggage,
consisting of boxes and packages, and she carried in her arms an
exquisite little flossy, silken-haired spaniel, the name of
which&mdash;she told the Peterfields&mdash;was Glory. It was an
original name for a dog, but Mrs. Felstead was not a commonplace
person, and therefore there was no wonder that she avoided giving
her pet dog a commonplace name; and, now, let me proceed to draw a
pen and ink portrait of Mrs. Felstead. The words are not mine, but
those of Peterfield, the artist, with only slight variation.</p>

<p>Her age&mdash;a very delicate point when dealing with a
lady&mdash;could not have exceeded seven-and-twenty; she was
<i>petite</i>, with a most engaging, ingenuous, and simple manner.
If it be true that a woman's hair is her glory, then, indeed, Mrs.
Felstead had every cause to be proud, for not only as regards
length and quality was it unique; but it was of that rich, very
dark golden brown now rarely seen, and, furthermore, it was full of
natural, wave-like ripples. She had a face that reminded one of an
ivory-painted portrait, not only as regards its colouring, but its
perfectness of contour and regularity of feature. From the purely
picturesque point of view it lacked nothing. The mouth, the nose,
the eyes, were a study. The eyes were violet. No other colour would
accurately describe them. She had faultless teeth, and so
wonderfully delicate was the colouring of the skin that Mrs.
Peterfield, with the severe criticism of her sex in this respect,
felt sure at first it was the result of art and not of nature. In a
little while, however, she had to confess she had done her lodger
an injustice in thought, for the lady used no meretricious aids to
enhance the exquisiteness of her complexion. Her figure was lithe,
supple, and willow-like, not altogether above the hypercriticism of
severe art tastes, but sufficiently near perfection to satisfy
ordinary people. She had small hands, small feet, and ears so
delicately moulded that they could not have been improved upon. To
use Mr. Peterfield's identical words, she was "an incarnate poem."
Allied to this physical beauty was a taste that perfectly accorded
with it. Vanity she had&mdash;what woman has not?&mdash;but she did
not outrage the true canons of art by a <i>bizarre</i> style of
dress. Her clothing was simple and chaste, and of the very finest
quality. Her vanity chiefly displayed itself in a love for
jewellery. She seemed to have rings and things for every day in the
week, and she seldom wore less than half a dozen costly rings on
her small white fingers at one time.</p>

<p>As regards the sensuous tastes of this dainty creature, they
were in keeping. She had the most delicate appetite, and cared only
for the most aesthetic forms of food. She drank sparingly of the
best of claret; occasionally she took a little champagne. She was
lavish in her expenditure, and seemed to have ample means at her
disposal. She paid promptly by cheque for everything that she
ordered, and her wardrobe was so extensive that it would have more
than sufficed for half-a-dozen ordinary women. She played
splendidly on the piano, and sung in a low musical voice with great
taste and feeling, often accompanying herself on the guitar, which
she touched with the skill of an artiste. She was passionately fond
of reading, poetry being her chief pabulum, but what was very
unusual for a woman, she showed an extraordinary partiality for De
Quincey.</p>

<p>To use a cant phrase&mdash;she never gave herself away. She was
singularly reserved, with a dignified manner that seemed to
silently resent anything approaching easy familiarity. She showed
great fondness for the artist's children; and yet, in a sense, she
kept them at a distance. If in any connection with her they
presumed upon the license peculiar and allowed to all children, she
instantly checked it. Within a few days of her taking up her
residence in Peterfield's house, she remarked one day to Mrs.
Peterfield, in a manner which seemed to imply that she had a deep
design in the remark, but once having made it it was never again to
be referred to.</p>

<p>"I am a sort of mystery. I know that most people think me so,
and I want to remain so. I live in a world with which I am not
altogether in accord, but I try to make a world of my own, and I
live my life according to my own views. No one has a right to tear
asunder the pages of that life, and hold them up to the vulgar gaze
of the mean-spirited and hypocritical rabble, who eat, drink,
cozen, cheat, and while their hearts are rotten with lies and sin,
bow down and mock Heaven with their prayers."</p>

<p>No wonder that simple-minded little Mrs. Peterfield was
astounded at this original&mdash;as coming from one of her own
sex&mdash;expression of sentiments, which embodied a philosophy far
more masculine than feminine. But though she would have liked to
have entered into an argument on the subject, not the slightest
encouragement to that end was given, and thenceforth it was a dead
letter, and Mrs. Felstead was allowed to remain a mystery. That is,
no attempt was made, so far as the Peterfields were concerned, to
draw aside the curtain and peep behind it.</p>

<p>Very soon the strange lodger showed that she was deeply
interested in Peterfield's work, and when she learnt, as she did
partly by inference and partly by obvious signs, that he embodied
in his own proper person an illustration of the oft-told
tale&mdash;genius struggling with poverty&mdash;she generously
offered to lend him money. Pride and self-respect prevented him
from accepting the offer, and then she commissioned him to paint
her portrait, causing him unusual trouble with a fixed purpose.
First she tried one pose, and didn't like it, and he was compelled
to wipe out the work he had begun. Then she did not like the way
she had arranged her hair, and when she saw it on the canvas she
said: "Oh, that won't do; you must paint it over again." At last,
however, he was allowed to finish the picture, and then she forced
upon him a cheque for three hundred pounds; and when he insisted
that it was far in excess of the value of his work she answered
that as she had been a particularly unruly subject and wasted much
of his time, it would have to be taken into consideration, for she
did not like to be under an obligation to anyone. It was gracefully
and kindly done, clearly with a view to an avoidance of wounding
the artist's susceptibilities. At any rate that was the
construction I put upon her act, when all the details of the story
gradually came to my knowledge in much the same way as I am
chronicling them. And Peterfield could hardly be justly censured
for allowing his liberal patron to thus assist him in his struggle
to make a name, and to do his work without being subjected to the
harassing effects of vulgar poverty. And now I come to the most
delicate point in the story, but let no one judge hastily, for few
will guess the truth or foreshadow the sequel.</p>

<p>For close on three years Mrs. Felstead resided with the
Peterfields, and the affairs of the household went on smoothly and
harmoniously. The strange lodger had certainly brought the artist
better fortune. His worldly affairs had improved; his pictures were
selling; he was becoming known. For two years or more Mrs. Felstead
received a visitor&mdash;a male visitor; so much was known, but no
one under that roof save herself ever saw him. She always admitted
him. Probably he gave some signal which she understood. She
occupied a front parlour, with the window facing the garden, and
mayhap he tapped on the pane. He did not come regularly, and yet
the inference was that she understood when to expect him. It was
always dark when he arrived; sometimes he would stay for two or
three hours; at others he would not exceed half an hour. She had
always shown, rather by silence than otherwise, a strong desire
that he should not be seen by the members of the household, or his
presence known. The Peterfields, therefore, were careful not to
cause her annoyance by displaying curiosity, and the
servants&mdash;two of whom were kept&mdash;had orders to avoid, if
possible, coming in contact with the mysterious visitor. Thus
things went on, as I have said, for more than two years, and Mrs.
Felstead seemed perfectly happy and contented. If she was not as
other women were, she was none the less charming. Peterfield and
his wife indeed seemed to look upon her with feelings akin to a
wordless admiration. His poetic and artistic fancy found in her a
sort of ideal, in which apparently there was nothing base, nothing
sordid, commonplace, or objectionable. Tender she was, and sweet of
disposition, with a very womanly nature withal, and yet she was not
as other women. The frivolities which her sex are generally
supposed to find pleasure in had no attractiveness for her. She
loved solitude; she shrank from the vulgar gaze; and in the
companionship of Glory, her silken spaniel, she evidently found, in
the absence of her lord, it may be presumed, all that she required.
A passing word anent that same spaniel. He was as original and
peculiar as his mistress, and seemed like her to love solitude. He
showed no disposition, at any rate, to mix with his own species,
and if by chance he was separated from his mistress, for even a
brief time, he evinced the greatest uneasiness and distress. And in
return for this attachment the gentle lady bestowed a ceaseless
care, and lavished her caresses upon him. In this way a period of
time elapsed nigh on to three years, during which the strange lady
had guarded her secrets so well that no one of the household knew
anything more of her history than was known on the first day that
she called about the apartments. It was testimony to her
originality of character that she had been able to refrain so long
from making confidants. Nine hundred and ninety women out of every
thousand would certainly have opened their hearts to the landlady,
and have shown her some of its most precious secrets; for to women
generally mutual confidences are as the breath of their nostrils,
and though they may hate each other with a consuming hatred that
finds no expression in words, they trust each other with their
secrets, they exchange views on men and things, and above all they
find in dress an evergreen subject of endless conversation. But
Mrs. Felstead must have been made of very different stuff, for she
was not a chatterer, and only on very rare occasions had she
canvassed her landlady's opinion on some particular article of
attire she happened to be wearing, and yet, to reiterate, she was
not lacking in vanity. Of her hair she appeared to be particularly
proud; and though it was always arranged with the most perfect
taste, and with an apparent negligence, she spent hours in
producing that very effect of negligent simplicity. Then again, her
extensive wardrobe afforded her an ever varying change of costume,
and seeming to tire soon of her things she was constantly
discarding them and buying new ones, and the cast-off ones were
bestowed upon Mrs. Peterfield for that lady's children, or to be
used in any other way Mrs. Peterfield might think proper. It was
noted that the strange lodger always adorned herself with the most
exquisite taste on those evenings when her lover or lord came to
visit her. She would wear flowers in her hair, and flowers on the
bosom of her dress, and the faint odour of violets she exhaled told
of the perfume she used.</p>

<p>It chanced at last one night that Mr. Peterfield was approaching
his house up the little front garden, when, just as he reached the
steps, which were overshadowed by a portico and lighted by a
suspended globular gas lamp, the door suddenly opened and a man
came down the steps hurriedly. He passed Peterfield without sign or
word, and disappeared into the darkness. The man was the mysterious
visitor who for so long had come and gone without being observed.
It may be imagined that the artist could see very little of him,
except in a general way; and yet for an instant or two, as the rays
of the suspended lamp swept across the face, its features were
distinctly revealed. Peterfield was almost fascinated by that brief
glimpse, for the face was one of so distinct a type that it could
not be forgotten. The features seemed to Le chiselled with the
delicacy of some rare carving in marble. The mouth was hidden by a
moustache that curled over it, the eyes glowed as if they were
points of highly-polished ebony, and the whole face appeared to
wear a sardonic expression. The man was intensely dark, as it
seemed to Peterfield; medium of height, with a slim figure, and a
snakelike gracefulness of motion. He wore an Inverness cape, and a
dark-coloured slouched hat pushed off the forehead. Such was the
hurried mental photograph Peterfield was enabled to take; and, as
an artist, he observed in a way that a casual observer would not
have done.</p>

<p>In recalling the impression made upon him by this unexpected
<i>rencontre</i>, he said he felt he had looked upon a remarkable
man of a distinctly original type. Once again they were destined to
meet. This time it was in the passage of Peterfield's house. He was
ascending to the upper storey, and reached the passage just as the
drawing-room door opened and the stranger came forth. Owing to the
brighter light the artist was enabled to get a better view of the
mysterious man, and he noticed that he had a pale olive complexion,
that his hair was intensely dark, and his eyes almost unnaturally
brilliant.</p>

<p>"He struck me," said Peterfield, "as being a man of lofty
intellect&mdash;scholar, student, and poet in one. What I mean by
that is, he was of the type we associate with great intellectual
power. His face and expression were certainly those of a
thinker&mdash;a philosopher mayhap&mdash;at any rate of a man who
could not be ranked as commonplace, and one who was not likely to
find pleasure in the ordinary pursuits of ordinary men. And
something in his expression indicated to my mind very clearly that
he was a confirmed cynic."</p>

<p>Mrs. Felstead had followed him into the passage, but they both
drew back when they noticed Peterfield, who, however, got something
more than a mere glimpse of the man, and came to the conclusion
that he was, in a word, "a singular being." He and the lady
apparently were well matched, and probably each found in the
other's society that enjoyment which nothing else and nobody else
in the world could give them.</p>

<p>At that time all this, of course, was mere inference, the result
of rapid deduction from such signs as were presented to the
artistic eye of one used to generalizing quickly, and it is set
forth as interesting, inasmuch as it serves to show that Mrs.
Felstead's visitor was not likely to be overlooked even in a
crowd.</p>

<p>The following morning she remarked to her landlord, "You saw my
visitor last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer. "But it was a mere chance."</p>

<p>"And yet he was greatly annoyed."</p>

<p>"Indeed," exclaimed Peterfield, not without a feeling of alarm
lest the little incident, trifling as it was, might be the means of
interrupting the harmony that had so long existed between him and
his lodger.</p>

<p>"He is very, very peculiar," continued Mrs. Felstead with a
seriousness of tone that was unusual with her. "He has a perfectly
morbid dread of making acquaintances, and so nervously sensitive is
he that he cannot bear to be even looked at by strangers, hence the
reason that he never goes out except at night. Of course I can
understand that all this will seem very strange to you. You may
even think it is ridiculous; but then we are not all constituted
alike, and I thank goodness for it. Most people are so very
commonplace that they disgust one with their monotonous
sameness."</p>

<p>Mr. Peterfield hastened to assure his lodger that he would
endeavour for the future to avoid coming in contact with the man of
mystery, whereupon the lady relaxed the sternness of her features,
and smiling sweetly as was her wont, she said:</p>

<p>"Ah, it is a pity that he is so strange, so eccentric. You would
like him, for you have tastes in common. He loves the picturesque,
the artistic side of life, and he has a creative fancy that is only
given to genius."</p>

<p>She had never before gone even so far as this, meagre as it was,
in speaking of him, and it tempted Peterfield to respond to a
strong impulse, and put this question:</p>

<p>"I should like to ask you, Mrs. Felstead, if that gentleman is
your husband?"</p>

<p>The question drove the smile from her face, and she drew herself
up in a haughty, proud, disdainful way, while her soft eyes flashed
with the light of anger.</p>

<p>"Husband," she echoed with a sneer. "He is greater than a
husband. He is my lord, my king, my ideal." Then she swept into her
room and closed the door with a violence that too plainly indicated
the ruffled state of her feelings.</p>

<p>Mr. Peterfield would scarcely have been human if he had not
experienced some concern, for selfishness in a greater or lesser
degree is absolutely inseparable from human nature. To his
beautiful, if strange, lodger, he owed the success that had come to
him, and he experienced something like a superstitious dread that
if she went away his good luck would depart too. So there and then
he made a resolve that he would use every endeavour to undo the
mischief he seemed to have done, and to salve over the wounded
feelings of the hypersensitive lady. But he knew that it would not
do to force the opportunity for this. He must bide his time until
chance favoured him. He told his wife what had happened, and she
agreed with him that it was advisable to try and pacify Mrs.
Felstead if she really was offended, but she took the womanly view
of the case, and said lightly:</p>

<p>"But, there, don't let it concern you. It's a mere bit of
feminine stupidity. She'll repent it in a very short time. Some
women are so touchy when a man is in question. I think you had
better leave the matter to me. I've no doubt I shall be able to put
it all right."</p>

<p>To this the husband assented, and a couple of days later Mrs.
Peterfield told him that all was well. She had spoken to the
lodger, and that lady had laughed in her usual genial way, saying
she was annoyed by the question at the time, but she had since
forgotten all about it.</p>

<p>About a week after this, Mrs. Felstead went to Peterfield's
studio, which was at the top of the house, and said to him:</p>

<p>"I have a strange fancy, Mr. Peterfield. Some years ago I was in
Florence, and in one of the galleries there I saw a picture that
has haunted me ever since. I forget who the artist was, but this
was the subject: A radiantly-beautiful woman, who had died young,
was arrayed as if for a wedding. She was lying on a couch of
flowers, her head resting on a silken cushion, while her
magnificent hair was unbound, and framed her face, as it were, in a
mass of old gold. And oh! that face&mdash;how sweet, how angelic it
was! A smile rested there. The cheeks were tinged with a faint
flush, like that which the setting sun lends to the lily. There was
no sign of pain or sorrow there, but an expression of perfect joy,
of unalloyed bliss. She was dressed in a loose, flowing robe of
white crape trimmed with gold, and fastened by a gold zone at the
waist. Her delicate hands were crossed on her bosom, and held a
bunch of gardenias and maiden-hair. The title given to the picture
was 'The Bridal Couch of Death.' It was one of the most exquisite
things I have ever seen. Now, I want you to paint a similar
picture. I will be the model. And the subject is so full of
poetical fancy that your artistic genius should revel in it."</p>

<p>Strange as the request was, Mr. Peterfield did not attach any
importance to it, as coming from so eccentric a lady, and he
undertook the commission. All the details of dress and pose as she
had described them she carried out, and he produced a picture
worthy of so beautiful a subject, so fantastic a theme. She
declared it was "ravishing and divine," and she had it placed on an
easel in her room. A few days afterwards she said she was going to
send the picture away, and a man would come for it that evening.
The man duly came, but nobody saw him save Mrs. Felstead, and the
wonderful picture disappeared.</p>

<p>A week elapsed. It was in the month of June, when one morning
the housemaid entered Mrs. Felstead's sitting-room to perform some
necessary duties. As she opened the door she was startled to
observe the lady lying on the table, which was strewn with flowers.
She was attired exactly as in the picture, and her magnificent hair
was arranged with studied negligence about the beautiful face and
neck. The hands, clasping a bunch of gardenias and maiden-hair,
were crossed upon her bosom, and a smile lingered upon the white
face, upon which the light through the half-drawn curtains of the
window fell.</p>

<p>The girl called the lady by name. There was no answer. She
touched the hands, and she touched marble, for Mrs. Felstead was
stone dead.</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Felstead was stone dead, and beside her on a crimson
cushion was Glory, the silken spaniel, dead too. The poetry and the
picturesqueness of the affair were soon destroyed by doctor,
police, and coroner. The lady was arrayed as if for a bride, and
bride she was. Death had wooed and won her. But it was no vulgar
form of death that had suddenly overtaken her, for there was no
wound, no external signs to indicate how the spirit had been let
loose from its earthly tenement. She had not been ill. All the time
she had lived with the Peterfields she had never consulted a
medical man, never complained of ache or pain, never displayed any
symptom of disease. Therefore, her end coming as it had done, so
unlooked for, so unanticipated by those who resided with her under
the same roof, was startling and significant, and suggested either
self-slaughter or murder. Law takes no note of sentiment, while the
Muse shivers with fright, and flies at the very name. Law in the
abstract embodies justice, sometimes tempered with mercy, but law
in principle is hard, stern, unpitying, sordid, and relentless,
while those who live by it often make Truth blush and Humanity
weep. In Mrs. Felstead's case the "majesty" of the law had to be
vindicated, for no man has a right to take the life of another, and
no one is justified in laying violent hands upon himself. Life is
God-given, and until God chooses to take back that which He has
bestowed, it is a sin to anticipate the end.</p>

<p>Now there was much mystery in Mrs. Felstead's end, inasmuch as
she had realized the picture which Peterfield had painted for her,
the original of which, according to her account, was in a gallery
at Florence. From the very first one of two things seemed
absolutely certain&mdash;either she had been murdered or she had
committed suicide. Whichever it was, death had in her case been
made beautiful and poetical, and the highest form of artistic
feeling had been displayed. But the world is practical&mdash;life
is sacred, and so it had to be determined by such means as the
minds of men have devised how the lady had come to die so suddenly.
It was noted by those who were amongst the first to enter the room
that a strange sickly odour pervaded the atmosphere. The medical
men recognized this odour, and when they came to prosecute their
surgical researches for the hidden cause of death they were enabled
to determine that the cause was chloroform. Both the lady and the
dog had died by the same means. Then the law in solemn voice
demanded to know whether the lady had administered the deadly
essence to herself, or whether it had been administered by some
other hand. In the one case it would be suicide; in the other
murder. On me devolved the task of using every endeavour to answer
the stern question of the law.</p>

<p>Detail by detail I learnt the story of the lady as I have given
it, from the moment when she first called about the apartments down
to the hour of her mysterious death. Mr. Peterfield was an
intelligent man; a man of observation, and one who knew the value
of <i>immutiae</i>. And in her own way his wife was no less
intelligent. Necessarily they were both greatly distressed by their
lodger's death. They had become very fond of her; and they could
not fail to be very painfully conscious that in her they had lost a
friend; a friend who had brought sunshine into their home, who had
changed despair into hope, poverty into prosperity. From the very
first not the faintest shadow of suspicion rested on them. In the
fable, the owner of the goose that laid the golden eggs slew her in
order to determine the cause of the extraordinary supply of wealth.
But in the Peterfields' case no such fantastic curiosity
existed.</p>

<p>My investigations soon led me to the conclusion that Mrs.
Felstead had been murdered; and her murderer was the mysterious
stranger whom she had spoken of as being her lord, her king. It was
known that he was in the house on the night preceding her death. He
was heard to come about eight o'clock; but at what hour he had
departed no one could say. It must have been pretty late; perhaps
not long before the servant entered and found the poor lady arrayed
on the bridal couch of death. It was no ordinary crime; it was not
a crime in which lucre or revenge had been the motive. The woman, I
was sure, had been killed for the sake of a sentiment, and he who
killed her was a madman. The more I went into the story the more
surely did my inferences and deductions crystallize that view of
the case in my mind.</p>

<p>The motive, therefore, was&mdash;a sentiment.</p>

<p>The sentiment was&mdash;an outcome of madness.</p>

<p>These two features of the strange case I steadily kept in view
in my endeavours to unravel the mystery, for I think it will be
admitted that there was a good deal of mystery surrounding the
whole affair. Nor did I lose sight for a moment of the importance
of the picture painted by Peterfield, and which had been removed
from the house. That picture was a link in the tragedy, and there
was some strange connection between it and the lady's death;
therefore the link would have to be found. Of course a search was
made, and a very diligent search, too, by the police for chloroform
in Mrs. Felstead's apartments. No vestige or sign of it, however,
was forthcoming. Yes, stay, a sign was there. On the floor of the
room in which her dead body was lying was picked up a large white
silk handkerchief, which had unmistakably been saturated with
chloroform, although it was quite dry when found. But there were
all the indications of it having been wet, and when found it still
retained a faint odour of the subtle fluid which had given Mrs.
Felstead her quietus. In one corner of the handkerchief beautifully
worked in pale yellow silk were the initials S.H. Need I say that I
took possession of that handkerchief, for I felt that it might
prove invaluable as a clue? No similar handkerchief was found
amongst Mrs. Felstead's effects, therefore the assumption was that
it had been used as a means of administering the chloroform, death
having been produced by inhalation; and that he who had
administered it had left the handkerchief behind by accident not
design. It was a singular and remarkable thing that no letters of
any kind, nor any memoranda likely to be of use, were discovered
amongst the lady's things; and Peterfield remembered that so far as
he knew she had never received a letter all the time she had lived
at his house, nor had she been known to post one, nor had
anyone&mdash;save the mysterious stranger&mdash;ever visited her.
In one of her boxes were a bank book and several cheque books. The
last balancing of her passbook showed that she had several thousand
pounds in the bank. Inquiries at the bank brought forth the
information that her account was constantly replenished by cheques
drawn on a certain Devonshire bank, and always signed by a firm of
lawyers in the same town in Devonshire as that in which the bank
was situated. To them I went, and from them I learnt that many
years before they had been appointed trustees under the will of a
very eccentric lady named Stelfer. It was known, or at any rate it
was believed that she was the widow of a West India merchant. It
was beyond doubt that she had come from the West Indies, and
invested her money in property in the town in question, and in
doing this she displayed a very shrewd business aptitude. She had
one daughter, Sybil by name, and though she had ample means she
lived in a mean way. The child was remarkable for beauty. She was
said, indeed, to be the prettiest child in the town. Her mother had
her educated at home, and she was never allowed to go anywhere
unless in the company of her governess or her mother, who seemed
afraid of letting her out of her sight. Mrs. Stelfer at length
died. Sybil was then barely nineteen. The firm of solicitors was
appointed her guardian and trustees; and as she expressed a very
strong desire to go to London they placed her under the care of a
lady of good social position, who had two daughters much about
Sybil's own age.</p>

<p>In a very few months, however, the girl wrote to her guardians
saying she hated the people she was with and intended to go away.
She described them as "commonplace, sordid, vulgar," and "too much
given to psalm-singing" to suit her taste. Of course her guardians
were anxious to know what she wished to do, and where she was going
to. Her answer was she was going to travel abroad. They said they
would endeavour to procure a suitable companion for her, but she
answered that she was quite capable of selecting her own companion;
and off she went to the Continent, nor could the guardians stop
her, for it was expressly stated in the will that they were not to
exercise any irksome control over her, and she was to be allowed a
fixed sum of money every month until she was of age, when she was
to obtain full possession of the property left to her by her
mother. It was known that she passed some time in Florence, thence
she went to Rome. During her absence she drew her allowance
regularly, and frequently wrote to her guardians, giving them
descriptions of places she had seen and people she had met. It was
noted, however, that her letters were all written in a vein of
strong cynicism. She spoke of the world as being beautiful; but men
and women, she said, were slimy reptiles, who left the blight of
their curse on all the beauty that God had given. Tor a young woman
to have held such views showed that she must have been peculiarly
constituted.</p>

<p>When Miss Stelfer reached her majority she returned home to
arrange her business affairs with her lawyers and guardians, and
take possession of her property. It was remarked that her business
aptitude was quite equal to her mother's, and the opinion was she
was fully equal to looking after herself and her property. She
appointed the solicitors her agents, instructing them to manage the
same and regularly remit the proceeds to her. Amongst the property
she owned was the valuable freehold of a flourishing brewery, so
that altogether her income was a substantial one. Having settled
her business to her own satisfaction she departed for London, and
from that time her solicitors were unable to learn anything of her
movements.</p>

<p>Down to this point we had learnt her history from her early
girlhood, and it was conclusively established that she had first
drawn the breath of life in the island of Trinidad. But from that
point onward to the time when she was found lying on "the bridal
couch of death" there was much yet to be learnt in order to clear
up the mystery.</p>

<p>Continuing my investigations, I found that she had assumed the
name of Felstead on going to live at Kennington, where she occupied
costly apartments; was visited in the same secret way by a man; but
was far more reserved, far more reticent, with the people she
lodged with there than she had been with the Peterfields. There
could be no doubt in the mind of any intelligent person that the
man who visited her at Kennington was the same one whom she was in
the habit of receiving at the Peterfields; and whoever that man
was, it was as clear as daylight that he had acquired an
extraordinary influence over her; and yet there was not a jot of
evidence to substantiate the suspicion that was entertained that
the influence had been exerted for sordid motives. I was convinced
he was no ordinary man, nor was she an ordinary woman, and they had
come together by a law of affinity, and had been moved and actuated
by a common idea, a common sentiment. Apparently they were not in
touch with the world generally, and found in each other an ideal,
which in part or wholly satisfied them. That was my theory, and on
that theory I worked.</p>

<p>I did not for a moment suppose that the name she had
assumed&mdash;Felstead&mdash;was a legitimate one. Much as she
might have hated society generally, and Mrs. Grundy in particular,
she found it expedient, at least to conform to some extent to those
conventional laws by which society is governed. I therefore did not
seek for her slayer under the name of Felstead, but for S.H., the
initials on the handkerchief. This handkerchief was altogether an
uncommon one. It was of the very finest silk, with a narrow border
running all round it of pale yellow silk, and the initials had been
worked in yellow to correspond. To this handkerchief I pinned my
hopes of tracing the man I wished to find. My plan, therefore, was
to advertise for the owner of the handkerchief in all the London
papers. Let it not be supposed that I expected for a moment the
owner himself would apply. But it was difficult to imagine him
being entirely without some connections. He must have had somebody,
for instance, to wash his linen, and should the advertisement fall
under the eye of the somebody results might follow. There was a
certain artfulness in the wording of the advertisement, and the
inference sought to be conveyed was that the handkerchief had been
found in the street, and the owner could have it by paying the cost
of the advertisement.</p>

<p>The result I had hoped for came within a few days. A fictitious
name was given, and an address in the city, and to this address was
delivered one morning a letter couched in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">I have seen your advertisement, and
think the handkerchief must belong to my master. All his
handkerchiefs are like that, and he is always losing something. If
you will bring it here I will pay for your trouble, and any expense
there may be.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Helen Preston</span>.</p>

<p><br>
To the address given, a quiet but aristocratic locality in the
south-western district of London, I made my way. The house, a
large, square, massive-fronted, semi-detached building, had a
substantiality and finish about it which suggested that it had been
erected at a period ante to the advent of the modern jerry builder.
There was a considerable space of garden in front, but it was
choked up with weeds and rank grass, and three or four tall poplar
trees threw a shadow of gloom over the place. On the massive stone
pillar supporting the iron gate that gave entrance to the garden
was carved in deep letters "Astral House." The pathway was
overgrown with grass, and the steps leading to the main door were
green and slimy.</p>

<p>Ringing the bell, I was soon face to face with a middle-aged,
stoutish woman, whose florid appearance did not give one the idea
that she mortified the flesh for the sake of the soul.</p>

<p>"Is your name Helen Preston?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, and then, divining my errand, inquired if I
had come about the handkerchief. I told her that I had, and without
hesitation she invited me to enter. The hall was large and well
furnished, and heavy and handsome curtains concealed the stairs at
the end. Complying with her request, I walked into an anteroom,
which was also well furnished and exceedingly comfortable. A man
considerably older than the woman, and having grey hair and beard,
was seated by the fire, but rose as I entered, and Mrs. Preston
presented him as her husband. He greeted me cheerily, and remarked
that he supposed I had picked up the handkerchief somewhere. I told
him it had been found, but I did not say where, whereupon the woman
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Master is, I think, the most careless man in the world. He is
always losing his things."</p>

<p>"What is your master's name?" I asked casually.</p>

<p>"Hengald, sir," she answered frankly.</p>

<p>"And his Christian name?"</p>

<p>"Stephen."</p>

<p>"Of course you will be able to recognize the handkerchief?" said
I.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there is not a doubt about it."</p>

<p>I thereupon produced the handkerchief, and the woman and her
husband both declared it was one of a number which their master
owned, and from a drawer Mrs. Preston produced a pile of them,
identical in every way with the one in my possession.</p>

<p>"Is the master in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can I see him?"</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, no," cried the woman with a laugh. "Why, he
never sees anyone, excepting us. He's the queerest mortal that ever
I've known. I'm the only one that's ever allowed to go into his
room upstairs."</p>

<p>"Is he quite right in the head?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she replied with some hesitation, "between you and
me, I don't believe he is. He's a bit queer; though I oughtn't to
say it."</p>

<p>"Do you know much about him?"</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is, we've been with him for ten years, but he's
never told us anything, and we don't know anything, only that this
place and the next house belong to him."</p>

<p>"Who lives in the next house?"</p>

<p>"No one. He won't let it. He wasn't so bad when we first came.
He went out more, and sometimes saw us, but he has gradually been
getting more gloomy and silent."</p>

<p>It was plain to see that these people were not in their master's
secrets. They seemed honest and straightforward enough folk, and
therefore I felt it was better to go straight to the point, so I
said to the woman:</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Preston, ray business here is far more serious than
that of merely bringing back this handkerchief. The fact is, there
is every reason to believe that Stephen Hengald has been guilty of
a great crime."</p>

<p>"A crime!" echoed the couple in one voice, while their faces
paled, and they looked at each other with a startled and inquiring
expression. Then the woman remarked with a sort of a groan: "Well,
upon my word, I am not surprised."</p>

<p>"You will understand now," I continued, "that it is necessary
for me to see him."</p>

<p>She appeared to be greatly perplexed and troubled, and looked to
her husband as if for guidance, and he, having reflected for some
moments, said to her:</p>

<p>"Nell, it ain't for us to screen the master if he's been up to
anything wrong. We've always done our duty by him, and we've had a
good place, but we mustn't screen him if he's broke the law. So you
had better take the gent up."</p>

<p>With obvious reluctance the wife yielded to her husband, and,
indicating that I was to follow her, she led the way along the
passage, and, passing under the heavy curtains already referred to,
I found myself mounting a broad flight of stairs, carpeted so
thickly and luxuriantly that not a sound arose, not a footfall was
heard. I found myself on a noble landing, carpeted no less
luxuriously, while the walls were draped with rich purple velvet
and a few costly statuettes&mdash;mostly of females&mdash;stood out
in bold relief against the dark background. A stained glass window
lighted the landing by day, and a multi-coloured lamp by night.
Proceeding to the end of the landing, the woman drew aside a heavy
curtain and opened a felt-lined door. She made a motion for me to
remain where I was, but I went forward, and my sense of smell was
assailed by a faint odour of what I took to be incense. I found
myself in a room hung with velvet, as the landing was. Here were
statues again and exquisite paintings, principally of flowers and
fruit. From the ceiling a noble coloured lamp was suspended, and,
being lighted, it diffused a soft glow throughout the apartment. A
looped curtain at a door-way at the end of the room allowed me to
catch a glimpse of a room beyond, and I almost fancied I was gazing
on some scene of enchantment. It was a long and lofty room lighted
with coloured lamps. The walls were entirely hidden with the most
costly velvet, relieved by paintings, statues, vases of flowers.
The floor was covered with the most magnificent of carpets, and
spread about were priceless rugs. Brocaded ottomans, stools,
lounges, were everywhere, some of them upholstered in material of
brilliant colours, until the eyes were dazzled and the other senses
lulled by a sensuous languor, for the air was heavy with perfume,
and the whole place might have been a bower of some Oriental
princess. But stranger than all was the presiding genius of this
remarkable scene, for on a low couch covered with a splendid fur
rug and clad in a robe of gold brocade reclined a man. He had
evidently been reading, but appeared to be half asleep, and the
book had fallen from his hand to the floor. Near him was an
exquisitely-wrought filigree metal stand holding an Egyptian
boat-shaped lamp, the soft light from which brought his pale,
delicately-carved face into startling relief. It was a face that
once seen could hardly be forgotten. It was a face cast in the very
finest of patrician moulds, but it was utterly without colour or
warmth, and the dark, flowing hair over the lofty brow and the
dark, drooping moustache enhanced the death-like pallor. As I gazed
on this strange man, sunk as he was in a dreamy, languorous
listlessness, I saw a startling sight. Prom the folds of his
splendid robe issued the head of a wondrously-coloured
snake&mdash;a South American carpet snake, as it subsequently
proved to be. Gradually it withdrew its glittering body from the
warmth of its resting-place, and then placed its jewel-like head on
the cheek of the man, who thereby disturbed moved his hand, and
gently grasping the reptile said:</p>

<p>"Achiroe, you are rude. Keep quiet; you disturb my
slumbers."</p>

<p>His voice was soft, flute-like, and mellow. There was a perfect
fascination in it. Opening his eyes, as he spoke, eyes that had a
strange, far away, dreamy expression in them, he beheld me standing
there. Mrs. Preston, fearing the consequences of our intrusion, had
withdrawn. He partly raised himself from his reclining position,
and said, addressing me:</p>

<p>"Who are you that you come here unbidden?"</p>

<p>He showed no anger. He seemed in no way disturbed. He spoke in
tones that were quite without any trace of agitation.</p>

<p>"Stephen Hengald, I have some serious business with you," I
answered. "I request that you will rise."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, to-morrow," he murmured drowsily, as with a gentle
movement he put the snake back into the folds of his robe, and
sinking down upon his luxurious couch closed his eyes, and showed
an utter indifference to my presence.</p>

<p>I felt the awkwardness of the position. How was I to act in such
unusual circumstances? This was no ordinary man, and he seemed to
be under the influence of some drug. Therefore I deemed it
advisable to take advice as to the course to pursue, for he was not
a vulgar ruffian, a desperate murderer who had to be subdued with
force.</p>

<p>As I stood thus debating in my own mind, I glanced towards a
recess, which was in the direct line of vision of anyone reclining
where Hengald was, partly screened by a loose curtain, but from the
recess issued a rosy light. I moved to the recess, and, drawing
back the curtain, beheld the picture which Peterfield had painted
for Mrs. Felstead&mdash;"The Bridal Couch of Death." It rested on
an easel, and from each side of the recess a rose-coloured light
streamed full upon it, bringing out all its details, and softening
and beautifying the whole in a marvellous manner. I noted then that
from where Hengald lay he commanded a full view of the painting. I
looked at him, but his eyes were still closed, and he appeared to
be sleeping.</p>

<p>Silently I retired. The rich pile carpets prevented any sound.
Mrs. Preston was waiting for me on the landing, and anxiously
inquired what had taken place. When I told her she said:</p>

<p>"Ah, I suppose he has been dosing himself again. He takes
something to make him dream, as he says, but I am sure it's killing
him. He gets weaker and weaker and more and more pale. I often
expect when I go into his room to find him dead."</p>

<p>In about two hours I returned to Hengald's house, accompanied by
the chief superintendent of a Metropolitan division of police and
two of his officers. As may be supposed Mrs. Preston and her
husband were much distressed and alarmed, though the worst they had
to fear was the loss of what to them was no doubt a perfectly
unique home. We proceeded upstairs to the splendidly-furnished
apartments. The couch was vacant, the room empty so far as Hengald
was concerned; but on the couch, coiled up in the deep fur of the
splendid rug, was the gorgeously-coloured snake which, as Ave
gathered from Mrs. Preston, had for a long time been Hengald's sole
companion, and he had bestowed upon it the classical name of
Achiroe.</p>

<p>At right angles with this room was the "Dreamer's" sleeping
apartment, the doorway, as all doorways in the house were, being
concealed by a heavy velvet curtain. In this instance, at the
bottom of the curtain was more than a foot of gold bullion fringe.
Pulling the curtain aside we passed into the bedroom. Here again
the most lavish expenditure had been indulged in. Splendid carpets,
costly rugs, velvet hangings, brocaded furniture, cheval glasses,
bronzes, statuettes, water-colour drawings, ravished the senses
with a scene of richness and sensuous comfort not often met with.
The ceiling of this superb apartment was in itself a priceless work
of art. The mouldings were coloured with cream and gold, and on the
plane was a magnificent painting representing an allegorical
subject&mdash;"The Awakening of Aurora at the Kiss of the God of
Day." The heavy canopied bed was covered with a black silk, gold
embroidered counterpane, and lying in an easy and graceful position
on this, his marble-like face with its delicately cut features
being brought into startling relief by the black silk, was Hengald
asleep, but we soon found that it was the sleep which dreams
perplex lot. He was dead, and the method of his death was soon made
apparent. On a small ormolu-topped table by the bedside was a phial
still half full of morphia while a hypodermic syringe, and a tiny
puncture in the dead man's arm told silently but eloquently their
own tale. What had prompted him to take his own life can only be
conjectured; but it is highly probable that my unexpected intrusion
when he lay upon his couch with his pet, Achiroe, had warned him
that his dream was over, and calmly, and maybe without a pang of
regret, he put an end to his existence.</p>

<p>A mass of papers and diaries were found amongst his possessions,
and from these was gathered the story of his life. He came of a
noble Swedish family who had been forced to fly from their country
for political reasons. His parents were evidently people of the
most aesthetic tastes, tastes that were inherited by their
children, of whom there were two, Stephen and a girl, who was said
to be ravishingly beautiful. The sister and brother idolized each
other, and they studied and dreamed together until the youth was
nineteen and the girl sixteen, when she died suddenly. From that
hour the young man seemed to have shut himself off from the world
in the common sense, and he created a world, so to speak, of his
own. He became an intense lover of books, especially poetry and
philosophy; he surrounded himself with the very choicest works of
art, and led a lonely and reflective life. Both his parents died
while he was still young, leaving him a most ample fortune, so that
he had the means of gratifying his peculiar tastes to the fullest
extent. After the death of his mother and father Stephen travelled
for some time, and appears to have covered nearly the whole of
Europe. He had a habit of daily recording his impressions, his
thoughts, and his experiences, and a few extracts from his diaries
will best tell the sequel of what I have recorded so far. He was
sojourning in Madrid when he wrote the following passages.</p>
<br>

<div class="quote" style="margin-left:10%">
<p>"It is a disgustingly vulgar world, made so by man himself, who
is the most vulgar of God's creations. I have been accused of being
a dreamer because I hate the grovelling, sordid, mean, huckstering,
lying spirit which characterizes my fellow-beings. And how I
shudder at and loathe the hypocrisy which tries to cheat heaven
itself! How I hate the hollowness of women, the knavery of men! For
years I have diligently searched for the philosopher's stone, which
is Truth, but I have come to the conclusion that it does not exist
anywhere in the world. It may be found in Paradise, carefully
guarded by the angels who carried it off from earth because men
despised it. Often do I seriously think of seeking out some lonely
spot in the world which is as yet untainted with the hateful
presence of man."</p>

<p>"I have arrived in Florence&mdash;Florence the beautiful and the
cradle of art. But here as everywhere lies the slimy trail of the
serpent in the presence of man. Greed, and the selfishness begotten
of greed; the cruelty of avarice; the falseness and hypocrisy of
pretention. Can I not get away from all these things? I grow sick
and faint as I watch the pitiable game of life. The painted jade
with her smirks and smiles cozening the lustful man, the knaving
trader, the lying lawyer, the false priest, the pitiless landlord,
the robber of the widow and orphans, the unjust magistrate, the
stupid statesman; and this is life. Oh, the pity of it; the pity of
it!"</p>

<p>"To-day while wandering in one of the galleries my attention was
drawn to a remarkable picture. It was labelled 'The Bridal Couch of
Death.' The subject had been treated well. It was full of poetry
and feeling. I liked the idea. It suited my mood. Better far for an
unworldly woman to be wedded to death than to man. For in man's
heart sits a devil, while death at least releases us from all that
is hateful here. As I studied this masterpiece of artistic
imagination, I turned by chance, and lo! beside me stood a woman,
the model, as it seemed to me, of the painting. She was beautiful,
with a face so sweet, so full of gentleness, that to me it was
unique. I addressed her, inquiring if she was the model of the
figure in the picture. She told me she was not. It was certainly a
coincidence. The face of the dead woman was the face of the living
one."</p>

<p>"In the lady to whom I spoke yesterday I have found a spirit of
purity and sweetness that enchants me. She is unlike all other
women I have ever known, save my sainted sister. In truth Sybil is
like my sister in many respects. To me it seems as if my sister
lives in her again. I must know her better. She is worth knowing.
Like me she hates the world of men. Like me she is searching for
truth."</p>

<p>"It is weeks ago now since I first met Sybil Stelfer, and the
opinion I formed then has in no way changed. She has an original
mind. She has formed an ideal of a world and she aims at living in
it. This woman, unlike all other women, save my sister, gives me
pleasure. I love to hear her talk. Her voice is music. She is an
incarnate poem. We have much in common. I am coming to love her,
but not with a carnal love."</p>
</div>

<p><br>
I will skip many passages in his diary, which, though full of
philosophical reflection and marked by grace of diction no less
than highly poetic imaginings, would occupy far more space than I
have at my disposal. Suffice to say that he and Sybil wandered for
some time about the Continent, dreaming their dreams and living an
ideal life. There is not a line nor a word to suggest that their
friendship was anything more than the purest of platonism. They
visited some of the most beautiful spots; and he frequently refers
to Sybil as being "a perfect woman" and twice or thrice he speaks
of her as being "a ravishing dream of all that is noble and
beautiful in feminine nature." At last they returned to London, and
he thus writes:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<div class="quote" style="margin-left:10%">
<p>"Between me and Sybil has been formed an unbreakable link based
upon the very highest conception of earthly love. We are sister and
brother, and she gives to me a love as holy as that my divine
sister gave to me and I to her. For me she has made the world
brighter, better, purer, and I know now what it is to live. In
order that the incarnate hypocrisy of prurient minds may not sully
the sweet spirit of my spiritual wife, I have urged her to make a
concession to the community in which circumstances force us to
live, and henceforth she will be known as Mrs. Felstead. It is sad
to think that one must be a living lie, for I have sought for
truth, yet now I outrage truth. But it is for my darling's sake.
For you unholy preachers of righteous things; you hirelings of the
press who sell your souls for gold; you besmirchers of fair fames;
you asp-tongued scandal-mongers; you revoltingly hyprocritical Mrs.
Grundys; you lying and slandering men and women whose hearts are
rotten and whose souls are damned&mdash;on you must fall the
responsibility for the falsehood under which we are compelled to
exist. For part we will not, and be aught else than sister and
brother we cannot."</p>

<p>"To me the past two years have been Elysium. Those delicious
dreamy hours I have spent with my beloved can have no counterpart
in Paradise. And yet of late a shadow has clouded our happiness. I
am mortal, and a mortal disease is slowly but surely slaying me.
Long and earnestly we have discussed the matter, and my soul's soul
has vowed that she cannot live after me, and yet she shudders at
the thought of laying hands upon herself, therefore we have decided
that when it is unmistakable that my end is near she will die by my
hand. The world will call this a crime; but what care we for the
world. We claim the right to destroy that which is in our own
keeping."</p>

<p>"By my request my darling has posed as the model for a picture
similar to the one we saw in the gallery at Florence years ago. The
painter has done his work well; and when the time comes Sybil will
actually realize that picture, and when her sweet body has been
consigned to the mould, my remaining days will be cheered by the
picture of her as I last beheld her. There shall be no vulgarness
in our dying. As we have endeavoured to live poetic lives so we
will endeavour to die poetic deaths."</p>

<p>"It is accomplished. My beloved is cold and beautiful as virgin
marble. She has died unsullied, untouched, uncankered by a single
sensual act or deed. She awaits for me now in a world of light,
where Truth blazes with dazzling effulgence. Farewell all that is
base, mean, and squalid. Never again will I cross the threshold of
my door. When once that door closes upon me, it will be as the door
of a tomb."</p>

<p>"I die slowly. When I saw my heart's idol lying so still among
the flowers I thought that a day or two at the most would be all
that would intervene before I joined her, for I was frail and
fragile, and the pulse of life was scarcely perceptible. Hasten
your coming, tardy Death, or I shall hasten to meet you."</p>

<p>"A strange languor steals upon me. I see but dimly. I am
irritable, even my pet Achiroe disturbs me. Through the vast and
silent spaces that lie between me and the unknown comes the
bell-like voice of my well-beloved calling me, calling, ever
calling; and I see her form, radiant in robes of gold, and her face
lighted with a light of joy such as the world could never give.
To-night, to-night, dear one, Death shall wed us."</p>
</div>

<p><br>
This was the last passage he ever wrote. It is not necessary to
add any description of the practical details the law demanded. But
one verdict could be returned. The strangely-constituted man had,
with her consent, taken the life of the equally
strangely-constituted woman. Nor for gain, revenge, spite, or
jealousy; but for love's sake. Nevertheless, the world calls it
murder. That he could not have lived many weeks in the ordinary
course of nature was proved by the post-mortem examination, which
demonstrated that he had an absolutely incurable disease; but he
anticipated his end, and the law said he had slain himself while
temporarily insane. Perhaps the world will say that he never had
been sane, but all men are not mad who choose to walk differently
to their fellows.</p>

<p>By the deaths of this strange couple the Peterfields were large
gainers, for they both left their fortunes to them. It is
satisfactory also to know that Hengald amply provided for the wants
of his old and faithful retainers.</p>

<p>It is interesting to state that the snake Achiroe&mdash;why he
should have called it after a daughter of the Nile is not
clear&mdash;whose compeer for beauty had never before been seen in
this country, pined so for her lost master that she died in a few
weeks.</p>

4. THE CRIME OF THE LONELY MARSHES:<br>
<small>A STRANGE PARALLEL TO THE ARDLAMONT CASE</small></h2>

<p class="first">
HOW true it is that history repeats itself; and equally true
that there is nothing new under the sun, whether it be in crime or
anything else. What is known as the "Ardlamont Mystery," which for
many weeks has been exercising the mind of the public in all parts
of the kingdom, bears such a remarkable resemblance in many points
to a case that occurred years ago in Austria, or, more strictly
speaking, Hungary, that I propose to tell the story of this case in
detail as I had it from the lips of the late Karl Radnosky, who
spent the greater part of his manhood's life in the Austrian secret
service. Radnosky came over to this country in search of one of the
chief actors in the strange drama, as it was supposed he had taken
up his residence in Scotland, where, ultimately, he was found. The
facts of the case are so well known in legal circles that it would
be a waste of time for me to urge their truthfulness by comment or
explanation. But this I may say, had the story been the outcome of
some fiction writer's fancy, he would have been stormed at by the
pure-minded critics as "a sensational writer," as though
sensationalism wasn't one of the strongest elements and features of
human existence.</p>

<p>As you journey in the steamer along the Danube from Pesth to
Rustchuk, in Bulgaria, the river flows for a long way through
singularly flat and marshy country, which seems to be inhabited
only by the lonely bittern and mournful heron. These marshes extend
for miles and miles inland, and are really the haunts of myriads of
water-fowl, while the broad rivers that flow through and feed the
swamps teem with splendid fish of various kinds. Here and there are
small isolated villages, whose inhabitants make their living by
sending the fish and fowls to the Austrian and other markets.</p>

<p>The stranger might be apt to suppose that this enormous stretch
of water-logged country was no man's land, but therein he would be
wrong. There are several proprietors who derive a good income from
the shooting and fishing. In parts where the land rises a little
above the surrounding dead level, and consequently is drained, it
is covered with stunted forest, where fur animals have their
haunts, while at intervals on the banks of the great river one
comes across little colonies of poor people who catch and prepare
the magnificent sturgeon, which they split open, dry, salt, and
smoke, and despatch to market, an immense quantity of it finding
its way to London. These people live in tent-shaped huts built of
reeds, and to the foreigner the huts have a remarkable and
picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>About 1840 there was living in this lonely marsh land a wealthy
widow lady named Herzog, whose family for generations had owned
property extending for hundreds of miles amongst the swamp-lands
and the dark forests near Buda-Pesth. On one of the rising patches
of ground to which I have referred, the lady, who was said to be
eccentric and strange in her habits, had built a really fine house,
which was situated almost in the centre of the oasis of forest. She
also owned another house in Buda-Pesth; but that was generally shut
up as she preferred to make her home in the lonely marsh land. Let
it not be supposed that she mortified herself or lived an ascetic
life. On the contrary, she was fond of good living, and her house,
especially in the summer&mdash;when it was pleasant
enough&mdash;was often the scene of many pleasant reunions when
friends from Buda-Pesth visited her. Of course in the winter the
whole country round about was desolation itself; for then fierce
gales and howling snowstorms swept the marshes, and woe betide the
traveller who was unfortunate enough to get benighted at such a
time. It was almost certain his life would be sacrificed. But
winter and summer, with the exception of short, occasional
absences, the Lady Herzog resided in her isolated dwelling,
averring that she preferred it infinitely to any other spot on the
globe. What is more singular perhaps is this, there dwelt with her
a niece; a young girl of about eighteen or nineteen, who was known
as Theresa, and who was renowned for her beauty. If reports are
true she was one of the most beautiful girls to be found in the
whole of Hungary and Austria. It certainly did seem remarkable that
a young and charming girl of this description should have been
content to live in such an out-of-the-world place. But soon it
began to be rumoured that not only was her aunt excessively kind
and indulgent to her, but the young lady was engaged to be married
to her cousin, her aunt's only living nephew, and the heir to all
her property. This was the young Count Zanzy, who it was understood
was travelling through Europe, and for some little time had been
residing in England.</p>

<p>Amongst the Lady Herzog's visitors was a certain Colonel
Ferraris, who had fought in the Austrian army, and while being
recognized as a gallant soldier his private character was not such
as would have borne investigation with credit to himself. However,
the wealthy widow by no means discarded him, and it was even hinted
there was an attachment between them. The Colonel had a servant, or
rather a superior sort of valet, in his employ, who also combined
to some extent the duties of secretary, for he was a well-educated
young man, and had been heard to say that he came from a very good
family, who, through political and other causes, had been reduced
to poverty, so that the various members of it had to turn out into
the world to earn their living. This young man was known as Maurice
Farnese, and he had the advantage of being good looking, well
formed, and refined and graceful in his manner.</p>

<p>During the numerous visits he made to the lonely house in the
marsh land, in company with his employer, he had frequent
opportunities of seeing and being in company with the beautiful
girl Theresa&mdash;in fact, the Colonel used to plan, apparently,
to bring them together, and by a good deal of finessing he afforded
them the opportunity of going out alone to fish and shoot in the
swamps, for Theresa could fish and shoot as well as a man. As might
have been expected, the young people fell in love with each other,
though Maurice was impressed with the idea that his case was
hopeless, for once when the Colonel accused him of looking sad and
melancholy, and asked him if he was in love, he confessed that he
was. But he said that knowing how useless it was for him to aspire
to win the hand of the beautiful Theresa, who, as it was reported,
was betrothed to her cousin, he had resolved to go away, and
endeavour to forget her.</p>

<p>At this the Colonel laughed, and replied:</p>

<p>"Don't make a goose of yourself, man. Love recognizes neither
rank nor station. You may, for aught we know, be as good a man as
the Count; therefore, never despair. Besides I will help you in
your suit, and try and bring about a marriage between you and
Theresa, if you are faithful and staunch to me."</p>

<p>Of course Maurice was delighted when he heard this, and he vowed
that he would be loyal and true to the Colonel till death.</p>

<p>Soon after this the Lady Herzog began to exhibit symptoms of a
strange malady, which puzzled the medical men who were called to
attend her. And though at first they did not attach any serious
import to the illness, they thought it strange, and recommended the
lady to go away for a time. This she consented to do, and taking
her niece with her, and accepting the companionship of the Colonel,
who was, of course, attended by the faithful Maurice, she voyaged
to Rustchuk, and after a brief stay there continued the journey to
Constantinople. But strangely enough her health did not improve,
and a doctor, who was called to see her in the Turkish capital, was
as much puzzled as her own doctors were at home. As she began now
to think that she wouldn't get better, she determined to return,
and she travelled back by slow stages to her lonely residence in
the swamps. As soon as she arrived she sent an urgent message to
her nephew to go to her with all speed. And he, obeying the
summons, travelled night and day, but when he reached his aunt's
house she was decidedly better, and expressed regret that she had
allowed her fears to interfere with the enjoyment of his tour. To
this he answered that he was truly delighted to be back with her
and his beautiful cousin, and as he had had enough of travel for
the time being, he intended, with her permission, to stay there and
enjoy the company of herself and Theresa. Needless, perhaps, to
say, that both the ladies were charmed with the proposal, and the
Colonel, who of course had been introduced to the young Count, also
expressed his gratification; for, apart from any other
consideration, he thought, so he said, that the Count's presence
would have a good influence on Madame Herzog's health.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that Maurice Farnese was by no means
overjoyed, for he felt that all his hopes of being able to win
Theresa were blighted, and he expressed this view one day when he
said to the Colonel, his master:</p>

<p>"I have indulged in an impossible dream. I had no business ever
to dare to think of Mademoiselle Theresa. I must go away; I must
forget her. At least, I will try to forget, but I am afraid it is
an impossibility."</p>

<p>The Colonel laughed, and said he was surprised he should be such
a coward in love affairs.</p>

<p>"All is fair in love and war," he added. "It is true the
ravishing Theresa is engaged to her cousin, but you must endeavour
to cut him out. Lay strong siege to the girl's heart, and, then, if
it falls not to you, you will have only yourself to blame. For
myself, I am going to try and win the widow, and if I can help you
count upon my assistance."</p>

<p>The young man was not much comforted, though he altered his mind
about going away, and resolved to stay Count Zanzy and Colonel
Ferraris soon became very warm friends; or at any rate, seemed to
be so, and they shot and fished together, and made many excursions
up and down the river. On these occasions the Count expressed a
desire that his aunt should be one of the party. But the Colonel
managed to dissuade him from asking her, and the young man having
quite fallen under his companion's influence, did as the Colonel
wished him to do. So the two men went about by themselves, for
Maurice Farnese was always left behind, and he improved the
occasion by seeking to console pretty Theresa for the absence of
her cousin. Matters continued like this for some time, when a
strange thing happened that caused consternation and terror in
Madame Herzog's household.</p>

<p>One day the Colonel and the Count started off on a fishing
expedition on one of the extensive lagoons which abounded in the
neighbourhood. Theresa was particularly anxious to accompany them,
but the Colonel told her that the day being rough and coarse, and
as they were likely to be absent all day, she would suffer and be
miserable. He, therefore, advised her to remain at home, and have a
warm welcome for them when they returned in the evening. She was
not quite pleased at having to remain behind, nevertheless
consented to do so, and the two men went off alone, well provided
with tackle and provisions. The bag of provisions and other things
were carried by one of Madame Herzog's servants, an old man and
faithful retainer, who had been brought up in the swamps, and knew
every creek, path, and lagoon. When they reached the boat which was
lying moored amongst the reeds at the edge of the lake, and the
things had been deposited in the bottom of the craft, the Colonel
sent old Michael back to the house for some rugs which he said he
had forgotten; and which having regard to the rawness of the day
would be required. However, getting impatient, the Colonel
suggested to his companion that they shouldn't wait for Michael's
return, but start at once, and the Count consenting they pushed
off, and rowed for some miles amongst the reeds and sedges until
they reached a deep and very lonely creek, where the little anchor
of the boat was put out, and the fishing tackle was prepared.</p>

<p>While this was being done the Count noticed with consternation
that the boat was filling with water, which appeared to be bubbling
up from the bottom.</p>

<p>The Colonel was furious with the boatman from whom the boat had
been hired, for not having seen that she was seaworthy; and he
suggested they should get up the anchor, and pull to the shore
immediately The Count, who was very much alarmed, for he said that
he couldn't swim a stroke, busied himself in getting the wooden
anchor in, while the Colonel arranged the oars; but now the water
poured into the boat so rapidly that she sank like a stone, and the
two men were left struggling in the water.</p>

<p>"God help us! we are lost," cried the Colonel, "for I cannot
swim either." In spite of this assertion he struck out, and getting
into the shallow part amongst the reeds he waded on shore. The
house was several miles off, and the route to it dangerous and
treacherous, owing to the swamps and bogs, so the Colonel, dripping
and drenched, proceeded to the point where they had embarked, and
he found old Michael waiting there with the rugs. The servant was
greatly alarmed when he learnt what had happened, and the Colonel
appeared to be overwhelmed with grief at the Count's death.
Wrapping himself in the rugs, he bade Michael get assistance, and
endeavour to recover the Count's body, while he himself would go to
the house, and break the news of the calamity to Madame Herzog and
Theresa. Having taken a deep drink of some common country brandy, a
flask of which Michael carried in his pocket, he started off on his
mournful errand, but after going some distance he seemed to have
changed his mind and turned back, notwithstanding that his clothes
were soaked with water and he must have been very uncomfortable. He
proceeded to the lagoon again. By this time Michael had got from a
creek another boat and the assistance of two reed-cutters, the
reeds being cut in the autumn for fuel, and he and the reed-cutters
pulled with might and main to the scene of the disaster, but
instead of bringing back, as they expected they would have to do,
the dead body of Count Zanzy they found him alive. He had managed
to keep himself afloat by an oar, and had gradually worked his way
to the sedges, when he waded to the bank and scrambled out, but was
so exhausted that he lay there and gave himself up for lost. But
presently, hearing the plash of oars and the voices of men, he got
on to his knees and shouted, and by this means was found. He was
not robust nor had he a strong physique, and he was in consequence
so prostrated that he had to be lifted into the boat. Some brandy
was administered to him, and the men wrapped their coats about him.
These swamp-dwellers always carry a little flask of the crude
native spirit called brandy with them, as they say a little of it
taken now and again is a preventative of the ague and marsh
fever.</p>

<p>The Colonel on reaching the lagoon saw the boat coming down, and
thinking the men had already recovered the Count's body he waited,
and when the boat came to the landing-place he saw to his amazement
that the Count was living. He was overjoyed, and, falling on the
young man's neck, he embraced him again and again, weeping
copiously and kissing him with a great show of affection.</p>

<p>The Count was still so weak and ill that he had to be carried to
the house, the Colonel preceding the little group in order that he
might prepare Madam for the shock, and shocked she was, for she was
so weak and ill herself she was not in a condition to hear up
against any sudden calamity. When she heard of the accident she
swooned, and it was some time before she recovered. Of course, the
Count was at once put to bed, and messengers were sent off post
haste to the nearest town for medical assistance, as it was feared
the young man would have inflammation of' the lungs or some other
deadly illness. However, although he remained prostrated, or nearly
so, for many days, no complications supervened, and he gradually
recovered his normal health and strength. But his aunt showed no
signs of improvement. On the contrary, she grew worse, and a
medical consultation was held, two famous physicians being summoned
from Buda-Pesth. After a long conference they came to the
conclusion that she was suffering from some form of blood
poisoning, though they were at a loss to assign a cause for it.
They then proceeded to place her under a course of treatment which
they hoped would prove beneficial, and in order that the treatment
should be thoroughly carried out and the medicines prescribed
regularly administered, a trained nurse named Kovich was brought
from Buda-Pesth.</p>

<p>Colonel Ferraris, when he heard that the disease had at last
been diagnosed, and that there were prospects of the lady's
recovery, expressed the greatest joy, and he became more than ever
attentive. So things continued for a little time, but unhappily
Madame Herzog's case did not yield to the treatment, and it became
only too evident that she was doomed. She herself appeared to be
perfectly conscious of that, for one evening she said to Kovich,
the nurse, to whom she had become much attached:</p>

<p>"Kovich, I shall never get better; I am convinced of it. But I
suppose I must be resigned. I have played my part in life, and,
though I should have liked to live a little longer, my destiny is
fulfilled. My dear nephew is my sole heir; he will inherit
everything I possess, and as he will marry my niece she is also
provided for."</p>

<p>Theresa was present and heard this conversation, and so was the
old housekeeper, a Mrs. Pervintz, and presently the invalid took
the hand of her niece, who was sitting at the bedside, and said
tenderly:</p>

<p>"You must not regret my departure, dear. You will be very happy
with the Count. He is a good young man, and will, I am sure, make
you an excellent husband in every way."</p>

<p>Theresa made no reply to this, but bowed her head on the
bedclothes and wept.</p>

<p>Madame Herzog lingered on for another fortnight, and for a day
or two rallied so much that hopes were entertained of her recovery.
But one evening when Kovich had retired for a short time to get a
little rest, Colonel Ferraris undertook to sit with the invalid,
the Count and Theresa having gone for a short stroll by special
request of Madame, who said it would do them good, as the weather
was fine. Suddenly the Colonel rushed from the sick chamber, and
alarming the household, said that he had been reading to the
invalid, but as she was disposed to doze, he ceased. Then, owing to
the stillness and closeness of the room, he, too, got somewhat
drowsy and slept for about twenty minutes, as he asserted. Waking
up he looked at Madame, and saw that there was something peculiar
about her face, and touching her he found to his horror that she
was dead.</p>

<p>Preparations were at once made to lay the body out, and in
removing the bed-things a small box was found under the pillow. On
the lid of the box a slip of paper was pasted, and on the paper was
written:</p>

<p>"Three days after my funeral this box is to be opened by my
notary in the presence of witnesses."</p>

<p>In accordance with these instructions, the box was duly opened
by the notary, several other people being present at the time. A
will was found in it. It was exceedingly short, and entirely in
Madame Herzog's own handwriting, with the exception of the
signatures of the witnesses. She stated that, utterly uninfluenced
by any living soul, she cancelled the will which she had previously
made and placed in the hands of her lawyers at Buda-Pesth, and by
this new will she, while still making Count Zanzy her heir, left an
immediate legacy to Colonel Ferraris of five thousand pounds, and,
in the event of Count Zanzy's death before his marriage with
Theresa, everything&mdash;estates, property, money&mdash;was to go
absolutely to the Colonel, with the exception of about one thousand
a year, which was to be paid to the niece. This will was signed by
Kovich, the nurse, and Maurice Farnese, and, as may be supposed, it
caused a good deal of surprise to the lawyers and some of the
distant relatives who had hoped to benefit. However, it was all
right according to the law of the country, and the notary lost no
time in registering it.</p>

<p>About four weeks after the funeral of Madame Herzog, Colonel
Ferraris had gone to Buda on business of his own, but, as he had
promised to return in a few days, he had not taken his valet,
Maurice, who, as it would seem, still hoped to prevail upon the
beautiful Theresa to have him. It seemed, in fact, that the young
lady was undecided in her choice, and could not make up her mind
which of her charmers she would bestow herself upon. But there is
little doubt she led the Count to believe that she was devotedly
attached to him, and it is equally certain he was not aware that
she showed any preference for Maurice, for, whatever lovemaking she
had done with him had been kept very secret from the Count.</p>

<p>And now another strange and startling circumstance happened. One
bright and frosty day Count Zanzy, accompanied by Maurice Farnese
and a number of attendants, went off for a day's shooting, as the
frozen lagoons were covered with wild geese, ducks, and other
birds.</p>

<p>After a very successful morning the party partook of their
luncheon; and, that finished, the Count and Maurice started
together for a strip of forest, where they expected to get some
fur-bearing animals. Having been absent for an hour or so, Maurice
came running back to the attendants, who had prepared a fire and
were making coffee, and, with a look of horror on his face, he said
that the Count had shot himself, and was then lying dead in the
wood. They all went to the wood as fast as their legs would carry
them, and there sure enough was the unfortunate young Count, lying
on his back half in and half out of a narrow, dry ditch, while the
snow about him was stained deeply crimson with the blood that had
flowed and was still oozing from a terrible wound in the front part
of his head. None of the men touched the body, for, apart from a
superstitious fear common to the peasantry of those parts, it was
against the law of the country. For a dead body found like that had
to be left in the exact position in which it was found until the
legal official whose duty it was to inquire into these matters had
seen it. To this official information was at once given, and he
rode out as soon as possible with a number of police and gendarmes,
also a doctor. The body was lying at the foot of a little
embankment that formed the back of the ditch. When shot he must
have been standing with his face turned from the ditch into which
he fell. The barrel of his gun, which he still grasped in his left
hand, was empty. He had been struck full in the forehead by the
main part of the charge, and the top of his head was nearly blown
off, the brain being exposed. It was noted also that a young fir
tree, growing on the top of the embankment, and in direct line with
the body, had been much peppered by the shot, some of the twigs
being quite broken off. This was regarded as a most suspicious
circumstance, and the doctor expressed an opinion that, while it
was not altogether impossible that the wounds in the dead man's
head were self-inflicted, he did not think they were, unless the
Count had deliberately committed suicide. All the other people
present were unanimously of opinion that there were a great many
suspicious circumstances in connection with the affair, and it
seemed to them that the Count could not possibly have shot himself
in that manner accidentally. In fact, the feeling was that he had
been wilfully and deliberately murdered, and as no one was with him
except Maurice Farnese, it was decided that he should be arrested
and thrown into prison pending the judicial inquiry, and
accordingly this was done.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, this crime of the marshes caused a
widespread sensation, for the news flew from lip to lip, and spread
like wildfire through Buda Pesth, where Madame Herzog and her
nephew had been well known. Colonel Ferraris was greatly shocked
when he heard of the death of the man whom he referred to as his
"best friend," and on Theresa the effect was crushing, for with the
Count and with the man accused of his murder she had played fast
and loose. Now, one of her lovers was dead and the other in prison.
It is very probable that she had had no serious feeling for
Maurice, but the flirtation had amused her, and had helped her to
pass the time away during the Count's absence. But assuming that
she had only flirted with the accused, she could not remain
indifferent to the dreadful charge that hung over his head.</p>

<p>Now, from the very first Maurice Farnese protested his
innocence. His story was this:&mdash;He and the Count had gone to a
wood which was known to be the haunt of white hares. On reaching
the wood they separated, it being arranged that the Count was to
remain concealed in the dry ditch while Maurice acted the part of a
beater and drove the game towards the Count. While Farnese was
doing this, and while quite out of sight of the Count, he suddenly
heard two shots fired in rapid succession. There was nothing
alarming in that, as the Count was provided with a double-barrelled
gun, but a few seconds later two other shots were fired. That was
remarkable, and for this reason&mdash;the Count's double-barrelled
shot-gun was a muzzle loader, and between the firing of the first
shots and the second there was not time for the gun to have been
reloaded. Who then had fired the second shots? Maurice was so
struck that he ran forward, and to his horror he saw the Count
lying on the ground and bleeding. Thinking he was only wounded, he
knelt down, spoke to him, and touched him, but to his still greater
horror found that he was dead. Then he sped away and raised an
alarm. It is hardly necessary to say that this story found no
credence, and when it leaked out, as leak out it did, that Maurice
and the Count were rivals for the hand of the same lady, the
accused was universally condemned before he was tried. It seemed
like an insult to the most ordinary intelligence to ask anyone to
believe for a moment that Maurice Farnese had not killed his rival
the Count Zanzy.</p>

<p>Now law in Austria is neither so expeditious nor so methodical
as it is in our own country. There is a vast amount of
circumlocution to be gone through, and an accused person is
permitted to see his friends and acquaintances with a freedom that
would not be tolerated for a single instant here. Then, again, a
prisoner can be examined and questioned and cross-questioned by the
official charged with the getting up of the case in a manner that
may seem to us ridiculous, but which no doubt has much to recommend
it. Throughout this trying ordeal Farnese bore himself well; and
never once did he vary from his original statement that he heard
four shots fired in rapid succession&mdash;four shots, representing
two double-barrelled guns.</p>

<p>As is usually the case, there was much conflicting testimony
about the young man's death. So-called experts were not wanting who
roundly declared, that the Count's wounds and the position in which
he was lying were quite consistent with the theory that he shot
himself accidentally or wilfully. As there seemed to be no earthly
reason for his killing himself wilfully, the affair was regarded by
these experts as pure accident. But another set of so-called
experts were equally emphatic in their declaration that the fatal
wounds could not possibly have been self-inflicted.</p>

<p>Then, again, these people asked how the four shots were to be
accounted for?</p>

<p>Number one set of experts laughed at this question, and said
that the second shots existed only in the imagination of the
accused man. But number two set stuck to their text, and said that,
whether one gun had been fired or two guns mattered not so far as
their theory was concerned, and though the Count might have been
shot with his own gun, his own hand did not fire it.</p>

<p>"Then you mean he was murdered?" shrieked experts number
one.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly we do," answered number two.</p>

<p>"And who murdered him?" asked the other party, losing their
heads with excitement.</p>

<p>"Why, the prisoner, of course," answered number two with brutal
frankness.</p>

<p>Naturally this difference of opinion led to bitterness and
recrimination. Two distinct camps were formed, and the case bid
fair to become a <i>cause célèbre</i>. Theresa's sympathies seemed
to be on the side of the prisoner, for she visited him three or
four times, and there was a prevailing opinion that she believed in
his innocence. In the meantime, Colonel Ferraris proceeded to the
realization of the late Madame Herzog's estate, for under her will
he became entitled to everything, with the exception of one
thousand a year, which was to be paid to Theresa. The house in the
marshes he sold, and sold, too, at what was considered below its
value, owing to the haste he displayed in his desire to get rid of
it. All her securities, too, were realized, and the Buda-Pesth
house was likewise sold. The Colonel was considered a very
fortunate man, for it was known the deceased lady had been very
wealthy.</p>

<p>During the months that elapsed while these business matters were
being carried out Maurice Farnese still languished in prison; for,
in accordance with the customs of his country, a prisoner can be
held in durance vile almost indefinitely until the prosecution
think their evidence is sufficiently strong to ensure a conviction.
If it does not seem so, then they can wait and wait until they get
more evidence. So it was in this case. The prosecution wanted to
bar every loophole. It is true that it was generally admitted, and
indeed could be proved, that the prisoner looked upon Count Zanzy
in the light of a rival, and that in itself supplied the strongest
possible motive for the crime. But in other respects it must have
seemed to the prosecution that there were flaws in the indictment,
otherwise they would certainly have hurried the affair to an
issue.</p>

<p>But now a startling turn was given to the matter by the escape
of the prisoner. He had succeeded in getting out of his cell in the
prison at Buda-Pesth, where he was confined, and by crossing a
courtyard, and using a ladder that had been conveniently left by
some workmen, to mount to the top of the wall; he drew the ladder
up after him, and then utilized it for descending the other side of
the wall with, and he was then a free man. Where he had gone to
nobody knew, but it was rumoured that the beautiful Theresa had
gone off too, and that she and the accused man had proceeded to
Turkey. Whether there was any foundation or not for that rumour was
not clear. What was clear beyond all doubt, the prisoner had gone,
and Theresa was not found in her accustomed haunts. Therefore,
inferentially, she had accompanied him in his flight. The Colonel
was appealed to, but he declared he absolutely had not the remotest
idea where Theresa had gone to. What he did know was this:&mdash;A
few days previously she had visited him, and begged of him to let
her have a sum of money, which in English would be between four and
five hundred pounds. He questioned her as to what she wished to do
with it, and she declined to tell him beyond saying in a general
way that she desired to make some purchases. As she was entitled to
a thousand a year, he advanced her what she wanted, and that was
the last time he saw her.</p>

<p>At this time Karl Radnosky had a private bureau in Buda. For the
greater part of his life he had been in the Austrian Secret
Service, and he was looked upon as a walking encyclopaedia of
information of a kind which is seldom contained all in one head. He
was one of the best known of public men, and perhaps one of the
most reticent and reserved. His secrets were secrets indeed with
him, and the human being was not born who could worm them out of
him. But if in this he was a walking mystery, he was on the other
hand one of the most humane and kindly of men, ever ready to assist
those who could not assist themselves, while his remarkable talents
as a detective were ever at the service of those who wished to
right the wronged, or uphold the cause of justice and order. He was
an old man, and had retired on a pension, but as he could not bear
to lead an inactive life he had opened a private office, and he had
a staff of trained men and women, who were employed to make
inquiries in delicate and secret cases, whether of a political or
domestic nature.</p>

<p>And to him there came one day soon after Maurice Farnese's
flight an interesting and good-looking young woman, who was in deep
distress and well-nigh crushed with an overwhelming sorrow. She
announced herself as Marguerita Farnese, the sister of
Maurice&mdash;his only sister. She was governess in a Polish family
living near Warsaw, and she had first heard of her brother's
trouble by reading it in a Polish paper. Then she had lost no time
in journeying to Buda, but as soon as she arrived she learned that
her brother had taken flight. Knowing her brother's gentle nature,
and having regard to the many strange rumours she had heard, she
could not bring herself to believe that her brother had been guilty
of the great crime he was charged with. She thought there were
circumstances in the case which ought to be closely inquired into,
and she prayed Radnosky in her behalf and her unhappy brother's
behalf to take the matter up for her. She was not rich, she added,
but she had a little money, and every kreutzer she possessed she
vowed should be Radnosky's if he would but serve her.</p>

<p>He listened to her story deeply interested, and he was much
moved by her sorrow. So, telling her that he did not want her
money, he promised to serve her if he could. He said that all along
his own opinion had been that there was a good deal underneath that
wanted bringing out, and from the accounts he had read he thought
there was a good deal of mystery in connection with Madame Herzog's
death. Yet the prosecution, in their eagerness for a conviction,
had quite overlooked that feature of the case. So far as Marguerita
could be comforted she was comforted, and went her way and waited
in suspense for what might be revealed. From the interest Radnosky
took in the young woman, he resolved that he would not employ any
of his subordinates in the case, but go silently and secretly to
work himself. And the first thing he did was to visit the scene of
the crime. The young tree which had been growing on the summit of
the embankment, and which had been indented with shot, had been cut
down by those who were charged with the defence of the accused man,
because they said it afforded conclusive evidence that from the
position the Count was in at the time he met his death it would not
have been possible for the shot to have struck the tree if he had
fired his own gun at himself. Therefore the shot had been fired in
a horizontal direction, and from a distance.</p>

<p>Radnosky was allowed to examine the tree, and also the various
drawings that had been made as illustrating the supposed position
of the Count when the fatal shots were fired, and the known
position in which he was in when dead. The theory of Radnosky after
that was that the Count had been deliberately murdered, and that
the murderer, having accomplished his foul purpose, fired off the
Count's gun to lead to the belief that the young man had shot
himself. This theory, however, Radnosky did not give away. He kept
his thoughts to himself, and he set to work in a most ingenious
manner to try and get groundwork for his theory. He began by having
a dummy figure the exact height of the Count made, and when this
was ready he carried it out to the scene of the crime in the lonely
marshes. Then, by actual experiment, he found that a tree behind
the figure could not have been struck, having regard to the
position of the Count's wounds, if the figure&mdash;that is the
Count&mdash;bad fired the gun himself. But at a distance of twenty
paces from the ditch was a narrow creek very thickly fringed indeed
with tall reeds. Anyone being in a boat on that creek could have
pointed a gun at the Count as he stood, and the fringe of reeds
would have concealed the boat, the man, and the gun alike. By
firing from that position the dummy figure was struck in the head,
and a post behind made to do duty for the tree that had been cut
down, was peppered all over with the shot, as the tree had
been.</p>

<p>This was an important point determined, and Radnosky proceeded
to further investigations. He found that the reed-fringed creek or
ditch communicated with a broad and extensive lagoon; and though
the creek was very shallow, a flat-bottomed punt, such as was used
by the reed cutters and wild fowl shooters, could be easily taken
up the ditch. This was another step in advance. The next inquiry
was directed to finding out if any of the reed cutters who lived
their lonely lives about the shores of the lagoon, had missed a
boat on the day of the crime. And at last an old woman was found,
who though a victim to ague and crippled with rheumatism, had a
perfectly clear intellect, remembered perfectly that on the day the
Count was shot her man and her two sons were working at reed
cutting two or three miles away. At twelve o'clock she put up their
dinner, consisting of soup, bread, and wine, and went to the little
landing stage where her punt was usually kept, and with which she
intended to convey herself with the dinner to her family, but to
her astonishment she found the punt was not there. Thinking that
her husband and sons had taken the boat away she resolved that they
should go without their dinner. But an hour later one of the sons
arrived in hot haste to know why they had been left to starve. Then
she learnt that they had not taken the boat. Several days
afterwards it was found drifting about on the lagoon.</p>

<p>Radnosky considered he had now gained another point; but still
he kept his business to himself, and while he was working at
unravelling the mystery the authorities were exerting themselves
with might and main to capture the escaped prisoner, but without
avail. They could not get a trace of him or of Theresa, and it
therefore seemed pretty conclusive that they had gone off together.
Of course a sharp watch was kept upon his sister, as it was thought
she would be communicating with him, but she seemed as ignorant as
anyone else as to her brother's whereabouts.</p>

<p>Colonel Ferraris was busy at this time in superintending the
erection of a new villa he was building for himself in a
fashionable locality in Buda. He had bought an old house, entirely
pulled it down, and was raising in its stead a perfect little
palace of a place. And it was said that as soon as his house was
finished he was going to marry, one Madame Vertchikoff, a widow
lady who had money; so that altogether the Colonel was considered
to be an exceedingly fortunate man.</p>

<p>Of course Radnosky had heard the gossip about the sinking of the
boat in which the Count and the Colonel were using for their
fishing excursion one day, when the Count was nearly drowned, so he
proceeded to discover the spot where the accident had occurred, and
that done, he had the boat brought to the surface. Now, the reason
that no attempt had been made to recover the submerged boat before
was this&mdash;All the natives and dwellers in those swampy regions
are exceedingly superstitious, and they say that a boat that has
once been under water would, if used again, be sure to be fatal to
those using her. So the owner, poor as he was, preferred to let his
craft rot in the slimy ooze rather than attempt to get her up
again; but it came out that the Colonel had compensated the man
well for the loss of his boat.</p>

<p>When Radnosky got the boat out of the mud he had it dragged to
the bank, and, clearing it of its accumulations of slime and sand,
proceeded to a minute inspection of it, with the result that he
discovered in the bottom a large number of minute holes that had
been made probably with a gimlet; but, whatever they had been made
with, there they were, and it would have been an outrage on common
sense to have asked anyone to believe that those holes were the
result of accident. No, they had been deliberately made with a
purpose, and the purpose was to drown Count Zanzy. Now, who had an
interest in the Count's death? This it was imperative to determine,
and Radnosky did it by a reference to Madame Herzog's will.</p>

<p>Still keeping his discoveries to himself, the celebrated
detective hunted out Kovich, who nursed Madame Herzog in her last
illness. Kovich was a woman well on in years, with rather a
saturnine expression of face.</p>

<p>She was asked how it was she came to be a witness to Madame's
will.</p>

<p>She answered that she was a witness because the will had been
drawn up in a hurry, and as Madame thought she was at the point of
death there was no time to lose.</p>

<p>"Had she seen the will written?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kovich, "she had not."</p>

<p>"Did she sign the will in the presence of the dying woman?"</p>

<p>"No, she did not do so."</p>

<p>"Where did she sign it?"</p>

<p>"In an ante-chamber."</p>

<p>"Who took the will to her?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Ferraris."</p>

<p>"Did she know the contents of the will?"</p>

<p>"No, she did not read it."</p>

<p>"Did Colonel Ferraris pay her anything for being a witness to
the will?"</p>

<p>To this question Kovich replied with a distinct negative, but
there was something in her manner and tone which to Radnosky's mind
did not imply truth, and under his pulverising cross-examination it
was hardly likely that such a woman could endure; so she gave
herself away. She confessed that at first, thinking something was
wrong, she had declined to append her name to the document until
she had spoken to Madame Herzog on the matter. The Colonel,
however, told her such a course was not necessary, but she insisted
that it was necessary to make the document legal, whereupon he gave
her three hundred kreutzers on condition that she signed and held
her tongue. Being a poor woman, she accepted the money, and did as
she was told.</p>

<p>The other person who had signed as a witness of the will was
Maurice Farnese, but he was <i>non est</i>. Radnosky, however,
resolved to find him. He ascertained that some days before his
escape from jail Theresa left the place she had been living in at
Buda-Pesth, and proceeded to Vienna, where she stayed two or three
days. Just outside the hotel where she put up was a money-changer's
office, and in his place she had converted about fifty pounds of
Austrian money into English money.</p>

<p>That was a sign Radnosky made the most of, for what earthly use
would English money be to her unless she was going to England? And
as her disappearance from Buda almost synchronised with Farnese's
escape from prison the deduction was&mdash;always having regard to
the well-established fact that he had been her lover and the
Count's rival&mdash;he had joined her, and they had gone off to
England together. And, if that were so, some plan had been arranged
for them&mdash;in all probability by a third person. Otherwise, why
did she go to Vienna some days before he escaped? She must have
known he was going to escape, and she waited in the capital for his
coming.</p>

<p>"Who was the third person?"</p>

<p>No one had ever for a moment suspected Colonel Ferraris of being
in any way concerned in the Count's death. At any rate, nobody had
had the daring to breathe a syllable against him; for he was a
popular man and a rich man, and though it was more than hinted that
he had led a fast and somewhat disreputable life that wasn't
justification for besmirching his fame. So he went on courting the
widow and building his grand house. But Radnosky had his own way of
thinking, his own way of acting, and he learned that on the
strength of the sympathy he bore for Maurice Farnese, who had been
a good and faithful servant to him, the Colonel had several
interviews with him in prison, and was with him for some time the
night before he escaped.</p>

<p>Before travelling to England, whither he intended to go,
Radnosky went out again to the scene of the Count's murder in the
marshes, and with the assistance of some of the poor reed cutters
he instituted a most minute search of the creek by means of an
ingenious drag, which was so constructed and fashioned that if it
got hold of anything at the bottom it was bound to bring it up.
And, sure enough, after two days of patient labour Radnosky dragged
up to the light a double-barrelled fowling piece&mdash;the barrels
red with rust, the stock sodden with water. The name of the maker
of the gun&mdash;a Vienna firm it was&mdash;was stamped on it, but
there was no other name or mark. Radnosky carefully carried that
gun to his house, and as carefully locked it up, for he felt
certain it was the weapon that had been used to slay Count Zanzy
with, and that it would prove a very valuable <i>pièce de
resistance</i> in fixing the guilt on the guilty person.</p>

<p>And now at this stage Radnosky went to London, where he had on
several occasions been before, and as he spoke English almost as
well as his native tongue, he was quite at home on English
soil.</p>

<p>As various inquiries he instituted failed to place him on the
track of those he was seeking, he had recourse to an advertisement
in some of the leading papers, in which he asked for information of
a young Hungarian lady who was supposed to be living in England and
to be receiving money from friends either in Hungary or
Austria.</p>

<p>Nothing could serve to illustrate the man's extraordinary acumen
better than this. He never allowed any details of a case in which
he was interested to escape him. He went to work with a
thoroughness of purpose which left little or nothing undone
calculated to make his way clear; and so it is almost needless to
say that he had ascertained in Buda-Pesth that, under the will
which her aunt was supposed to have made, Theresa was entitled to
the by no means inconsiderable sum of one thousand pounds a year.
That is what it amounted to in the Austrian money. A certain
portion of Madame Herzog's estate was charged with the payment of
this money, which was to be drawn quarterly. Now, it was not likely
that anyone entitled to that snug little income would forgo it
under ordinary circumstances. And thus it came about that Radnosky
hit upon the shrewd plan of making it a means of discovering the
lady he was searching for. And it was a means, for in a short time
he received an intimation from the London branch of a foreign bank
that they received quarterly from a Vienna bank the sum of two
hundred and fifty pounds for and on behoof of a lady whom they knew
as Mrs. or Madame Dronwitch, then residing with her husband in
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours of receiving that information Radnosky
was in Edinburgh. The address given to him was one of the houses in
Regent Terrace. He found it was a good house, and on a brass plate
on the portal of the door was the legend&mdash;"Peter Dronwitch,
Professor of Languages."</p>

<p>Radnosky, not, it may be supposed, in his proper person as
Radnosky, sought an interview with the Professor, but he was absent
at the time, and the visitor found himself in the presence of the
Professor's wife, formerly Theresa, the niece of Madame Herzog. She
showed no concern until Radnosky remarked:</p>

<p>"I believe, Madam, your husband's real name is Maurice
Farnese."</p>

<p>She changed colour then. She became red and white alternately,
and she asked angrily:</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh," was the cool answer; "as I know a good many more things.
Perhaps my name will not be unknown to you. A good many people in
Austria and Hungary know it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she gasped, with a frightened expression on her
pretty face.</p>

<p>"Radnosky," he answered curtly.</p>

<p>She showed signs of fainting when he announced himself, but by a
great effort she recovered, and with a poor attempt at a smile, she
said:</p>

<p>"Yes; you are the famous Austrian detective; but what of that?
You have no claim upon my husband or on me. It is true my husband
escaped from prison; but he did so because he was perfectly
innocent of the dreadful charge brought against him."</p>

<p>"I believe myself that he did not murder Count Zanzy, but still
he ought not to have escaped, because no doubt he can throw a good
deal of light on the crime."</p>

<p>The poor little woman shuddered, and with great difficulty
restraining the tears that wanted to gush forth, for as tears are a
woman's weapon, so they are a source of relief when her soul is
overcharged with anguish, she said:</p>

<p>"I do not believe he can. He has been an illused man. He has
been a victim to circumstances."</p>

<p>"I believe that also," said Karl Radnosky, in his peculiar dry
way. "But, you see, your husband knows many things, he can tell
many things, and out of those many' things some may be of use in
elucidating certain points that are at present a little obscure.
Therefore I must talk to him."</p>

<p>"But you cannot, you shall not," cried the lady, with a renewed
expression of fear, for beneath the calm exterior of Radnosky she
fancied that there was a menace to her husband, whose liberty, if
not life, was in danger.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Madam," answered the imperturbable Austrian, "I
have been to some little trouble to find your husband, and having
come all this distance I can hardly return without the pleasure of
making the professor's acquaintance."</p>

<p>"What do you want with him?" demanded the lady, getting very
excited.</p>

<p>"I want to ask him sundry questions."</p>

<p>"To what end?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that remains to be seen. But he and I <i>must</i> meet. So
please tell me when he will return. You need not let me interrupt
your arrangements. With a book or a paper I can pass the time away.
But, Madame Dronwitch&mdash;if you elect to be called so&mdash;do
not try to circumvent me. I am your friend at present. You might
make me your enemy."</p>

<p>The man's manner, his words, his mode of uttering them would
have impressed a much stronger-minded person than Madame Dronwitch.
She certainly was impressed for the tears came at last, her pent-up
anguish would be pent up no longer. But Radnosky consoled her. He
had the gentleness of a woman, the heart of a child. Presently the
door bell rang. The lady started up, and was about to leave the
room.</p>

<p>"Stay," said Radnosky, "that is your husband?"</p>

<p>"It is, for I know the way he rings the bell."</p>

<p>"Good. Then you will remain where you are. I will let him
in."</p>

<p>She recognised the uselessness of making any attempt to oppose
this man, whose will was all powerful where he meant to have his
way. So she remained silent, and he went forward to the door. The
ringer was Maurice Farnese, otherwise Professor Dronwitch. His
amazement may be imagined when he beheld Radnosky, whom he had
often seen, and now recognised. Very pale indeed he was, as he said
with a faint smile:</p>

<p>"I certainly did not expect to see you here."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. During my long career I have often turned up
in places where I was not expected."</p>

<p>"My wife, my wife, have you seen her?" gasped Maurice in
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She is well. Come, we will join her." So they went
into Madame, and found her weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>"Beloved," said her husband, "why these tears? There is nothing
now to conceal, it shall all be known as far as I have anything to
tell. Question me, M. Radnosky, and I will answer."</p>

<p>"I will. Did you shoot Count Zanzy?"</p>

<p>"No; by the light of God's countenance I swear I did not."</p>

<p>"I believe you; but who did?"</p>

<p>"I did not see the shot fired, nor the hand that fired it, but I
could swear it was Colonel Ferraris' hand. He knew that the Count
and I were going out, in fact, he arranged the excursion, and he
impressed upon me that I was to be sure and take the Count through
the wood."'</p>

<p>"You signed a will, purporting to have been drawn out by Madame
Herzog?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"At the Colonel's instigation?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you see Madame write the will?</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you think she did?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You believe then that the Colonel forged that will?"</p>

<p>"I do now."</p>

<p>"But you did not at the time?"</p>

<p>"I did not. The Colonel is a most plausible and persuasive man.
He told me that Madame had just written the will, and desired me to
sign it. I wished to see Madame before I put my name to the paper;
but the Colonel said she was very ill, and I had better not disturb
her. When I was arrested for the murder, I knew that all the
appearances were against me, and how could I hope to combat
anything the Colonel might swear to. So I was depressed and broken
down; but the Colonel came to me and consoled me. He said that he
quite thought the Count had destroyed his own life, but public
opinion was dead set against me and I should have no chance. He
said the only plan for me, if I wished to save my life, was to
escape, and he would help me to do so; and as I had been a good and
faithful servant to him he would give me liberty and a wife at the
same time. For he told me that Theresa was breaking her heart for
me. How could I resist falling in with his plans? I had no hope
except through him; and he offered me not only life but the woman
whom I worshipped. He carried out his promise; he bribed one of the
jailors to aid me to get out of the prison; he had planned for me
to go to a certain house and disguise myself as a woman, and then
proceed to Vienna, where Theresa was waiting for me; and he
promised that, so long as we remained abroad, Theresa should
receive her money regularly.</p>

<p>"I confess that my conscience has troubled me: but still I
should have kept silent had you not appeared. The sight of you
convinced me that the time for silence had passed. I have told you
a truthful story. I defy any living man to dispute it."</p>

<p>So far as Radnosky had gathered up his evidence he knew that the
story he had listened to was veracious enough. What had to be done
was to establish its truth. So he returned to Austria, having first
exacted a promise from Farnese that he would keep in touch with
him. But the young man saw for himself that he had nothing to fear
now, so long as he did not attempt to thwart justice.</p>

<p>Within a few days of Radnosky's return to Buda-Pesth Colonel
Ferraris was lodged in jail. His arrest came like a thunderbolt out
of a summer sky to him. He was still courting the widow; still busy
with his house; but when the fatal announcement was made that he
was a prisoner, he must have felt that his day was done.</p>

<p>Owing to the representations that Radnosky made to the
Government, Madame Herzog's body was exhumed, and the internal
organs subjected to a most critical analysis by two of the most
famous chemists of Vienna, with the result that they found distinct
evidence that the unfortunate lady had been killed by vegetable
poison. The poison was supposed to be a decoction of what was
commonly known as marsh lily. Throughout those extensive marsh
lands, which extend back from the Danube between Buda and
Rutschuck, grows a small white flower of the lily tribe. At certain
seasons the stalks and roots of this flower yield a rank, viscid,
acrid liquor, which, on being mixed with alcohol, can be
administered in small quantities at a time to a human being to the
gradual destruction of health and life.</p>

<p>Pervintz, the housekeeper to the late Madame Herzog, and Kovich,
the nurse, both swore that they had seen the Colonel pour something
from a phial, which he took from his pocket, into her food or
drink.</p>

<p>So the links were forged. The gun which Radnosky fished out of
the creek was proved to have been the property of the Colonel. It
had been bought new from the makers in Vienna, and of this there
was the most direct evidence. There was circumstantial evidence to
warrant an inference that he purloined the boat and punched holes
in it in order that the young Count might be drowned.</p>

<p>Maurice Farnese and his wife were both brought back to Buda to
give evidence, and after a long and exhaustive trial Colonel
Ferraris was condemned to death. The sentence, however, was
subsequently commuted, on some technical grounds, to his being
interned for life in an Austrian fortress as a chained prisoner
subject to hard labour. His property was all confiscated, and
Madame Herzog's original will was ordered to be registered as her
only will. By that will, with exception of some legacies and
charitable bequests, Theresa, her niece, became her heir if Count
Zanzy died before the will was proved. Maurice Farnese and his
pretty wife had thus good cause to feel grateful to his sister, for
it was due to her that Radnosky's talents were brought to bear on
the Crime of the Lonely Marshes.</p>

5. MRS. WYNNIATT'S SKELETON&mdash;<br>
A STUDY IN PSYCHOLOGY</h2>

<p class="first">
THE case I am about to chronicle is sufficiently remarkable, I
think, to be worthy of expansion from my rough notes, and of being
set forth in detail. At any rate it is not without picturesque and
even weird elements, and it must be admitted that they certainly
lend an interest to a story.</p>

<p>It was just at the close of the decade of the fifties, and a
lurid decade it had been, for it had witnessed the tremendous and
disastrous struggle in the Crimea, and the great Indian Revolt,
when our hold on our Indian Empire was nearly shaken free. People
were looking forward to the dawn of the New Year 1860, in the hope
that it might inaugurate an era of peace, but as everyone knows
those hopes were destined to the blighted before a third of the
decade had been swept into the gulf of Dead Time, by the breaking
out of hostilities between North and South America. However, this
is by the way, and it is not my intention here to deal with that
remarkable struggle, although to a very small extent I saw
something of it.</p>

<p>It was just about Christmas time that I received a letter from a
lady whom I will refer to as Mrs. Josephine Wynniatt, asking me to
call upon her at her residence in Bruton Street, Mayfair, London.
The address indicates that she must have been a person of means;
for only those upon whom Mammon has smiled are able to take up
their abode in that fashionable locality. As a matter of fact Mrs.
Wynniatt was a wealthy woman. She was the widow of a gentleman who
had for many years held a very important Consular position under
the British flag, and he had succeeded to a considerable fortune on
the death of his father. He had only one son himself, and that son
had been such an outrageous scapegrace, that he cut him off with
the fine old crusted shilling, and dying left his fortune to his
widow, she thus found herself in possession of very ample means,
and free before all her youth had faded from her.</p>

<p>When I first called upon the lady I knew nothing of her from
personal acquaintance, but I had frequently heard her name
mentioned, and I was aware that she was generally regarded as being
eccentric. Dark hints were also let fall that there was some
strange mystery in connection with her life; though no one seemed
able to define the nature of the mystery. Certain bold tattlers,
however, went so far as to say that she had been very unhappy with
her husband, not from any fault on his side, for he, so it was
asserted, had displayed a passionate attachment to her, but she
could not bear him. Thus the rumour ran.</p>

<p>I regarded all this as so much society scandal which might or
might not have some truth in it. But I was too much a man of the
world to attach any great importance to frivolous gossip. The
inherent meanness and spitefulness of human nature, unless kept in
check by a well balanced mind, leads many people out of sheer
wantonness, to assail in a wickedly reckless manner the characters
of their fellow beings. From the tongue-poison of these pests of
society nobody's character is really safe, from the Queen on her
throne to the quietest and most sedate of citizens.</p>

<p>On complying with the request contained in the letter to call on
Mrs. Wynniatt at her house in Bruton Street, I was ushered into a
superbly furnished morning-room by a powdered flunkey, and I had
ample time to examine the rare articles of vertu, bric-a-brac, and
other nick-nacks so profusely scattered about before Mrs. Wynniatt
presented herself. She was a tall, stately woman, on the wrong side
of forty; handsome still, with a dignified manner apt at first to
convey the impression that she was haughty, even austere. But this
impression was speedily removed when her reserve wore off in the
course of conversation, and I came to the conclusion that she was a
charming and attractive person, somewhat vain, somewhat weak. There
was a pained and troubled expression on her face, as bowing with
easy grace she seated herself in an artistic pose on a luxurious
ottoman.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, sir," she began after a few preliminary
remarks, "that your varied experience has often enabled you to
verify the trite though true proverb, that there is a skeleton in
every cupboard. I am sorry to say I have my skeleton, and a very
unpleasant one it is. My friends have told me that I ought to be
the happiest woman on earth, and if worldly goods were all that
were required to complete the sum of human happiness, then my
friends would be right. In that respect I lack nothing; but in
asking you to give me your services, I must take you behind the
scenes a little and let you see the skeleton in my cupboard. You
will infer, of course, that I wish to avail myself of your
services; and I may take it for granted that you will respect the
confidence I repose in you."</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam, you may," I replied, as leaning back in my
chair I watched the workings of her face. It was an exceedingly
mobile face, capable of very many changes, and she impressed me
with the idea that she could be peculiarly secretive when it
answered her purpose so to be. In fact, I had no hesitation in
coming to the conclusion that for a woman, she was unusually
diplomatic, and not likely to give herself away readily under
ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>"Some time after my husband's death." she continued, "&mdash;I
may mention that for years he held a very important consular
position abroad&mdash;my only brother, Richard Julyan, came to live
with me here. This is a very tender subject indeed&mdash;" She
applied her handkerchief to her eyes, and seemed to be greatly
distressed. "In his youth Richard gave great promise of developing
into a brilliant man, and all his friends and relatives were
exceedingly proud of him. This promise was maintained until he was
about three or four and twenty. He graduated with honours at
Oxford, and everybody predicted a future for him. He had the
misfortune, however, to be remarkably handsome, and it was more
than hinted that there were some shameful pages in the history of
his College career. Be that as it might, he was engaged to marry a
lady of excellent family, who though not rich, as riches are
counted nowadays, were comfortably off. The lady, whose name there
is no necessity for me to mention, was an only daughter, and her
attachment for Richard can best be expressed by the common
phrase&mdash;'She was madly in love with him.' It was soon made
evident, however, that there was something wrong. Richard appeared
to avoid her, and at last he disappeared altogether. Means were
taken to discover his whereabouts, and in the fulness of time it
was revealed that even before he left college he had contracted a
secret marriage with a woman with whom he had had a <i>liaison</i>,
and who had borne him a daughter.</p>

<p>"This woman&mdash;this <i>creature</i>&mdash;" Here Mrs.
Wynniatt spoke through her clenched teeth, and her face was a study
in its display of concentrated hatred. "This creature was without
character, without shame, and the offspring of gutter people. When
Richard first met her she was a singer in low-class London
music-halls; and how my brother, brilliant scholar and a gentleman
as he was, came to allow himself to be entangled with such a
wretch, is one of those mysteries of human nature not easy to
explain by any ordinary process of reasoning."</p>

<p>She had become a little excited, and paused, during which I took
the opportunity to remark:</p>

<p>"Eve yet lives, madam, and man is still as weak as the Adam of
old."</p>

<p>She failed to see the appositeness of this somewhat epigrammatic
observation; for she exclaimed with an outburst of passion:</p>

<p>"Eve! Good gracious, man, you wouldn't liken <i>that</i>
degraded thing to Eve."</p>

<p>"A daughter of Eve," I put in.</p>

<p>"Yes," with a withering sneer. "A daughter of Eve. We are all
daughters of Eve, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Alas, we men know it," I said with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Donovan," the lady continued, "we won't enter into
any controversy. You men are all pitiably weak when a woman is in
the question. Otherwise you wouldn't allow yourselves to be wrecked
and ruined by women as often as you are."</p>

<p>"That is distinct evidence of woman's power," I ventured to say.
Mrs. Wynniatt stamped her foot with a little gesture of impatience,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Pray let me finish my narrative. When the lady to whom Richard
had been engaged heard what had happened, she nearly went
mad&mdash;poor fool as she was&mdash;and ultimately threw herself
away on a man whom she positively detested."</p>

<p>"How like a woman," I thought, though I did not dare give
utterance to my thought for fear of arousing Mrs. Wynniatt's
wrath.</p>

<p>"For some time I lost sight of my brother," she continued, "and
when next I heard of him he was a wreck. His horrible wife, thank
heaven, was dead; but he had sunk until he was an outcast&mdash;a
degraded sot. Oh, how it makes me shudder and cringe to have to
describe him like that."</p>

<p>"And his daughter," I asked; "what had become of her?"</p>

<p>The lady winced at this question, and she answered me with
averted gaze:</p>

<p>"I don't know; nobody knew. He never mentioned her; but probably
she too had died. Well, sir, for years I did all I could to reclaim
Richard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With your husband's knowledge?"</p>

<p>The question brought a little flush into her face; and she said
quickly and irritably:</p>

<p>"Yes;" then she checked herself, adding, "why should I tell a
falsehood over it? No, my husband did not know I was ashamed of my
brother, and I carried on my work secretly. Over and over again did
Richard promise me to reform, and I supplied him with money in the
vain hope that his manhood would assert itself, and he would rise
from his degradation. But, alas, alas! it was useless. Still I kept
an eye upon him, though it was only to see him sink lower and
lower, until he was shunned and despised by everyone, save my own
poor self. He was so pitiably weak, so lost to every sense of self
respect, so dead to every consideration for the sister who still
loved him, that he made not the slightest attempt to save himself.
I heard that he had habituated himself to the use of narcotic
drugs, opium in particular; and that he was chronically in a dazed
and stupefied condition. At last he became a pauper inmate of a
lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>Up to this point Mrs. Wynniatt had refrained from any outward
exhibition of her feelings by an obvious effort, but the effort
failed at this point of her painfully interesting story, and
rising, she sobbed audibly, going to the window so as to hide her
face from me. I remained silent, and presently she returned to her
seat, saying apologetically:</p>

<p>"Pray excuse my weakness. As I was telling you, Richard was
taken into an asylum; not because he was dangerous, or
violent&mdash;on the contrary he was gentle, submissive, and
yielding; but he seemed to be quite irresponsible for his actions,
and incapable of looking after himself; and I being the only friend
he had in the world, and as I had to do what I did secretly, I
considered it the wisest course to let him remain under the mild
restraint that was put upon him; but I took good care that he
should be well attended. He remained there until some time after my
husband's death; then as I was free to do as I liked, I allowed the
undying affection I bore for this man to get the better of my
judgment, and I conceived the&mdash;shall I say mad?&mdash;project,
for mad it seems to me now, of trying myself to redeem him. I
therefore released him from the asylum where he had so long been
confined, and had him brought here.</p>

<p>"Rooms were specially fitted up for his use and there was a
liberal supply of books and other things likely to interest him. I
engaged the services of a trusty man-servant, to do nothing else
but look after him; and the rest of the servants in my house knew
nothing whatever about Richard beyond that he was an unfortunate
relative of mine. For a long time the secret has been well kept.
Whatever rumours may have been set in circulation, the outside
world has known nothing of the skeleton in my cupboard. Richard
never went out. His rooms were large, airy, cheerful, and
comfortable, and such exercise as he cared to take he was able to
get there. But he detested physical exertion of any kind, and his
chief delight was in reading. An old and esteemed medical friend
has visited him periodically, and he gave me to understand that my
brother had shattered his constitution far too much for any hope to
be entertained of his complete restoration; but that in the
circumstances in which I had placed him he would, in all
probability, live for many years. It might be thought, having
regard to the career he had led, and the half imbecile state into
which he had hopelessly sunk, that his death would have been a
blessing and a relief, but I could not bring myself to think so. Of
course the world will call me weak and stupid. I cannot help what
the world says, nor do I care. My brother was precious to me, and
it afforded me some consolation in thus being able to watch over
the man and see that all that worldly love and care could effect
should be effected.</p>

<p>"But now I come to the <i>crux</i> of this wretched story. A
little more than a fortnight ago the manservant was suddenly
summoned to his home in the country to attend the death-bed of his
mother. Not caring to bring a stranger into the house, and thinking
that Kichard would be all right for a few days, I ordered my page
to look after him during the day. All seemed well for a week, when
one morning, to my horror and consternation, I was informed that
Richard had gone. That, however, is not the worst part of it. He
had made his way into my boudoir, which adjoins his rooms, and had
ransacked it, breaking open the drawers and cabinets, and carrying
off with him a considerable amount of valuable property in the
shape of jewelry and trinkets. The loss of those things, though,
does not concern me, although there are some family relics I should
like to have back; but from one of the drawers he took a bundle of
documents of the very greatest importance to myself, one of them
being a deed relating to some houses of mine. It ought to have been
in the safe keeping of my solicitor; but, some time ago, wishing to
peruse it, I brought it here and foolishly retained it.</p>

<p>"You will now have gathered, Mr. Donovan, why I have sent for
you. Such inquiries as I have in my own way been able to make have
failed to obtain any clue to Richard, and I want you to do your
best to trace him. I have told you his history and given you all
the particulars I have, in order that you might thoroughly
understand the position, and you will also understand how painfully
sensitive I am on the subject, and how desirous that the whole
matter should be kept as secret as possible. I wish to avoid a
scandal, and though it may be impossible to induce the wretched man
to return, you will, I trust, be able to recover the papers for me.
As for him&mdash;well, he must now take his chance, though it is
quite easy to predict what the end will be, nor will it be long in
coming."</p>

<p>By the time the lady had finished her narrative there was every
indication that she was deeply affected. In fact, if she had not
been a woman of considerable strength of will she would have broken
down entirely.</p>

<p>The inference I had drawn during the time I patiently listened
to her, was that she had kept something in reserve, that, in fact,
she had only told me half the truth. I gathered this from her
manner, the expression of her face, the look in her eyes. Anyone
used to studying the signs which the human face cannot conceal,
knows how much may be learnt thereby; and when I came to reflect
upon her story and subject it to a critical, mental examination, I
arrived at the conclusion that Richard Julyan was <i>not</i> her
brother, but her lover. The lady who had been "madly in love with
him" when he was "a young man of brilliant promise" was herself. In
desperation and despair she had "thrown herself away" on a
gentleman whom she did not love; and during all the years of her
married life she had, with characteristic feminine inconsistency,
watched over the man she did love. And certainly it redounded to
her credit and honour that when the death of her husband released
her, and she might have contracted another and advantageous
marriage, she preferred to sacrifice herself to a sentiment; for,
after all, it was only a sentiment, inasmuch as she knew perfectly
well that Richard Julyan could never be her husband. He simply
represented the phantom of her early love; but to that phantom she
clung. On this hypothesis could be explained the foundation for the
various rumours, particularly those which ascribed to her an
unhappy married life, with the love all on her husband's side.</p>

<p>I did not deem it advisable, at that juncture, ta tell Mrs.
Wynniatt what my views were, but I expressed a desire to have an
interview with the man-servant, if he had returned, who had had
charge of Julyan. She said he came back two days ago, and she at
once rang the bell and ordered the servant who attended to send
John Hissop&mdash;that was his name&mdash;to her. Pending his
arrival, I told her I should prefer to talk to Hissop alone. To
this she by no means readily consented, and was anxious to know why
I objected to her being present. I had to decline to give her any
reason, and pressed my point, and seeing that I was inflexible, she
reluctantly yielded.</p>

<p>As soon as Hissop entered the room I was struck by the keen
shrewdness of his general appearance. He was the very type of an
ideal gentleman's servant, of medium height, squarely built,
quiet-looking, unobtrusive, respectful, without being in any way
cringing. He was exceedingly neatly dressed, his face was clean
shaved, his hair cut short.</p>

<p>"Hissop," I said, "you are aware, of course, that your charge,
Mr. Julyan, has taken himself off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You have been looking after him for a considerable time, Mrs.
Wynniatt tells me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Now I want to know whether during that time you have formed any
opinion about Mr. Julyan?"</p>

<p>"I have, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what that opinion is?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if you won't say anything to missus, I don't mind
telling you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you may rest contented about that," I answered. "Mrs.
Wynniatt has given me instructions to try and trace her missing
brother, and I want to see if anything you can tell me will aid me
in any way."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what I've always thought about master is that he was
precious artful."</p>

<p>"Artful!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"What I mean is that he wasn't so bad in the head as the missus
seemed to think."</p>

<p>"Did your mistress see him often?"</p>

<p>"Yes, every day."</p>

<p>"Did he talk to her?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;very little. She used to do all the talking;
and he always seemed glad when she went away."</p>

<p>"Was there anything else in his conduct that struck you as being
peculiar?"</p>

<p>"He used to wear under his shirt a portrait in a little case
that was hung round his neck with a ribbon. Many and many a time
I've seen him looking at that portrait; but he would never let me
see it."</p>

<p>"You've no idea who it represented?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I haven't."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me this. Had he, to your knowledge, ever been in
Mrs. Wynniatt's boudoir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, often. She used to let him go in there and sit with
her."</p>

<p>"Were you present on those occasions?"</p>

<p>"No. I had to wait outside in the passage in case I should be
wanted."</p>

<p>I did not question the man any further. My interview had
elicited two important points. Firstly, Julyan was artful and
cunning, like most men of his nature, and to a very large extent
Mrs. Wynniatt was deceived in him. Secondly, he was, no doubt, well
acquainted with the fact that she kept valuable property in her
boudoir, and having got up in the middle of the night he had
possessed himself of her property, and then left the house by the
front door. Those were material facts which were valuable. Now what
were the probabilities? So far as I was able to reason them out by
a process of logical deduction, they seemed to me as follows: In
committing the theft he had been actuated by a motive not entirely
selfish&mdash;that is, he was thinking of somebody else. I was
confirmed in that opinion by his taking the title deeds. In an
ordinary way they could be of no earthly interest, because he could
not deal with them legitimately. Of course, having the deeds, he
might try to raise a mortgage on the property; but before he could
do that some inspection or survey of the premises would have to
take place, and that would certainly lead to detection.</p>

<p>Let us try and define now who the somebody was he was likely to
have had in his mind when he stole the deeds and jewels. Round his
neck&mdash;according to Hissop&mdash;he wore a portrait which he
was constantly looking at. It is a well-known psychological fact in
connection with men who have destroyed their brains by dissipation
and debauchery, that they often preserve a distinct recollection of
some relative or friend, until the mental image becomes a sort of
idol to them, which they worship. Now Julyan had had a daughter.
Mrs. Wynniatt never heard of the girl's death. Was it not likely
therefore that she was living; that Julyan wore her portrait; that
his thoughts were always going out towards her, and with the
remarkable cunning peculiar to nearly all forms of
insanity&mdash;for it is right to describe Julyan as being actually
insane, though not so insane as Mrs. Wynniatt supposed&mdash;he had
been biding his time and waiting his chance? What I wish to be
understood is, that, according to ray opinion, he was capable of
appreciating his surroundings; of clearly understanding his
position, and of reasoning things out for himself, so far as a
fixed idea went. At the same time he lacked self-control, and the
moment a chance occurred he would return again to his former
habits, and soon reduce himself to gibbering imbecility. Therein
was the kernel of his insanity; and that was where the necessity of
restraint arose. While under restraint, such a man would be sullen,
silent, crafty, watchful, and cunning. Such a form of dementia as
Julyan was afflicted with is rarely accompanied by frenzy; and so
the patient is described as "gentle" and "harmless." I have gone
somewhat into details on this point, because I want to justify the
conclusion I drew. Now let me look back for a moment. I have said
that, in my opinion, he had but one leading and fixed idea in life.
That idea was associated with the portrait. The portrait, in all
probability, represented his daughter. Assuming that to be so, she
was, so to speak, the one guiding light in his otherwise clouded
mind.</p>

<p>Following this line of argument, and always bearing in mind the
cunning of the man, another feasibility suggested itself. He would
have intelligence enough to know that he would be hunted for, and,
if retaken, be placed under restraint again&mdash;in all
probability a much more secure and irksome restraint than any he
had before experienced. Therefore, he would be careful to lie
<i>perdu</i>; or, to use a less idiomatic, but more explicit,
French term, <i>il se cacherait.</i> This might make it extremely
difficult for him to be tracked in the ordinary way. To strengthen
my suggestion about his being led by a fixed idea, which may have
been haunting him for months or years, where would such a man, who
had so long been shut off from the world, so to speak, be likely to
go to on finding himself once more free? He must have had some
place in view; some plan well worked out and prearranged.</p>

<p>I have now endeavoured&mdash;and, I hope not
unsuccessfully&mdash;to make clear to the reader the leading
features which influenced my inferences and deductions, and having
arrived at that stage I advanced another. I requested Hissop to see
me again, and when he came I went straight to the point I wanted to
reach.</p>

<p>"Hissop, have you ever conveyed letters or a letter anywhere for
Mr. Julyan?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, no, sir," came the halting reply; and the manner of the man
showed that he was not a good liar.</p>

<p>"Don't deceive me," I said. "This is a serious business, not as
far as you are concerned, for I don't know that it will affect you
personally, though you may have posted letters for him."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I will tell you the truth," he answered. "Some time
ago, I think it's between four and five months, Mr. Julyan asked me
to post a letter, and said if I did so he would give me a
sovereign; and that on a certain night I was to be at a spot that
he mentioned, when, in all probability, a letter would be given to
me to convey to him, and if I took him the letter safely he would
give me another sovereign."</p>

<p>"Where did he get the money from?"</p>

<p>"He had several sovereigns, which he had had for a long time,
and used to keep them tied up in a large silk handkerchief, which
he wore round his body, and would never part with."</p>

<p>"And you posted the letter for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where was it addressed to?"</p>

<p>"I really forget; but it was some place in the east of
London."</p>

<p>"What name was on the envelope?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. It was a very curious name; a foreign one I
think."</p>

<p>"And did you get the answer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I went one night to St. Paul's Churchyard, and carried a
newspaper in my hand, by Mr. Julyan's instructions."</p>

<p>"That was to be a sign by which you were to be known?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it was. After I had waited some time a Chinaman
came up to me and asked me if my name was Hissop?"</p>

<p>"Did he speak English?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, what followed?"</p>

<p>"He gave me a letter, and said I was to take it to Mr.
Julyan."</p>

<p>"Had you any further conversation with him?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. He walked away immediately."</p>

<p>"You've never seen him again?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you ever taken any other letters for Julyan?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You are sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"Now tax your memory, and try and remember the name of the
person to whom the letter was addressed."</p>

<p>"It was Mrs. Whang Sing; or something like that."</p>

<p>"It was Chinese, you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it was."</p>

<p>As there was nothing further to be made of Hissop, I dismissed
him; I felt I had got a clue now, and a very important one, and I
lost no time in acting upon it.</p>

<p>I proceeded to the East-end of London, where I instituted
inquiries with a view to discovering if anything was known of an
English woman being married to a Chinaman. Before long I
ascertained that it was notorious that in one of the most evil
quarters near Ratcliffe Highway, a Chinaman, named Wung Song, kept
"a den" which was frequented by Chinese, Japanese, Lascars, and
others; and that the presiding genius of the place was a young
English woman. This was another important link forged, and I soon
discovered that Wung Song's den was ostensibly a shop in a dreadful
alley leading out of the Highway. The shop was an emporium for
tobacco, sailor's knives, clothes, sea chests, boots, and the like.
It was a dirty, squalid, wretched hole, suggestive of sordidness,
craftiness, meanness, and wickedness of all kinds. My next step was
to penetrate into this den and learn its secrets, for it had
secrets, and dreadful ones I was sure. I was fully alive to the
difficulties I had to encounter, for no open attempt to solve the
mystery would be likely to succeed. Stratagem must be resorted to,
and the form that stratagem should take had to be determined. At
last I hit upon the following plan: I disguised myself as a sailor
man down on his luck, and I mingled with the loafers, the crimps,
the touts who infested that undelectable neighbourhood; and who
were simply human rats or human sharks, whichever way you like to
put it, ever on the alert for prey, and ready to turn and rend each
other in their eagerness to secure the biggest share. At that
period there was a place known as Green's Sailors' Home, which was
situated not far from the entrance to the East India Docks. This
home was the rendezvous for seamen of almost every nationality, and
where the prey was there were the crimps and blood-suckers also. At
length I scraped acquaintance with a desperate ruffian known as
"Dutch Sam." For years this fellow had pursued his unholy calling
of living by his wits. He preyed upon the sailors. He advanced them
small sums of money at enormous interest; he cashed their advance
notes at an enormous discount; he took them to slop shops and
procured clothes for them, charging four times the value of the
goods and pocketing the balance. He was, in short, a leech who
attached himself to a sailor man, and never dropped off until there
was nothing more to suck. Being a tout and crimp, he was in the pay
of all the dens of iniquity to which he lured his victims when they
had any money to spend. Repulsive and horrible as the fellow was, I
saw how he might serve my purpose. I told him that I had been in
China, which was true, as I had spent many months in the early part
of my career in Shanghai and Amoy. I gave him to understand that I
had acquired a taste for opium-smoking, and wanted to have a few
days of delirium in one of the East-end dens. I suggested that Wung
Song's might be a desirable place, if the mystic portal could be
past.</p>

<p>He grinned and leered at me as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Taint no use your trying that slum, mate, unless you've got a
few shiners, and even then Old Wung and his she-devil wouldn't let
you go in without a passport. You see they're afraid of the police
coming down on 'em."</p>

<p>"Who is the she-devil?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The white woman who lives with him."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"I'm blest if I know; and nobody else knows, 'cept Wung, and
perhaps he don't know."</p>

<p>"And what's the passport that is required?"</p>

<p>"Well, you'd have to be introdooced, and somebody would have to
swear you was all right."</p>

<p>"Would you do that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I would, if you made it worth my while."</p>

<p>I drew from my pocket a greasy, worn-out purse, that I specially
carried, and from the purse I produced a five-pound note: whereat
his eyes became like goggles, and his gills watered with greedy
expectancy.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that from?" he asked with a breathless
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Never you mind, I've got it." I answered.</p>

<p>"How much are you going to give me?" he demanded; his fingers
fairly twitching to grasp the note.</p>

<p>"How much will Wung want?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can work him for a couple of quid."</p>

<p>"All right," said I, "if you can do that you shall have the
other three."</p>

<p>He fairly snorted with suppressed excitement. He was round, fat,
and greasy like a porpoise, and he didn't breathe freely.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said, "let us change the note." So away we went to
a public where he was well known, and I converted the flimsy into
coin of the realm. He tried to grasp the money as it was placed
upon the counter for me; but I covered it with my hand, saying;</p>

<p>"No, you don't, Dutchy. You keep to your bargain. I'll keep to
mine."</p>

<p>He seemed a little surprised, for his dupes did not often oppose
him. I lifted the money; picked up a piece of newspaper lying on
the floor, and in this I carefully wrapped three sovereigns.</p>

<p>"There you are, now." I remarked. "You get me into Wung's, and
I'll slip that into your hand."</p>

<p>His bulgy face was very red with the anger he endeavoured to
conceal, for he was not used to being bound down by any
hard-and-fast compact, and his pride&mdash;for even such a wretch
as he was had pride of a kind&mdash;was wounded. However, he
snarled:</p>

<p>"Come on then, let us go."</p>

<p>So away we went, and when we reached Wung's shop it was dusk:
but two or three guttering candles stuck in bottles about the shop
enabled me to take stock of the place. Behind a narrow counter,
that was heaped up with all sorts of things&mdash;tobacco, cigars,
bundles of red cotton handkerchiefs, oilskins, etc., and on which
were little stands containing smouldering joss sticks, which filled
the air with their suffocating and foetid odour, was Wung, busy
attending to his customers; for the limited space was crowded with
Lascars, Chinese, and amongst them were two or three negroes. They
all looked wretched, forlorn, cold, and miserable. Wung was an
evil-eyed rascal; his yellow face deeply pitted with small-pox. The
floor of the place was greasy; the ceiling perfectly black with the
grime of ages. All round were shelves closely packed with goods,
principally handkerchiefs, sailors' clothes, sea boots and
oilskins, tin plates and pannikins. The babel of tongues was
deafening; each man seemed to be talking against the other. At last
Dutch Sam managed to get a word or two with the evil-eyed Wung, and
when they had talked for some moments Wung beckoned to me, and
elbowing my way to the counter, he said to me:</p>

<p>"You all wellee proper?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "I'm not going to blow on you."</p>

<p>"You want to makee big smoke; two or three days, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You got muchee money?"</p>

<p>"I've got two pounds."</p>

<p>He made an exclamation in Chinese; then added in his pigeon
English:</p>

<p>"Two pounds wellee little; you makee more?"</p>

<p>"I can't, I have no more. You can take that or leave it," I said
sullenly "All right; me takee; givee me."</p>

<p>I handed him the two sovereigns, and lifting up a ragged, faded
limp curtain at the end of the shop, he disclosed the entrance to a
passage. He bawled out something in Chinese, and then bade me go
in. But before I could do so Dutch Sam seized my arm. I knew what
he meant, and I handed him the piece of paper containing the three
sovereigns. Then I entered the passage, and the mouldering and
filthy curtain shut me off from the shop. For a minute or two I
stood, for as there was no light I could not see. But then suddenly
a door was opened at the end of the passage, and rays of light
streamed forth, but a female figure stood in the doorway and partly
intercepted the rays; and standing thus, and but dimly brought into
relief by the light, she presented an extraordinary picture. Her
head was covered with a tangled mass of matted fair hair, and she
was clad in what seemed to be a long flannel nightgown.</p>

<p>"Come this way," she said in English; but her voice was thick
and ropy, and was like a rasp grating on one's nerves.</p>

<p>I went forward, and found myself in a little room. The walls
were hung with dark coloured felt, and the floor was covered with
the same material. There was a long couch on each side, and a lamp
was suspended from the blackened ceiling. The woman was about
thirty, and at one time must have been fairly good-looking. Her
hair was the colour of straw; her face was pasty, and suggestive of
putty; her eyes were bleared, heavy, and stupid looking.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible," I thought, "that this is Julyan's
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Are you Wung Song's wife?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, with a snarl.</p>

<p>"You're an Englishwoman?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not a Chinese woman, anyway.-"</p>

<p>"But yet you've got a Chinese husband."</p>

<p>"And what if I have? what have you got to do with that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. It would not have been anybody's business, I
suppose, if you had married Old Harry if he had been to your
taste."</p>

<p>"Of course it wouldn't." Then as if to turn the conversation she
said, "I suppose you've come here to smoke; haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you used to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Then take your boots off, and come in here."
She indicated a doorway before which hung a black curtain; and when
I had complied with her request, she drew aside the curtain, and
revealed a startling scene. No window was visible, all the walls
being hung with felt; the floor was also thickly felted. On each
side of the room running the whole length was a long low bench
covered with carpet. While at the end of the room were what may be
described as ship bunks; four one above the other. There were two
or three small, round, Oriental tables near the benches, and on
each side, and on each table burned a tiny lamp. From the ceiling,
which was black, like those in the outer apartments, hung a lamp
enclosed in rose-coloured glass. The bunks were empty, save one;
but all I could discern was that there was a man in it, though what
he was like it was impossible to tell, as he was concealed in
shadow. There were other figures on the benches; I counted eight;
they were Asiatics, and they were all under the influence of the
pernicious drug which they were smoking. The air of this chamber of
living death was indescribably horrible, and the wonder was that
any human being could exist in it; but it is astonishing what men
can accustom themselves to. The silence too was that of a tomb, for
the felt deadened all sound; and the narcotised wretches
themselves, save one man, who seemed very restless, were as still
and silent as corpses.</p>

<p>The woman prepared the end of one of the benches for me by
placing there a dark coloured rug and a short round bolster. She
told me to take my place; and when I had done that she moved up one
of the little round tables, on which were a pipe, some tobacco, a
lamp, a tiny tin bowl containing the semi-liquid opium, and a sort
of bodkin to lift it up with. She next produced from a cupboard
which I had not before observed, a small glass jar, containing what
seemed to be black marbles. Removing the lid she offered me the
jar, with the remark:</p>

<p>"Do you eat the stuff?" I answered.</p>

<p>"No;" she grinned horribly, saying: "You don't know what life is
then," and shaking two of the balls or marbles into her palm, she
tossed them into her mouth and swallowed them.</p>

<p>Then, replacing the jar, she left me. Filling my pipe with the
tobacco, but avoiding the opium, I began to smoke, and when my
senses had become more accustomed to the place, I was able to
realise the strange scene in all its weird details. That the woman,
Mrs. Wung Song, as she called herself, was Julyan's daughter, I did
not doubt for a moment. I even thought that she bore a strong
resemblance to him, judging from his photograph which Mrs. Wynniatt
had given me, and which had been taken during the time he was
confined in the asylum.</p>

<p>Presently I arose and went to the bunk I have referred to, to
see who its occupant was. He was a white man, and was steeped in a
narcotic sleep, his face almost covered by the rug. I pulled this
aside, and revealed Richard Julyan; but to be doubly sure, I put my
hand inside his shirt to feel if he had the photograph which Hissop
had spoken of. It was there, sure enough; and possessing myself of
it, I went under the lamp, opened the case and gazed upon the
likeness of an exceedingly pretty girl of about twenty, in whose
features after I had studied them for a while I traced a
resemblance to Mrs. Wung Song's.</p>

<p>Retaining the photograph, I returned to my couch and continued
smoking: and whether it was due to the heavy, drugged atmosphere,
or the tobacco, or both combined, I know not, but I gradually lost
my senses and went to sleep. How long I remained insensible I don't
know, but when I awoke and looked round I noticed that only two men
remained on the benches. Julyan was propped up with bolsters in the
bunk, and the woman was administering something to him out of a
teacup. He looked ghastly in his paleness. His hair was
dishevelled, his cheeks hollow, his eyes sunken, his face awfully
haggard. He was more suggestive of a corpse that had been
galvanized into motion than a living man. He groaned and moaned,
and she muttered something to him, though what it was I couldn't
hear, for she too seemed to be in a maudlin state of stupidity I
lay still and watched. When he had swallowed all the fluid that was
in the teacup, his chin sunk upon his chest and he remained
motionless. Then the woman, looking horrible and more like the
creature of diseased and distorted imagination than a living woman,
staggered across the room, placed the cup on a table, and coiled
herself up on the bench, with her head on one of the bolsters. Half
an hour later I rose, feeling sick and ill, owing to the dense
fumes that permeated and saturated the mephitic atmosphere. I went
to the bunk; Julyan was perfectly unconscious. I turned to the
woman; she was in the same condition, and as there was nothing more
to be gained by remaining there, I left. Wung was in his shop as I
passed out. He was alone, for it was between seven and eight in the
morning. He grinned at me and said: "You all wellee? Had good
time?"</p>

<p>I nodded, for I could not speak; my head was in a whirl; I felt
deadly sick. When I reached the open air, which seemed like heaven
after the experiences of that hideous den, I staggered like unto a
drunken man. I really felt as if I should sink to the ground, but I
managed to keep up until I reached a thoroughfare, where I procured
a cab and drove to my home.</p>

<p>It was not until two days had passed that I recovered
sufficiently to be able to call upon Mrs. Wynniatt. I felt that it
would not be kind to her to conceal anything, so I laid the whole
facts of the case before her. She was inexpressibly shocked, and
urged me to try and rescue Julyan; but I impressed on her the
advisability of leaving him to his fate if she wished to avoid a
scandal and an expose of her affairs, and I promised that I would
try and recover her property. She did not readily fall in with my
views; but I urged them upon her again and again until at last she
consented.</p>

<p>A few days later I waited upon Wung Song, "clothed and in my
right mind" this time. I told him that he was harbouring a man who
had committed a serious theft&mdash;one Richard Julyan. He flew
into a passion, told me that I lied, and that Julyan, who was his
wife's father, had been there for a long time. I soon convinced him
that unless he listened to reason, he would be inside a prison in
an hour. That brought him to his senses, and I insisted on the
restoration of the things Julian had taken away from Mrs.
Wynniatt's house. He retired to talk the matter over with his wife,
and after a time returned to me with the deeds, but he said the
jewelry and trinkets had been lost. I did not for a moment believe
him, but it was Mrs. Wynniatt's urgent desire that I would not make
the matter public. Rather than that, she would have sacrificed half
her fortune, she said; and so long as she got the deeds, she cared
not a rap for the other things. What could I do under such
circumstances other than what I did, which was to take her back the
documents and let the matter end. I was determined, however, that
Wung Song should not entirely escape, for he was a dangerous
rascal, so I called the attention of the sanitary authorities to
his premises, with the result that an official visit was paid him;
and so horrible and dangerous was the den found to be that a
magistrate's order was obtained to shut it up, and Wung was given a
week in which to clear out. When that period had expired Richard
Julyan was found to be in a dying state; his mind had quite gone,
and he was a helpless imbecile, incapable of understanding anything
or recognising anybody. He was removed to the London Hospital,
where he lingered for a fortnight, when the Angel of Death wrote
"Finis" on the last page of his strange history. Let me add, I
ascertained beyond all doubt that Mrs. Wynniatt never had a
brother. The extraordinary infatuation, therefore, that prompted
her to cling to the weak-brained Julyan, and even when all hope had
gone, endeavour to save him from his inevitable fate, is another
instance of the lengths to which a woman's devotion will carry
her&mdash;a devotion which has no equivalent in the other sex. No
ordinary standard can ever be applied to gauge and measure the
depth of a woman's love&mdash;a love that passeth man's
comprehension.</p>

<p>I may mention that I made it my business to learn the history of
Julyan's daughter, so far as it was possible to do so; but it is so
remarkable, so astounding, that it forms a tale in itself, and I
must reserve the telling of it for a future occasion.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. THE DEED OF DEAD MAN'S MOOR</h2>

<p class="first">
WOLDHOLM, which is a quaint little Yorkshire market town with a
population of nearly six thousand inhabitants, is situated on the
edge of one of the great wolds. It is an ancient village, its
origin dating back to Saxon times. From time immemorial a weekly
market has been held in the village, when people flock in from all
parts of the country. With the exception of this one day's
excitement in the week, Woldholm is a dreamy Rip Van Winklish sort
of place, and seldom does anything out of the ordinary occur to
disturb the repose of the inhabitants. A good many years ago,
however, an exciting little drama was enacted in the neighbourhood,
and as I played a part in it, I propose to tell the story, which is
so full of strong dramatic interest that it would be a pity to
spoil it by merely bare outlines. I will therefore narrate it with
the necessary details, and a due regard for the <i>mise en
scene</i>. It is important I should state that at the period I am
dealing with the village had been connected by a local line with
the main line of railway running from the north to London. The
nearest main station was York, and that was twenty miles away. As
may be imagined, the local service was not very frequent, and on
important occasions when despatch was imperative people would drive
the twenty miles to York in order to get the express train there
for north or south as the case might be.</p>

<p>One bitter night in December, a young man named George Hargood,
left Woldholm in a dog-cart, driven by a sturdy country bumpkin,
familiarly known amongst his associates as "The Flipper," but whose
real name was William Paget. The object of Hargood in undertaking
such a journey on such a night was to catch the midnight up express
to London, as it was of the highest importance he should be in
Paris the following night. His mission was a delicate one, and he
had been entrusted with it by his employer, Mr. Millwater, the
village banker. Young Hargood had been in the bank for some years,
and had won a position for himself by his integrity and devotion to
duty. When it became necessary for Mr. Millwater to send a special
messenger to Paris to confer personally with one of his principal
clients, who was temporarily sojourning there, he felt that Hargood
was the most reliable person he could select, and as the journey
was not decided upon until after the last local train had departed,
there was no alternative, if the mail was to be caught at York, but
to drive there, a distance, as I have said, of twenty miles.</p>

<p>In ordinary weather the journey was pleasant and easy enough,
for there was an excellent road running over the wolds; but on a
dark, snowy winter night it was different, and powers of endurance
and hardihood were required for the drive. The worst part of the
journey was that known as Dead Man's Moor; a wild, weird strip of
moorland country at the best of times, but terribly so in the
winter and in a snowstorm. Then there was not a little risk, for it
was really difficult to keep to the road, which became obliterated
by the snow, and no one would have thought of crossing the moor on
a winter night except under the pressure of circumstances. In
Hargood's case the exigencies of the circumstances left him no
alternative unless he had chosen to risk his position in the bank;
and so in spite of the protests of his mother and his sisters he
set off, leaving Woldholm about ten o'clock; and as the train was
not due at York until three in the morning, there was ample time to
accomplish the journey under ordinary conditions. But the weather,
which had been bad for some days, had developed that afternoon into
a fierce snowstorm, and some of the villagers who knew of Hargood's
journey predicted:</p>

<p>"It will tak' him all his toime to get across the moor."</p>

<p>The Flipper, however, who was an assistant groom in Mr.
Millwater's service, was an experienced driver. He had driven to
York and back scores of times, and the mare he drove that night was
also well used to the road. The vehicle was a light dog-cart
suitable in many respect for such a journey, but, of course,
affording no shelter whatever from the weather to those who rode in
it. But Hargood wore a heavy fur-lined coat, and in addition he had
two woollen rugs. The Flipper, besides a topcoat, wore a Mackintosh
cape, and he had a horse rug tied round his waist, while his head
and face were protected by a sou'wester with flaps that fastened
under the chin.</p>

<p>When the young fellows set off on their venturesome night
journey, the air was thick with driving snow, and the wind was
piercing. The Flipper, who was like a white statue on the driving
seat, tooled the mare with consummate skill, but, occasionally,
when the open moor was reached, the fierce gusts that came tearing
down over the wolds caused her to shy, and now and again she came
to a dead stand and displayed considerable nervousness,
consequently care and patience were required in the driving, but
the Flipper bore up bravely and cheerfully. He was a courageous
young fellow of about twenty, and having been born and brought up
in the Wold district, he was familiar with the moors, both in fair
and foul weather. On the present occasion he seemed rather to enjoy
the situation, and now and again his exuberance of spirits found
vent in whistling and snatches of song. The pace was necessarily
slow, and Hargood began to have serious doubts whether in the face
of such a storm he could reach York in time to catch the train. Not
only was the road very heavy with snow, but it was absolutely
impossible to distinguish it from the wilderness of white that
stretched away on all sides. Considerable caution, therefore, had
to be exercised to prevent accident, for if the proper track had
not been kept a spill in some of the deep depressions of the wold
would have been certain. But to a large extent the driver allowed
the horse to exercise her own instincts, and though she evidently
did not like the business she pegged away.</p>

<p>After a time the storm seemed to increase. The air grew thicker,
the wind fiercer. No sound arose from the horse's hoofs, none from
the wheels. It was deathly silent, and the prospect, such as it
was, was suggestive of the Arctic regions during the long winter
night. Young Hargood came to the conclusion that it was folly to
have commenced such a journey under such atmospheric conditions,
and at last even the Flipper began to display some anxiety, and
frequently jumped down from his seat in order that he might lead
the horse. The lamps of the dog-cart were lighted, but the wet,
blurred glass prevented much light from escaping, and owing to the
air being so full of snow, nothing could be distinguished, more
particularly as the steam from the panting animal's body encircled
driver and traveller in a cloud of white vapour.</p>

<p>When this sort of thing had gone on for a couple of hours or so,
and still the white wolds stretched around, the snow fell, and the
wind blew, the Flipper for the first time gave expression to
certain doubts about being able to accomplish the journey, for he
remarked as he jumped to his seat after having led the horse for a
considerable distance:</p>

<p>"I fear as how we wunnat get to York city in time, Measter
Hargood. Drifts are too deep hereabout to put any pace on. But if
we were across Dead Man's Moor t' worst part would be passed, and
we could go ahead then. But I shouldn't wonder if we got stuck this
side o' Deenes Dip."</p>

<p>"We must try and do the journey, Flipper," remarked Hargood,
anxious indeed to carry out his instructions, and yet feeling that
the chances were against him.</p>

<p>"Oh, ay, we'll try, of course; and we'll do it if it's to be
done," answered the Flipper with the spirit of a true Briton, as he
coaxed the mare to quicken her pace.</p>

<p>"How far is it now to Dead Man's Moor?" asked Hargood.</p>

<p>"Nigh on half a mile, I reckon, judging by the distance we've
come."</p>

<p>"After we pass Deenes Dip it's all downhill, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It be, Measter Hargood, and half a mile further on we get on to
the high road, where we can spank along."</p>

<p>The fierce wind made conversation by no means easy, and it
ceased, and as Hargood buried his face deeper in his upturned fur
collar, the Flipper continued to urge Biddy the mare to renewed
efforts, with all the cajolery at his command, and that was no
small stock. The part of the route called Dead Man's Moor was the
highest part of the wold. It derived its lugubrious name from the
fact that in the good old times a couple of gibbets stood on the
very summit of the rise, and could be seen for miles around, and
these gibbets were seldom without a ghastly burden of mouldering
bones. Our forefathers were not so squeamish and sentimental as we
of the end of the nineteenth century are, and they had a rough and
ready means of dealing with evil doers. Nowadays, if we want to
flog the most brutal of garrotters up rise the old women, male and
female, and shriek themselves hoarse about the "degrading and
demoralising" nature of the punishment, as though you could
demoralise and degrade a human brute who would choke the life out
of you for a few shillings, or who would explode a bomb amongst a
crowd of women and children. Such wretches would have had a very
short shrift at the beginning of the century. However, this is by
the way.</p>

<p>At the summit of Dead Man's Moor a peculiar ravine stretched
away east and west, and was known as "Deenes Dip." It was as if
some convulsion of nature had rent the land there, making a long,
jagged fissure that extended for miles. Owing to the shelter
afforded by the sides of the ravine there was a luxuriant growth of
shrubs and trees, which afforded shelter to flocks of game. Crime
had been committed in Deenes Dip, for footpads had lain concealed,
and sprung out on passing travellers. The spot lent itself to
exploits of the kind, for the road descended abruptly into the
ravine. Lonely pedestrians and solitary horsemen generally kept
their eyes open when they reached the Dip, and relaxed not their
wariness until they had passed it. But Hargood and his companions
did not concern themselves for a moment about the possibility of
meeting with footpads or highwaymen at such an hour and on such a
night. Even the rascals of the road would have thought twice before
exposing themselves to such a furious storm. At night few people
traversed the moorland highway except it was in the summer time.
Then the market folk from the scattered villages sometimes used it,
but they always travelled in numbers, and since the opening of the
branch line of railway the road across the moors had been all but
deserted, consequently the occupation of the ruffians had gone, in
that region at any rate.</p>

<p>When our travellers on the present occasion came to the
notorious Deenes Dip the Flipper jumped off his seat in order to
lead the horse down into the hollow. And when the bottom was
reached the light of a bull's-eye lantern was with startling
suddenness flashed full in the mare's face, causing her to spring
aside so abruptly and to plunge to such an extent that she
overturned the cart. Hargood was shot out into the snow, and, being
so swathed in wraps, was powerless for the time being to help
himself. But no sooner had he fallen than a man sprang upon him and
dealt him such a heavy blow over the head with a stick or
life-preserver that he was completely stunned, and the blood flowed
from his wound so rapidly as to redden the snow around him. While
this was occurring, a second man had seized Flipper, and, throwing
a sack over his head, twisted a cord tightly about his arms,
binding them to his body so that he could not offer the slightest
resistance. The whole business had been carried out so promptly and
with such skill that neither of the victims had time to even utter
a cry, not that there would have been the slightest possibility of
help coming to them in such a lonely spot. Nor had they had the
slightest chance of catching even a glimpse of the fellows who
attacked them, nor did the ruffians themselves utter a word.</p>

<p>The first man, having silenced his victim, proceeded to tear off
his wraps, and then to search his pockets. As Hargood was
insensible at this time, he of course, did not know what was being
done. But it would appear that the ruffian examined the young man's
purse, which contained a considerable sum of money. Some of this
money was subsequently found on the spot where the outrage was
committed. The rest the fellow appropriated, and then thrust the
empty purse back into the victim's pocket. Then from an inner
breast-pocket of Hargood's undercoat the thief abstracted a
pocket-book, which he carried off. That secured, the villains slunk
away as silently as they had appeared.</p>

<p>When Flipper found himself released from the grip of the fellow
who had held him tightly, notwithstanding the rope and the sack, he
began to make the most desperate efforts to get free. And by dint
of considerable wriggling and struggling he worked his arms out of
the coils of rope, and got the sack off his head. He himself was
uninjured, but for a moment or two felt dazed. He soon got all
right, however, and then he made out that his companion was lying
on the snow. At first he thought he was killed. He struck a light
with some matches he carried with him, and set fire to a piece of
newspaper in which he had carried some meat and bread in his
pocket.</p>

<p>By the glare he saw that Hargood was ghastly pale, as white as
the snow almost, and blood was flowing freely from the wound in his
head. A little way off the mare, attached by one shaft to the
overturned cart, was standing quietly enough. The other shaft had
been wrenched off when the cart went over.</p>

<p>The Flipper, having his wits about him, clapped a plaster of
snow on Hargood's bleeding wound, which soon restored the young
fellow to consciousness. When he had recovered his scattered
senses, he examined his pockets in order to find out to what extent
he had been robbed. Flipper made another torch of a piece of paper,
and by the light thus afforded, Hargood ascertained that, though
all his money had gone that was in coin, two five pound notes were
left in his purse that had evidently been overlooked. His
pocket-book, however, to which he attached more value than he did
to his purse, for reasons that will presently be explained, had
been taken away altogether.</p>

<p>As the bitter cold made it dangerous to remain inactive, the two
young men righted the dog-cart, which they did without much
difficulty. Then while Hargood bandaged up his broken head as best
he could with the appliances at hand, Flipper managed by means of
handkerchiefs and some cord which was in the bottom of the cart to
fasten the broken shaft. Of course they made no attempt to trace
the author of the outrage. Indeed, it would have been worse than
folly to have done so under such circumstances. And as it was
useless to continue the journey, firstly, because they could not
hope to catch the train as so much time bad been lost, and owing to
the broken shaft the horse could only be driven gingerly; and,
secondly, because Hargood had been deprived of certain papers,
without which his journey to Paris was rendered useless. He was now
anxious to get back to Woldholm as soon as possible in order that
information of the outrage might be given to the police, and
efforts made to capture the thieves. But everything was
unfavourable to expedition. The storm seemed to rage with increased
fury, and the snow had drifted so deeply that progress was
painfully slow, while to add to their difficulties, the broken
shaft kept parting, and Flipper was at his wit's end what to do
until it occurred to him to cut a portion of the reins and make a
strap to bind round the fracture, and even then it was necessary to
lead the horse; consequently only a walking pace could be kept up
and it was six o'clock in the morning before the village was
reached. Hargood felt very ill, for he had lost a good deal of
blood, and was weak and faint. Nevertheless he made his way to the
police station, where he gave information of the outrage, and that
was all he could do, for he could say nothing about the thieves, as
neither he nor Flipper had seen them. There were two men certainly,
and there might have been more for aught the young fellows
knew.</p>

<p>Having carried out this duty, Hargood went to his mother's
house, and was got to bed as soon as possible, and Flipper drove
back to his master's house. The mare no doubt was very glad to get
to her stall, and when Flipper had rubbed her down, fed her, and
covered her up, he went off to his bed, and slept soundly till one
o'clock in the day.</p>

<p>During all this time the police remained inactive, and they
accounted for their extraordinary indifference by saying that as
the thieves had evidently laid their plans with such deliberation
and foresight they would be sure to get clear off; and, moreover,
the victims had not been able to furnish the slightest description
of their assailants. Therefore all that could be done was to
telegraph information of the outrage to York, and one or two other
towns.</p>

<p>As soon as it became known in Hargood's household that he was
injured, a doctor was called in, and he proceeded to dress the
wound, and that done he gave the patient a sleeping draught. When
the young man awoke it was mid-day, and being very much concerned
he sent a message at once to his employer, and that was the first
information Mr. Millwater had received, for when he left his home
Flipper was still snoring.</p>

<p>As soon as the banker heard the news he walked over at once to
the residence of his clerk, and questioned him about the outrage.
Hargood could only tell the story in brief; he could give no
details of the attack, for he was stunned at once. What he knew
was, he had been robbed of all his loose money, and also of his
pocket-book. That fact was a very serious and very significant one,
for in the pocketbook was a document of considerable importance,
and the banker was inclined to think that one crime had been
committed to cover another. In deep concern, therefore, he went to
the police station, and had an interview with the chief inspector,
and was highly indignant when he learnt that no active steps had
been taken to capture the rascals.</p>

<p>He told the inspector it was a far more serious business than he
dreamed of, and that every possible exertion should be made to
arrest the fellows. But the inspector said that telegrams had been
sent off, and beyond that it was difficult to do anything, as they
had no description whatever of the men. Flipper had handed him a
morsel of a printed neck-handkerchief, which in the short struggle
that had ensued between him and the man who threw the sack over his
head&mdash;for it must not be supposed Flipper remained absolutely
passive while that was happening&mdash;he had managed to tear from
the fellow's neck. But the inspector expressed an opinion that the
"bit of rag" was not likely to be of much use. Mr. Millwater,
however, took a different view, and begged that he might be allowed
to have the piece of neck-handkerchief for a time, and so it was
given to him.</p>

<p>He next hurried to his home, and severely questioned Flipper,
whose description of the affair was as follows:</p>

<p>"All I know, Measter, is, there was a flash o' light, and th'
mare plunged and reared, so that she overturned th' cart, and young
Measter Hargood was pitched out. Then there was a sack shoved over
me, and I tried to get a grip o' th' chap what did it, and I
collared him by th' neck, but he had a scarf on, and a bit on it
was torn away I stuck to that bit, and I gave it oop at Police
Station."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be got out of Flipper than this, for
the lad had nothing else to tell, and in his own mind Mr. Millwater
was sure if Flipper had only had a fair chance he would have given
a good account of himself in his encounter with the thieves, for he
was a lusty young giant, with any amount of the Yorkshire pluck, so
the next thing the banker did was to telegraph to me in London,
asking me, if possible, to leave by the next train. It
unfortunately happened that I was away that day, so I did not get
the message till the following morning. I then wired to ask if my
services were still wanted, and received for reply:</p>

<p>"Yes, come at once Trap shall meet you at York. Otherwise you
will have two hours to wait for local train. It is very important
you should come immediately."</p>

<p>Although it was singularly inconvenient for me to rush off in
such a hurry, I determined to go at once, and I got down to York
soon after one o'clock.</p>

<p>Flipper was on the look-out for me. Of course, I did not know
Flipper then, but he spotted me, and said his master had sent him
to drive me back. I at once "cottoned" to the young fellow, as the
saying is. He was a bright, smart, intelligent youth, reeking of
the country, and yet far above the level of the average
bumpkin.</p>

<p>Going out of the station I found a well-appointed trap in charge
of a man-servant, and a powerful horse in the shafts. As soon as
Flipper&mdash;he informed me that his name was William Paget, but
that he was always called Flipper&mdash;as soon as he and I had
mounted and tucked the rugs around us, the horse set off at a fine
pace. The snow was lying deeply on the ground everywhere, and the
trees were laden, while some of the hedgerows were almost hidden
out of sight. London, when I left it, was wallowing, so to speak,
in mire and sloppiness, with an atmosphere like a saturated sponge;
but down in Yorkshire there was a hard frost, and a crispness of
air that was delightful; while occasionally fitful gleams of
sunshine lit up the snow-covered landscape.</p>

<p>As we drove along Flipper told me the story of the night journey
during the snowstorm, of himself and Hargood, with all the
incidents appertaining thereto, in almost the same terms as I have
detailed it to the reader.</p>

<p>On the first blush it seemed to me that it was nothing more
serious than a robbery by footpads from two unsuspecting travellers
crossing a wild moor on a stormy night when everything was
favourable to such an outrage; and I wondered why I had been sent
for. But very little reflection caused me to change my views, for
the request for me to go down had come from Mr. Millwater, who
described himself as "banker," and I thought that he would never
have requested me in such an urgent manner to go all the way from
London merely to investigate an ordinary case of highway robbery
which the county constabulary ought to have been quite competent to
deal with.</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Hargood robbed of much money?" I asked Flipper.</p>

<p>"Noa, zur, I don't think they took much money from him," was the
answer, and that served to convince me that there was a good deal
more in the affair than appeared on the surface.</p>

<p>When we reached Deenes Dip, on Dead Man's Moor, Flipper told me
that was the spot where the robbery took place, so I alighted and
examined the place carefully, and I asked him what had become of
the sack which had been thrown over his head and the cord that had
been used to bind his arms. Strangely enough, he had forgotten all
about them when he had freed himself, and had not thought of taking
them, for, as he said, he was pretty excited at the time. So I at
once commenced a search, and after a time I found the bag under the
snow, and the cord was not far off. The sack was an ordinary corn
sack, and was marked "Taylor &amp; Sons, corn merchants, Woldholm."
The rope seemed to be a few yards of clothes line.</p>

<p>Thinking that something else of value from a professional point
of view might be lying in the snow, we made our search as
exhaustive as possible with the result that we found some money and
a silver pencil case. The money consisted of various coins,
including a sovereign, a half-sovereign, several shillings, and two
or three half-crowns. The coins had no doubt been inadvertently
dropped by the thief. As we failed to bring anything else to light,
we proceeded on our journey, and after a very cold drive reached
Woldholm, which looked singularly picturesque with its covering of
snow, and the fading light of the winter afternoon, bringing out
with sharp distinctiveness all the salient angles, and particularly
the old square-towered Norman Church, which was perched on a hill
just at the back of the little town. Woldholm was an irregular,
straggling place, built on a slope, and this heightened the
picturesque elements. Flipper had received instructions to take me
at once to the banker's house, which was known as Brookside. It was
a large, old-fashioned Elizabethan mansion standing in extensive
grounds, and being on an eminence, it commanded a very fine view of
the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Millwater received me in his library&mdash;a handsomely
furnished apartment. It was called "The Library" more by courtesy I
imagined, for there were relatively few books, and what few there
were were carefully shut up in glass cases. Some valuable little
pictures, however, a few bronzes, and two or three exquisite Parian
statuettes seemed to indicate that the owner of the house had art
tastes, if not literary ones.</p>

<p>Mr. Millwater was a well-preserved man of about sixty, affable
and gracious, and yet with a certain patronising air and a pompous
bearing that to me were objectionable. But I made allowance for him
inasmuch as he was, no doubt, the leading local magnate, and men
who pass their lives in the narrowed sphere of a country town and
are in the habit of being treated with deference and looked up to
by the rural population are very apt to develop somewhat
exaggerated notions of their own importance, which, if not
annoying, are certainly amusing to the dweller in a great city,
where a person must be somebody indeed to shine above his fellows.
However, Mr. Millwater was a big man in his little way, no doubt,
and though for a short time he rather gave me the impression that
he was an upstart that wore off as the conversation proceeded.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you have come, Mr. Donovan," he said with gruff
heartiness, as he shook my hand as if I were an old friend.</p>

<p>"I have come at great inconvenience, sir," I answered, "and I
venture to suppose you would not have sent for me if this affair
had been merely a common highway robbery."</p>

<p>"Your supposition is correct," he replied. "It is a good deal
more than that, and I am disposed to think that investigation may
bring some rather startling facts to light. I knew it was no use
trusting to the local constabulary here. They are as pigheaded and
as self-opinionated as they can be. They are quite behind the
times, for, you see, up to a recent period we were in a sense
isolated from the rest of the world. Our letters were brought from
York by mail coach, and it was only on the weekly market day that
the place woke up; the rest of the time it slept. However, in the
course of time the local railway will alter all that, and we shall
become quite important. But at present these yokels have not caught
the fever of excitement. They do not know what it is to hurry. They
have never been used to hurrying. If they were in the village
alehouse, and were told that a fire had broken out, and their
services were required, very likely they would answer: 'We be
coomin' when we'en supped oor beer and smoked oor piäpes. T' foire
must wayät till we un ready.'"</p>

<p>There was something so comical in the idea of a fire having to
wait until the bumpkins had finished their 'bacca and beer that I
laughed heartily. And yet it seemed to me as if it fairly
represented the bucolic mind of that part of the country.</p>

<p>"Pardon my rigmarole," Mr. Millwater continued, "but I thought
it was as well to give you some idea of the class of people the
yokels of Woldholm are. Well, now to business. I told my lad
Paget&mdash;or Flipper, as we generally call him&mdash;who met you
at the station, to give you the particulars of a robbery that was
committed three nights ago at Deenes Dip, on the part of the wolds
called Dead Man's Moor. I suppose he did so?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"And he would stop at the spot where the robbery took
place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I made a search there."</p>

<p>"With what result?" Mr. Millwater asked with peculiar
anxiousness, and before I could answer he added: "you didn't find a
pocket-book, did you?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "but I found some money; also an old corn
sack, and a few yards of clothesline."</p>

<p>"Those things may be of use," said Mr. Millwater quickly. "The
local police would hardly know what use to make of them; but no
doubt they will prove valuable to you."</p>

<p>"I note that on the sack," I answered, "is stamped the name of
Taylor &amp; Sons, corn merchants, Woldholm."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," exclaimed the banker. "Why, Taylor &amp;
Sons are the largest corn merchants in this part of the country.
Now, how on earth did one of their sacks come into the hands of the
thieves?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," I answered. "Very likely the sack may
prove a valuable clue."</p>

<p>"Ah, very likely, very likely. But now to give you some further
particulars. My clerk was not waylaid on that terrible night for
the sake of the money he carried, for ordinary footpads would not
have exposed themselves to the risks and discomforts bound to be
encountered in such a wild place on such a stormy night on the mere
chance of getting a trifle of money. The thieves knew by some means
or other that the clerk was about to journey over the moors.
Because now, except on market nights, the moorland road is never
traversed at night time, more particularly in the winter. Only
stress of circumstances would induce anyone to set out on that wild
journey on a winter night, and during a snowstorm."</p>

<p>"Then, I suppose it was stress of circumstances in the case of
your clerk?" I remarked, as the banker paused.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed it was. He was bound on a most important mission,
which permitted of no delay, and as there was no other way of his
reaching London the following morning except by driving from here
to York, the lad at my request courageously undertook the journey,
but neither he nor I dreamed for a moment he would fall a victim to
a vile conspiracy. And there is no doubt it was a conspiracy, for
what the thieves wanted to get hold of was his pocket-book."</p>

<p>"Then the pocket-book, I presume, contained documents of value,"
I remarked as Mr. Mill water paused.</p>

<p>"It contained a document of value," he answered. "I must inform
you that one of my most esteemed clients is a Mr. Philip Gregson,
who is the owner of and lives at Ashley Hall, a fine old country
mansion about twelve miles from here. Mr. Gregson is a local
magnate as well as the lord of the manor, and he is also one of the
Justices of the Peace for the county. For several years Mr.
Gregson, who is a widower, has crossed over to Paris about this
time to see his only daughter, who is studying painting there, and
having spent a day or two in Paris they journey on to Rome for
Christmas, as they have some relatives living in Rome. You will
presently see the necessity for my giving you these particulars. A
few days ago, an order written on a sheet of notepaper, bearing Mr.
Gregson's crest and motto, and dated from Ashley Hall, was
presented at my bank. The order ran as follows, as near as I
remember:</p>

<p>"'Pay to bearer the sum of one thousand pounds, and charge to my
account. I have unfortunately mislaid my cheque-book for the
moment, and want the money immediately, as I start to-night for the
Continent as usual.'</p>

<p>"Here followed Mr. Gregson's signature, and though Mr. Gregson
had never been known to draw out a cheque in such a way before, the
money was paid, as there was no reason to suppose the document was
not genuine. The cheque was presented at our very busiest hour, on
our weekly market day, a day on which there is a great deal of
excitement in the town, and the bank is generally pretty crowded
for some hours. In the ordinary way the cheque would have been
passed; Mr. Gregson's account would have been debited with the
thousand pounds; and we should not have known that all was not
right until the end of the year when the client's passbook was made
up. But a couple of days after it chanced that the cheque fell
under my notice, and, as I was very familiar with Mr. Gregson's
handwriting, I was struck by certain discrepancies in the
signature, and I also thought it strange that he should have sent
for so large a sum in such an unusual way, for he is one of the
most methodical of men, and exceedingly precise and business-like
in all his habits. This led me to make inquiries, and I sent for my
head cashier, Mr. Walter Freeland, who, it appeared, had paid the
money.</p>

<p>"Of course, up to that moment he had had no suspicion about the
genuineness of the document, and he was, as you may suppose, very
much alarmed when I expressed my views. We compared Mr. Gregson's
signature on the cheque with his signature in our books, and also
with other writing of his in our possession, the result being that
we both came to the conclusion the document was a forgery. Freeland
was in a terrible state of mind when it dawned upon him that he had
allowed himself to be victimised, for he is as a rule very careful
and most trustworthy. He said that at the time the cheque was
presented for payment the bank was crowded with the country people
drawing out and paying in money. It was the very busiest of the few
busy hours of the week. It is only on this weekly market day that
we rise to any excitement in the town, and for those few hours the
staff of the bank is taxed to its utmost. But very rarely, indeed,
is there any error to chronicle.</p>

<p>"On this occasion, however, it was clear that an audacious
forgery had been committed, and the bank would be the loser of a
large sum of money. Of course, I questioned Freeland about the
person who presented the cheque for payment, and he says that he
took him to be one of Mr. Gregson's servants. He is described as a
person of about forty, with a clean shaved face and having the
appearance of a farm hand.</p>

<p>"As soon as the forgery was discovered I sent off a special
messenger to Ashley Hall, and it was then ascertained that Mr.
Gregson was in Paris, and had left on the day the cheque was paid,
and he was to leave Paris the following afternoon for Rome. It was,
therefore, too late to communicate with him by letter. That is,
there would have been considerable delay, while to have telegraphed
would have been unsatisfactory I, therefore, after consultation
with Mr. Freeland, decided to despatch a young fellow named George
Hargood to Paris that very night, entrusting him with the forged
document for Mr. Gregson's inspection. In order that he might catch
Gregson in Paris before he left for Rome, it was necessary for
Hargood to drive to York to get the up mail train. The result was,
he was attacked at Deenes Dip, and robbed of his money and
pocket-book containing the forged document. The loss of that is a
very serious matter, as you will see, because we are now without
proof of the forgery. As soon as I heard of the robbery I posted a
letter to Mr. Gregson at his address in Rome explaining the matter
in detail to him, and asking him to telegraph his reply. That reply
was as I expected it would be. He said that the cheque was a
forgery. The delay, of course, has given the thief or thieves ample
time to get clear off, and the possibilities are we shall not be
able now to trace them."</p>

<p>"There I differ from you," I remarked. "The rascals, whoever
they may be, are local people."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Mr. Millwater. "It occurred to me they
were probably London sharpers who had made it their business to
learn something about Gregson."</p>

<p>I felt sure that in this particular Mr. Millwater was wrong, and
that the whole affair was of local origin. I pointed out to him
that the thieves who had waylaid young Hargood on Dead Man's Moor
had probably been employed by the forger in order that he might
repossess himself of the forged document. This argued, of course,
that he must have been previously informed of Hargood's intention
to cross the Moor.</p>

<p>"But do you think the robbery on the Moor was a planned thing?"
asked the banker.</p>

<p>"From what you tell me I should say that it undoubtedly was. The
fellows ascertained by some means that Hargood was going to York,
and they waited for him at the Dip, and though they stole his
money, the forged cheque was what they aimed at. The sack and the
cord had been provided to keep Flipper quiet, and the whole affair
was planned with a regard for thoroughness of detail which points
to a conspiracy and somebody who knows Gregson, and knows your
business, it at the bottom of this."</p>

<p>Mr. Millwater looked very serious, and admitted that on the face
of it it seemed to be as I surmised, and he showed that he was
disposed to think young Hargood might have had something to do with
the affair as one of the principals, although he posed as the
victim. But I told the banker that nothing I could see could
justify that suspicion, though I had little doubt when
investigation came to be made it would be found that the evil-doers
were connected with the town.</p>

<p>I found on further inquiry that the money had been paid in notes
and gold, and that the man who received it put it into a leather
bag with which he had come provided.</p>

<p>Of course I lost no time in seeking an interview with Mr.
Freeland. He was a young man of about thirty rather an exquisite in
his way; evidently proud of his full-flowing moustache, his good
looks, and his clothes. He had been with Mr. Millwater for a
considerable time, and great confidence was reposed in him. He was
a single man, and his people lived in York, he himself being a
native of that city. Young Hargood had been born in Woldholm, and
was a highly respectable youth. He had been educated in the village
school, and Mr. Millwater had taken great interest in him, as he
was the only son of his widowed mother, who had been greatly
reduced in circumstances through a series of misfortunes.</p>

<p>Now it was very certain that the forger was well acquainted with
the fact that Mr. Gregson kept a large account at Millwater's bank;
he also knew that Gregson was going on the Continent, and he took
advantage of that and of the busy market day to draw the money It
seemed probable, therefore, that the criminal, if not actually a
member of the Gregson household, was indirectly connected with it.
That household consisted of a lady housekeeper, a Mrs. Parton, who
had been in Mr. Gregson's service for about five years. Then there
were the usual servants, including a steward, a butler, and a
valet. But the valet had gone abroad with his master. The steward
was a Mr. Henry Braceridge, a local man born and bred, and had been
with Gregson for nearly twenty years. I saw no reason to suspect
him of any complicity in the affair. It was clear that several
people had been mixed up in the crime, and that the presenter of
the forged cheque must have had a confederate in the bank itself;
that confederate had warned him of young Hargood's journey, and
that he was carrying the forged cheque with him. If that document
could be secured all evidence of the forgery would be destroyed,
and the difficulties of proof would be increased manifold.</p>

<p>Without breathing to living soul that I suspected anyone in the
bank, I proceeded to overhaul the employees, so to speak; and I
endeavoured to learn just so much of each man as would enable me to
form some opinion as to the likelihood of his lending himself to so
serious a crime. When my investigations were so far completed, I
came to the conclusion that the one person whose conduct justified
suspicion was Walter Freeland. This young man enjoyed the full
confidence of his employer, and was in the habit of frequently
visiting at the banker's house. At one time there had even been
some lovemaking between Mr. Freeland and Miss Lucille Millwater, a
charming young lady, her father's second daughter. Mr. Millwater,
however, did not approve of the affair, and gave Freeland
distinctly to understand that if he wished to retain his confidence
and friendship, he must cease his attentions, and that was done.
Since then Freeland had become engaged to a lady residing in York,
and he was in the habit of going to York every Saturday afternoon,
and remaining there till Monday morning.</p>

<p>It may be asked why I came to suspect Freeland, and though it
has been said that one should never give reasons for one's
opinions, I will do so in this case. Firstly, he better than anyone
else knew how Gregson's account stood at the bank. Secondly, he
himself paid the money, and though he of all men ought to have been
cautious; and as it was so unusual for the customer to send for
money in such a way, he ought to have taken particular note of the
person who came to draw the money, and have even questioned him.
But he did neither, and professed to be quite unable to give more
than a general description of him. This seemed to me so
irreconcilable with straight-forward business-like, not to say
honest conduct, that I suspected Freeland of not being as honest as
he wished to appear. Then, again, he alone knew besides Mr.
Millwater that young Hargood was going to drive to York, and was
carrying the forged document with him. These then are the grounds
upon which I worked, and I set to work to make myself better
acquainted with Mr. Freeland, who as I learnt was deep in his
master's confidence. Indeed, Mr. Millwater regarded him as
exceptionally clever, and exceptionally trustworthy.</p>

<p>I found that Mr. Freeland occupied apartments in the house of a
highly-respectable widow lady, who had two sons both in business in
the town, and they both resided with her. In this family Freeland
was regarded with great favour, and they thought it was rather an
honour to have a gentleman occupying a responsible position in the
bank lodging with them. Just about the time that the forged cheque
was presented for payment a young man, whom Freeland described as
his brother "Bob," came suddenly to stay with him. Previous to his
arrival no mention had been made that he was coming. The day after
the robbery he suddenly disappeared. That is, Freeland did not tell
his landlady that his brother was going away. But the same evening
at tea-time, said:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, my brother Bob is not coming back again." At
this the landlady expressed some surprise, whereupon Freeland
added: "The fact is, Bob is rather a wild boy, and he has some girl
in London breaking her heart about him, so he's gone off to her.
He's a most erratic fellow."</p>

<p>This incident of "Bob's" arrival and departure strengthened my
suspicions, but, still, up to this point they were only suspicions,
and I had not a scrap of proof. That is, such proof as the law
would have required to substantiate a charge.</p>

<p>My next move was to wait upon Taylor &amp; Sons, the corn
merchants, and make inquiries whether they had any means of tracing
a missing sack. They told me it was a difficult thing to do as a
large number of the sacks were out in different parts of the
country.</p>

<p>And although it was customary for people who dealt with them to
return the empties when they were supplied with full ones,
otherwise to pay for them, it was not always done, and every year a
considerable number of sacks remained unaccounted for. I noted that
the sack I had found at Beetles Dip was almost new, and I called
Taylor &amp; Sons' attention to this, requesting them, if possible,
to inform me who was likely to have been supplied with a new sack.
After consulting their books they came to the conclusion that the
sack found at Deenes Dip was one of a dozen full sacks of corn
which had been supplied to a Mr. Jackson, a carrier, who lived at a
place called Briglea, some ten miles or so from Woldholm. Jackson,
who was a regular customer of Taylor &amp; Sons, and kept a number
of horses, had sent an order about three weeks before, and the
order had been duly executed. And as a number of new sacks had
recently been taken out of the storeroom of Taylor &amp; Sons, it
was likely some of them were sent to Jackson. To Mr. Jackson I next
went.</p>

<p>Briglea was a quaint little town, untouched at that time by
rail, and Jackson was a splendid specimen of a tough old yeoman. He
had been the local carrier for thirty odd years, and also farmed a
considerable quantity of land, but did not grow corn for his own
use. Investigation proved that one of the sacks sent with the last
order from Taylor &amp; Sons was missing, and Mr. Jackson could not
account for its loss. He employed a considerable number of hands.
In his carrying business alone he generally kept about twenty men
and boys at work, and he had about a dozen more on the farm. Some
of the men had been with him for a long time, but others again were
fresh hands; in fact, he was constantly changing some of them,
either because they were discontented, they were incompetent,
untrustworthy, or for other reasons. He remembered that he had
discharged a man about a month before this for drunkenness, and he
had also reason to believe the fellow had been guilty of some petty
thefts, although owing to the difficulty in the way of proving them
against him Mr. Jackson took no further steps beyond discharging
him, and refusing to give him a character. The man was known as Jim
Truscott, and he lived at a place called Brook Bottom, half-way
between Briglea and Woldholm.</p>

<p>The foregoing information was elicited in reply to a series of
questions I put to Mr. Jackson, and he deemed it not at all
unlikely that Jim Truscott might have stolen some corn and carried
it off in the sack; but, of course, Jackson hazarded no opinion as
to how the sack came to be found at Deenes Dip. I began to think
now, however, that I had struck a trail, even if I had not got a
positive clue.</p>

<p>Brook Bottom was one of those truly rural spots which as yet
have been able to preserve their far away time air, and where
modern life seems out of place. There were about a couple of dozen
houses in all, and the people were all engaged as agricultural
labourers, excepting the keeper of the village inn, and the village
huckster's shop, and the Squire was still looked up to as a great
personage, the squire in this case being Mr. Gregson of Ashley
Hall. Jim Truscott, so I learned, had been in the local militia,
but was regarded as a man of somewhat vicious habits, and inclined
to give way to drink. He had also for a time been in the service of
Mr. Gregson as an under gamekeeper, but had been discharged because
he quarrelled with his fellow servants. At this time, when my
interest had become aroused in him, I found he was absent from his
native place, and had been absent for over a fortnight. It was
believed he was in the city of York looking for work, and I
gathered that he might be found or heard of at "Lorimer's
Lodging-house" in York. Need I say that my inquiries were made in
such a way that they were not calculated to arouse the suspicions
of the bucolic minds.</p>

<p>On reaching York, where I proceeded without loss of time, I
found that Lorimer's Lodging-house was a place with a reputation of
a kind. It had been in existence for about half a century, and its
patrons belonged chiefly to the vagrant class, who for a few pence
could get a night's shelter and a breakfast. Jim had been there,
but had gone off to London "on th' spree" with his "pal," Jack
Frimble, and he had expressed his intention of "'listing" when his
"brass" was all spent. Such was the gossip retailed to me by
certain beery yokels, who seemed to regard Jim somewhat in the
light of a hero. One of these gentlemen in a moment of confidence,
the result of a tankard of ale I had treated him to, told me that
"Jim's got 'old o' a bit o' brass, and I shouldn't be s'prised if
he ain't got no proper right to it; but that there's naught to do
wi' me or wi' yow, measter, be it?"</p>

<p>I did not quite agree with my friend as to its being no concern
of mine, though I refrained from telling him so.</p>

<p>It seemed to me now clear that I was on the right trail, and I
decided not to abandon it until I had ascertained where Jim put in
his time on the night of the robbery at Deenes Dip. His "pal" Jack
Frimble was a new actor on the scene, and the most I could gather
about him was he had been on the tramp for some time, and was known
to have been down at Woldholm. To follow these two worthies to
London seemed somewhat in the nature of a wild goose chase on the
first blush, as I could get no information what part of the huge
Babylon they were likely to be found in. They had never been to
London before, and their going there was an event that had set
their chums all agog, for London was a dream to most of these
people, a dream of wonder and mystery, and when one of their kind
talked of going there he was regarded with as much interest, as a
man was in Queen Elizabeth's day when he expressed his intention of
voyaging to the New World. It appeared there had been quite a
little scene when the two adventurous travellers left for the great
city. A number of their associates had accompanied them to the
station, and Jim, with lavish liberality, had stood two shillings'
worth of beer.</p>

<p>In following them to London I felt that my main chance of
finding them lay in the probability that they had enlisted, as they
said they would. If they had been enjoying themselves in their
festive way with ill-gotten gains, it was exceedingly likely that
when they had exhausted their stock&mdash;and with such fellows it
is lightly come, lightly go&mdash;that they would offer themselves
to some recruiting sergeant, thinking probably that they would then
be safe from any pursuit if they had done wrong.</p>

<p>Before I left York I wrote a note to Mr. Millwater telling him
that I thought I had got a clue, but that I deemed it of great
importance he should not mention the matter to a living soul until
he saw me again, when I might possibly be in a position to name the
person who had forged Mr. Gregson's name, and thus succeeded in
obtaining a thousand pounds. I spoke confidently, for I felt
justified in doing so, inasmuch as I was instinctively certain Jim
Truscott was in a position to afford valuable information about the
robbery at Deenes Dip, if not about the forged cheque. Of course
this fellow was only a tool in the hands of a cleverer and more
designing villain, and as two men had been engaged in carrying out
the robbery, was it not likely that his "pal", Jack Frimble, had
been his assistant? Men of their stamp represented an exceedingly
commonplace type of humanity, incapable of any original ideas. They
follow in a beaten track, and anyone who has made their habits and
ways a study knows pretty well how to track them to their dens. No
one could doubt for a moment that Jim and his companion had
suddenly acquired wealth&mdash;that is, wealth to them. The
improvident nature of such creatures leads them to look upon "a
burst," in other words "a spree," as the height of human enjoyment.
They think nothing of the after consequences. They aim at a few
short-lived hours of delirium, when for the time their sordid lives
undergo a change. This is a pitiable phase of human nature, but
alas it is a very common one. Jim and his companion would soon
exhaust their money in a day or two's wild revelry, and then
finding themselves stranded in the wilderness of London what would
they be likely to do? If they had belonged to the class of habitual
criminals they would no doubt have consorted with their kind and
have sought to replenish their exhausted exchequer by some other
unholy deed. But they were fledglings, and the odds were in favour
of their carrying out their avowed intention of "'listing;" for to
such men the army is a refuge from immediate want and
difficulty.</p>

<p>Acting on the theory I have set forth I proceeded at once, on my
arrival in London, to make inquiries at the various recruiting
depots, with the result that in a very short time I had run my men
down. They had both taken the "Queen's shilling" in Westminster,
two days previously, and were only then recovering from the effects
of their dissipation. I had no difficulty in obtaining an interview
with them. They were both of them fine specimens of the yokel, full
of muscle and stamina, and all the raw material of fighting
machines. There was nothing of the stamp of the gaol bird or
habitual criminal about them. They appeared to be a good deal more
fools than knaves.</p>

<p>They were both very reluctant to talk about their escapade. To
use a vulgar phrase they were "suffering a recovery," and were
melancholy and miserable. When I proceeded to question them as to
their movements about the time of the robbery they got confused,
and contradicted themselves over and over again. First they vowed
they were in York. Then forgetting that they had said so, they
declared they were in Woldholm; and thus having woven the meshes
about themselves I suddenly sprung a mine by exclaiming: "I am
going to arrest you, and charge you with having committed a highway
robbery at a place called Deenes Dip, on Dead Man's Moor, in
Yorkshire. And unless you can furnish undeniable evidence as to
what you were doing at the time it will go mighty hard with
you."</p>

<p>This told upon Jim to such an extent that he began to blubber.
His companion seemed to be more stolid and phlegmatic, and he
expressed his opinion that Jim was a fool. But the soft spot in
Jim's nature had been touched, and he blurted out:</p>

<p>"Me and my pal did it, because Master Freeland's brother axed us
to do it." He then volunteered a full statement, which was, that
Howel Freeland, the brother of Walter, whom they both knew, had
promised them five pounds each if they waylaid Hargood and Flipper
at Deenes Dip, and secured a pocketbook which Hargood was known to
have with him. They both consented. Jim procured the sack from his
home, where he had taken it from Mr. Jackson's premises with some
corn in it, he having stolen the corn for his hens. Accompanied by
Howel Freeland they set off for the Dip, only a short time before
Hargood started. At the Dip Freeland waited until the crime had
been committed. Then he received the pocket-book, and all three set
off for York. This confession made my course clear. I applied for a
warrant for their arrest, and the military authorities had to give
them up. After a preliminary magisterial examination in London they
were removed to York in custody, the crime having been committed in
that country.</p>

<p>As soon as I could I hurried off to Woldholm and had an
interview with Mr. Millwater. As may be supposed, he was greatly
shocked when he learnt that his trusted clerk Freeland had betrayed
his confidence, for of course there could not be the slightest
doubt that Walter Freeland had been in league with his brother. His
arrest, which followed, stunned him, and at first he emphatically
protested his innocence. Howel Freeland had disappeared, and a
warrant was issued for his apprehension. He was a sailor by
profession, and had only recently returned home from a three years'
voyage, having sailed as third mate of a Liverpool ship which had
taken emigrants out and brought a cargo of cotton home from China.
The evidence that was gathered up left no doubt that he had been a
mere tool in his brother's hands, and though he had forged Mr.
Gregson's name&mdash;being able to imitate handwriting very
well&mdash;he had done so at his brother's instigation. Walter, it
appeared, had acquired a mania for speculation, in the hope that by
some stroke of good luck he might make money as he was going to be
married. But instead of making money he lost it, and got into such
serious difficulty that he was tempted into crime, and hap availed
himself of his brother being at home to use him as a confederate;
and it was the brother who actually presented the cheque at the
bank and received the money, which he conveyed to Walter's
lodgings. Then, when the forgery was discovered, this very foolish
young fellow thought to conceal one crime by committing another,
and in the two or three hours at his disposal before Hargood set
off on his eventful journey he planned the robbery with his
brother, who, at Walter's suggestion, secured the aid of Jim
Truscott, who in turn had no difficulty in persuading his "pal"
Frimble to join him.</p>

<p>It was a wretched story, and all the more pitiable since Walter
Freeland, who was on the highway to a good and honourable position,
had utterly blasted his career, broken the heart of his sweetheart,
and crushed and humiliated into the very dust his doting mother and
sisters. If young men who are tempted to go astray would only pause
to reflect on the awful suffering and misery they entail on those
who love them there would be less evil in the world. But men go
blindly into the path of wrong, and reck not of the consequences
until it is too late. Then comes the hell of remorse and shame.</p>

<p>It remains for me to say that Howel Freeland was never captured.
He managed somehow to get out of the country, which, he being a
sailor, was comparatively easy for him to do. At any rate he did
it, and was heard of no more. The other principals in the miserable
drama, after an exhaustive trial at the York Assizes, received
their due meed of punishment.</p>

7. THE STORY OF AN ANARCHIST PLOT<br>
AND HOW IT WAS FRUSTRATED</h2>

<p class="first">
AT a time when there is renewed activity on the part of the
cowardly ruffians who call themselves "anarchists," it is not out
of place to relate the story of an infernal plot that was hatched,
and happily frustrated before its objects could be carried out, and
I am pleased to say that nearly all the ignorant and worthless
vagabonds who were mixed up in it got their deserts. No, not quite.
It is true they were sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment,
but they ought all to have been hanged. Anyone guilty of preaching
the wicked and detestable doctrine of wholesale and indiscriminate
slaughter of innocent people, including women and children, is
unworthy of God's gift of life, and should be hurried out of the
world in which he is a mere excrescence. Time was when men had some
regard for the principles of chivalry; and while ready enough to
wage war against their fellow-men, and resort to all sorts of
devilish devices for torturing them, the line was drawn at men; and
women and children could pass on their way unmolested, and with a
consciousness that if danger threatened them an appeal to manhood
would bring them assistance. Surely since then man must have
degenerated? He has acquired more knowledge than his ancestors
possessed; he has penetrated into every hole and corner of the
world, and his inventive faculties have produced the most
astonishing results; but be has apparently become more cowardly,
more dastardly, more snake-like. If this is not so, how is it we
are every now and again startled by outrages which make one shudder
by reason of the fiendishness they display? I boldly declare that I
have always been an uncompromising opponent of the revolting
doctrine that society can be reorganised by dynamite and bombs. The
idea of secret assassination must ever be abhorent to all
right-thinking people; and when women and children are included in
the anarchist's propaganda of destruction, there are no terms in
any language too severe to use in speaking of the dastardly
wretches who spread it.</p>

<p>Men who preach this damnable doctrine of wholesale mutilation
and death are invariably lazy, and for the most part ignorant,
stupid louts, who, envious of the fruits of industry of those who
labour&mdash;as it was intended man should labour&mdash;will resort
to any deed of violence in order to possess themselves of that to
which they have no legal or moral claim. That is the fundamental
principle underlying all anarchism. By means of death, scattered
broadcast amongst high and low, rich and poor, women and children
alike, there shall be wholesale plunder, and an equal distribution
amongst the thieves, supposing it possible that thieves could be
honest one to another.</p>

<p>The leaders of this dreadful movement&mdash;which has been
termed "A development of our social and enlightened
progress"&mdash;are knaves for whom no punishment science could
devise would be too severe. For they live upon their stupid dupes;
they fill their purses and wax fat, without running the slightest
risk, for when blood has to be shed and wrong done, these cowardly
assassins take good care to keep out of harm's way. They place too
high a value on their wretched carcases to run any risk, and their
hideous work is done by the poor mad fools, who are told they are
aiding a great cause by pitching bombs into crowds of inoffensive
people. It is a startling commentary upon our "Free and enlightened
England," with her boasted "humane laws which so jealously guard
the sanctity of human life;" her loudly-trumpeted "respect for the
rights and opinions of all men," that we should leave our shores
free and afford shelter and protection to the human reptiles who
are driven from other countries. It is surely carrying "freedom" to
a verge of idiocy when we allow the most degraded specimens of the
human race to openly preach murder and theft in our midst, and to
plot and plan against the peace and security of neighbouring
States. That is freedom, with a vengeance.</p>

<p>But a few days ago from the time when I pen this paper an
ignoble wretch, who is allowed unmolested to issue every week a
journal devoted to so-called anarchism, and advocating the most
violent measures, openly stated at a public meeting in
London&mdash;the "city of the world;" the "hub of the
universe"&mdash;that he rejoiced at the Barcelona outrage. That is,
he entirely approved of a bomb being thrown from the gallery of a
theatre amongst a group of ladies and gentlemen, young and old, who
were seated in the stalls, and who in a few moments were rent,
maimed, and shattered; while into hundreds of hearts was carried
the ineffable sorrow for lost loved ones. Children were rendered
orphans, wives were deprived of their husbands, husbands of their
wives, sisters of brothers, brothers of sisters, parents of their
children, and the black shadow of sudden death was thrown over
scores of erstwhile happy homes. All this was done in the name of
"right," and in the heart of London an unmitigated scoundrel was
allowed on a Sabbath night to express his entire approval of the
hideous holocaust. No wonder that foreign nations are so embittered
against us. No wonder we are branded with the names of "Hypocrites,
maudlin sentimentalists, mock humanitarians." We deserve it all;
and the day is not far distant when, having sown the wind, we shall
reap the whirlwind. The sooner it comes the better, for then and
not till then shall we learn the important lesson that in order to
protect ourselves we must close our doors to the vile scum of other
nations, and exterminate that of home gathering. For it is a
mockery, an absolute mockery, of the sacred principles of freedom
and hospitality that we as a people who boast so loudly of our
Christianity should throw our doors open for the admission of
wretches so vile, so despicable, so devilishly cruel that other
Christian and enlightened nations will not tolerate them in their
midst; and from the safe shelter we afford these people they spread
their horrible opinions to the ends of the earth, and by these
opinions fools and madmen are influenced. It is a heavy charge to
have brought against us that we encourage murder and sedition, and
though it may make us blush and indignant when we hear it, it is
nevertheless true.</p>

<p>This may seem a somewhat long dissertation, but it is
exceedingly <i>apropos</i> to my subject; and no one who reads what
I have written, if he be not an Anarchist, will think the language
used a whit too strong.</p>

<p>It was just at the close of '73 that information was sent to the
head of the Detective Department in London and by that department
transmitted to all the centres throughout Great Britain, that a
most notorious Anarchist, whose real name was Scipione Rocca, was
believed to have recently arrived in England, where he would
project and endeavour to carry out outrages in different parts of
Europe. Here is the detailed description of him copied from the
official communication sent to England:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="typewriter">"Real name&mdash;Scipione Rocca.
<i>Aliases</i>&mdash;Marshal Valquerez, General Don Seco, Jean
Valois, Adrian Puthon, Philippe Dartagan, Count Hertz, Karl
Coester, James Rendle, Walter Smith, and others. Height&mdash;Five
feet six. Build&mdash;Massive, thick neck, large head.
Complexion&mdash;Dark, hair and eyes dark. Features&mdash;Regular,
and much like a woman's. Marks&mdash;Large scar on left side of
head under the hair, result of sword cut; hairy mole on right side
of cheek near the lobe of the ear. He is fairly well educated; has
travelled extensively; has a quiet, reserved manner, except when
excited; voice very feminine, low, and soft; he has scarcely any
hair on the face, and sometimes he shaves this little off and
disguises himself as a woman, a character he is able to assume so
effectually as to deceive his most intimate acquaintances. He has
lived in England for some time, and speaks the English language
fluently. His age is between thirty and thirty-five."</p>

<p><br>
Here followed most voluminous details of the man's career, in
which he was described as being imbued with the most violent
anarchist doctrines. He was known to be the instigator of many
anarchist outrages in different parts of Europe. He had murdered a
woman in Spain, for which he had been tried and condemned to
imprisonment for life. Six months later, however, he effected his
escape by stabbing to death, with a sharpened dinner knife, a
warder and a soldier who were on duty. He was believed to have made
his way into Germany after that, where he allied himself to a
secret society that had for its object the plundering of the rich
and the destruction of public buildings. He was believed to have
been implicated in the attempt made in Berlin to blow up the
emperor's palace with bags of gunpowder. He disappeared immediately
afterwards, and it was supposed he went to Paris. A year later he
was known to be living in that city with an actress of the
<i>Châtelet</i>. They occupied apartments in the Avenue des
Gobelins. At that time Rocca passed under the name of "Adrian
Puthon," and described himself as a teacher of music. One morning
his mistress was found to have been barbarously murdered during the
night. Puthon had disappeared, and every article of value the
unfortunate woman possessed, including a large sum of money, had
been carried off.</p>

<p>The rascal's movements could not be definitely traced after
that, but there was reason to think he went direct to Portugal. At
any rate some months later he was arrested in Lisbon for committing
a forgery on a Lisbon bank. The charge could not be substantiated
against him, but before he was acquitted Spain applied for his
extradition, and he was ultimately given up, but while being
conveyed across the frontier managed to effect his escape during a
heavy snowstorm. After that he lived in Lyons for some time under
the name of Philippe Dartagan, and there was little doubt he was
responsible for the murder of a police spy who had been deputed to
watch him.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, were a few of the charges formulated against
this wretch, and if only half of them were true he was a monster of
iniquity, against whose hideous life every man's hand should be
turned, and he should be hunted down as remorselessly as man-eating
tigers in India are hunted.</p>

<p>The information sent to us came from France, by which country
his extradition was demanded. I should add that it was not
definitely stated that he had come to England, it was merely
supposed he had. In face of the demand for his extradition the
authorities could not, of course, be indifferent. Otherwise our
magnificent ideas of hospitality and our bloated notions of
"freedom" would have enabled even a monster of that kind to move
about as he liked, and to plot and plan all sorts of crimes to be
committed in other countries. And this he could have done with
impunity, and he could have spouted sedition, talked destruction,
and howled forth slaughter until his lungs ached. No one would have
taken any notice of him, that is, nobody in authority, but the
idle, worthless loafers, who are found in every great city, would
have listened a-gape to him, and he would have made converts by the
score. But had he done anything against our own laws he would, of
course, have been arrested, he would have got some worthy lawyer,
who couldn't tell a lie, to descant upon his blameless life, and to
discredit all the witnesses that might have been produced against
him; with the result, that unless his offence had been a serious
one, he would have been acquitted, or, at the most, fined. However,
luckily, there was the demand for his extradition, and as France
never refused to give up our malefactors when they went there, the
authorities were bound to do something; and so I was commissioned
to try and find out where the wretch was hiding. I should mention
that it was further stated in the particulars sent from France that
he was an adept at assuming disguises; this and his self-command
had enabled him to elude justice; but when brought to bay there was
no crime too terrible for him to commit in order to effect his
escape, as had been proved in Spain and Portugal. It was clear
then, if all this was free from exaggeration, that we had to deal
with no ordinary criminal, and unless he gave himself away, his
capture would not be easily effected. It happened that at this
period London, in a way of speaking, was crowded with foreign
cut-throats, and rascals of all classes. The close of the
Franco-Prussian war had caused a perfect rush to our hospitable
shores of gentlemen and ladies who had distinguished themselves
during the Commune by horrible atrocities. And though these
distinguished French men and women would, under different
circumstances, have railed against <i>Perfide Albion</i>; they were
now glad enough to breathe her fog-laden atmosphere, and enjoy the
freedom she accords to all and sundry. But apart from these Gallic
murderers, thieves, fire-raisers, and petroleuses, we had a fine
collection of miscellaneous scoundrels from other countries.
America&mdash;another delightfully free country where anyone is at
liberty to plot and plan the destruction of any other country in
the world without being molested&mdash;had contributed a large
contingent of fenians and dynamitards. But as it was known that
these gentry had designs against the "brutal Saxons" some watch was
set upon them; for there were rumours that they intended to shatter
and destroy in every town throughout Great Britain, while certain
prominent public personages were to be "removed." History testifies
that to a very limited extent these threats were realised; and that
in the struggle the gentle fenian and the warm-hearted dynamitard
came off second best. We hanged a few in spite of the maudlin
sympathy that was expressed for them by certain free-born Britons;
and a few others were sent to recruit their health, and to work out
the problem whether after all honesty is not the best policy, in
Her Majesty's criminal jails. Some of them, poor things, suffered
in health; prison fare and discipline did not agree with their
pampered constitutions; and so from time to time maudlin sympathy
has been allowed to prevail, and these blood-thirsty human rats
have been turned loose again.</p>

<p>We certainly <i>are</i> a remarkable people; at least some of us
are!</p>

<p>As I had no particular interest at that time in any
distinguished foreigner who was breathing our free but fog-filled
air, save Signor Scipione Rocca, I turned my special attention to
trying to find out what particular part of the country he was
honouring with his presence. Theorizing from what I had heard of
the man's habits I did not think it probable he would care to
rusticate in the provinces. A fellow of that kind didn't usually
play second fiddle. The <i>rôle</i> of the Provincial was not in
his line. He was a star, he was, of the first magnitude, and he
couldn't lower his dignity by twinkling in some provincial town. He
preferred to blaze effulgently in the Capital. All this, of course,
was only an idea of mine, but it was founded on a very fair
knowledge of the psychological idiosyncrasies of the criminal mind.
Anyway I felt that if I was wrong, it was highly probable I might
pick up his trail in London and follow it up until I came to his
lair in whatever part of the land it might be.</p>

<p>As I have often stated in my sketches, there is a
well-established and peculiar freemasonry, as well as a magnetic
sympathy current amongst criminal classes, and the detective who
overlooks this is not likely to score many points. This freemasonry
and this magnetic sympathy keep them in touch with each other, and
by moving amongst their haunts one may learn a good deal. I
therefore decided to get an introduction, if possible, to Signor
Scipione Rocca through the medium of some of his sympathizers. It
must be remembered that we did not know at this time for certain if
he had really come to England. The French police only supposed he
had; but he seemed such a slippery eel, and capable of changing his
skin so often that it was by no means certain he had honoured our
shores with his presence. That, of course, had to be found out, and
I set to work to find it out.</p>

<p>As most people know who know London, Leicester Square and its
neighbourhood have long been the favourite haunt of the foreigner,
the Frenchman particularly. In this classic region there is
something congenial to his tastes. The consequence is it may be
described almost as French London. Here are found French
booksellers, cafés, restaurants, laundries, lodging-houses, French
shops where every delicacy in the shape of <i>charcuterie</i> is
sold. In the region of "Lee-ces-ter" Square you can procure
vermouth, absinthe, French papers, French cigars, and coffee <i>à
la Francaise</i>, that is, inferior coffee&mdash;one-third coffee
to two of the villainous stuff called chicory&mdash;exactly as it
is drunk all over France. They manage <i>some</i> things better in
France, but coffee is not one of them. However, this is a mere
detail.</p>

<p>At the time I am dealing with French London was unusually
crowded, owing to circumstances I have already referred to. The air
resounded with the French language, and French customs were
strongly <i>en evidence</i>, while occasionally as one passed a
café or restaurant there came forth an odoriferous puff of garlic.
In Rupert Street&mdash;a street that runs northward from the
Square&mdash;and not very far up, was a large corner
house&mdash;the property of a Frenchwoman, and let out in
apartments, which were entirely occupied by French people. The
lower part of the building was a shop, in which a French barber,
who also sold all kinds of French periodicals, plied his trade.
There was a private entrance to the building from a little side
street; and in a recess in the wall of the passage, which was
common to everyone occupying any part of the house, sat, during the
day, a decrepit and curious little old man. He was the French
<i>concierge</i> or doorkeeper. He was also a cobbler, and did all
the cobbling for the household. At night he slept in a foul den at
the bottom of the passage, and a string led from the head of his
bed to the latch of the door. By pulling the string he could lift
the latch and give admission to anyone who sought it by ringing the
bell which communicated with his den. On a bracket at a small
window let into the wall of his room, if it could be so called, a
lamp was always placed at night, and its light so shone that anyone
passing along the passage to the stairs or <i>vice versa</i> came
within the influence of the rays, and so could be recognised by the
old <i>concierge</i> if he was on the alert. All this, of course,
was very French, and no one could gain admission to the house by
the passage after eight o'clock in winter and nine in summer
without ringing the bell. During the day a lodger could get in with
his latchkey, but the cobbler was always in his box then.</p>

<p>The house, which was a large one, had been the town mansion last
century of a certain nobleman, when the Square was a fashionable
place of residence and a favourite resort of the gentry. The growth
of the great city, however, has changed all that, and the Square
has degenerated.</p>

<p>As I've said, the particular dwelling-place I am alluding to was
owned by a Frenchwoman, who possibly had left her country for her
country's good. At any rate she had found shelter in <i>Perfide
Albion</i>, and by some means or other only known to herself had
acquired sufficient money to purchase the property, and by letting
it out in apartments had made a good thing of her speculation. She
was known as Madame Blanc, and she occupied the garrets at the very
top of the house, together with a crippled daughter, who for years
had been unable to leave her bed, owing to some peculiar disease of
the spine.</p>

<p>It was rumoured that Madame Blanc hated the country of her
adoption and everything in it. To such an extreme was this
antipathy carried that she had never taken the trouble to learn the
language, except to a very limited extent. And when she did
condescend to use a few phrases they were so badly spoken that
English people would have been more likely to have understood her
native tongue better. For years this strange woman had lived there
anathematising our country, our climate, our food, our customs, our
institutions. She had lived in solitude nursing her invalid
daughter, looking after her lodgers with a particularly keen eye to
business, collecting her rents, and&mdash;doing heaven knows what
with the money. As she paid her rates and taxes very regularly, and
had committed&mdash;so far as was known&mdash;no offence against
the laws of the country in which she had chosen to make her home,
she was not interfered with and was free to do as she liked. How
pleasant it is, indeed, to live in a free and Christian land where
you can plot against every government under the sun, except the one
which affords you its protection! In spite, however, of Madame
Blanc being such a regular rate and tax payer, and never having
committed any overt act that could be technically construed as an
offence against the law, it was known that some of the lodgers she
admitted to her house had made themselves notorious and infamous.
However, the dear old lady could not be expected to inquire into
the character and pedigree of every one of her lodgers. She wanted
her rent, and she took good care to have it, and anyone failing to
stump up at the proper time was bundled out. She was precious sharp
about the rent, but as to what they did she didn't care a dump. It
was known, however, to myself and to other men who like myself were
interested in watching the movements of our foreign guests, that
Madame Blanc's house was the rendezvous for some very desperate
characters, and there were strong grounds for believing that
conspiracies had been hatched there. At this time one person who
lived under the roof was known to be one of the most violent of
revolutionists, and had made two attempts on the life of Napoleon
III. He was an old and frail man now, but he used to saunter out
regularly at meal times to get his food at a restaurant in the
neighbourhood, which was patronised entirely by foreigners. His
name was Chabot, and, having a universal reputation as a
revolutionist, and&mdash;apart from his pronounced
views&mdash;being a man of strong individuality, he was always a
centre of attraction, and was invariably sought after by those who
considered it advisable to leave their own country and come to ours
for change of air.</p>

<p>I have already given my reasons for believing that Scipione
Rocca was not likely to bury himself in the provinces. Now, if he
elected to patronise the Metropolis, it was certain he would
gravitate to French London. It was just as certain as that anything
thrown into a whirlpool will be sucked downwards, after having
gyrated for some time round and round. If he reached the Square, it
was no less certain that he would come in contact with Chabot;
therefore I resolved to keep an eye on Chabot. He was an
interesting and central figure in that little section of London,
for he was a picturesque man with long flowing white hair and white
beard; and though infirm and old, he walked with a certain
stateliness and grace that made him conspicuous, while his small,
piercing, dark eyes, which had lost little of their pristine
brightness, were as restless and watchful as those of a hunted
animal. Let it be understood that Chabot's walks never extended
beyond the restaurant he frequented. In this restaurant he spent
the greater part of the day, Sunday included. There he read the
foreign papers, and there he met his acquaintances, and received
those who came to pay him homage or discuss some weighty political
matters, in which&mdash;probably&mdash;bombs and dynamite were to
figure.</p>

<p>I was fully aware that I was not likely to learn very much by
merely shadowing Chabot from his residence to his restaurant and
from the restaurant back to his residence. Something more than that
was wanted, and if I visited the restaurant <i>in propria
persona</i>, suspicion would at once be aroused, for the visitors
there, having much to conceal, were exceedingly suspicious of all
strangers. I therefore hit upon another plan. Desperate diseases
require desperate remedies, and this was a case where the utmost
secrecy was imperative if anything was to be learnt. I was
fortunate in being able to speak the French language very fluently,
having partly been brought up in Trance. I was also dark of hair
and complexion, so, getting my hair cropped <i>à la Newgate</i>, a
fashion so dear to the heart of Frenchmen, I donned the attire
usually affected by the French <i>garçon</i> or waiter, and applied
to Monsieur Tierrot, the keeper of the restaurant in question, for
a situation as waiter. French waiters in French restaurants in
London are usually freshly imported, because the wages paid are
low, and as soon as ever they have learnt a little English they
betake themselves to the swell English restaurants, where so many
foreign waiters are employed, and where the rate of payment is much
better, and the hours not so long. To Monsieur Tierrot I
represented that I had just arrived from Bordeaux, and the end
justifying the means I resorted to a few other necessary little
fictions so that I might be able to carry out my plan.</p>

<p>Tierrot was a sharp, business-like fellow, and cross-examined me
with no small skill; but I was too much for him. It ended in his
telling me that he had a man he was very dissatisfied with, but he
couldn't discharge him under a week's notice. If I liked to wait
till then he would take me on for a short trial. If I suited I
might count on permanent employment. The wages were to be three and
sixpence a week&mdash;raised to five shillings after six months'
service&mdash;and food and lodging. On my complaining that the
salary was not princely he reminded me that I could count upon
getting a <i>pourboire</i>, or, as we call it, a "tip," from every
customer I waited upon. I told him that that being so, I would
accept his offer, and in due course I entered upon my duties.</p>

<p>For the first few days I confess to a. certain amount of
awkwardness, but I soon got over that, though I could not so easily
conquer an aversion to the food supplied and the sleeping
accommodation provided. However, my zeal carried me through, and I
soon became conscious that he who kept his eyes and ears open in
that restaurant might learn a good deal; particularly the opinions
these foreigners entertained for England and the English. But their
opinions at that time had no interest for me.</p>

<p>I found that Chabot always occupied the same seat at a table in
a corner at the far end of the room from the entrance door, and
near a fireplace. I was informed he had occupied the same seat for
years. By a little manoeuvring with another waiter I got Chabot's
table included in those I was to attend to. The first day I went to
him, he looked hard at me, with his keen beady eyes full of an
inquiring light.</p>

<p>"So you are a new-comer," he said in English.</p>

<p>I shook my head as a sign that I did not understand him,
whereupon he addressed me in French.</p>

<p>"You don't understand English? I am glad of it. I hate the
English tongue. Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Bordeaux, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Ah! Bordeaux! By no means a bad place. I know it well. One does
sometimes see the sun there. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Charles Ganz, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Umph, not a bad name. Ever been in England before?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Any acquaintances here?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Well, take my advice and be very cautious how you make any. You
seem intelligent," he added, still scrutinising me.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Monsieur," I returned, with a profound bow.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Charles Ganz, if you are going to wait on me
you must be smart, silent, and anticipatory. I hate to have to ask
for every little thing; nor do I like a waiter counting every
mouthful I put into my mouth. Do you understand, Charles?"</p>

<p>"I think I do, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Good. Now attend to me well, and you can count on having two
sous after every meal, and once a month I shall present you with a
shilling, providing I am entirely satisfied. If you don't get the
shilling you will know that I am displeased about something. Stay,
Charles; permit me to give you a word of advice as to what seems to
me to be the primary duty of a waiter. Keep your eyes and ears open
and your mouth shut."</p>

<p>I thanked him, bowed, and retired. He little dreamed how rigidly
his advice would be followed. But what he meant was something very
different to what I mean. He meant that a waiter should see at once
when his customer wanted bread, mustard, salt, and such-like
things; that he should be ever on the alert when called, but should
not attempt to enter into any conversation unless spoken to.</p>

<p>Chabot came to the restaurant with the precision and regularity
of mechanism. You could tell the time of day by his appearance.
Being winter time he wore a large coat, a muffler round his throat,
a large, broad-brimmed, soft felt hat, and white woollen gloves. He
drew off his gloves very deliberately, and after stretching the
fingers, handed them to me together with his hat, which I placed in
a rack. Next I helped him off with his coat and muffler, and hung
them up. That operation finished, he lowered himself with a sigh of
relief, and perused the <i>menu</i>, having first swallowed at a
draught a small tumblerful of the litre of red wine, which was
always on the table ready for him. He called that draught of wine
his "appetizer." For the first few days that I was there he came
alone. Then after that for a time he was occasionally accompanied
by a cut-throat-looking rascal&mdash;a man with iron-grey hair,
bleared-eyes, a sallow complexion, and a sullen, hang-dog
expression. Keeping my eyes and ears open, as Chabot advised me to
do, I soon became aware that the cut-throat-looking individual was
a most important personage. He was a foreigner, though at that time
I could not quite determine his nationality. He and Chabot
sometimes spoke in English, and sometimes in German, never in
French. I divined that the object of this was that I should not
understand. But as I understood my mother tongue a bit, could
converse in French, and get on fairly well in German, and being
neither deaf nor blind, I learnt something.</p>

<p>Of course I had to pick up my knowledge in a very disjointed
way. A phrase sometimes, a word now and again; but by studying
these and filling in the blanks from the context, I gathered that
the gentleman of the cut-throat appearance was a delegate from a
revolutionary society whose head-quarters were in Belgium, that he
had come over to England with letters of introduction to Chabot,
and that business of a serious character was on hand. The nature of
that business I was to learn later on; but up to that point I had
gathered enough to feel sure that a sanguinary drama was about to
be arranged, and one day I heard Chabot say reflectively in
response to some remark made by the other fellow:</p>

<p>"Rocca! Yes, Rocca's a good man. He's reliable, desperate,
fearless. I must put you in touch with him."</p>

<p>When I heard this I chuckled mentally, and some such thought as
this passed through my mind:</p>

<p>"Yes, we will both get in touch with him, and possibly something
will happen that is not in your programme, my brave gentlemen."</p>

<p>Up to this point my little plan had so far been successful, and
my shadowing Chabot was the means, of proving my surmise that he
would be in touch with Rocca, correct. He had given himself away,
all unconsciously, of course, and having got hold of the thread I
was not likely to let it go. In watching Chabot I had necessarily
to be particularly cautious, for he was as wary as an old fox that
has been several times hunted, and I knew that the watched one
watched me. If I seemed to linger longer at his table than was
consistent with my duty he would say:</p>

<p>"Charles, what are you hanging about here for? I hate a waiter
to be loafing about my table when he is not wanted."</p>

<p>I was aware also that he kept his eyes upon me, and my movements
did not escape his observation. If therefore I had done anything
calculated to arouse his suspicions my plan would of a certainty
have been frustrated, consequently I had always to be on my guard,
and, so to speak, keep an eye on myself. It was something, however,
to have learnt from his own lips that he knew of Rocca's
whereabouts, and so I lost no time in setting a colleague to shadow
the movements of the cut-throat-looking man from Belgium, and
report to me as early as possible. I speak of this fellow as being
of "cut-throat" appearance, and in doing so I am quite within the
bounds of strict truth. He was an evil-visaged man. The physical
configuration of his face was suggestive in itself of villainy, but
his fiery, restless, fierce-looking eyes seemed unmistakably to
proclaim him cruel, blood-thirsty, ferocious. On the other hand,
there was a sauvity in speech, and a polish in his manner and his
bearing generally that were calculated to mislead, because
unthinking people might have been disposed to say&mdash;"This poor
man's looks belie him. His face is his misfortune."</p>

<p>I was sure, however, that he was even more dangerous in actual
fact than he looked. His hands were plump, soft, and white,
indicating that he had done no hard manual labour; but his fingers
were disfigured by the nails being bitten down to the quick, and I
noted that his finger tips were seldom out of his mouth. He was for
ever biting and gnawing his nails. He dressed well, wore a diamond
pin, several rings, and a massive watch guard.</p>

<p>In a few days my colleague informed me that he had traced the
fellow to Lamb's Conduit Street, out of Oxford Street, where he had
apartments in the name of Eugene Marcet. He was living in the house
of a German called Falber, who kept a tailor's shop, and who was
well-known to the police as a man of violent socialistic views. He
had several times been fined for obstruction by collecting a crowd
together at some street corner and holding forth in inflammatory
language on the sins of monied classes, and advocating a sweeping
revolution in order to&mdash;as he termed it&mdash;"reorganise
society on an equitable basis." It was in the house of this man
that Marcet, if that was his name, had taken lodgings, and that in
itself was significant.</p>

<p>Having made this discovery, I felt that my mission as a waiter
had been fulfilled, for I did not anticipate that Rocca would come
to the restaurant. He would have been afraid to do that, and I had
no doubt that he was lying <i>perdu</i> somewhere. The irksomeness
and disagreeableness of my position may be imagined, and I was only
too glad to be clothed and in my right mind again. When I told
Tierrot that I wished to leave he was surprised, then angry. He
wanted to know what I was dissatisfied with. I told him I thought I
could better myself; but, anyway, as I was independent and my own
master, I intended to do as I liked.</p>

<p>To. Chabot I made known that I was going, and he expressed
regret.</p>

<p>"I am bound to say, Ganz," he remarked, "that, speaking for
myself, you are one of the best waiters I have ever known in some
respects. At any rate, you have been most attentive to me. You have
shown a disposition, perhaps, to linger too long when I have been
talking to my friends. But that no doubt is due to vulgar
curiosity. You will cure the fault in time if you are ambitious of
succeeding in your calling."</p>

<p>I bowed, smiled inwardly, and thanked Monsieur Chabot for his
good opinion of me.</p>

<p>Having got clear of the restaurant, I devoted my attention to
watching the house of Madame Blanc. I was sure that house had its
mysteries and secrets, and they would, in the interests of justice,
have to be brought to light. People were constantly going and
coming to the place. They were all foreigners, and amongst them was
Falber, the German tailor. I saw him go one evening by himself, and
he came away later on in company with the cut-throat-looking
gentleman from Belgium. I sent a minute description of this fellow
to the Belgium police, and asked if anything was known about him.
In reply they wrote to say that they believed he was a notorious
anarchist, by birth an Italian, who passed under various names, but
whose real name was Caccioli. He was the leader of a strong
revolutionary party which was being closely watched in Belgium.
With these particulars a photograph of Caccioli was enclosed, and
in that photograph "Eugene Marcet" was revealed. There was the same
fierce expression of the eyes; the same villainous-looking
face.</p>

<p>It was now pretty clear that some important business had brought
this rascal to London, and the fact that he wished to get in touch
with Rocca made it conclusive to my mind that some conspiracy was
hatching. One day there came to Madame Blanc's house two
women&mdash;a young one and an old one. They drove up in a
four-wheeled cab, the number of which I was enabled to note. One of
the women was old, and seemed to walk with difficulty, as if
suffering from illness. She wore a large bonnet and a veil, so that
her face could not be seen. Her companion was a young, good-looking
woman, probably under thirty. She was intensely dark, with hair and
eyes the colour of sloes. The face was unmistakably of a foreign
type. When they had passed into the house I went to the old
cobbler, who was in his den cobbling shoes. He was a strange,
bleary, foxy looking old man, with a voice like a rasp, that set
one's blood curdling. Speaking to this man in French, I asked him
if he could tell me if there was a room to let in the house. He
looked up, and fixed me with his watery eyes. I don't know that I
ever saw a human face that so closely resembled a monkey's. He
would have done for Darwin's missing link. Having taken stock of
me, he answered curtly:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Then he began to hammer and bang a piece of leather on his
lapstone. I waited for a few moments until he put the stone down
and busied himself with paring the leather with a small,
sharp-pointed knife.</p>

<p>"I was told," I said, "that I might get lodgings here."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" he asked sharply, as he condescended to look up
once more from his work.</p>

<p>"Well, I was told so."</p>

<p>"But <i>who</i> told you?" he demanded, with an emphasis and
peremptoriness that spoke of an energy that one would have thought
the withered old rascal was incapable of. He gibbered like a
monkey; he snarled like an angry cat; and he held his sharp-pointed
knife in a way that was suggestive of a readiness to prod me with
it if I irritated him.</p>

<p>"That's my business," I answered.</p>

<p>He grinned until his toothless gums were revealed. Then he put
his knife down; fumbled beneath his leather apron, produced a
common horn snuff box; and having helped himself to a pinch with
exasperating coolness, that was in marked contrast to his previous
fieriness, he replied&mdash;"Well, Monsieur, keep your business to
yourself, and let me go on with mine. You ask me if lodgings are to
be had in the house, and I tell you 'no.' That ends the matter,
doesn't it? Now go. I am busy, and can't waste any time with
idlers." I was amused with the old rascal. There was character in
him. And shrivelled and ugly as he was, he had his wits about him.
I therefore decided to try other tactics with the fellow, for
cupidity was unmistakably marked on his face.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "don't make yourself disagreeable, old man.
I simply asked you a question."</p>

<p>"And you got an answer," he snarled quickly.</p>

<p>"I did, but I don't know who you are, or what authority you have
to speak in the name of the proprietor of the house."</p>

<p>Once again he fixed me with his bleared eyes, and he took up his
knife and held it vertically, with the handle resting on his
knee.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what my authority is, Monsieur," he said. "I
have been the doorkeeper here for years, and I speak in the name of
the proprietor. Nobody comes here promiscuously. Anybody who wishes
for apartments has to come strongly recommended. You see, it's a
respectable house, and it wouldn't do to lower its respectability.
Now then, you've got your answer. Will you go?"</p>

<p>"You are certainly an excellent janitor," I remarked with a
laugh. "But now I will be candid with you, and if you will give me
the information I desire, this coin shall pass into your
possession." I balanced a sovereign on the tip of my finger as I
spoke, and a greedy look came into his eyes as he raised his head
and looked at the coin.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" he asked more suavely.</p>

<p>"Two ladies passed into the house just now."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"One a handsome young woman."</p>

<p>"Well?" with growing eagerness, his eyes still on the coin.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me who that young woman is? I wish to make her
acquaintance. I have seen her before, and I am dying to know
her."</p>

<p>He leered, and exposed his toothless stumps again as he replied,
with something like a sigh:</p>

<p>"I don't know who she is."</p>

<p>"Come, come," I remarked, for I saw his cupidity was fully
aroused, and that he could be corrupted with gold.</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't know," he growled. "I never saw her before
in my life."</p>

<p>"What has she come here for then?"</p>

<p>"To visit a Monsieur Chabot."</p>

<p>"Could you find out for me who she is?"</p>

<p>"I might." This cautiously.</p>

<p>"Will you do so?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if you double the amount."</p>

<p>I made a pretence of hesitating, but finally said:</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll give you two sovereigns if you will tell me
what her name is, and where she lives."</p>

<p>"I will do what I can," he answered. "Come tomorrow at this
time."</p>

<p>I was about to take my departure when a shadow fell upon the
doorway, and I beheld Eugene Marcet. I drew back, and made way for
him. He glared at me from under his shaggy eyebrows. Then turning
to the old <i>concierge</i>, he said in a low tone,</p>

<p>"Importance."</p>

<p>It was evidently a password. The cobbler answered him with a
look, and pulled a string which no doubt rang a bell upstairs,
although I did not hear it ring, and Marcet passed on and went up
the creaking stairs.</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow," said the cobbler to me in a tone that clearly
indicated he would hold no further conversation with me then.</p>

<p>"All right," I answered, and I took my departure. But I did not
go very far. I felt there was important business going on, and that
there was a good deal to learn. I waited for over two hours. Then
the <i>concierge</i> came out, and hobbled down the street,
returning in about ten minutes with a four-wheeled cab. A few
minutes later the two women reappeared, got into the cab, which
then drove off. I followed it into Leicester Square, where I picked
up a hansom, jumped in, and told the driver to keep the
four-wheeler in sight. The chase led me to Upper Street, Islington.
Near the Agricultural Hall the four-wheeler stopped. The two women
alighted, the young one paid the fare, the cab was dismissed, and
they directed their steps northward until they reached a short,
quiet, but somewhat squalid, street, where they stopped before a
house, and the young woman produced a key, opened the door, and the
two entered.</p>

<p>This was something gained. I mentioned that I took a note of the
number of the cab which brought them to Rupert Street. I found out
the driver of that cab, and ascertained from him that he had driven
the women from Upper Street, Islington. On the following day I
presented myself to the <i>concierge</i> again.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "have you discovered what I want to know."</p>

<p>"No," he answered surlily, "I have tried and failed." His manner
was sincere, and left me no room to doubt that he meant what he
said.</p>

<p>I expressed my regret, and asked him if he would be more
successful if I waited a day or two. But he assured me that he saw
no chance of learning anything about the women.</p>

<p>"They are friends of Monsieur Chabot," he said, "and Monsieur
Chabot keeps his business to himself."</p>

<p>"Who is Monsieur Chabot?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A highly respectable gentleman, who has lived here for a long
time. That is all I can tell you. Now, you can go; I do not intend
to answer any more questions."</p>

<p>He evidently meant what he said, so I departed, and I turned my
attention to the house at Islington. I found it had been rented for
a year in the name of a Mrs. Blanche Philips. The landlord was a
grocer in the neighbourhood. He said he was satisfied his tenant
was a respectable person. She had paid a half-year's rent in
advance. She had got some furniture on hire from a local tradesman,
for which she had paid a considerable sum down. The young woman was
her sister. The elder one was an invalid, and the business had been
transacted by the young one, who spoke English with a foreign
accent. All this was instructive and significant, and I set a watch
upon the house, with the result that we found parcels were
frequently delivered there, and other parcels as frequently taken
away. Mrs. Blanche Philips also had a large correspondence, and a
great many people went to the house; but it was noted that they
always went after dark. One evening a cab drove up to the end of
the street, and from it alighted old Chabot and Marcet. They did
not go straight to Mrs. Philips' house, but walked past it, and
glanced up and down the street as if to make sure they were not
being watched. Their precaution, however, did not avail them.
Almost immediately opposite Mrs. Philips' residence was a coal
yard, that was reached by a gateway. Over the gateway was a
joiner's shop. That shop was rented by an intelligent young fellow
named Jackson, who, by his industry as a joiner, managed to support
comfortably and respectably a wife and three children. He had so
far been taken into confidence that he allowed his workshop to be
used as a coign of vantage for keeping an eye upon Philips' house.
His shop consisted of a long room with two windows in it. At one
end was a small room with one window. This small room, which was
kept in darkness at night, was used as the watching place. Jackson
worked in his shop, with the exception of Saturday and Sunday,
until frequently ten and eleven at night. In the day time he went
out to work. He had three or four gas brackets in the shop, and by
request he kept all these flaring away while he was working. The
object of this was that a stream of light might fall full upon the
opposite houses, which it did, illuminating them most effectually,
and the Philips' residence was rendered very conspicuous, so that
nobody could go to the place or leave it without being seen. This
little arrangement answered the purpose for which it was designed
most admirably, and without causing any suspicion, for it seemed to
be a perfectly reasonable thing that the joiner working in his shop
at night should require plenty of light.</p>

<p>Chabot and Marcet being apparently satisfied that all was well,
approached the house, knocked at the door, which was speedily
opened, and they disappeared inside; and not until two hours had
passed did they come forth again. It was now very obvious that the
house was a rendezvous for the foreign rascals who preferred the
free air of foggy London to the risks they ran in their respective
countries. It was no less clear that the two women who rented the
house were not quite the innocent and harmless creatures they
appeared to be. Deception was being practised for some sinister
purpose. And that purpose was probably a desperate plot for the
destruction of life and property.</p>

<p>So far as I had proceeded everything justified the conclusions I
had drawn, but as yet I had not discovered Rocca. I was determined,
however, that if possible the conspiracy, whatever it might be,
should be frustrated, and that nothing should be left undone to try
and root out the nest of scorpions who had so snugly sheltered
themselves, as they thought. I therefore took means to have Madame
Blanc's house closely watched night and day, also Falber's, the
German tailor, and I myself gave attention to the place at
Islington.</p>

<p>Two days after Chabot's and Marcet's visit I observed the young
woman come out alone. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon.
She was most respectably, even well dressed, and her good looks
were calculated to attract attention. She walked rapidly to the
Angel at Islington, and got into a London Bridge 'bus. On the top
of that 'bus I rode. When the 'bus reached the Mansion House she
alighted and got into another vehicle going east to Poplar. I also
shifted my quarters, and got on top of the Poplar 'bus, wondering
what developments were to come out of this little jaunt. Why was
this foreign woman going to the east of London? Not for any
legitimate purpose, probably, all things considered. Anyway I did
not lose sight of her, and I expected every moment to see her
alight. But she kept her seat until the 'bus reached the extreme
limits of its journey near the gates of the East India Docks. It is
a long ride, as everyone knows who has taken it, and the mere fact
of the woman coming to such a neighbourhood strengthened my opinion
that she had not come for any legitimate reason.</p>

<p>It was now dark, so that her movements were more difficult to
watch: but I noted that she walked up and down for a little time,
and seemed to get impatient, for two or three times she pulled out
her watch, and looked at it by the aid of the light from a
gas-lamp. It was pretty evident she was waiting for someone, and
presently a man carrying a parcel done up in brown paper
approached, passed her for a few yards, then turned back and spoke
to her, and they entered into conversation. He had the appearance
of a foreign seaman. His face was certainly not an English type. He
wore a dark coloured cloth cap with ear-flaps tied up on the top of
the cap with a bow of ribbon, and he was dressed in a pilot jacket,
loosely-fitting trousers, and Wellington boots, into which the
bottoms of his trousers were stuffed. In a short time he handed the
woman the parcel, and in return she gave him some money from her
purse. The two next walked to the starting-place of the city
'busses, where they stood talking until the 'bus was ready to
start. Then he shook hands with her, raised his cap with the
politeness of a foreigner, and helped her into the 'bus, Avhich at
once moved off. For a few moments I was undecided whether to follow
her or keep in the track of the man. But my hesitation only endured
for a few moments, as I felt sure that I might gather something by
following him. He sauntered leisurely along the street, turned off
a side street that led to High Street, Poplar, where he entered a
public-house which was frequented principally by seafaring men. A
few minutes later I also strolled into the bar. It was not one of
the flaunting, flaring, glittering gin palaces which are such a
conspicuous feature in London, but a low-roofed, dingy place, with
a sanded floor, a pewter-covered counter, and small, plain deal
tables, and forms in front of the bar for the use of the customers.
There was a perceptible reek of tar even above the other odours,
and the crowd of men congregated there were unmistakably nautical.
Foul cigars and pipes charged with the strongest of tobacco were
being smoked, and the drink principally affected by the motley crew
was rum, though some had beer pots before them. There was a perfect
din of voices, and one with stentorian lungs was roaring out a
nautical ditty.</p>

<p>My man had joined a group of four or five foreign-looking
individuals, who were seated round one of the tables. As
unobtrusively as possible, I made my way to the counter and ordered
drink, a short pipe, and a screw of tobacco. Then I took stock of
the fellow I had followed. He was a burly man, bronzed with hot
suns to the colour of copper. I asked the man behind the bar if he
knew what ship the foreigners belonged to, and he answered that two
belonged to the <i>Santa Fe</i>, a small Italian steamer which was
lying off Tilbury with "gun-cotton or something on board." He
believed her destination was Naples. One of the two men he referred
to was the man I had followed. In a little while I finished my
smoke and left, and as soon as I got outside I hurried off to the
Blackwall Pier, where I secured the services of a couple of
watermen to row me down to the <i>Santa Fe</i>. It was by no means
a pleasant journey, for the night was cold and very dark; but,
fortunately, we had the tide with us, and went down pretty rapidly.
We found the steamer moored in the channel specially reserved for
vessels carrying cargoes of explosives, and I was only admitted on
board after I had declared that I represented the law, and that my
business was of the most urgent character. I at once sought an
interview with the Captain, an Italian, who informed me that he had
come from Newcastle, where he had taken on board a quantity of
dynamite and gun-cotton to be used for blasting purposes in the
marble quarries of Carrara. He bad put into the Thames to fill up
with a quantity of petroleum, but owing to some infringement of
regulations with regard to this cargo he had been detained, and was
not likely to get away for another fortnight. He identified the man
I described to him (the one I had followed) as one of his crew, by
name Guy Gagliardelli. He was a Spaniard, not an Italian. Having
learnt these particulars I said:</p>

<p>"Now, Captain, I have a serious question to ask you. Do you
think it likely that Guy Gagliardelli has stolen some of your cargo
of dynamite and gun cotton?"</p>

<p>"Santa Christ! no!" exclaimed the Captain in alarm and
amazement. "Why should he?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that is another question," I said. "If my surmise is
correct he has a strong motive, no doubt."</p>

<p>"But he would render himself liable to the law," urged the
Captain, looking still more alarmed.</p>

<p>"Of course he would," I answered. "But there is something more
serious involved in this than the mere theft of a few pounds of
your dangerous cargo; therefore I must ask your co-operation to
assist me in getting to the bottom of what seems to be a dangerous
conspiracy."</p>

<p>"You may command me," said the Captain, laying his hand upon his
heart. "I am willing to do whatever you wish me to do."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," I asked, "for you to discover whether your
cargo has been tampered with, even to a small extent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I think there is no doubt about it."</p>

<p>"When can you let me know?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"I suppose Guy Gagliardelli is on shore on leave?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His leave does not expire until twelve o'clock
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then if I come down here to-morrow, between ten and eleven, you
think you will be in a position to answer my inquiry one way or the
other?"</p>

<p>The Captain expressed himself as confident that he would be able
to do so, and having smoked a cigar and drunk a glass of wine with
him I took my leave, exacting from him a promise that he would keep
my visit a secret.</p>

<p>I went up to London from Gravesend, and I could not help
thinking, as I returned to the great city, that my night's
adventure was not likely to be profitless. Indeed, it seemed to me
that the net I had been spreading would, when drawn in, bring up a
pretty good haul; and I was not without hope that amongst my catch
would be the infamous and much-wanted Rocca.</p>

<p>True to my appointment, I went down the next morning to the
Santa Fe and had another interview with the Captain, when he told
me that in company with his mate and the carpenter he had that
morning examined the cargo, with the result that he found that a
case of dynamite had been opened, also a case of gun-cotton; and
from each something like fourteen or fifteen pounds' weight had
been abstracted.</p>

<p>I now informed the Captain that on the previous night I had seen
Gagliardelli deliver a parcel or bundle to a woman who was
suspected of being closely associated with a dangerous gang of
anarchists, and in return for the packet the woman had handed him
some money. The object of the transaction, therefore, could be
readily guessed. By some means or other, yet to be learnt, the
sailor had been communicated with and prevailed upon to steal some
of the cargo in order that he might sell it to the conspirators.
Apart from the gravity of the mere theft, the serious nature of the
crime could not be overrated, for while unlawfully abstracting the
explosives the fellow might have blown the vessel and all on board
to pieces. Then he conveyed the stuff on shore, carried it through
the streets, and sold it to a woman who actually rode in a 'bus
with it to London. It seems almost incredible, and yet what will
the folly of criminals not lead them to do! When men and women
engage themselves in desperate deeds they resort to desperate means
to accomplish their wicked ends.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that the Captain&mdash;who traded
regularly to England, and was well known&mdash;was in great
distress, for he recognised that it was no light matter, and he
asked me what was the best thing to do. I had no hesitation in
advising him to communicate instantly with the police, and as soon
as Gagliardelli came on board give him into custody at once on a
charge of having broached the cargo and stolen portions thereof.
The proof of the theft would be forthcoming afterwards.</p>

<p>My advice was acted upon, and I had the satisfaction of learning
that afternoon that the Spanish sailor had been duly arrested and
lodged in jail on the charge preferred against him by his Captain.
I felt now as if the first blow had been struck, and that the net
was tightening. It was very evident that the prisoner must have
been in league with the conspirators, otherwise how was it he came
to be in communication with the woman to whom he sold the
explosives? The hour and place of meeting must have been
prearranged either by correspondence or in some other way peculiar
to the plotters. And I deemed it of high importance that the man's
effects which he had on board the <i>Santa Fe</i> should be taken
charge of by the police, as it was very possible that amongst the
things some compromising matter would be found which would serve to
throw light on what was now shrouded in darkness. It will be
understood now that I had presumptive evidence that in the house in
Islington rented by the woman who called herself Mrs. Philips, a
quantity of dangerous explosives was stored, and that was a direct
infringement of the Act framed specially to deal with a case of the
kind. Of course I could at once have laid information on the
strength of what I knew, and have obtained a warrant to search the
premises. But I considered that that course would have been
premature, and some of the big fish I was so anxious to catch would
probably escape from my net. I therefore decided to wait further
developments, and to watch all the suspected people with increased
vigilance. In order to do this I had to enlist the services of
several trusty colleagues, and Madame Blanc's house, Mrs "Philips'"
house, and Tierrot's restaurant were all placed under
surveillance.</p>

<p>Up to this point I had got no trace of the rascal Rocca, whereat
I was considerably disappointed. And yet I was certain he was
somewhere behind the scenes, for had I not heard Chabot tell
Caccioli, <i>alias</i> Marcet, that he would place him in
communication with him? Had that been done? This question, which
came into my mind at once, seemed to present one of the incidents I
had witnessed in a new light. I had seen the two women go to
Chabot's house, and I had witnessed the entrance of Chabot there
also. Could it be possible, I thought, that the veiled woman was
Rocca? The more I dwelt upon this idea the more it seemed to me not
only possible but probable, till at last feasibility became
conviction in my mind. In the particulars sent from France about
Rocca it was stated that he was an adept at disguising himself as a
woman.</p>

<p>"Yes," I mentally exclaimed, "the person who poses as Mrs
Philips is none other than the arch criminal himself."</p>

<p>As the matter had now become very serious I applied to have the
prisoner Gagliardelli's effects examined. He had already been
brought before the magistrates on a charge of theft, and remanded
on my application, as I stated that I should very likely be able to
bring forward very important evidence at a later stage. His sea
chest, which had been given up by the captain of the <i>Santa
Fe</i>, was now opened, and everything turned out. Amongst his
things was found a bundle of letters. All these letters were
written in Spanish and had to be translated. When this was done, we
found that a great number of the letters had been sent to him from
London while he was with his ship in Newcastle. His correspondent
was a woman, who always signed herself&mdash;"Your loving cousin,
Isabella." In the letters it was proposed that he should abstract
from the cargo some of the dynamite and gun cotton, and it was
arranged that he and the woman should meet at the spot where I saw
them meet at Poplar, in order that she might receive the parcel for
which he was to receive the sum of twenty pounds.</p>

<p>This was damning evidence against the prisoner, and it also
showed how desperate was the plot in which the wretches were
engaged. I now received a report that for some days past there had
been a great deal of activity at the house in Islington, and Chabot
and Falber were frequently there, and many people came and went
every day. Gradually we accumulated an overwhelming mass of
evidence. Correspondence was intercepted and revealed the extensive
nature of the conspiracy, which had for its object the simultaneous
blowing up by means of bombs and other missiles public buildings in
the principal capitals of Europe, and several prominent personages,
including statesmen, military commanders, chiefs of police, and
others were marked for assassination. The very thought of the
wholesale murder and destructions contemplated by these infamous
wretches was enough to appal one, and had the plot been carried to
a successful issue the whole world would have been aghast. Happily
the fiendish conspirators, all unknown to themselves, were
gradually being drawn into a trap from which there would be no
escape.</p>

<p>It had been noted that an unusual number of people always went
to the Islington house on a Sunday evening, so it was decided that
the grand <i>coup</i> should be made on a Sunday night. By this
time a voluminous amount of evidence had been accumulated; and the
police throughout Europe had been notified of the conspiracy, and
put upon their guard. At length the day came when the net which had
been so cautiously set was to be hauled in, and every precaution
was taken to prevent the possibility of even the small fry slipping
through the meshes.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and a more disagreeable day it would have been
difficult to imagine. It had rained almost incessantly the whole
day, and a fierce cold biting wind added to the discomforts of the
streets. A careful watch had been kept upon the Islington house
from the joiner's shop, and when darkness set in a dozen picked men
made their way to the shop one by one. On this evening there were
an unusual number of visitors to the house, and we knew that in the
course of the ensuing week the conspirators intended to carry out
their nefarious designs unless prevented. It was evident that they
had no idea that they had been watched. In their own way they had
acted with great caution, and done what they thought was necessary
to protect themselves from being suspected. But they had failed,
and an astounding disappointment awaited them.</p>

<p>When all the churchgoers had assembled in their respective
places of worship, and the by-streets were deserted, for nobody
cared to be out in such weather who was not compelled, several cabs
unostentatiously assembled within easy call, and an additional body
of men came upon the scene; and being reinforced by those who had
already assembled in the joiner's shop, the house was gradually
surrounded. All being ready I went to the door in company with a
colleague, and rang the bell. In a few minutes the door was opened
by the young woman "Isabella," and as soon as that was done I
stepped into the passage and told her that I held the warrant for
the arrest of everyone on the premises, as they were supposed to be
there for an unlawful purpose. She turned deadly pale and uttered a
warning cry; but it was too late. The police swarmed in and burst
into a back room where a dozen persons were assembled, including
the hoary sinner Chabot, the traitorous Falber, Caccioli, and Mrs.
Philips, who proved to be none other than the notorious Rocca
himself, while Isabella, as it subsequently turned out, was his
wife, or at any rate the woman who passed as his wife.</p>

<p>On the table was a heap of printed leaflets of the most
inflammatory character. These were being made up in packets to be
despatched by post to various capitals in Europe. The consternation
of these wretches, taken red-handed as they were, is not easily
described, and that they would have made desperate resistance there
is little doubt, for a number of them were armed with revolvers and
knives, and Rocca, besides a revolver, had two most formidable
Spanish daggers concealed in a belt under the dress he wore.
However, before they had recovered from their surprise. They were
handcuffed, and then marched out, placed in the cabs that were
waiting, and driven to the station.</p>

<p>A search of the house revealed a most startling state of
matters. There were tons of anarchist literature, and in the
basement, that is in the cellars, there was a complete printing
plant, including the most improved hand-presses. The literature was
printed in English, Trench, German, Spanish, Italian, and Russian;
and it was all classified and arranged in a most business-like and
methodical way But in addition to these things there was a small
chemical laboratory, though it did not seem to have been much used.
There were bombs, dynamite, gun-cotton, fulminating powder, fuses,
bottles containing phosphorus, a carboy of carbolic acid, besides
various other chemicals and compounds, intended to be used in the
manufacture of explosives wherewith to commit wholesale massacre.
Fortunately the diabolical plot of the inhuman wretches, whose
dreams and schemes were as Utopian and wicked as any that could
have their birth in the brain of man, was frustrated just as it was
ripe for execution, and I might be pardoned for experiencing some
sense of gratification&mdash;shall I say pride?&mdash;that it had
been my good fortune to have been instrumental in letting in the
light on this dark conspiracy. At any rate, I confess to an intense
feeling of satisfaction that I was enabled to bring to a close the
career of Scipione Rocca, one of the most infamous beings that the
century possibly has produced. Although he had committed an offence
against English law he was, after some delay, handed over to the
French authorities, and removed to Paris. There he was tried for
the murder of his mistress, the actress of the <i>Châtelet</i>, and
being convicted of the crime, he was, I am happy to say, duly
guillotined. The young woman who had shared his fortunes in England
was a Spaniard, and a member of quite a respectable family. What
she saw in him to be fascinated with is one of those psychological
problems not easily solved. During the five years she was destined
to spend in an English jail she was able, no doubt, to reflect upon
the folly of her ways. Caccioli, <i>alias</i> Marcet, had come to
London accredited as the representative of <i>The League of
Liberty</i>, an organization of ruffians, having its head-quarters
in Brussels. The objects of the league were the regeneration of
society by massacre and the destruction of property. He had brought
letters of introduction to Chabot, and was commissioned to find out
Rocca and enlist his aid. He, Falber, the German tailor, and
Chabot, the hoary-headed rascal, were sentenced to long terms of
imprisonment. Chabot never regained his liberty, for he died of
bronchitis in the course of the second year of his sentence.
Gagliardelli, as well as all the others, also found out that though
England might be the land of the free, it was by no means a
desirable place to live in when one's life had to be spent in a
criminal establishment.</p>

<p>Madame Blanc, who had so long given asylum to the "Patriots,"
who fled from their own countries, was brought so prominently into
notice by the revelations that were made, that she deemed it
prudent to realise her property, and depart for a more genial
clime. The little old cobbler, who had cunningly played the part of
watch cur, finding his occupation gone, and being friendless and
penniless, was forced to seek shelter in the workhouse. But the
change didn't suit him, and he left this world in which he could
never have known joy or gladness. Thus the nest of scorpions was
cleared out, and although anarchism was not killed, it received
such a violent blow that it staggered under it for a long time, and
society was relieved of a terror which had oppressed it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. THE STRANGE TENANT</h2>

<p class="first">
IN going over my notes which embrace a period of upwards of
thirty years, I am disposed to think that the case I am about to
relate possesses unusual interest, for it presents us with some
remarkable psychological aspects of human nature. To the student
the study of man is fascinating to a degree. It is as complicated
as astronomy, quite as full of mysterious surprises, and no less
vast. To him who watches with untiring vigilance darker and deeper
depths are constantly being revealed, until one asks one's self
whether the human comprehension is capable of grasping or
understanding the infinite possibilities of the human mind. "Man,
know thyself" is a philosophical dictum, but it may be doubted
whether man ever can know himself, let him study never so well. As
an abstract principal I venture to think that this contains a great
truth. At any rate human nature is such a varying quantity that
just as you think you have mastered the problem of it your
calculations are entirely upset by some undreamt-of factor.</p>

<p>This brief introduction fits the story I have to tell. I
returned to my chambers one evening after an anxious and tiring day
when I was informed that a lady had been waiting to see me for some
time. I found her to be a woman of at least fifty. She had refined,
thoughtful face, with soft brown eyes that were rendered more
conspicuous by the iron grey hair that was carefully brushed over
the intellectual looking forehead. Her dress indicated that she was
in a good position in a worldly sense: and there was something
about her that was decidedly suggestive of the Mint mark of the
true lady. As she rose from her seat on my entrance she handed me
her card, saying:</p>

<p>"Permit me to introduce myself&mdash;I have come up to London
specially to seek your advice and assistance."</p>

<p>"Which are at your service, Madam," I answered, as I glanced at
the card on which was engraved "Mrs. Lydia Staffler, Deepdene,
King's Wood."</p>

<p>"I am the widow," she went on, "of the late General Staffler,
whose name possibly you may have heard before."</p>

<p>"I think I have," I answered; "if I am not mistaken he greatly
distinguished himself during the Crimean War."</p>

<p>A slight flush of conscious pride suffused her face, as she
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so, and the terrible hardships he had to endure
served to hasten his end, for he returned home a wreck and only
survived a few months. He left me with a son and a daughter. My son
is in the Army and is at present abroad, while my daughter
Beryl&mdash;who is now just turned two-and-twenty&mdash;lives with
me."</p>

<p>"Where is your home, Mrs. Staffler?" I asked.</p>

<p>"At Malmesbury," she replied. "King's Wood is a suburb of
Malmesbury. My late husband was a Wiltshire man and very fond of
his country. He built Deepdene, and purchased other property in the
neighbourhood. Amongst this property was a curious place bearing
the uncommon name of Monksbell. It is a large house standing in a
park of fifty acres, and was built somewhere about the beginning of
the sixteenth century. Although my husband paid a good price for it
he was supposed to have got it cheap, for it had been in the market
a great many years, but the trustees of the property had been
unable to find a purchaser or a tenant. My husband tried to let it
but did not succeed, and, dying, he left me a life interest in it.
At my death it reverts to my son or his children. For a long time
it was a white elephant to us, but about two years ago I succeeded
in letting it for a term of years to a Mr. Tyler Vellacott, who had
recently come from the Brazils where he had been the greater part
of his life. His father was an Englishman, his mother a Brazilian.
He represented himself as a rich bachelor who took a great interest
in chemistry: and said he wished to live a quiet and retired life
for the remainder of his days.</p>

<p>"From the first I thought he was eccentric. For a time he
isolated himself entirely; he never received any company; he kept
only one servant in the house&mdash;an ancient crone, whom he
brought from the Brazils. He said her name was Rinaldo, and that
she had been in the service of his family from her childhood. Some
months ago he began to pay marked attention to my daughter, and one
day alarmed me by asking me to consent to his marrying her. I say
that I was alarmed, because I couldn't conceive that he would make
her a suitable husband in any way. Beryl is a bright, cheerful
girl; he is an old, withered, and gloomy man. Perhaps I need
scarcely say now that I resolutely declined to accede to his
request, and I probed my daughter to find out what her feelings
were. She confessed that he had for a time fascinated her, but that
the fascination had worn off and she had come to dread him. I
therefore gave him clearly to understand that he must cease to pay
attention to her, and that it would be folly for him to dream for a
moment of making her his wife. He seemed much cut up, but said if
that was my decision he must abide by it. Some weeks ago I was
horrified by Beryl confessing to me that the man had thrown a spell
about her; that she loved him, and she declared that if I did not
consent to her becoming his wife she would either go into a convent
or destroy herself. I have reasoned with her; I have endeavoured by
every means in my power to show her the folly, the madness, the sin
of her conduct, but all to no purpose. She is resolute. She
declares solemnly that her happiness, her life, are bound up in the
strange old man, and for me to oppose her desires is unnatural and
cruel. It is a fearful trouble to me, but what am I to do. Perhaps
after all I am mistaken in Vellacott, and she may find her
happiness with him. But I know nothing about him. His life is a
sealed book to me, and to everyone else so far as I can ascertain;
nor will he breathe a syllable of his past history, He says that he
is rich and that is all that is necessary. I have managed, after
much argument with my daughter, in exacting from her a promise that
she will let the matter remain in abeyance for three months; and
unknown to her I have come here to request that you will do what
you can to learn the man's past history. If your report is
favourable to him I shall then consider that I have no longer any
right to oppose my daughter's wish, if it is then her wish to
become his wife. Will you undertake this task?"</p>

<p>My interest, I will even say my curiosity, had been aroused by
the lady's narrative, and I felt that Mr. Tyler Vellacott was one
of those human riddles that are well worth trying to read, and I
consented to do everything in my power to that end. As I considered
it of importance that I should have some personal knowledge of
Beryl, as well as of Mr. Vellacott, it was arranged between me and
Mrs. Staffler that I should go down to Malmesbury ostensibly as a
possible tenant for a small villa she had to let. This plan it was
considered would prevent any suspicion of my true object being
raised, and give me practically a free hand.</p>

<p>So it came about that a week later I found myself in the quaint
and historical town of Malmesbury which as everyone is aware
figured very prominently in the struggle between King Stephen and
the Empress Maud; and it witnessed many a sanguinary encounter
during the civil wars of Charles the First's reign. It also had the
proud distinction of possessing the finest and wealthiest
Benedictine Abbey in England, Glastonbury excepted. The town being
built on an eminence commands five views of the beautiful rolling
country by which it is surrounded, and the classic Avon may be said
to wash the foundations of some of its ancient houses.</p>

<p>The evening of my arrival I dined at Mrs. Staffler's house, and
made the acquaintance of her daughter who in some respects was a
remarkable looking girl. She was exceedingly fair, with a delicate
pink and white complexion, small features, languid, dreamy blue
eyes, and a great quantity of straw coloured hair. There could be
no disputing that she was an unusually pretty young woman, with a
well shaped figure, a graceful carriage, and a general picturesque
appearance. But the opinion I formed of her mental characteristics
was that she was vain, secretive, weak-minded, and inclined to be
morbidly sentimental. My next step was to learn something about Mr.
Tyler Vellacott, and I secured quarters for a few days in one of
the local hotels. As soon as practicable I went out to "Monksbell,"
which I found to be a gloomy old mansion, with mullioned windows,
massive chimney stacks, quaint gables, and terraced walks round
about it. An air of melancholy seemed to have settled on the place,
and this melancholy was further enhanced by the neglected state of
the grounds which were more suggestive of a jungle than a private
park in connection with a gentleman's residence. All the paths were
overrun with grass and weeds; trees crowded each other to such an
extent that they illustrated in a peculiarly mournful way nature's
law of the survival of the fittest. Those which had been unable to
endure the struggle were decaying or dead, and the air was filled
with an odour of damp mould and rotting vegetation. Even in the
immediate neighbourhood of the house, where at one time had been
well ordered lawns, trimmed shrubberies and carefully tended paths,
neglect was painfully apparent. In front of the house was a
balustraded terrace, with a broad flight of stone steps leading
down to the lawn. The balustrade was all overrun with a thick
straggling growth of ivy; the steps were green with moss and slime;
weeds choked the paths, the lawns were covered with layers of damp,
mildewed leaves, a fountain basin was filled up with a mass of
black rotting vegetation, and a statue of a Cupid with a bow lay
broken and encrusted with slime. All this was indicative of an
indifference on the part of the strange tenant which could only be
accounted for on the ground that he was of an eccentric, even
gloomy disposition.</p>

<p>"A man who can isolate himself as this man does, and display no
interest in his dwelling, must be a strangely constituted being," I
argued with myself. "Either he is a victim to some phase of madness
or he has come to regard the world with aversion."</p>

<p>As I felt it very desirable that I should have some personal
knowledge of Vellacott, I resorted to a little stratagem to gain
it. I rang the bell one day at the main door, and after
considerable delay was confronted by the Mulatto woman whom Mrs.
Staffler had referred to as Rinaldo. She was a dirty, slipshod,
fierce-looking creature who would have served an artist excellently
well as a model for a typical and traditional witch. It was easy to
associate with her all the absurd stories one has heard of the
power of witches to lure men to destruction, and to blight and slay
cattle by a mere glance of the eye. One could imagine her moulding
a waxen image in the likeness of an enemy, and sticking the image
full of pins so that the enemy might gradually wither away. Most
certainly the ignorant and the stupid would not have been slow to
accredit her with weird and supernatural powers.</p>

<p>Brusquely and coarsely she demanded to know what my business
was. She spoke with a pronounced accent and her command of English
was far from perfect. I expressed a desire to see the master, but
angrily she bade me depart, as the "master" was not to be seen. Nor
should I have seen him probably, had it not so chanced that
Vellacott was crossing the hall from one room to the other and
heard me express regret that I could not have an interview with
him. The woman said something to him rapidly in Portuguese, and he
answered her in the same language, then said in English:</p>

<p>"Show the gentleman in, Anna."</p>

<p>And Anna, grumbling and muttering between her blackened stumps,
piloted me into a small room, not ill furnished but looking sadly
neglected, and reeking of damp. In a few minutes Mr. Vellacott
joined me.</p>

<p>He wore a frayed dressing-gown, Turkish slippers, and a black
skull cap. He was a shrivelled looking man of medium height, with a
strangely sallow complexion, and small, intensely dark, intensely
brilliant eyes. It was altogether a remarkable thing that such
bright eyes should be associated with such a yellow complexion. His
teeth were exceedingly good and very white; and though he was well
advanced in years his face was without a wrinkle, while his hands
were the hands of adolescence. It is well known that the hands are
the first part of the body to show signs of age but this man had
the hands of a youth of fourteen or fifteen. In fact,
notwithstanding the yellow face he could easily have passed for a
man of thirty or even younger, for his voice was strong, his gait
steady, his figure straight. And yet there was something about all
this that struck me as unnatural. His youthful appearance seemed to
me to be the result of artificial means.</p>

<p>I apologized for my intrusion; said that the neglected look of
the place had led me to infer it was for sale although I saw no
board up, and being a stranger in the neighbourhood I was induced
to make some inquiries.</p>

<p>He smiled in a strange way and his white teeth gleamed, while
his extraordinary eyes shone with the brilliancy of an angry
snake's. As I looked at him now I could well understand how he had
been enabled to throw a spell over the weak-minded Beryl
Staffler.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "the property is not for sale. I confess it
is neglected; it has become a wilderness; but the fact is I am a
lonely sort of man. I have no kindred, and I become greatly
absorbed in my favourite study, for which I have a passionate
love."</p>

<p>"May I inquire what that is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it is chemistry; that is, the occult phases of
chemistry which is the basis of all creation. We ourselves are mere
chemical compounds which if understood aright would enable us to
perform marvels. But the fact is, while your scientific men talk
glibly about their knowledge of the chemical elements of the human
body, they are singularly ignorant and can go no farther than to
tell us that we have lime, phosphorus, soda, and various salts,
etc., in our bodies. But that is knowledge that a child may
acquire. It is merely A.B.C. I go infinitely deeper than that. I
have devoted my attention to endeavouring to discover the true
principle of life.</p>

<p>"And have you succeeded?" I asked with an ironical smile.</p>

<p>"Not quite," he replied, "but I have come near it. I have found
out how to perpetuate youth. Pray don't laugh. Look at me. I am
living evidence of the truth of what I say. I have by means of a
marvellous discovery learnt the secret of staying the ravages of
age."</p>

<p>"Does that mean," I asked, "that you know the art of prolonging
life indefinitely?"</p>

<p>He was thoughtful. His eyes appeared to me to lose some of their
brilliancy. He was like a man who was utterly absorbed in a
profound introspective study. In a few moments he closed his eyes;
placed the tip of his index finger on the furrow between the eyes
and stood motionless and statue-like. Presently he recovered
himself; his eyes flashed forth again, and gazing at me steadfastly
he answered:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I will not go quite so far as that. To preserve one's
youth is, if I may so express it, a mere chemical trick; to prolong
life indefinitely one must know the essence, the principle of life:
and that hitherto has eluded the grasp of all searchers. It is
something, however, to know how to keep one's self young; and how
to arrest the horrible process of decay."</p>

<p>"Can you arrest decay?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That is another secret I have wrested from the mysterious
depths of science. I can give the dead a beauty they did not
possess in life; and I can stay the effacing finger of
corruption."</p>

<p>I could not suppress a smile as he thus spoke. It is true there
was an absolutely startling earnestness in his manner, but it was
the earnestness of fanaticism; the earnestness of the mystic.</p>

<p>I was anxious to prolong the conversation, for the man was more
than ordinarily interesting, notwithstanding that I considered him
to be&mdash;to a large extent&mdash;a charlatan; but he said
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Well, you will excuse me. I must go. My laboratory demands my
presence." Then, opening the door of the room, he called out:
"Anna, Anna, conduct the gentleman to the hall."</p>

<p>I had only just time to express my thanks for the courtesy he
had shown me when the hag-like Mulatto appeared. She was so
hideously ugly, so old and parched that I was about to turn and ask
him how it was he had not tried his wonderful discovery on her, but
he had gone, and a door in the panelling that I had not before
noticed was sliding back into its place again, and thus indicating
his means of exit.</p>

<p>"Come" said the woman roughly; and as I had no excuse to linger
longer I followed her, and passed out of the house to the
moss-grown terrace.</p>

<p>The day was dying. The slanting rays of the sun illumined the
landscape with an effulgence that brought out every detail, and
imparted a beauty to even the most commonplace features; but
somehow or other neither that house nor its jungle-like
surroundings seemed warmed or lighted by a single ray. It was the
house of gloom, and seemed a fitting place for the abode of the
strange man I had just left.</p>

<p>I lost no time in seeing Mrs. Staffler and acquainting her with
my impression of Vellacott, and I strongly urged her to take her
daughter away, and let her look no more upon the mysterious tenant
of Monksbell. But the lady insisted that such a course would be
useless. She said she knew her daughter's disposition too well to
think that for an instant she would swerve from her resolution. To
oppose her would result in misery and suffering, and she strongly
urged her contention that it would be far better to learn all that
could be learnt of Vellacott's past. If there was nothing against
him, and eccentric though he was, she saw no reason why her
daughter should not marry him; but if his career had been shameless
and profligate that revelation would, no doubt, be sufficient
inducement to influence her daughter in curing herself of her
infatuation.</p>

<p>I allowed Mrs. Staffler's arguments to prevail; though for other
reasons than she advanced I deemed it desirable that Vellacott's
history should be known. The lady agreed with me that to attempt to
learn it from his own lips would be as useless as looking for the
philosopher's stone and so it was decided that I should arrange to
depart as early as possible for Brazil, and acting on the slight
information which he had thought proper to impart to her, endeavour
to trace his life back to its earliest years. I left England in the
autumn, my objective point being Rio Janeiro, where I arrived after
a somewhat stormy passage. I lost no time in commencing my
inquiries, and I ascertained that Tyler Vellacott, although known
in Rio, where he had been looked upon as a half mad man, had lived
for many years up the country at a place called Ararquara, in the
province of Sao Paulo where he owned an estate. So thither I wended
my way; not easily, as anyone will readily understand who has ever
travelled in the Brazils. I reached my destination after the
endurance of much misery, and I found myself in a very wild and
isolated part of the country. Ararquara seemed to me to be the most
undesirable place to live in it would be possible to imagine.</p>

<p>In this place or its immediate neighbourhood Vellacott had
resided for many years, and owned a coffee plantation on which he
had employed upwards of four hundred slaves. As in Rio, he had been
looked on by the people of Ararquara as eccentric to the verge of
madness; and yet he had conducted his business in a very
business-like way and was known to have made a fortune. He married
the young widow of a neighbouring planter, and she had brought him
considerable property. But it very soon became known that he and
his wife led a most unhappy life. Their tastes, temperaments, and
habits were totally different, and their quarrels were many and
frequent. She left him on two or three different occasions and went
to stay with friends in Rio, but after a time she always returned
to him. At length she mysteriously disappeared, and when it became
bruited about that nobody had seen her go away, and that her
friends in Rio knew nothing of her whereabouts ugly rumours were
spread. At last her friends became clamourous, and openly accused
her husband of having made away with her. He was accordingly
arrested, and every means were resorted to to get some trace of the
missing woman, but without result. In due course&mdash;and the
course of legal procedure in Brazil is painfully slow&mdash;Tyler
Vellacott was put upon his trial, but as no evidence was forth
coming he was ultimately discharged. Anna Rinaldo his servant,
although she was threatened with torture vowed that she knew
nothing, but she declared that she had several times heard her
mistress say that she would destroy herself. Other witnesses swore
they had heard the unfortunate woman give utterance to the same
threat. The question, however, that found no answer was, "Where is
her body?" A dead person could not dispose of his own remains. It
was suggested that she had gone forth into the vast forests that
stretched to the north of the town and there been consumed by some
of the fierce wild animals that swarm in Brazilian jungles. Anyone
getting lost in the Jungle was never likely to be heard of again.
Orchid hunters and others whose avocations took them to the dark
depths of the forests sometimes disappeared as effectually as if
the earth had opened and swallowed them. It was known that if a
human being met with an accident in the forest, or was overcome
with weakness or sudden illness so that he could not help himself,
he would&mdash;supposing that he escaped the larger
carnivora&mdash;be utterly devoured in a few hours by the tierce
rodants, and in the course of two or three weeks his bones Mould be
entirely covered over by the rank vegetation which grows with such
marvellous rapidity.</p>

<p>Now, whether Mrs. Vellacott had met her end in this way or not
the theory, as every Brazilian knew, was feasible enough, and in
view of no other being suggested it was generally accepted, save by
the woman's relatives, who threatened Vellacott with violence. He
manifested no alarm, however, but proceeded to realize his
property, and that done he took his departure from the country
accompanied by his faithful servant Anna Hinaldo who was known to
be passionately attached to him.</p>

<p>Having gone, all interest in him ceased, and the mystery of his
wife's end seemed destined to remain a mystery for ever. This in
substance was the story I gathered; but in addition, as justifying
the opinion that was expressed that he was eccentric if not
somewhat off his mental balance, I was told that he often spent
many hours of the night in his chemical laboratory which no other
human being was allowed to enter except, perhaps, Anna, though
there was no evidence that she did so. And he had been frequently
heard to boast that he had made two wonderful discoveries. One was
the means of arresting decomposition in all animal substances,
preserving them in all their pristine freshness; the other the
means of renewing youth. The first was regarded as a chemical
possibility; the other as charlatanism, and strongly indicating
that he was a crank. But it was admitted as a curious fact which
went a long way towards supporting him in his statement, that he
changed his own appearance from haggard age to, relatively
speaking, blooming youth. Of course I should have treated this as
the idle gossip of an ignorant and credulous people who have an
ingrained belief in sorcery, witchcraft, and magical spells&mdash;I
refer more particularly to the lower orders&mdash;had I not seen
with my own eyes certain signs which lent colouring to the story I
freely confess that if I attached no great importance to it, I was
not prepared to scout it altogether At any rate, I looked upon
Vellacott as a very remarkable man who presented the world in his
own proper person with one of those startling human puzzles which
are not easily solved. Perhaps he was a fool, madman, and knave
combined; but he was neither so foolish nor so mad that he did not
know what he was about. And yet it was clear that he thought not as
the generality of men think, and he lived a life that might very
properly be described as unnatural. My investigation in Brazil
extended over a period of three months; and I left the country by
no means sorry to get away. For existence is carried on there under
conditions which sorely try the average European. The climate saps
his strength; night and day he is tortured by numberless insect
pests, and whenever he moves from the centres of civilization he is
menaced on all sides by venomous reptiles and ferocious beasts. In
addition to all this he is irritated by the treachery, the filthy
habits, and the incurable laziness of the people. Under the sway of
almost any other people but the Portuguese Brazil would be one of
the grandest and wealthiest countries in the world.</p>

<p>I merely give vent to these expressions as my personal opinion
based upon a short experience, and I am open to be set right or
corrected by anyone who is competent to speak with greater
authority than I am.</p>

<p>My voyage home was marked by a succession of tremendous storms
and a narrow escape from shipwreck, and when I stepped ashore at
Southampton from the deck of the good ship that had brought us
safely through many perils, it was with a sense of relief. The
object of my journey had so far been gained that I was in a
position to advise Mrs. Staffler that it would be undesirable to
permit her daughter to unite her destiny with the strange tenant of
Monksbell, Tyler Vellacott. After a day's rest I hurried off to
Malmesbury expecting to find things <i>in statuo quo</i>, but such
was not the case. Mrs. Staffler was in a state bordering on
distraction as well she might be, for three weeks previous her
daughter had disappeared. Then it was found that Monksbell was shut
up, and Vellacott and his strange servant had gone away. This
permitted of but one inference, which was that Beryl had gone with
them. Every effort had been made to trace the fugitives but without
avail, and poor Mrs. Staffler was stricken with inconsolable
grief.</p>

<p>"As you have done so much," she exclaimed to me, with a
passionate wail, "complete your services by discovering the
whereabouts of my misguided daughter. I would sooner have followed
her to her grave," she added, "than have to bear the shame and
humiliation that afflict me now."</p>

<p>Of course I promised to do what I could, and it was very evident
that from this point I should have to take a new departure: but as
Beryl was of full age there was no legal power that could compel
her to return to her mother's house. Of course if her whereabouts
was discovered it came within the bounds of possibility that the
moral persuasion of her unhappy mother might have an effect where
everything else would fail, but I confess that the probability of
such persuasion being successful seemed to me remote. It was only
too obvious that the girl must have fallen completely under the
extraordinary influence of Vellacott, and the odds were largely in
favour of that influencing enduring; for his power was strong; she
was weak. It appeared that she had gone to Bath on a visit to some
friends. After being there four or five days she expressed a desire
to return home, as she expected an old school-fellow to visit her.
This, of course, prevented her friends having any suspicion. From
the time that her friends saw her off by the train all trace of her
was lost. On leaving Malmesbury she had taken a first-class return
ticket, but the half from Bath to Malmesbury had never been given
up. That was significant, and it was a most remarkable fact that in
spite of the efforts that had been made to trace her, no
information was forthcoming as to where she had alighted. If she
had returned to Malmesbury the half of the ticket could have been
found, notwithstanding that several days elapsed before her mother
knew she had left her friends, and the friends learned that she had
not gone back to Malmesbury. It was discovered by her letters
directed to Bath being re-addressed to her home.</p>

<p>My own inquiries left no room to doubt that she had travelled by
the Malmesbury train on the day her friends saw her off. Now, she
could not have travelled without a ticket, and I came to the
conclusion at once that she had taken a ticket for some other place
unknown to her friends. Acting on this, I caused minute inquiries
to be made as to the tickets that were issued by that particular
train on that particular day, and I found that three singles were
issued for Malmesbury and two for Chippenham, and several for
Swindon and other places. It is but a short rail journey from Bath
to Malmesbury and Chippenham is within easy drive of the latter
place. At it was winter time it would be dark when the train
reached Chippenham, and it occurred to me that one of the two
ticket holders for Chippenham was Miss Staffler. Of course I shall
be asked what my reason was for this. Here it is. Vellacott and his
servant were such conspicuous people that they certainly could not
have left Malmesbury without its being known; but even if they had
succeeded in doing so it was extremely likely owing to the wide
publicity given to the case that information of them, from
somewhere or other would have been forthcoming. Now, what was the
logical deduction from this line of argument? To my mind it was
that she had alighted at Chippenham been met by Vellacott and had
walked to Monksbell, a distance of under ten miles, or she might
have gone alone. It did not affect me that Monksbell was shut up
and tradesmen and others who called had gone away under the
impression that no one was in the house. Vellacott kept an account
at a local bank, and this account had not been drawn upon for some
time. That fact possessed a certain significance which will be
obvious.</p>

<p>It may be argued that though she did go to Monksbell, she and
Vellacott and Rinaldo must have left again very soon. Not
necessarily so, for as I have endeavoured to show if they had done
that some information about them would in all probability have been
obtained. Then assuming that they did not leave the house they were
there still; and being there and being human they would have
required provisions from outside sources, unless a large quantity
had previously been laid in, and no evidence was forthcoming to
justify that conclusion. But being there how did they live? My
opinion was, they were not living at all, but <i>dead</i>.</p>

<p>This was a startling theory, but I worked it out in this way
Vellacott was a strange man, full of extraordinary ideas, and half
mad. Supposing that his influence had so far prevailed as to draw
the girl to his gloomy abode, and when she reached there she
suddenly realized her position and endeavoured to retreat&mdash;to
escape. What was more likely&mdash;having regard to the man and the
circumstances&mdash;than that he killed her? Or he might have been
trying some of his cracked-brain experiments upon her, and
accidentally extinguished her life. In which case fear and grief
might have driven him to slay his servant and then himself. I was
so far affected and swayed by this line of reasoning that I applied
for and obtained an order to break into the premises. The
application was kept secret, and near midnight one night,
accompanied by a well-known J. P., three constables, and a London
detective, I effected an entrance into the premises. It was a dark,
wild, fierce sort of night, such as is often experienced in England
in early December. The wind blew freezingly and in squally gusts;
screaming through the leafless trees, or moaning like a thing in
pain, round the gloomy house. In the house itself a solemn silence
reigned, save for the wind that wailed and sighed in the passages.
There was an eeriness about the place that was impressive. In our
own shadows thrown by the lights we carried, a nervous person might
have fancied he saw ghosts or ghouls. From room to room we went.
Nothing seemed to have been disturbed. In the dining-room the grey
ashes of the last fire were on the cold hearth. The table was
partly covered with a white cloth, on which were the remains of the
last meal. A decanter half full of wine, some fruit that was a mass
of putridity, the remnants of a leg of mutton at which the rats or
mice had been gnawing, a closed silver box containing biscuits, a
box with some cigars, and on a plate a cigar partly smoked. There
was something positively uncanny in all this, and to some extent it
certainly prepared me for what followed.</p>

<p>From the dining-room we went to the "Laboratory." A long, narrow
room it was, with a goodly array of crucibles, retorts, syphons,
bottles, and the hundred and one things that an experimental
chemist would surround himself with. But there was <i>something</i>
that arrested our attention more than these. Seated in a large
chair, her head resting on a silken cushion was Beryl Staffler. Her
fair hair was hanging loose about the cushion; her eyes were open
and bright; her face ruddy with a glow of life as it seemed, and
yet there was a dreadful waxiness about it; a polished opaqueness
that caused it to resemble marble; and she was as rigid and hard as
marble; as cold as ice; motionless as a statue, for she was dead,
and yet there was no sign of the effacing finger of death. It was a
strange and impressive sight; but there was a stranger and more
awful one still. In a crouching position at her feet, its head
resting on her knees was what at first might have been taken for a
dressed up, but dead and shrivelled, monkey. The face was brown
like mahogany, the skin drawn tightly over the prominent bones, the
lips were stretched apart revealing the white teeth, the eyes had
dried up from the sockets, the hands were the hands of a mummy. A
very little examination proved that figure to be all that remained
of Vellacott. The few hairs about the cranium were white as driven
snow, and the dead man had the appearance of having reached an
extreme old age. What was the mystery? Had his wonderful
youth-preserving elixir failed? And young as he seemed when I saw
him in life had he really reached an age far beyond the allotted
span?</p>

<p>Although he was shrivelled and fleshless the ordinary signs of
decomposition were wanting. So far we had accounted for two of the
actors in the extraordinary drama. Where was the third?&mdash;that
is, Anna Rinaldo. Prosecuting our search we left no part of the
house unvisited, but not a sign of the Mulatto could be found; and
so, full of a wonderment that made us dumb we gave the place over
to silence and death for the time being, and went forth into the
night. The trees looked like solid blocks of shadows; rain fell in
torrents and the howling wind smote it until it seemed to struggle
in the fury of a great wrath; dashing itself against the foliage
and the building with the hiss of a thousand serpents, and leaping
up from the ground in boiling, misty wreaths. It was with a sense
of positive relief we quitted the grounds and heard the great gate
swing on its rusty hinges between us and that house of mystery.</p>

<p>On the following day the investigation was continued and
resulted in a further revelation. We had failed to notice on the
previous night (and no wonder) a large glass shade covering a metal
plate, that stood on a table in the laboratory. On the plate was a
heap of greyish looking dust; and written on a parchment label
attached to the knob of the bell-shaped glass by a piece of ribbon
was the following:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"This dust is all that remains of Anna Rinaldo,
my faithful Mulatto servant. I reduced her body to ashes in six
hours by a chemical process, the secret of which will die with me.
<span class="smcap">Tyler Vellacott</span>."</p>

<p><br>
So much and no more did the strange being tell. All the rest
could only be guessed at. Was it not probable, however, that he had
reduced his wife in Brazil to a handful of ashes, and scattered
them to the winds? But how did Rinaldo die? Did her master kill her
and Beryl Staffler? If so, why? Was it not very probable that
Beryl's death was brought about by accident, and that being so he
too resolved to die, though first of all he determined that he
would prove to the world that he had made two great discoveries. He
could prevent decomposition, and reduce a human body to ashes
without the aid of fire. When he came to die himself, the effects
of his youth preserving elixir passing away disclosed that he was a
weakened shrivelled old man, who had only worn a mask of youth,
which falling off revealed a sight that made one shrink with
horror. How he slew himself; how he killed Beryl, if he did kill
her, which I doubt; how he influenced her to join him, and for what
purpose could never be determined. He was a human problem that
could not be fully solved, and his marvellous story serves to give
point to the Shakespearian dictum that:</p>

<p>"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in
our philosophy."</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Staffler did not long survive the shock that the
revelation caused her. Her daughter's remains were consigned to the
family tomb in the picturesque grave garden of a little country
church. Vellacott's body was placed in a nameless grave in
unconsecrated ground, while Rinaldo's ashes were sealed in a vase
that is now in the possession of a well-known scientific man.</p>

<p>With the passing of the strange tenant the blight that had so
long rested on Monksbell came back like a curse. People shunned the
place, for they said foul things haunted it, and blood-curdling
sights and sounds were to be seen and heard by him who had the
hardihood to venture near after dark. The jungly growth of trees,
shrubs and weeds choked up the paths in time, and hid the house
from view. Owls hooted from the chimney stacks, bats flitted in and
out through the broken windows, the ravens found undisturbed
shelter, until years had elapsed; then the hand of improvement
swept the whole place away and Monksbell is known no more save as a
tale that is told.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. THE VULTURE-FACE MAN</h2>

<p><br>
IT was a winter night. London was wrapped in, or more correctly
speaking permeated, saturated, sodden, with a thick, dense,
choking, palpable yellow fog. Traffic was almost entirely
suspended. A horrible silence prevailed. The gloom of death seemed
to lave settled upon the great city. The gas-lamps were powerless
to penetrate the murk atmosphere. Such pedestrians as were out
looked like spectres, as they struggled on their weary way, with
heads bowed, faces muffled. The shopkeepers, despairing of doing
any more business that day had put up their shutters, for they knew
that evil human things were abroad and neither property nor life
was safe. The theatres were empty; even the artistes of the
music-halls sang and buffooned to empty benches. Nothing stirred
upon the river, and the work of the railways was carried on under
the utmost difficulty. Some of the trains laden with city men bound
for the suburbs were delayed on the way two and three hours. It was
indeed a terrible night, and many sick and delicate people died
from breathing the poisoned and mephitic atmosphere; while the
ill-clad and poverty stricken wretches of the alleys and slums
suffered agony.</p>

<p>In strange and striking contrast to all this was the "Blue Room"
of the newly erected National Hotel. This splendid and palatial
house had been erected by a limited company, and that night being
the first anniversary of the opening, the Directors had invited the
shareholders to a grand ball. Of course it was not foreseen when
the invitations were sent out that on the ball night the modern
Babylon would be wrapped in an inky pall of choking fog. Many who
were to have been present from distant parts of London were unable
to reach the hotel at all, and had to bear with their
disappointment as best they could. People who lived in the country,
or at any rate some of them, had taken up their residence in the
house two or three days before, so that they were not prevented by
the atmospheric conditions from displaying their gorgeous dresses
and sparkling jewels.</p>

<p>The "Blue Room" of the National Hotel was said to be one of the
finest rooms of the kind in London, outside of Buckingham Palace
and one or two of the historic mansions. The decorations were of a
peculiarly chaste character: the walls being panelled with blue,
with white and gold bordering. As for the ceiling, artists and
critics had come from all parts of the country to gaze upon it, for
it was the work of a famous Italian artist whose name was known
throughout the civilized world.</p>

<p>Terrible as the gloom and fog were outside, the ball-room was
now a scene of brilliancy and beauty A crack military band
discoursed sweet music: and the gorgeously dressed dancers threaded
their way through the mazy quadrille, or whirled round in the giddy
waltz, all unmindful of the horrors that prevailed outside the
well-warmed and well-lighted building, and the suffering and the
misery of the houseless and the hungry By common consent it was
admitted by all that the belle of the room was a vounw ladv who was
on the right side of thirty Firstly she was possessed of beauty of
no common order. She had an exquisitely moulded arm, and a face
that suggested all the delicate tracing of a cameo. Her neck,
shoulders, and bosom were without a fault, and her well, poised
head was surmounted by a wealth of splendid auburn hair in which
burned and flashed a single diamond star. Round her swan-like neck
was a diamond necklet of the purest gems, while diamonds sparkled
on her wrists. Not only was she a perfect dancer, but she carried
herself with a dignity and grace that attracted the attention of
everyone. Her dress too, was in keeping with her beauty. It was
pure cream-coloured satin, trimmed with bullion fringe. This lady
who seemed to be under the care of an elderly chaperon, was
apparently the gayest of the gay in that festive scene. Her
laughter was like music itself, and when her red lips were parted
they disclosed the most perfectly even and white teeth.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, she was much sought after by the other sex
as a partner in the dance; but she did not confer her favours
indiscriminately. Indeed, it was a matter of remark that her envied
favourites were few. Had some wandering angel from another sphere
entered the room that night, and requested to be shown the
incarnation of the highest human happiness, the lady in the gold
and satin dress would surely have been presented to him as
typifying earthly contentment <i>in excelsis</i>. On her fair brow
no care seemed to rest; in her laughter there was no trace of
sorrow, while health and wealth would appear to have been hers in
abundance. She was a star in that scene of brilliancy; and the
flowers, the music, the lights, the flashing jewels served but to
enhance her own beauty, so to speak, for beauty should have a
beautiful setting, whether it be embodied in a picture or a
landscape, a woman or a jewel. Truly that ballroom was a scene of
dazzling radiance, but outside the gloom of eternal night seemed to
have settled on the mighty city with its wonderful secrets; its
inscrutable mysteries, its folly and foibles, its sin and
misery.</p>

<p>The hours waned. The theatres and music-halls had long since
closed their doors, and the tired mummers had managed somehow or
other to reach their houses. The houseless waifs and the starving
gutter rats had slunk away into any hole or corner that would
afford them some pretence of shelter from the cold; and the
<i>habitués</i> of the gin palaces and public-houses with their
meretricious attractions and fatal fascinations, had disappeared,
for darkness and silence reigned where erstwhile there had been
uproar and light. Shivering policemen stood at the street corners
or wearily patrolled their beats; but they could see nothing, for
the fog was impenetrable. Four o'clock rang out solemnly and slowly
from the great bell of Westminster tower, but the brazen noises
were strangely muffled and subdued by the heavy, dense
atmosphere.</p>

<p>At the National Hotel, the last bars of music had been played,
the last dance had been danced, the last dancer had gone, the
lights were extinguished, save such as were necessary to enable the
servants to perform their work of clearing the room; and to the
human atoms who had made up that little world of movement, light
and joy the night with its splendour and feast was but a
memory.</p>

<p>The scene shifts. It is nearly high noon of the day following.
The fog has lifted considerably, so that traffic can be resumed;
but there is still a heavy damp mist, so cold and saturating that
it seems to penetrate to one's very marrow. Suddenly throughout the
National Hotel runs a thrill of horror; there has been a tragedy,
and the belle of the ball room&mdash;the Beauty of the gold and
satin dress&mdash;lies on her bed with a ghastly pallor on her
face, and her delicate limbs frozen with the coldness of death. Her
friend and companion, a Mrs. Arkwright, had occupied an adjoining
room, that communicated with her friend's room by a door which had
been partially open all night. She had risen soon after eleven, and
gone to her friend to enquire if she was ready to partake of some
tea. But a horrible sight met her gaze and almost paralyzed her
with fear. Beauty was in the throes of death, her nightdress and
bedclothes were crimson with her lifeblood which had flowed from a
gaping wound in her bosom. She was still conscious, and looked
pitiably at her friend, who, going to the bedside, exclaimed
frantically:</p>

<p>"Florence! what does this mean?"</p>

<p>The dying woman's lips moved, and as Mrs. Arkwright inclined her
head so that she might the better hear anything that was said, she
caught these words, gasped out in broken accents and with
difficulty:</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the&mdash;Vulture-face man."</p>

<p>The dying woman spoke no more; a fearful spasm shook her; she
clutched at the air, while Mrs Arkwright tugged violently at the
bell, then flung wide the door, and rushing on the landing <i>en
deshabille</i> screamed shrilly and long. In a very few moments
servants and visitors had crowded round. She could only point
dumbly to the room before she sank down in a dead faint, and when
people pressed eagerly through the open doorway it was to find that
Florence had ceased to breathe. While some attended to Mrs.
Arkwright, others rushed for medical aid, which was soon
forthcoming; but nothing human could restore the dead to life
again. A tragedy had been enacted, and now it became necessary to
determine if Beauty had slain herself, if Mrs. Arkwright had slain
her, or if she had been killed by someone else. I was called upon
the scene, and at once commenced an investigation. It was soon made
manifest that Mrs. Arkwright was innocent of any participation in
her friend's death; and the medical evidence left no doubt that
Beauty could not have taken her own life. A small stiletto had been
driven with great force into the breast, piercing the right lung,
but the wound indicated that she could not have done it with her
own hands. The stiletto with the point broken off&mdash;the point
being left in the wound&mdash;was found on the floor. It had a
mother-of-pearl handle which was drenched with blood.</p>

<p>Of course a revelation had to be made. When Mrs. Arkwright
recovered somewhat from the dreadful shock she had sustained, she
said she was a widow, and resided in the neighbourhood of
Nottingham, where her friend also resided. The dead woman's name
was Florence Maude Slark. She was the wife of Lieutenant-General
Slark, a retired officer who had seen much service. He was twice
the age of his wife and there had been much unhappiness between
them, as their tastes and ideas were so totally dissimilar. She had
married him for his position and money.</p>

<p>So much to begin with was brought to light, but there was much
more to be known. For the time being it was all important that
every effort should be made to trace the murderer. The chamber in
which the dead body lay was a large, handsomely furnished room on
the first floor. It was lighted by two French windows that
communicated with a narrow balcony protected by a massive stone
balustrade overlooking the main street. To this balustrade was
attached by means of hooks, a strong, knotted, silken cord which
descended to within about six feet of the pavement. By this cord
the murderer had escaped, for there were marks of bloody fingers on
the stone work, and the cord itself was stained with blood. There
is no doubt he intended to take the cord with him, but having
miscalculated the distance somewhat, he found that he could not
jerk the hooks free of the balustrade when he reached the pavement;
and he had no alternative but to leave the evidence of his escape
behind him. So he fled forth into the fog and the gloom, and the
great city swallowed him up.</p>

<p>Now as to a clue. Mrs. Arkwright attached no importance to her
dying friend's words: "The vulture-face man" but I did. The
"vulture face" might have been the result of a mind horrified with
a fear of death. But I considered it had direct reference to
someone the murdered woman had been acquainted with and in whose
features she traced some fancied resemblance to a vulture. Given
that my theory was correct, I had to search the world for a man
with a "vulture face" And when I had found him I should have the
murderer of the beautiful Mrs. Slark.</p>

<p>In beginning my quest it was absolutely necessary that I should
learn the history of the dead woman in its entirety, for in that
history some page would probably afford valuable hints that would
help one to unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>Florence was the only child of her parents. Her father had
served the Hon. East India Company long and well. He had married
the daughter of a London merchant who was supposed to be wealthy,
but dying it was found that his affairs were so involved that he
had little or nothing to leave.</p>

<p>Florence's father, however, was not poor, but his life went out
when his child was barely seven. He was on his way home from India
as an invalid, but died on the voyage. Florence had a weak and
indulgent mother who spoilt her so that she became a self-willed,
wayward, and headstrong girl. She was not fourteen when her mother
died, and the girl was then placed in the care of a guardian. He
appears to have been an austere, puritanical Scotchman to whom the
girl took an intense dislike. She was renowned for her beauty and
could have had lovers by the score, but her guardian exercised such
a keen vigilance that she had no chance of open flirtation; though
there was very strong reason to suspect that she had secret love
adventures.</p>

<p>As soon as ever she came of age she rushed into matrimony. She
was then said to be one of the most beautiful girls that human eyes
could have looked upon. Save on the hypothesis that she married
solely for money&mdash;she had very small means of her own&mdash;it
is difficult to understand why she should have been in such haste
to wed. Her husband, Lieut.-Gen. Slark was a grizzled warrior who
had been battered and broken during a long course of active
soldiering. He succeeded to a large and valuable estate in
Nottinghamshire on the borders of the famed forest of Sherwood. It
was soon made manifest that his young and beautiful wife was not at
all disposed to be humdrum or submissive, and quarrels between her
and her greybeard husband were frequent. She married in haste, she
repented at leisure; and she resolutely refused to be controlled by
her lawful lord and master, while he for the sake of peace and
quietness allowed her much more liberty than was either judicious
or good for her.</p>

<p>Amongst the acquaintances she formed was a Mrs. Arkwright, whose
husband had made money in the wholesale boot and shoe trade. Dying,
he left his childless widow, who was still young and possessed of
considerable attractions, well off. One must have a pretty
considerable knowledge of human nature to determine what there was
in common between the two ladies. Mrs. Arkwright was rather a
vulgar woman, and by no means well educated. Her personal
attractions could not be mentioned in the same breath as those of
her much younger companion. But Mrs. Slark was glad to take
ostensible shelter under her wing; and Mrs. Arkwright was proud to
be able to speak of Lieut.-Gen. Shirk's wife as her friend. The
widow had been a source of much unpleasantness between the General
and his wife. He did not like her. He had forbidden her to
associate with his wife or come to his house. The latter mandate
she obeyed, the former Mrs. Slark herself ignored. She was
fascinated with the widow, and the widow had great power over
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arkwright was a shareholder in the National Hotel Co. Ltd.,
hence it was she had received an invitation to the ball. She had
pressed her friend to join her, and Mrs. Slark had yielded readily,
but knowing that she would never be able to obtain her husband's
consent she told him that she was going to London to do some
shopping and would stay with an aunt for a few days. He would have
insisted on accompanying her had it not been that he was helpless
with an attack of acute gout. Nor could he alter her resolve or
control her movements, so he had to submit because he had no other
alternative. It was Hobson's choice. He was in entire ignorance
that she was going to London with Mrs. Arkwright or that she
intended to be present at the ball. Mrs. Arkwright engaged the
rooms at the hotel; she had planned that she and her friend would
return to their respective homes on the afternoon following the
ball. But she was too frivolous and shallow-pated to understand
that she was running a tremendous risk and playing with fate when
she tacitly counselled poor Mrs. Slark to so shamefully deceive her
husband.</p>

<p>Such in outline was the history of Mrs. Slark. No doubt it is
the history of thousands of other women, and therefore may be said
to be commonplace. Yet the history of human beings must ever repeat
itself; it can vary only in degree. But in the dead woman's case
were deeper depths and finer shades of shadow to be explored, for
they concealed the clue to the vulture-face man, and I was resolved
to get hold of that clue.</p>

<p>The crime had been deliberately planned, and revenge was the
motive. Nothing had been stolen from the lady's room. All her
valuable diamonds and other jewels were lying intact on the
dressing-table, where she had placed them on retiring. Had robbery
been the motive the criminal would never have left the diamonds,
which he could so easily have carried off. As regards the
deliberate planning of the deed, the fact of the murderer having so
ingeniously provided means of escape proved that. Then again it was
pretty evident that he had concealed himself in the room. Mrs.
Arkwright testified that when she and her companion went up to
their rooms it was a quarter to three. They were both exceedingly
tired and proceeded at once to undress themselves. By the time they
had finished this operation and arranged their hair for the night
their watches had told off the fourth hour of the morning. Both the
bedroom doors were locked and bolted, and Mrs. Arkwright declared
that notwithstanding her excitement when she discovered the crime,
she remembered perfectly having to draw the bolt of the door before
she could get on the landing. The deduction therefore was that the
criminal was concealed in the room, and there was no place where he
could have concealed himself save under, the bed, which was a heavy
iron one with valances all round the lower part of it. That he had
so concealed himself seemed absolutely certain, but how long he had
remained concealed no human being could determine by any process of
ordinary reasoning. It was only a little less difficult to say with
any pretension to accuracy at what hour the fatal blow was struck.
It was about half past eleven in the forenoon when Mrs. Arkwright
discovered her friend <i>in extremis</i>, but the medical opinion
was that the poor woman had been bleeding to death for some hours.
The fatal wound was of such a nature that from the very first it
would render her helpless. It was probable that she might have
called out and have groaned, but Mrs. Arkwright slept so soundly
that she failed to hear her.</p>

<p>The next step in logical sequence was to determine so far as it
was possible to do, if any man had been present in the house, or at
the ball whom Mrs. Slark had previously met. In this matter there
was nothing but Mrs. Arkwright's evidence to go upon, though she
expressed a very positive opinion that if her friend had seen any
man at the ball with whom she was acquainted she would hardly have
kept the matter secret. And yet when I put this point-blank
question to the widow&mdash;"Did your friend entrust you with all
her secrets?"&mdash;she answered with an emphatic "Oh dear no. She
was singularly reticent considering how familiar we were." After a
thorough analysis, however, of all the incidents, and a searching
examination of the probabilities and improbabilities I came to the
conclusion in my own mind that the man had ascertained by some
means that Mrs. Slark was going to be present at the ball; and
taking advantage of the relative confusion he had managed to gain
ingress to the hotel without being noticed; and had at once
proceeded to her room and concealed himself there, waiting for his
prey; but she had been all unconscious of his presence in the
house.</p>

<p>It may readily be imagined that his wife's terrible and tragic
death proved a crushing blow to Lieut.-Gen. Slark. I found him a
true gentleman of the old school; chivalrous, courteous, high
minded, and full of generous feeling towards all men. He displayed
a natural reluctance to breathe a syllable against his wife, and it
was only by diplomatic and judicious questioning that I induced him
to give me the following particulars.</p>

<p>He had known his wife for some time before he married her; and
though he had conceived a great liking for her, he did not mention
a word of marriage until she was of full age. Then she seemed to
"jump at him," but he soon found he had made a grave mistake. She
was thoughtless, giddy, and young, and accepted him without fully
considering the matter. He was old and staid, and not suited for a
woman of her temperament. She seemed to think that she had an
absolute and perfect right to do as she liked and was unwilling to
recognise, even in an infinitesimal degree, wifely thraldrom.
Whenever the General ventured, no matter in how mild a way, to
remonstrate with her she would become exceedingly angry, and use
galling and harsh expressions to him.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have to confess it," added the General, "but it
was sadly true that she bore me no love. I allowed her as much
freedom as I could, compatible with propriety; but I set my face
strongly against her associating with Mrs. Arkwright, who was not a
fitting companion in any way for my poor wife."</p>

<p>Herein the General showed that his judgment and discrimination
were sound. Mrs Arkwright was a very weak, very silly, and an
indifferent sort of woman. By "an indifferent sort of woman," I
mean that she was frivolous, lacking a proper sense of self
respect, and wholly incapable of viewing anything from a really
serious standpoint. She was content to fritter her life away, and
her regard for her good name was not what it ought to have been.
There is no doubt that she had exercised a good deal of influence
over Mrs. Slark, though perhaps Mrs. Slark was willing enough to be
influenced. But with all my probing and all my searching
investigation I failed to get a scrap of information likely to
serve me in my search for the "Vulture-face man."</p>

<p>I have already remarked that Mrs. Arkwright attached no
importance to the words. She regarded the expression of her dying
friend as due to the delirium of impending death. But not so I.
They had a very distinct significance for me. I ascertained that
Mrs. Slark was in the habit of keeping a subdued gaslight burning
all night. She had a strange nervous dread of being in the dark.
Now, after she had been stabbed she no doubt caught sight of her
slayer, and recognised him; though later, when her friend came to
her she was only able to whisper "The vulture-face man." I lay
particular stress on the fact that she used the definite article,
and that it seemed clearly to indicate that it was somebody she
knew, and whom, owing to certain peculiarities of feature, some
suggestiveness of configuration, she had been in the habit of
thinking or referring to as a "vulture-face man."</p>

<p>I confess that it was a very knotty problem, and yet I did not
despair of finding the solution. Of course I secured the cord with
which the fellow had lowered himself from the balcony, and also the
dagger or stiletto used for the perpetration of the horrible crime.
I have stated that the cord was made of silk. This in itself was a
remarkable incident, the importance of which could not be
overlooked. The silk of which it was composed was a coarse-fibred
material peculiar to some parts of India, where it is used in the
manufacture of shawls and other fabrics of a coarse texture. It
possesses great tenacity, and twisted together in strands it makes
an exceedingly light, flexible, and yet powerful rope. The man who
had used the cord as a means of escaping from the hotel, had no
doubt carried it wrapped round his body which as I put to the test
could easily be done without attracting attention by its bulk.
Another significant fact was that the weapon used for the
commission of the murder was also Indian. It was a weapon such as
one frequently sees on sale in the Bazaars of Delhi, Meerut and
other parts of Upper India. The blades of these weapons being of
native manufacture lack the fineness and temper peculiar to
European steel, and hence the reason, no doubt, that the
vulture-face man's stiletto broke off in the wound he had made in
letting out the life of his victim.</p>

<p>I was now certain that the murder had not been committed by a
native of England; the planning of it, its carrying out, and the
patience, cold-bloodedness, and remarkable cunning displayed
stamped it in my mind as a crime of a foreign order. But of what
order? it will be asked. And to that I answer&mdash;Indian. It
smacked of some of the strange tragedies that occur in our Eastern
possessions, and are not infrequent in connection with the Zenanas.
By that I mean that it is jealousy that prompts. The man who did
the deed must have been concealed in the room some time, as I have
already pointed out. The thick fog and the confusion in the hotel
due to the ball favoured his project. He had tracked his victim,
waited for her with the patience of a wild animal waiting for its
prey, and then slew her out of revenge or jealousy. Now, who was
likely to cherish feelings of revenge or jealousy against a
beautiful woman such as she was, except a flouted, scorned,
disappointed lover? "A woman scorned" it has been said by some one,
is more dangerous than a tigress robbed of her cubs, and my
experience is that there are times when a scorned <i>man</i> is not
less fierce.</p>

<p>My deduction was, therefore, that Mrs. Slark's murderer was a
bitterly disappointed admirer, and that he was a native of India.
That admitted, and the <i>Vulture-face</i> began to lose some of
its mystification as I shall proceed to explain. But first let me
say that I began to make careful enquiries as to whether a black
man or a very dark-complexioned one had been noticed by anyone in
the hotel. These enquiries elicited the fact that a nurse in the
service of a lady staying in the house, was going along the long
corridor in which her mistress's room was situated, when suddenly
like a spectre, a dark man appeared before her, and so startled her
that she nearly screamed out. The corridor being very long and
filled with fog that almost obscured the gas-lights accounted for
her not seeing the man until she was close to him. He uttered no
sound but moved away from her at once, and beyond that he was black
or very dark she could not describe him, nor could she tell where
he went to. Such an impression did the incident make upon her mind
that when she reached her mistress's room she fainted, and on
reviving she declared that she had seen the spectre of a black man
and she was sure it presaged evil. Of course no serious importance
was attached to her statement, beyond that it was considered that
she was suffering from some hallucination due to a bad state of
health. She had been complaining for a considerable time.</p>

<p>From the place where she saw the man in the corridor to the door
of the room that had been occupied by Mrs. Slark would be about
fifteen yards. This information, as will be seen, was another
important link, and tended greatly to strengthen my theory, for I
did not for a moment think that it was a hallucination. What this
woman had seen was a reality. That is, she had met a dark-skinned
man in the passage; and that dark-skinned man was on the track of
his victim whom he subsequently slew. There was another point to be
determined. How did the man find out the room occupied by Mrs.
Slark? In answer to this it seemed to me that he must have watched
her movements from the time she arrived. She had been in London
three days before her death. It was bad weather during all the
time, and there had been many strangers passing in and out of the
hotel, while preparations for the ball were in progress, as the
employment of numerous workmen was necessary. Unusual chances were
thus offered to the criminal to get the desired information. But
there was another way by which he might have got it. Mrs. Slark and
her friend the widow had done a great deal of shopping, and the
things they had purchased were sent to the hotel by various
tradesmen. In sending parcels to guests staying at an hotel it is
customary to put the number of the guest's room on the parcel. It
was possible&mdash;probable, in fact&mdash;that Mrs. Slark's
destroyer had followed the ladies about, had seen the shops they
went to and so had been enabled by that means to learn what he was
anxious to know.</p>

<p>This argument led me to another consideration. Did the murderer
come prepared with the silken cord by which he effected his escape,
or did he provide himself with it after he had ascertained the
position of the room she occupied? I had no hesitation in answering
the latter part of the question in the affirmative. He found out
the room, he noted the balcony, he judged the distance from the
balcony to the ground, and had then bought the cord and had been
out in his calculation of the distance by a few feet, and had thus
been compelled to leave his rope behind him. Had he got it away the
mystery would have been increased manifold, as there would have
been no indication as to how the assassin escaped.</p>

<p>Where did he get the cord from?</p>

<p>It was not easily procurable. There was one house I was
acquainted with in London where they dealt almost exclusively in
Indian goods. From enquiries I learnt that they had made such cord
up for bell ropes in drawing-rooms and other rooms of swell
West-end houses. But there was more than this brought to light. Two
days before the crime they sold several yards of such cord to a man
wearing European clothes including a top hat, but who seemed to be
a Mulatto or a Parsee. He was not dark enough for a Hindoo or a
Mohammedan. He did not state what he wanted the cord for, nor was
he asked. By measurement I found that the cord attached to the
balcony of the hotel corresponded exactly with that sold to the
"Mulatto" or "Parsee."</p>

<p>Putting aside the very remote possibility of a coincidence there
could not be the slightest ground for doubting that the dusky man
who purchased the cord was the same man who slew poor, frail, and
beautiful Mrs. Slark; and he was the vulture-face man of her dying
vision. And now I came to the <i>crux</i> of the whole problem. It
is well known to physiognomists that a person by association may
acquire some particular look or expression. In a work on
physiognomy published at the beginning of the present century, the
case is recorded of a man who for thirty odd years had been the
keeper of the monkeys in a Zoological collection in Germany, and
owing to his being constantly associated with these animals, he had
come to bear a remarkable resemblance to a monkey, and had even
acquired some of their habits. Now the man who I had strong reason
to believe had murdered Mrs. Slark was a dark-skinned man, a
Mulatto or Parsee. I inclined to the Parsee, and for this
reason&mdash;the Parsees belong to India. In India vultures swarm,
and in order to account for the vulture face it was necessary to
associate the man with vultures. How could this be done? Long I
pondered over the problem, and I endured a great mental struggle
before I got a theory. But it came to me at last, and this was
it.</p>

<p>In Bombay are the well known and ghastly Towers of Silence. As
it may be possible that some of my readers may not have heard of
these strange depositories of the dead, I may be permitted to
explain that the Parsees do not bury their dead, but expose them on
gratings on the summits of towers where they are devoured by the
vultures. When a Parsee dies he is borne by his relatives to the
dismal gates of these extraordinary charnel houses, but save the
Keepers of the Towers and the Dead, no one or nothing passes the
portals of mystery. When the corpse has been brought to the gateway
the relatives take their last and farewell look of it, then the
grim keepers receive it and bear it inside, and the gate closes for
ever on the mortal remains.</p>

<p>The keepers then strip the remains off every atom of clothing,
and carry them up the many nights of stone stairs to the gratings,
where hundreds of fierce and hungry vultures are waiting eagerly
for the hideous and revolting feast which begins immediately the
body is left.</p>

<p>The men who perform the solemn and awful duties of
corpse-bearers to the filthy scavenger birds, are grim, silent, and
melancholy-looking beings; and some of them, more impressionable
than others, acquire a look which, with the assistance of a little
imagination, may be described as a vulture-like expression. Was it
possible, I asked myself, that such a man could have forsaken his
strange calling, and have come to England and met the lady who
fascinated him, but who, shrinking from him in horror, fell a prey
to his savage fury? This question was full of suggestiveness, and
it induced me to seek another interview with Lieut.-General Slark,
to ascertain if his wife had ever been in India.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," was the answer, "we left England immediately after
our marriage and went to the East, where we remained nine months.
Four months of the time were passed in Bombay where I had and still
have relatives."</p>

<p>After this information I felt that the tangled skein was being
gradually unravelled, and that the theory I had built up was likely
to prove correct. That theory might be summarised thus:</p>

<p>First&mdash;the murderer was a dark-skinned man!</p>

<p>Second&mdash;The dark-skinned man was a Parsee!</p>

<p>Third&mdash;The Parsee was a native of Bombay!</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;The Parsee had possibly&mdash;probably&mdash;seen
Mrs. Slark in Bombay, and had become dazzled by her radiant
beauty.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;Possibly his calling was that of a "corpse prepare"
in the Towers of Silence.</p>

<p>Sixth&mdash;He followed her to England. He had dogged her
footsteps. He had haunted her. But realizing the utter hopelessness
of his passion he had resolved on killing her, and had carried out
his resolve.</p>

<p>All this may seem highly fantastic to him who reads, but to me
it was probable enough because it was <i>human enough</i>. Strange
men have done strange deeds before now, that could not be gauged or
understood by any ordinary process of commonplace reasoning. The
slaying of Mrs. Slark was a strange deed. It had in it all the
elements of a wild, a nightmare romance; and I was prepared to find
its cause in a maddening and hopeless passion; and its author in
some person whose life had been a wild, romantic dream, and whose
surroundings and associations had been totally different to most
men's. Nor was it in the common haunts that I expected to run down
the assassin, if ever I did run him down. Thus it was that my
reasoning led me to construct the theory I have set forth.</p>

<p>Many weeks passed and the dark crime was still shrouded in the
mystery in which it had first been presented to the public gaze.
Rumours and statements there were, more or less, every day, almost
every hour of every day; but nobody was able to tear the veil of
mystery away; nobody could put his hand on the murderer. From the
moment that he dropped from his silken cord on to the pavement and
fled away into the fog of the gloomy winter's morning, all trace of
him ceased. He had disappeared as effectually as if the solid earth
had opened and swallowed him.</p>

<p>If during this period I remained silent, I did not remain
inactive. I sought for him in possible and impossible places. I
haunted the docks and the neighbourhood of the docks; and the
slums, alleys, and dens, of the East-end of the great Babylon,
searching eagerly for some traces of him I sought. Until at last
there grew upon me an irresistible conviction that he had shaken
the dust of London from his feet and had gone&mdash;whither?</p>

<p>To this question the process of reasoning which I had allowed to
guide me so far would not have been consistent had it failed to
furnish the answer. And what could that answer be but "To the East,
from whence he came?"</p>

<p>Though he bore the brand of Cain, though like the Wandering Jew
he was accursed, what more likely than that in the torture of his
guilty conscience he should be driven back to his weird calling
beneath the burning skies of his native land, whence he had been
lured by the radiance of a beauty which was to him but a
phantasmagoria that begot madness?</p>

<p>Until I had proved my theory true or false I could not cease my
quest, and so one wild wet night I found myself steaming down the
British Channel bound for Alexandria <i>en route</i> to India. The
dark sea was lashed by the turbulence of a mighty wrath; and the
flying spume drenched the vessel that tussled nobly with the giant
wind, and the giant sea, and the rain sobbed in sad and mournful
cadence, until verily it seemed as if the earth was filled with the
moan of wrong, the cry of pain, and the shriek of evil! But in a
few days we were beneath brighter skies, and in the balmy breezes
there was a promise of hope, and a voice that told how fair and
beautiful was the world and all things in it, save man&mdash;the
greatest of God's creations and yet <i>he</i> alone was evil.</p>

<p>Across the burning sands of the desert, by sweltering Aden,
through the torrid Red Sea I held my way until I stood in the
picturesque and grandly situated city of Bombay, the sun-smitten
city washed with an ocean of gold and framed with a setting of
palms.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that I had gone to Bombay without some
definite plan. My object was to put my theory to the practical
test, and this is how I did it. I at once made enquiries in the
proper quarters if any one of the attendants of the Towers of
Silence had been missing, and was informed that a man who had been
for many years engaged there suddenly disappeared some time
previously and no one knew whither he had gone. Recently, however,
he had returned as mysteriously as he went, and his only
explanation was that he had had a vision; he had been lured by a
phantom. It was a vision of an angel he thought, and he believed it
would lead him to Heaven. Instead it had lured him to the brink of
hell, into which he had gazed with unutterable horror. It was noted
since his return he was a prey to a settled gloom, a brooding
melancholy; and so no doubt was entertained that his mind had
become unhinged by the sad duties of his occupation, and he had
been put under restraint by his friends. My next step was to obtain
an interview with this man, and after some difficulty I succeeded
it doing so. The instant I set my eyes upon him I understood how it
was Mrs. Slark bad referred to him as a "vulture-face man," for
there was no longer any doubt that the man I had so long sought I
had found. He had sharp aquiline features, a hooked nose, a
peculiar drawn up formation of mouth, while his eyes were small,
beady, restless, and full of fire. And more than all he had a truly
remarkable way of moving his head from side to side, and following
objects about with his fierce eyes, after the manner of a bird of
prey. I had been previously informed that he spoke English
perfectly, and I thus addressed him: "You have been away."</p>

<p>His eyes glittered as he fixed them on me, and he held his hands
slightly upraised, with the long lithe fingers all stretched out
like a vulture's talons when it swoops to seize. But he made no
answer.</p>

<p>"You have been to England," I continued.</p>

<p>He breathed hard, his nostrils were compressed, his lips
slightly apart. "You were in London," I went on, "and there you
shed the blood of a fellow being, of a beautiful woman who had
never injured you."</p>

<p>He threw his hands up above his head; the fingers still
outstretched; and he uttered an awful shriek that will haunt me to
my dying day.</p>

<p>"She was a fiend," he hissed; "she lured me to destruction."</p>

<p>Then with a sob he pitched forward on to his face and lay
motionless.</p>

<p>I was glad to get away, and I lost no time in seeking advice as
to the course to be pursued under such extraordinary circumstances.
But the next morning a report came that he was dead. He was found
on the steps leading up to the Towers of Silence, and his dead
claw-like fingers, encircled, with the grip of a vice, the neck of
a cobra, which was also dead. The snake had bitten the man in the
throat over the jugular vein, and it was supposed that having
effected his escape from the restraint imposed upon him, he had
procured a cobra and allowed it to bite him, and in his frenzy or
dying agony, he had retained his hold of the venomous reptile, and
his grasp tightened as death approached, so that the life of the
reptile went out with that of the man.</p>

<p>Such was the sequel to the strange and thrilling story of crime
and madness, and the man's end was in keeping with his life and his
deed. The Gods had smitten him, and human vengeance was
forestalled.</p>

<p>From subsequent enquiries I made, it became evident that he
escaped from England immediately after the crime, and reached
France. Then making his way to Marseilles he obtained a passage on
board of a P &amp; O steamer bound for the East, and it was
remembered by those connected with the vessel that during the whole
time he was on board he scarcely ever left his cabin, such food as
he partook of being carried to him by a steward.</p>

<p>The dramatic fitness of his end cannot be gainsaid, and when the
rites of his faith had been performed, his remains were exposed on
the summit of the gloomy tower, and in a few hours not a trace was
left of the Vulture-Face Man.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. A LONG TRAIL</h2>

<p class="first">
DURING a not altogether uneventful career which has embraced
experiences of men and things in all four quarters of the globe, I
have often been struck by the strong resemblance the lives of some
people bear to those of the characters created by the art of the
fiction writer. This is, perhaps, but another way of giving
expression to the well-worn axiom that truth is stranger than
fiction. Indeed, it goes without saying, that he who would write
romance must study real life, for that is the only school where he
can find the types on which to mould the figures of his
imagination. In other words no one can imagine anything that has
not really happened, so long as he confines his flights of
imagination to this terrestrial sphere and not to things human. In
writing these stories I have never lost sight of the fact that one
of the leading functions of a writer is to interest his writers;
therefore I have endeavoured to deal only with such cases as have
seemed to me to possess the elements of interest in a marked
degree. I have tried in my humble way to bring out prominently the
picturesque side to the exclusion of the vulgar. In the story I am
about to tell the points I have urged in the foregoing lines are
clearly set forth. It is a story of human wickedness, vulgar enough
if separated from its picturesque elements, but by retaining these
it is invested with an interest that otherwise would be lacking. To
follow a man across the whole of the North American continent
before the completion of the road which now enables you to journey
from Ocean to Ocean in Something like six days and nights, can
scarcely be regarded as a commonplace incident. But even if it were
the grand and sublime scenery through which the trail led me, and
the adventures sometimes exciting enough, inseparable from such a
journey, cannot by any means be looked upon as commonplace.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of the winter of 1872 that this little
drama opens. It had been a very severe winter, and sickness and
death had laid low a good many distinguished people in various
walks of life. Amongst those who had been seized with a fatal
malady, consequent on the severity of the weather, was an aged
gentleman whom I will designate as Mr. Stansfield Wimple.</p>

<p>This gentleman's career had in many ways been distinguished and
conspicuous. By profession he was a civil engineer, and some very
remarkable monuments of his skill and industry are still in
existence. He had also sat in Parliament for a number of years, and
was one of the most bitter opponents of Mr. Gladstone's proposal to
cede the Ionian Islands. Wimple had been a great deal in the
Islands and had carried out several important engineering works in
Corfu; he therefore was in a position to speak from personal
knowledge of the strategical value of the Islands to Great Britain.
It may be remembered how on one occasion during a debate in the
House on the burning question he twitted Mr. Gladstone with being
willing to sacrifice his patriotism to a mere sentiment, and a very
lively passage at arms ensued. Mr. Wimple stuck to his guns, and he
predicted that if the Islands were ceded it would be a fatal
mistake, and one that England would some day have cause to bitterly
regret. This prophecy is being fulfilled, according to competent
authorities, and the loss of the Islands has weakened our hold on
the Mediterranean very seriously; besides giving Russia a much
freer hand than she could possibly have had if England had been in
command at Corfu.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple was known to be a man of very pronounced views,
singularly pertinacious and unyielding when he had once made up his
mind on any particular subject. It was more than hinted that his
private career had been somewhat of a romance, and that there had
been serious disagreements between him and his family. Some of his
enemies had gone the length of saying spiteful and cruel things
about him, but he treated them with studied reserve and crushed
them with silence. On one occasion only did he allow himself to be
betrayed into a retort. A small-minded political opponent during a
contest, was silly enough to say that "no man whose private life
contains as many dark pages as Mr Wimple's ought to be placed in
any public position of trust and confidence."</p>

<p>This drew from Wimple the stinging reply: "A man who seeks to
advance his interests by a low, vulgar attack on the private
character&mdash;about which he absolutely knows nothing of an
opponent displays so paltry, so mean, so un-English a spirit that
right thinking people who still maintain that an Englishman's house
in his castle, will think twice before placing him in a position of
trust; and I have faith enough in my countrymen to believe that
they will not tolerate a moral assassin who, disdaining the
ordinary rules of fair play, creeps in at the area window of his
opponent's house in order to try and besmirch his character for the
sake of some petty gain, pecuniary or political."</p>

<p>That retort told, and the other man was overwhelmingly defeated
at the poll.</p>

<p>In 1869, Mr. Wimple who had exceeded the allotted span of life
fell a victim to the treachery of the English climate. He had all
his life been an exceptionally healthy and robust man, but now he
was stricken down by that scourge bronchitis, which in his case was
so severe as to leave no hope he would be able to successfully
overcome it. It was while he was lying in this hopeless condition
that his nurse, Maria Tiptree, called upon me with a request that I
would repair at once to Mr. Wimple's residence, as he wished to see
me.</p>

<p>Maria Tiptree was a buxom, well-formed, good-looking woman of
about thirty-five, with a thoughtful intelligent face, and a quiet,
staid, dignified manner. Of course it will be understood that I
knew nothing at all about her. She introduced herself to me.</p>

<p>"I am a professional nurse," she said, "and am nursing Mr.
Stansfield Wimple. My name is Maria Tiptree. I am a widow. My
employer is exceedingly ill and not expected to recover. In fact,
he may die at any moment. I have been driven here in his carriage,
and it is his request that you go back with me. The carriage is
waiting at the door."</p>

<p>"Do you know why he wishes to see me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not. He is a strangely reserved man, and few people, I
imagine, know anything at all about his affairs."</p>

<p>I did not question Mrs. Tiptree further, but announced my
readiness to proceed with her to her employer's residence.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple occupied a very fine house standing in a little more
than an acre of ground on the edge of Wimbledon Common, and thither
we drove as fast as a splendid pair of horses could take us with
safety. During the drive my companion did not talk much; and such
conversation as we held had no reference to Mr. Wimple or the
object of my journey.</p>

<p>On arriving at the "Retreat"&mdash;such was the name of Mr.
Wimple's residence&mdash;there was evidence of some confusion, and
when we entered the great hall, the footman who opened the door to
us said, addressing my companion:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tiptree, the master's dead."</p>

<p>This sudden and abrupt announcement caused the nurse some pain,
for she put one hand to her bosom and the other to her forehead,
while a look of trouble swept across her face. Recovering herself
she asked:</p>

<p>"How long has he been dead?"</p>

<p>"About half an hour. The doctor is here and Mr. Hulton, the
lawyer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiptree asked no further questions, but indicating that I
was to follow her she led me into an anteroom where a bright fire
blazed, and asking me to be seated until she returned she left me.
A quarter of an hour later the door opened and she reappeared in
company with two gentlemen: one a tall, grey-haired, staid looking
man, with the unmistakeable air of a doctor about him. The other
was a short, dark, keen-faced man, carrying a black bag in his hand
such as lawyers generally use. Mrs. Tiptree unceremoniously
introduced them.</p>

<p>"This is Doctor Fisher and Mr. Hulton, the lawyer," she said.
Then she added by way of making me known to them&mdash;"Mr.
Donovan," and having so far performed her duty as she thought, she
retired.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tiptree tells me," began Hulton, "that my late client sent
her up to town in the carriage to bring you here, and this slip of
paper I presume will be for you. The butler who was present says
that his master being suddenly seized with a spasm scribbled this
but was unable to speak, and ten minutes afterwards he died."</p>

<p>As Hulton spoke he handed me the slip of paper alluded to. It
was a half sheet of note on which was written in a shaky, scratchy
hand:</p>

<p>"Donovan&mdash;too late&mdash;I can't last&mdash;will
stolen."</p>

<p>"This seems to me to suggest a very serious business," remarked
the lawyer, "unless you think, doctor, that the dying man was
labouring under some delusion."</p>

<p>"I should be disposed to think not," answered Doctor Fisher
cautiously. "The disease from which he has died frequently
terminates life in that sudden way by producing constriction of the
already half-stopped air passages; but a patient might be in full
possession of all his mental faculties up to within a few minutes
of actual death."</p>

<p>We were interrupted here by the entrance of the butler bearing a
tray, on which were glasses, a decanter of port, another of sherry,
and some biscuits. The doctor solemnly poured himself out half a
glass of sherry and took a biscuit from the box, and having
swallowed the wine and munched his biscuit he said:</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, I don't see that I can be of any further use,
and possibly you would like to discuss your business alone. I will
therefore say good afternoon."</p>

<p>We shook hands and parted; and then as Mr. Hulton leaned back in
his chair and stared thoughtfully at the fire he remarked,
half-musingly:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that unless Wimple was raving there is something
seriously wrong." Then looking up at me he asked: "Were you
informed why Mr. Wimple wished to see you?"</p>

<p>"No, the nurse called and requested me to drive back with her at
once. Not a word was said about the reason for my coming here."</p>

<p>"Umph! It's strange. Well, I received a telegram about an hour
and a half ago at my office in the Temple, requesting me to come
immediately. I got a train down as soon as I could, but arrived too
late. My client had just breathed his last. I inquired for the
nurse but was told she had gone to London in the carriage on
business for Mr. Wimple, but no one seemed to know when she would
be back. Your presence here, when taken in connection with that
slip of paper, is ominous."</p>

<p>"So it would seem. But can you explain what it means?"</p>

<p>"I can make a shrewd guess, and in a little while may be able to
get confirmatory evidence when we can go upstairs to Mr. Wimple's
room." He rang the bell as he spoke, and a manservant appeared.
"Frederick, let us know when we can go upstairs again to the
master's room, will you?"</p>

<p>"I will, Sir," answered the man respectfully, as he
withdrew.</p>

<p>"Did you know Mr. Wimple personally?" asked the lawyer,
addressing me.</p>

<p>I told him that I had no personal acquaintance with his client,
but that I had heard him speak in the House several times, and knew
him as a public man only.</p>

<p>"He was a strange man," continued the lawyer thoughtfully, "and
it strikes me if his private life comes to be looked into it will
present us with as thrilling a romance as novelist ever
penned."</p>

<p>"In what way was he strange?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, he was peculiarly self-willed, for one thing, and so
determined that having made up his mind to do a thing I don't
believe anything short of death would have stopped him. He had
unlimited faith in his own judgment, and though he has been my
client for years he would only allow me to do such business for him
as had to be done in a strictly legal way, and I really know very
little of his private history. He was never in any way disposed to
be confidential."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the servant came back to say that we could go
upstairs at once, and following the lawyer I mounted the
luxuriously-carpeted stairs, to the chamber of death, which had
been set in order; the stilled figure on the bed had been robed in
the cerements of the grave, and covered over with a white sheet.
The room was magnificently furnished, and the bed was heavily hung
with curtains. The lawyer approached, and, drawing down the sheet,
he gazed on the dead face for some moments. Death had smoothed away
the wrinkles, and the deceased looked much younger than he really
was. It was a finely chiselled, a patrician face in fact, but the
formation of the mouth indicated a very determined nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Hulton replaced the sheet&mdash;then crossing the room he
entered a small dressing chamber which had no independent door, and
could only be entered from Mr. Wimple's bedroom. In one corner was
a small iron safe on a stand. Hulton took a bunch of keys from his
pocket, and as he selected one and began to insert it in the lock
of the safe, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I believe there are only two keys to this safe&mdash;one my
client placed in my possession a short time ago in anticipation of
his early death; and the other he kept himself. This is the first
time, however, that ever I have been to the safe."</p>

<p>The door was not opened without some difficulty for the lock was
intricate and complicated; but at last it swung back on its binges
and revealed a number of neatly tied-up bundles of documents,
which, on examination, proved to be for the most part share
certificate and railway scrip, representing a very large sum of
money. Hulton made a thorough search of the safe, and that
completed he said:</p>

<p>"There is no will here, and that slip of paper in your
possession written by the dying man explains why he was in such a
hurry to see you and me. I may tell you that some time ago he drew
up a will in his own handwriting, and by his request I came down
here to read it over and see it properly attested. In it he revoked
all former wills, and with the exception of certain legacies to his
servants, he left the whole of his property to his daughter
Beatrice Mary Staples, for her own free use and enjoyment, and
beyond the control of her husband. That will has gone. It has been
surreptitiously abstracted from the safe. Mr. Wimple must have
discovered its loss just before his death, and hence his reason in
sending in such haste for us. No doubt he wished you to trace the
thief: and he intended to give me some fresh instructions. His
sudden demise has prevented that, and complicated matters
terribly."</p>

<p>Mr Wimple had died a wealthy man, and it can easily be
understood the difficulties that had to be faced in the absence of
a will were very great. There could be no doubt that Mr. Hulton had
read over and seen a will of recent date properly attested, and his
client the testator had told him that any other will he might ever
have made was revoked and cancelled, and the disposal of his
property was to take place according to the provisions of that last
will and testament which, for some inscrutable reason he insisted
on keeping himself together with all his securities in the shape of
scrip. He had given Hulton a key to the safe, merely as a
precautionary measure, and at the same time he had written him a
letter in which he said:</p>

<p>"As soon as you hear of my death you will come down, take
possession of the will, together with all the securities you find
in the safe, a complete list of which is in the hands of my
bankers. I have, as you know, appointed you my sole executor, and
as the provisions of the will are simple enough, your duties will
be relatively slight."</p>

<p>This was plain and straightforward, and if the will had been
there all would have been right. But it was not there, and within a
few days of Mr. Wimple's death being announced another will was
forthcoming, and administration was applied for on behalf of Sarah
Helen Wimple, widow of the deceased; and the Reverend John Ernest
Arkwright, clergyman of the Established Church, and Peter Felsted,
Builder and Contractor, were the trustees and executors named in
the will. This will was dated about seven years previous to the
death of the testator It was in his own handwriting, and was duly
and properly attested.</p>

<p>Here at once we were confronted with a tremendous legal
difficulty; and on the strength of the letter in Mr. Hulton's
possession, and of his sworn evidence, probate was withheld for the
time, and it seemed as if there was likely to be a busy time for
the lawyers. It became necessary to let the light of publicity on
to some of the dead man's private affairs, and just so much as was
made public do I intend to deal with here, and no more.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimple was a member of a very good county family, but in his
youth he had been extremely wild, and contracted a clandestine
marriage with his father's cook. By this person he had two
children; a son and a daughter. The son died young; the daughter
grew up, and married against her father's will a young man named
William Staples, who was a clerk in a firm of Colonial Merchants in
the city of London. There was any amount of evidence to make it
clear that her father was very strongly attached to Beatrice, and
though he had been known to declare that he would disinherit her
owing to her marriage to a man for whom he had an aversion, it was
clear he had relented towards the end; hence his last will in which
he desired that everything should be settled on her for her sole
use and enjoyment. The young lady's mother had died when Beatrice
was a child, and soon afterwards Mr. Wimple married again. This
time his choice fell upon a humble woman who was the caretaker of
and pew opener in a church in one of the southern suburbs of
London. At that time she lived with her brother who was "something
in the building line."</p>

<p>This marriage proved a very unhappy one. Mrs. Wimple was an
ignorant woman and did not understand her husband. She never openly
lived with Mr. Wimple, who established her in a house near
Salisbury. Three children were born of the union. A son and two
daughters. They were all living, and the son, who had studied for
civil engineering, was abroad. His father had long ago disowned
him. Peter Felsted was the brother of Mrs. Wimple, and was in a
large way of business as builder and contractor in the town of
Salisbury He had been started in business by his brother-in-law.
Had failed twice, but had been started again with Mr. Wimple's
money, and at the time of Wimple's death he was apparently
flourishing. The Rev. John Ernest Arkwright was a clergyman in the
parish in which Mrs. Wimple and her brother resided.</p>

<p>From this gentleman we learnt that Mr. Wimple had been in the
habit one time of visiting his wife frequently, and seemed very
friendly with the brother. Latterly, however, he discovered that
his wife had been false to him; and her brother, although seemingly
doing well, was not solvent, and pestered his brother-in-law for
loans of money. These were the causes, no doubt, which prompted
Wimple to revoke the will he had made in the favour of his wife and
her family, and leave everything to his daughter Beatrice. Under
the first will she was to receive an annuity only of four hundred
pounds a year. It appeared that between Beatrice and her stepmother
strong enmity existed.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that in this disunited family there were
many conflicting elements which Mr. Wimple made no efforts to
reconcile. In each case his matrimonial venture had been an
unfortunate one, and even the offsprings of those marriages had not
brought him any joy, although he had always been exceedingly fond
of Beatrice.</p>

<p>There was one other incident in his life which having been made
public, I am at liberty to touch upon. Years before his death he
formed a strong attachment, which developed into passionate love,
for a very beautiful young woman, one of two sisters who lived with
their widowed mother. Their father bad been a distinguished officer
in the Indian Army. He lost his life by assassination while
conducting a surveying expedition in Afghanistan. The youngest
daughter Maude seems to have fascinated Mr. Wimple. She was a woman
of extraordinary beauty and of great accomplishments. Could Wimple
have married her she would not only have adorned his household, but
have been a fitting companion for him. He seems to have behaved
with great munificence to her and her family. He bought the house
in which she and her mother and sister lived, and presented it to
her. For years he had allowed them a thousand pounds a year, and a
short time before his death&mdash;feeling, probably, that it was
inadvisable to mention her in his will&mdash;he gave Maude a cheque
for five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>So much for the private affairs of this remarkable gentleman;
and now for the robbery. The will had been abstracted from the
safe, that was clear. The safe had not been forced, but opened with
the key. But two keys were in existence. One Mr. Wimple himself
always kept, the other was in possession of Mr. Hulton, the lawyer.
Whoever opened the safe must have opened it with one of these two
keys. There was not the slightest reason for supposing that
Hulton's key had been used. Therefore it must have been the one in
Wimple's possession. This decided two important points. Firstly,
the thief knew the will was in the safe. Secondly, he or she must
have known where Mr. Wimple kept the key. This in turn argued that
the thief was a member of the household. Now, who else could
possibly be interested in the abstraction of the will but Mrs.
Wimple and her family? But neither she nor any member of her family
ever went to the house, consequently she must have had a
confederate. So I set to work to try and find out who that
confederate was likely to be.</p>

<p>The nurse, Mrs. Tiptree, was reported to be a very respectable
woman. She had often been to Mr. Wimple's house to nurse him in
trifling illnesses; for he seems to have had an aversion to
strangers about him. About a year before his death he was laid up
for two months through a carriage accident. The horses in his
carriage bolted one day. He attempted to get out: was thrown
heavily to the ground and sustained a slight concussion of the
spine, which necessitated absolute rest for weeks. Mrs. Tiptree
attended to him during that period. On his recovery she went away,
but returned as soon as he was seized with his fatal illness. He,
according to the statement of his housekeeper and other servants,
was much attached to her, and he had been heard to say she was a
most perfect nurse. Owing to the confidence he reposed in her she
was a highly privileged person in the household.</p>

<p>These particulars led me to look upon Mrs. Tiptree with more
than ordinary interest. But there was one little fact which told
greatly in her favour. According to Mr. Hulton, who, though he did
not keep a copy of the will remembered it very well, this woman
under the will that had been stolen was entitled to an immediate
legacy, free of duty, of five hundred pounds, whereas in the will
brought forward by Mrs. Wimple the nurse's name was not mentioned.
Therefore if she had stolen the will she had done herself out of
five hundred pounds. That certainly seemed to negative the theory
that she was the thief. Nevertheless, I did not abandon her, and in
questioning Mr. Hulton I ascertained that the will was drawn up
during the time that Wimple was lying in bed through the injury to
the spine. When the question of attesting it was being discussed
she was in the room, and forgetting for the moment that she was
interested in it, Mr. Wimple said:</p>

<p>"Here, Mrs. Tiptree will do for one of the witnesses."</p>

<p>But the lawyer answered:&mdash;"How can she witness the will
when you are leaving her by its provisions five hundred
pounds?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiptree, of course, heard that remark; consequently she
knew that she was to get something, and on the first blush it
appeared preposterous that she should have gone against her
interests to such an extent as to steal the will.</p>

<p>I have stated that she was a privileged person in the house,
therefore it was not surprising that she occasionally asked some of
her friends to visit her. A fortnight or so before Mr. Wimple's
death, a young man came to see her, and she stated to the
housekeeper that it was her nephew, who had been abroad for some
years and had just come home. He was described as a highly
respectable looking young fellow of about sis or seven-and-twenty.
Altogether he called three or four times. On the last occasion he
stayed till after eleven, and had supper in his aunt's room, which
adjoined Mr. Wimple's. Another detail which I elicited struck me as
having a bearing on the matter. It was this, on the very evening
that the nephew stayed so late, the doctor administered a sleeping
draught to his patient, who had been unable to sleep for two
nights. This was a small matter, but by putting all the items
together and examining them in the light of deductive reasoning, I
came to the conclusion that if I was to solve the mystery I must
find out a good deal about Mrs. Tiptree's past career.</p>

<p>One result of my inquiries was that in the course of the ensuing
month, all unknown to her and to everyone else, save Hulton and one
or two other people whom it was advisable should be informed, I was
on my way to Montreal. My reason for taking this, as it may seem,
extraordinary step, I shall explain presently. My object was to
have an interview with a gentleman named Walter Copeland, who was a
civil engineer by profession. On arriving at Montreal, I found that
Copeland was known there, as he had done some work in connection
with the surveying that was going on for the projected railway
across the continent; and it was believed he had again started with
a surveying party, who had resolved to push on somehow into British
Columbia, and thence down the Pacific slope to Vancouver. Whence,
so it was believed, Copeland intended to sail by the first ship tor
China.</p>

<p>I proved unmistakably that he had really started on his
adventurous journey, and as he was known to be an intrepid and
resolute traveller, there was little doubt expressed that he would
go on. He had got a long start of me, but it was necessary I should
overtake him before he was enabled to leave for the East. I tracked
him down to Toronto, where I found that he and his party had
chartered a small steamer to convey them to Port Arthur, at the
head of lake Superior. By this means they saved the long land
journey from Ottawa; and that part of the proposed route had been
pretty well surveyed. If was the country beyond that; over the
prairies and through the Rockies, that the engineers were anxious
to get information about, for if was practically a <i>terra
incognita</i>.</p>

<p>I had to kick my heels for several days at Toronto, before I
secured a passage in a tug boat going up Lake Superior to engage in
the lumber towing trade. For the benefit of my readers who may not
understand this term, I would explain that lumber means timber. In
the great forests round the head of Lake Superior the trees are cut
down, stripped of their branches, then tossed into the Lake, where
enormous rafts are constructed. These rafts are then taken in tow
by tugs, which convey them to points of shipment.</p>

<p>The tug in which I embarked was known as the <i>Algoma</i>, and
a most uncomfortable craft she was. In Lake Huron we nearly came to
grief in a hurricane; and after passing the rapids at Sault Ste
Marie, and getting into Lake Superior, we experienced a series of
such heavy gales that we had frequently to run for shelter into
some desolate creek or bay, and on one occasion we were driven on
shore at a small island, fortunately without injuring the vessel to
any great extent. And when the engineers had patched her up we
started once more on our adventurous voyage, and after a few more
trifling mishaps we reached our destination in Thunder Bay, the
voyage having occupied a fortnight. This Bay is as wild and
magnificent as anything to be found in America almost. At that time
all round its shores was one great wilderness of primeval forest,
with here and there a lumber station. Now the Canadian Pacific line
which skirts it has caused busy towns to spring up, and factories
and huge grain elevators are to be seen everywhere.</p>

<p>An engineer's camp had been formed at Fort William (now one of
the railway stations), and also a trading camp. I ascertained that
Copeland and his companions had stayed a few days in that camp, and
had then started forward for the frontier outpost of Winnipeg. I
therefore had no alternative but to follow him. It was a long
trail, but what could I do? Purchasing two good horses, and a pack
horse, together with proper clothing, provisions, a tent, a rifle,
revolvers, a good supply of ammunition, and a small light birch
bark canoe, all these things being carried on the packhorse, and
engaging the services of a white trapper known as "Buck Jump Joe,"
and two Indian guides, I set off in pursuit of my man. Soon after
leaving the head of the lake we plunged into the forest wilderness,
and for days and days we travelled through desolate regions where
hundreds of lonely lakes, big and little, stretched out in a
seemingly endless chain. As the Indians knew the route well we were
never at fault; and of fresh provisions we had ample, for Buck Jump
Joe and the guides were adepts at trapping game and fish.
Traversing the wide valley of Red River we reached the desolate
station of Winnepeg, where I ascertained that Copeland and his
party had left a fortnight before.</p>

<p>Winnepeg, at this date, was one of the outposts of the Hudson
Bay Fur Trading Company, now&mdash;and I speak from personal
experience, for I visited the place a year ago&mdash;it is a huge
town with colossal hotels, splendid shops, big warehouses, and a
junction for ever so many great lines of railway; besides being one
of the principal stations of the Canadian Pacific. Its rapid rise
from a lonely frontier post to a stupendous commercial and
industrial centre is truly marvellous. But such is progress in
modern America. To-day there is a wind-swept prairie, to-morrow the
prairie is covered with towns. When I followed Copeland across the
continent tens of thousands of buffaloes roamed the plains. To-day
nothing but huge piles of whitening bones show where the animals'
haunts were. Not a single buffalo now exists. It is sad, but we
live in a practical age. In the race for wealth sentiment is
brushed on one side, and the beauty of nature is nothing as
compared with the beauty of money. The wild free life of our
forefathers in America, Australia, Africa, and elsewhere will soon
be but a tradition.</p>

<p>To reach the Rocky Mountains from Winnepeg there is a journey of
about twelve hundred miles over the rolling prairies. Having
refitted, laid in an ample stock of provisions, engaged the
services of three additional Indians, and appointed Buck Jump Joe
to "boss" the travelling arrangements, I set off once more.
Fortunately the weather was all that could be desired&mdash;neither
too hot nor too cold&mdash;and we were able to make long daily
marches.</p>

<p>It was monotonous work, that prairie travelling, and thankful
indeed I was when at last we came in sight of the foot hills of the
Rockies. In a rough, preliminary way, some of the railway route had
been marked out by the pioneers, and we were able to follow this
until the stupendous scenery of the Rockies themselves burst upon
us. These tremendous barriers of mountains for a time baffled the
engineers. They could bring their line easy enough all the way from
Montreal to the mountains: but to take it over the mountains was
the difficulty. For years exploring parties had been at work trying
to find a suitable passage, but in my time no route had yet been
fixed upon. It had been suggested that the course of the Bow River
should be followed, and some of the hardy adventurers had gone that
way. The Indians said they could lead us by a better route, but
Buck Jump Joe was in favour of the Bow as being more practical for
our horses. For two days we remained in our camp, and Joe and the
Indians hunted, supplying our larder with plenty of fresh
provisions, including wild sheep and bear's meat.</p>

<p>On the second day a little band of prospectors, who had been in
the mountains and were returning east, came upon us and, for the
time, we made merry; for when men meet in these lonely wildernesses
there is no formal introduction needed. They fraternize at once.
The prospectors told us that a three days' journey up the Bow was a
surveying camp, and that a parry had recently arrived from the
east, and were resting there. From the description given me I had
no difficulty in determining that it was the party with which
Copeland was travelling. So the next day when our friends left us I
struck camp, resolved to push on with all speed and overtake my
man. I was fortunate in being able to do this. He and his
companions had lingered, as they could not agree on the route they
should take through the stern regions of snow-clad and ice-bound
mountains, belted about as they were by stupendous forests, the
undisturbed homes and haunts of the bear and the wild goat and
sheep.</p>

<p>Of course I did not then make myself known to Copeland, and we
were heartily welcomed as brother travellers in those untrodden
regions and vast solitudes. I found him a good-looking young
fellow, reckless and rollicking, and full of the daring and
enthusiasm of the explorer. As I could not arrest him and convey
him back as a prisoner over the two thousand miles of journey
already traversed, there was nothing for it but to join issues with
his party and endeavour to reach Vancouver. On the fifth day we all
moved off by common consent, and by intricate and most difficult
travelling, during which we had to run no small amount of peril, we
at last struck the great Columbia River, and then the chain of the
Rockies was behind us. But a still greater chain confronted us in
the Selkirks, a mighty barrier of unexplored peaks as virgin from
the tread of man as they were when the world was created. Language
seems poor indeed when one attempts to describe such scenery as
that which everywhere surrounded us. The awful height, the
stupendous depths, the mighty river, the limitless forests of giant
trees, the glittering snows and glaciers, the appalling precipices,
all made up a panorama to which no language could do justice. My
Indians now proved invaluable With rare instinct and wonderful
topographical knowledge they led us over the Selkirks by an
extraordinary pass&mdash;not that now used by the railway, being
twenty miles at least to the north of it&mdash;and when after weeks
of roughing and hardships, with hair-breadth escapes by flood and
field, we had conquered the Selkirks, we made our way down into the
Great Fraser Valley; through which the turbulent River Fraser
forces its way to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>I need not dwell upon the incidents of our journey through
British Columbia. We were a worn and somewhat dilapidated party
now. Buck Jump Joe left us and went off to join a gold prospecting
party. We had lost one of our Indians through an accident, he fell
over a precipice; and one of the white men had died of disease.
Before finally descending the Pacific slope we had to cross a
lesser range of mountains, called the Gold Range; but though their
peaks are covered with eternal snow they are pierced by many
practicable and well-known passes, which have long been used by
miners and hunters coming up from the Pacific shores into British
Columbia. The worst part of our journey, therefore, was over, and
after nearly nine months of exciting travel we reached
Vancouver&mdash;then a straggling port, with rows of wooden houses
built amongst the forest that fringed the bay Anyone who visits the
place now will find a handsome town, wide streets, tram cars,
electric light, busy wharves and quays, huge hotels, and all the
requirements of modern life.</p>

<p>Our party secured accommodation in a so-called hotel kept by a
Chinaman. It bore the high sounding and pretentious name of "The
Grand Pacific Hotel." It was a wooden shanty of the roughest kind,
but after our long wanderings we were thankful for the shelter it
afforded us, and which, by comparison with what we had gone
through, seemed a luxury.</p>

<p>And now the time has come when I may tell the reader why I
followed Copeland over such a long trail. My suspicions having been
aroused with reference to Mrs. Tiptree, I procured her marriage
certificate and found that her maiden name had been Felsted. It
will be remembered that Mrs. Wimple's maiden name was Felsted; I
therefore felt convinced there was something more than a
coincidence here, and pushing my researches deeper and deeper I
brought to light that Mrs. Tiptree was Mrs. Wimple's sister. But
this was not all. Walter "Copeland" whose name was not Copeland at
all but Wimple, and therefore true enough it was he was Mrs.
Tiptree's nephew He had been an exceedingly wild youth, long
disowned by his father. When he was only seventeen he had
contracted a marriage with a ballet girl who was four or five years
his senior. He was then only an apprentice in a firm of civil
engineers in Westminster. After two years of a cat and dog life he
and his wife separated; he went out to Canada, and for good and
substantial reasons, no doubt, he felt it desirable to change his
name, and he took that of Copeland, though a little later his wife
killed herself with drink.</p>

<p>Without making known any discovery to Mrs. Tiptree, I asked her
if she did not think it probable young "Copeland" had stolen the
will, and her answer was:</p>

<p>"If any will has been stolen he must have taken it. Though why
he should have done such a thing heaven only knows. I don't."</p>

<p>I did not doubt that heaven knew; and from the data I had massed
together I felt I could make a pretty shrewd guess as to why he had
done it, so I resolved to follow him and get from his own lips, if
possible, a confession which would serve at least to invalidate the
will in Mrs. Wimple's possession. It is, of course, not difficult
to deduce from the fore going particulars that Mrs. Tiptree must
have had some patent motive for aiding and betting young Wimple in
abstracting the will, because by so doing she sacrificed an
immediate payment of five hundred pounds. The opinion I had formed
of her was that she was by no means a bad-minded or bad-hearted
woman. She had led so far as I could ascertain, an honest and
respectable life, and in disposition she was gentle and kindly. But
she was not a woman of any strength of mind, and I was of opinion
she was likely to be swayed and influenced by sentiment, and in
this instance she had been so swayed by her sister, no doubt by
specious arguments&mdash;Mrs. Tiptree having previously informed
her about the new will and legacy she was to inherit&mdash;and
false representations had induced her to steal the last will on the
promise and understanding that she should be paid a much larger
sum.</p>

<p>Young Wimple, or Copeland as we will call him, had just come
home. He had not seen his father for years, and none of the
servants in the "Retreat" knew him. These considerations led Mrs.
Tiptree to regard him as a suitable person for working out the
little plot; for she thought her share of the wrong would be
reduced to the shadow of nothing, if she did not actually take the
will away with her own hands. This, of course, was a mere juggling
with conscience, but a tyro in the study of human nature will know
how common that sort of thing is amongst a certain class of
people.</p>

<p>To illustrate this I will cite a murder case in which I was
interested some years ago. A man, a discharged soldier, was
indicted with being an accessory to the fact, inasmuch that he,
being a caretaker in the house where the crime was committed,
placed facilities in the way of the principal actor, whereby he was
enabled to commit the deed. The accessory swore and vowed he was an
innocent man and when he was sentenced to penal servitude for life
he created a remarkable scene in court by solemnly declaring with
dramatic passion in the name of the Almighty, that he was falsely
condemned. Subsequently he actually drew up a statement and
submitted it to the Home Secretary, in which he still averred his
innocence, and in order to prove it he said all he had done was to
leave the door of the house open, in consequence of which the
murderer was enabled to get in. In spite of this fact the accessory
could not see where his moral guilt came in. Nor could many
hundreds of other people, for a petition numerously signed was
prepared by some of the lower classes, and forwarded to the Home
Office, praying for the fellow's release on the grounds of his
innocence. The belief in his own innocence took such a hold upon
him that he became a maniac and he subsequently died raving mad in
the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Many such cases might be
brought forward to give point to my argument, but this one must
suffice; for to the scoffer and the sceptic I would say if one
ounce of solid truth will not convince you, a ton of argument would
be of no more avail.</p>

<p>To return to Copeland. The opinion I had formed of him during
the time I had been with him was that he was in a certain way
clever; and beyond doubt daring and adventurous; but singularly
thoughtless. He lacked the calculating qualities of the scientific
mind. He did things from some sudden impulse and never paused to
consider what the consequences might be. This characteristic was
displayed in his daily life in a very conspicuous way. Here is an
example. During the time we were travelling through the Rockies it
was necessary on one occasion to cross a swollen river. The birch
bark canoe was launched and by some stupidity was allowed to drift
away before anyone could get into it; without a moment's reflection
and dressed as he was, young Copeland sprang into the river, and
would of a certainty have been drowned had not one of the Indians
nobly plunged in after him and brought him ashore again.</p>

<p>During our journey I had cultivated his acquaintance so closely
that he showed great attachment for me; consequently as "a
travelling chum" there was nothing out of the way when I asked him
on our arrival at Vancouver if he would share a room with me. To
this he gladly consented, and so unconsciously played into my
hands. On the second night after our arrival as we smoked our pipes
sitting on the edge of our respective beds I suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Walter Wimple I have something serious to say to you." The
mention of his name so amazed and startled him that the pipe fell
from his lips and he caught it in his hands, a shower of sparks
shooting forth by the jerk, while his face went deathly pale.</p>

<p>"How do you know my name is Wimple?" he stammered, the concern
he felt displaying itself in the expression of his eyes.</p>

<p>I smiled as I answered:</p>

<p>"I know a good deal about you and your family; including your
aunt Tiptree and your late father. I came out to Canada to find
you. I overtook you at the Rockies, and here we are. Can you now
guess what my errand is?"</p>

<p>He fumbled with his pipe, and I saw his eyes wander to the table
where our revolvers lay. The instinct of self-preservation,
quickened in his face by the wild adventurous life he had led,
prompted him for the moment probably to attempt to settle matters
in the rough and ready fashion in vogue amongst the lumber men and
half civilized miners of the Western Wilderness. I rose, went to
the tables, took the weapons up, and said:</p>

<p>"No, Walter, my boy, you mustn't try to get rid of one wrong by
committing a greater."</p>

<p>"I had no thought of that," he growled somewhat sullenly. "But,
I suppose, the fact is you've trailed me on account of the will
business."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "that is so."</p>

<p>"Well, you must blame my aunt and mother for it."</p>

<p>"I believe that. I believe they made a tool of you."</p>

<p>"They did," he exclaimed, brightening up a little. "My aunt told
me my father had no business to keep my mother and the family out
of their rights, and that if I took the will nobody would be any
the wiser. As I had no great love for the old man&mdash;for I never
thought he had treated us well&mdash;I consented."</p>

<p>"Did you make anything out of the transaction?"</p>

<p>"Some. My uncle Felsted gave me five hundred pounds on condition
that I cleared out of the country at once."</p>

<p>"And of course you gave up the stolen will, or destroyed it, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sirree!" he exclaimed with a little triumphant laugh. "I
wasn't such a blamed fool as that. I thought that some day it might
be useful to me."</p>

<p>"Where is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>He hesitated for some moments. Then said, as he puffed at his
pipe:</p>

<p>"Look here, pard,"&mdash;he had picked up a good deal of the
American back-woods phraseology in his travels&mdash;"Look here,
pard, will you promise not to jump my claim if I give you the
paper."</p>

<p>"I can make no conditions," I answered. "You had better leave
the matter in my hands; but you <i>must</i> give me the will."</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of the bed for some time, dangling his legs;
smoking vigorously and staring vacantly. He was turning the matter
over in his own mind, and I did not interrupt him. Presently he
jumped up and going to the corner of the room where his things were
rolled up in cowhide and water-proof&mdash;the mode of transporting
one's personal effects in travelling through the
wilderness&mdash;he spread the bundle out, and from the centre he
drew a flat leather writing-case. This he opened and from a number
of papers and letters, he produced the will and a carte-de-visite
photograph.</p>

<p>"There's the darned will," he said, thrusting it into my hands.
"And do you see that picture?"&mdash;The photograph was that of an
exceedingly pretty girl, and I noticed by the imprint it had been
taken in Hong-Kong&mdash;"I'm going to marry her. She will be my
second wife. My first was a demon. That girl lives in Hong-Kong
with her dad, who keeps a store there. Now, you see, I'm playing
fair with you, and you mustn't give me away. I'm bound for
Hong-Kong, that's my game, and she's expecting me. And if you were
to come between me and her, pard, I might do something violent,
see!"</p>

<p>I could not help smiling at his rough and blunt manner no less
than at his threat. And as I secured the will in my pocket-book
which I placed in a body-belt I wore and in which I carried my
money and other valuables, I remarked looking at the photo, "She's
a very pretty girl, and if ever you are married I hope she will
make you a good wife and you will make her a good husband. But
there must be no conditions now. We'll talk the matter over
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Give us your hand on that," he said, "and don't play low."</p>

<p>I shook hands with him, and a few minutes later the candle was
blown out and we were both in bed. Soon he was locked in sound
sleep, and snoring like a trooper; but I lay awake for hours,
pondering over the strange drama in which I had played my part.
Daylight had dawned before I fell asleep and I did not awake for
hours afterwards. Then I noted that my companion's bed was vacant,
and his traps had been removed from the room. When I went down and
made inquiries about Copeland I was informed he had taken a passage
for Hong Kong in a trading steamer that had cleared three hours
ago. I frankly confess that I was not sorry, for I was relieved of
a difficulty. And though he had rendered himself liable to
punishment I had no warrant and no instructions to convey him back
to England.</p>

<p>In a few days I got passage in a steamer going down to San
Francisco. Then I took the long dreary railway journey to New-York
and came home in the <i>Helvetia</i>, one of the National Company's
steamers.</p>

<p>During my absence Mr. Hulton had succeeded in getting Mr.
Wimple's affairs thrown into Chancery, and when I arrived on the
scene with the last will and testament of the deceased there
was&mdash;as may be imagined&mdash;consternation amongst those who
had conspired to frustrate his intentions. During the time that had
elapsed one of the conspirators had died, namely Felsted, Mrs.
Wimple's brother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wimple escaped conviction, owing to the lack of necessary
legal evidence to establish her guilt; and Mrs. Tiptree who was
more fool than knave got off with the light punishment of twelve
months imprisonment. As for Copeland nothing, more was heard of
him; nor did the authorities show any concern to have him arrested.
There is no doubt, however, if he had returned to England he would
have found himself in the clutches of the law. He was by no means a
bad sort of fellow and I hope he married his girl and lived happy
ever after. For the part I had played I received a handsome
recognition at the hands of Mrs. Beatrice Staples; while as for the
numerous lawyers mixed up in the case; it goes without saying they
had some choice pickings. But all is well that ends well.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. THE WORLD OF WHITE DEATH</h2>

<p class="first">
IT was towards the end of boreal March, when a certain balminess
in the air, and a brightness in the sun gave promise and hope that
the last of an unusually bitter winter had come, and genial spring,
with her vernal breath, would soon awaken the flowers to life, and
bring forth the buds on the naked trees which had so long been
buffeted and tempest-tossed by icy gales and fierce snowstorms,
that Henry Tyler Twort fled from London. For years there had been
no more familiar name to Londoners than that of Tyler Twort. It was
uncommon and striking, even as the man himself was. And seldom was
there any movement in the cause of charity in which his name did
not figure conspicuously. He was a fine art patron, a dabbler in
literature; a giver of good dinners; a <i>bon-vivant</i>; moreover
he was also the head of the important firm of Twort and Co.,
general merchants in the City of London. Apart from that he sat in
Parliament for a Midland borough where he owned a considerable
estate. He had been for many years a very prominent politician; and
being gifted with the power of eloquence allied to a commanding and
imposing presence, his light was not hidden under a bushel, but
shone forth into many a dark place where the hearts of his humbler
brethren were gladdened thereby. For Henry Tyler Twort posed as a
friend of the poor, and he really had been instrumental in
effecting numerous reforms in the interests of those who were
unable to help themselves or make their feeble voices heard. So
apart from being merchant prince, politician, charity giver,
church-goer, art patron, litterateur, <i>bon-vivant</i>, he was
also a philanthropist; men sang his praises; women blessed him.</p>

<p>All this being as I have stated, how came it, will be asked,
that so excellent a man fled? For does not flight imply some evil
done? Otherwise why should a person flee? He may fly before a
roaring lion in jungle or desert; before a prairie fire sweeping
over the plain, or before an advancing flood which threatens a
deluge. In such a connection flight is understandable; but when a
prominent citizen who has hitherto been regarded with respect and
honour, disappears suddenly from his haunts taking with him a large
amount of valuable property, the inference is he has offended the
mighty majesty of the Law, and that Justice demands that he should
be brought back. But in order to make it clear why Tyler Twort
fled, some particulars of his life are necessary.</p>

<p>He was the son of a city merchant who, however, never rose to
any distinction either as a trader or as a citizen. But no one
breathed a word against his good name, and he managed to bring up a
family of six children, including Henry Tyler&mdash;his eldest
son&mdash;respectably and well. Dying when he had played his part
and fulfilled his destiny, he left each of his children a few
hundreds a year, and in addition Henry succeeded to the business.
As a youth he had shown himself to be ambitious&mdash;even vain; as
a young man he desired to be foremost in the ranks. He wanted to go
ahead as the bell-wether rather than be lost amidst the crowding
and hurrying flock of human sheep.</p>

<p>These are traits in a man's character which, when allied to a
well-balanced mind, and a high regard for ethical purity, are
calculated to help him to reach the pinnacle of fame, or at least
to earn the good will of his fellow-beings. In all probability
Henry launched himself on his career with the best of intentions.
He set to work to build up a big commercial fabric; his work was
crowned with success, and at an age when most men are still
struggling against the stream, he was accounted wealthy. Had he
been less ambitious, less vain&mdash;vanity, perhaps, was his
strongest weakness&mdash;he might have carved his name indelibly in
the hearts of his fellow-men, and have lived for ages in the public
memory.</p>

<p>When his business was flourishing he essayed to consolidate it
still more, by taking in as partners various members of his family,
including his brothers and a sister, who invested their little
capital, and trusted to their brilliant and gifted brother, to
guide them&mdash;if not to El-Dorado, at least to something like a
competency.</p>

<p>He married before he was thirty. The lady of his choice brought
him no dowry beyond a handsome face, which in her case was a
fortune. When they had been married for some years and no children
had come to bless their union, they took under their care
Gwendoline Silva, the orphan daughter of a Portuguese father and an
English mother. Twort and Silva had been firm and intimate friends
for many years, for Silva had early come to England. He represented
an old and noble Portuguese family who for many generations had
been settled in Lisbon or its neighbourhood, and were the owners of
enormous vineyards, the products of which found their way to nearly
all the civilized parts of the world. Silva was the London
representative, but unhappily he died young. He had been left a
widower four years previously, when his English wife yielded up her
own life in giving life to her daughter. Therefore at her father's
death Gwendoline was but four years of age, and being heiress to a
large fortune Silva made his old and esteemed friend her guardian
and trustee. For about twelve years or thereabouts Mrs. Twort was a
loving and affectionate mother to the girl, but death removed her
after a brief illness, and Gwendoline was in the sole care of her
foster-father.</p>

<p>For a long time Mr. Twort had been occupying a luxurious mansion
near Hyde Park where he lived in almost regal splendour. His house
was the gathering place for some of the most notable of the
prominent men and women of the day. Theology, science, art,
literature, politics, the press, the stage, the world of trade were
represented at those hospitable receptions. And Twort, the
Politician, the Philanthropist the Trader, was as a king upon his
throne around which gathered a multitude of admiring subjects ever
ready to render him homage, and shout his praises.</p>

<p>Gwendoline was noted for her beauty; many a young man turned to
her with longing gaze, for apart, from the charms that Nature had
endowed her with, it was said that when she came of age she would
be able to count her fortune by scores of thousands. Her guardian
and foster-father, however, guarded her well, and with a keen-eyed
jealousy that kept at bay any who might have been actuated by
unworthy motives.</p>

<p>After his wife's death Mr. Twort seemed to become more
ostentatious in his mode and style of living. Humility and
lowliness certainly formed no part of his composition. He was
evidently a man who loved to hear the praises of his fellows
ringing in his ear; to be distinguished, to have homage paid to
him, to be considered great&mdash;were the things he aimed at, and
weak, pitiably weak as it was, it certainly would have been
tolerated and perhaps forgiven had his heart remained sound, his
mind pure. But the form of weakness he displayed was beyond all
doubt a form of madness; as much madness as the miser's greed for
gold, the lust of the <i>roué</i>, or the ambition of a Napoleon
the Great. He was very human; he dreamed human dreams of greatness;
and such a man would, if he could, make the sun, the moon, the
stars, the flowing tides, the bursting buds, the wanton winds,
subservient to him. It is a perilous ambition, but men in all ages
have endeavoured to pose as demi-gods. Alas it is sad indeed that
the little span of human life&mdash;the inappreciable drop in the
mighty ocean of eternity should be turned to such poor account. And
yet perhaps even such a being may be fulfilling some great destiny
in the working out of the incomprehensible human scheme. Who can
tell!</p>

<p>Between three and four years after his wife's death Tyler Twort
fled, and with him went his foster-daughter. She was then about
twenty and he was fifty or turned. And with his flight his
greatness fell with a crash, so to speak, and crumbled into the
dust; while the sycophants who had worshipped him looked on aghast
at the rottenness of the fabric which they had considered so solid,
so genuine. For years he had propped this fabric up with tinsel
instead of gold. His greatness was the greatness of a blown bladder
which being pricked, shrivelled into nothingness. To drop the
metaphor, his life for long had been a living lie; he had been
insolvent for years; and not only had he shamelessly pledged the
credit and ruined the firm which he represented, but he had
fraudulently appropriated his ward's fortune to his own selfish
ends.</p>

<p>Many and many a day had been swept into the ocean of the past
since there had been such an expose, such a scandal. Mrs. Grundy
wrung her hands in dumb anguish; the meek-faced parsons, the
aesthetic artists, the whole brotherhood of literary men, the
pure-souled representatives of the drama, the lamb-like lights of
the press, the whole world of Fashion and Frivolity moaned and wept
in chorus:</p>

<p>"'Who'd have thought it?' 'It was so shocking.' 'So
unexpected.'</p>

<p>"Such faith had been placed in him." The world does not like to
be deceived; and it had been deceived. It had believed Henry Tyler
Twort to be Virtue incarnate, whereas he was a vulgar swindler, a
heartless thief. Then there swooped down upon the belongings he had
left behind an army of creditors, and terrible was the wailing,
loud the gnashing of teeth when stretching forth their greedy hands
they clutched not fruit but ashes.</p>

<p>"Where had he gone to?" asked the world in clamouring chorus.
"What power did he exercise to induce his ward to accompany him in
his guilty flight?"</p>

<p>The latter question was easy to answer. It was the basilisk
power that men have ever exercised over the weak and susceptible
natures of women. For woman is trusting and confiding, and in man's
heart sits a devil.</p>

<p>If Society has no pity for the woman who parts with the jewel of
her womanhood, the Law has none for the man who has outraged his
trusteeship. And so Justice said: "This man must be sought for; he
must be hunted down; he must be hauled in chains before me that I
may smite him hip and thigh and break him on the wheel."</p>

<p>The duty of hunting him down fell to my lot. A warrant was
issued for his arrest, and I was entrusted with its execution. A
little inquiry soon revealed to me, that sudden as the collapse
seemed, he had long been preparing for his flight. He had gradually
realized all the securities he could, and with a cunning which no
one would have given him credit for, he had opened accounts at
various banks; so that when his schemes were ripe he could withdraw
his money without attracting that attention which he would have
done, if he had placed all in the keeping of one bank and suddenly
taken that all out. His ward's property he had made ducks and
drakes of and had squandered thousands of her fortune.</p>

<p>Not for one single instant did I think he would remain in any
part of the United Kingdom; nor was it in the least degree likely
that he would proceed to any British possession. But in what
direction had he bent his fugitive steps? By comparing notes and
studying detail I came to the conclusion that he had left London by
night, alone and with little or no luggage. Some days before, his
ward had gone to Southampton&mdash;so it was understood&mdash;to
spend a few days with some friends, though nobody could be found
who knew what friends they were. She had taken a remarkably large
quantity of luggage with her, most of which she had packed herself,
not allowing her maid or any of the other servants to interfere.
That in itself was significant. It clearly indicated a guilty
knowledge. Now, why had she gone to Southampton?&mdash;I
established pretty conclusively that she really had gone
there&mdash;It must have been with a view to getting a vessel for
some foreign port. From Southampton steamers sailed for the
Brazils, the West Indies, Australia, America, Africa, and for
France. To my mind it would have been doing violence to the most
ordinary intelligence to suppose she had gone alone, wherever she
had gone to. Tavort had joined her, but where? I considered that it
was not likely he did so in Southampton; and my reason for so
considering was this: He was a conspicuous man, and unless he had
resorted to the common trick of disguise, he could hardly have
hoped to have escaped observation had he attempted to leave in
company with a young lady. I argued with myself against the theory
of disguise, because if he had entered any place as Tyler Twort,
and issued forth as somebody else, information to that effect would
surely have been forthcoming, unless of course he had paid somebody
handsomely to keep silent. But having regard to the character of
the man, his vanity, his remarkable shrewdness, I did not think it
likely he had adopted a disguise. He who for years had cozened the
world, and juggled with society, would, even in his fall, have
sufficient faith in himself to believe he could still delude.
Again, by taking a third person into his secret who had no interest
in him beyond an immediate monetary reward, would be to increase
his risk manifold, and he was far too clever to forget that.</p>

<p>These were my reasons for dismissing the theory of disguise. So
I was forced to the conclusion that he had not joined Gwendoline
Silva in Southampton or in any part of England, but that they had
fixed a rendezvous abroad. To have gone to the West Indies or in
fact to any British possession would have been to run into the jaws
of the lion. To the Brazils? Gwendoline would have had to have
travelled there alone unless he had joined her at the post of
embarkation, Southampton being the last port touched at. But from
Southampton to some point of France she might have travelled and
travelled alone, and he going by another route had met her there.
At Havre perhaps. At Bordeaux likely.</p>

<p>On this hypothesis I set to work. Perhaps it will here be asked,
"What would be his object in going to France?" To that question I
can only suggest an answer. It must be remembered that I was guided
entirely by hypothetical reasoning, based upon the knowledge I had
acquired of the man's habits and his disposition. I would urge
again the seeming unlikelihood that a person of his intelligence
would rush off to a British possession where his arrest would be
certain, and having, no doubt, an acquaintance with the principles
of international law, he would also avoid those countries where
extradition treaties were in force; and probably his intention in
going to Bordeaux was because it was an excellent <i>point du
départ</i> for Spain, and he would be able to hurry through France
before the hue and cry had spread to that country. I have already
given my reason for supposing it unlikely that he had left England
in company with the young lady She had unquestionably gone to
Southampton. That I established conclusively Now unless she had
doubled back on her tracks and rejoined him in England she would
leave Southampton alone. It will be said that the fugitives might
have sailed to America. True, they might; but in that case Twort
would have had to go to the Hampshire port himself if he wished to
voyage with the lady, because the vessels trading from Southampton
to America did not touch anywhere else in England. But most
carefully conducted inquiries failed to elicit any fact which would
seem to point to his having been in Southampton.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen I was forced to the only really logical
conclusion to be arrived at, which was, that the fugitives in order
to render the tracing of them more difficult, had arranged that she
should start first for Southampton, carrying the luggage with her:
then that she should proceed from there to the nearest convenient
point of meeting abroad. If their objective point was Spain, they
would be able to reach that country before I could overtake them,
unless they lingered by the way At any rate I started in pursuit,
going direct to Havre; for failing to get information about them
there, I could reach Bordeaux much quicker by train than I could by
steamer from England. Necessarily on reaching Havre I directed my
attention to the custom-house. The season being still winter, few
passengers were travelling, so that I had a better chance. My
supposition turned out to be correct. A lady had arrived, a few
days before, by the Southampton steamer. She was young, handsome,
and possessed an unusual quantity of luggage. She was joined at the
station by a gentleman; good-looking, well-dressed, middle-aged,
with whiskers and hair turning grey. He had been staying for two
days at the Hotel Frascati. As soon as their luggage was cleared
they proceeded at once to Paris. I followed, and traced them from
the Gare du Nord to an hotel close to the Paris, Lyons, and
Mediterranean Railway Station, where they spent the night, and
proceeded the following day to Geneva. This was a little puzzling.
Why had they taken tickets for Geneva? It was a roundabout way to
get to Spain. Perhaps it was a ruse to throw their pursuers off the
scent. Anyway they had certainly purchased tickets for Geneva, and
their luggage was registered to that place. In Geneva they stayed
at the Hotel Beau Ilivage, and the next day went on to Chur in the
Canton des Grisons. The porter at the hotel registered their
luggage for them to Chur so there was no mistake. I travelled on to
Chur as fast as the train would take me. I arrived in the midst of
a blinding snow-storm. It had been snowing for days, and the
capital of the Grisons was buried in snow; while the great
mountains that surround the town were hidden from sight, being
shrouded by the mists and the swirling snow. With the exception of
<i>auberges</i> and inns such as are patronized by ordinary
commercial travellers, only one hotel was opened, namely the
Steinbeck. I happened to be personally acquainted with the manager
of this house, Herr Gredig. Naturally he was surprised to see me.
He said that with the exception of two or three German and Italian
commercials of the better class he had had no travellers for weeks
save a lady and a gentleman on their way to Italy. The manager had
ascertained from the gossips, for Chur is a small place and news
soon travels, that the gentleman&mdash;who had registered his name
in the hotel books as Mr. John Evelyn of Liverpool&mdash;had had an
interview with Herr Weltdig, the manager of the Orisons bank, and
the object of the interview was this. Tyler Twort&mdash;who called
himself in the hotel John Evelyn&mdash;had purchased a shooting
villa in the neighbouring mountains, four years before. He had only
visited tin; villa twice since he purchased it; and the object in
seeing the bank manager was to place the deeds of the properly
which were valuable, in his hands, and get an advance of money. At
the same time he gave Kerr Weltdig a written authorization to
dispose of the villa and grounds at the first convenient
opportunity.</p>

<p>Twort's reason for visiting Switzerland was now fully explained.
He wanted to realize every penny he could lay his hands on, and not
caring to sacrifice that Swiss property, he had run the risk
necessitated by a journey to Switzerland in order that he might add
to his store of money.</p>

<p>Having completed his business in Chur Mr. Twort, accompanied by
his foster-daughter, had left the day previous to my arrival in a
private carriage with a view to crossing the Splügen pass and so
making his way into Italy He had been urged to delay his starting,
owing to the terrible weather; but he insisted that very urgent
business necessitated his pushing forward, and go he must. At first
he had had some difficulty in getting a conveyance, and only
succeeded in doing so on his offering a considerable increase on
the usual terms. On account of the depth of snow the carriage had
to go on sleigh runners, and the party left Chur about midday, the
vehicle being drawn by two powerful horses. And he hoped to reach
Thusis at the entrance to the Via Mala the same night, and pass the
night there.</p>

<p>My plans were at once taken. I went to the head of the police;
presented my credentials; showed him the warrant of arrest which I
held, and asked for his assistance. He tried to persuade me that,
having regard to the terrible weather, and the danger of the route
owing to the snow, it was inadvisable to follow the fugitives for
the present; but he said he would telegraph forward for Twort to be
detained. Twort, however, had got a good start, and might already
have reached Italian ground. I therefore resolved, let the risk be
what it might, to start off at once; and after much bargaining and
haggling I procured a two horse sleigh, which being much lighter
than the one used by Twort gave me a decided advantage, and I hoped
to overtake him. I was accompanied by two stalwart
<i>gendarmes</i>, though I had had very great difficulty indeed in
prevailing upon the chief to allow any of his men to accompany me.
Your Swiss official&mdash;as everyone knows who has ever had
anything to do with him&mdash;is a pig-headed, self-opinionated
donkey, who will puff his cigarette smoke into your face, and argue
himself hoarse in trying to prove that you are a fool, and he
wisdom incarnate. There may be Swiss officials, who do not do this,
but I have never met them, and yet I spent some years of my life in
Switzerland, a country which for natural beauty and grandeur of
scenery is hard to beat.</p>

<p>On leaving Chur it seemed as if the elements had combined to
thwart me, and not a few people predicted that my party would come
to grief. The air was darkened with snow; the wind howled like a
roaring lion; the cold was intense. Nevertheless I resolved on
taking the journey, for I thought that what Twort and his ward
could do I could do; and yet I was not indifferent to the fact that
to travel over Swiss passes in such weather was a proceeding
fraught with great personal discomfort, and not an inconsiderable
amount of risk.</p>

<p>The distance from Chur to Thusis is about twelve miles, and the
road all but quite level. Under ordinary circumstances it is
pleasant enough. Pastures and mountains border the road on each
side; and the brawling Hinter Rhein tears its way alone, now
through open meadows, anon hidden from sight in some deep gorge, or
howling with fury against some mighty barrier of rock which impedes
its straight course. In summer the air is fragrant with hay, and
sight is gratified by the blaze of colour which the wild flowers
make, and the other senses are lulled by the repose, and the dreamy
tinkling of the cowbells on the mountain sides. But in winter and
during a snow-storm such as that I had to encounter, the journey is
one to be remembered. So heavily had it snowed that the road was
completely obliterated, and it was with the greatest difficulty we
made any progress at all. Three or four times the sleigh
overturned, owing to the horses floundering in some ditch; and when
the darkness closed upon us it verily seemed as if we were doomed
to pass the dreary hours of night in the howling wilderness of
trackless snow. Thanks, however, to the instinct of the horses and
the care of our driver, we managed to reach Thusis between ten and
eleven; but we were almost more dead than alive with cold and
hunger.</p>

<p>When I had thawed myself out before the hot stove in the
dining-room of the comfortable little Rhätia hotel, I made
inquiries about the fugitives, and ascertained, to my intense
disgust, that after a short stay to change horses, they had pushed
on to Splügen, the little village situated not far from the summit
of the wild and terrible pass. Splügen is twenty miles from Thusis.
In summer the route is sublime in its grandeur; in winter it is
awful in its desolation and danger. Twort had started with four
horses, and had promised the driver and conductor a hundred francs
a-piece if they reached Splügen that night. No Swiss could resist
such a temptation as that though his life was at stake, so the
party had gone forward. My companions said that our course was to
telegraph on and request that Twort and his foster-daughter might
be detained at the customhouse on the frontier some few miles from
Splügen. But there were two very substantial reasons why we could
not do this. The first was the post office was closed and the
official in charge was no doubt snoring in his bed. The second was,
all telegraphic communication with Italy had ceased some hours ago,
owing to the snow-storm and hurricane having broken down the wires.
For us to have attempted to continue the journey then would have
been to court certain death. And as a matter of fact if I had been
disposed to risk it myself I should not have got a living soul to
have accompanied me. Under the circumstances there was nothing for
it but to wait till daylight, and so I made a good supper, and
enveloped in blankets soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>When daylight dawned the snow had ceased to fall; but the sky
was like lead; the air numbingly cold. We were told that the road
through the pas was absolutely impracticable owing to avalanches,
and that there was every sign of a renewal of the storm in a short
time. Although the weather was so bad on the Swiss side of the
Alps, it was highly probable that it was fine on the Italian side.
That was the case more frequently than not, and vice versa. The
consequence was the birds would escape me. My <i>gendarmes</i>,
however, refused to go on further. I urged, insisted, pleaded. It
was all no use. They said they had no orders to go beyond Thusis. I
resolved, however, not to be beaten; and by offering a heavy bribe
I secured a sleigh and the services of two men, and with three
horses driven tandem-wise we left the village followed by the jeers
and evil prophecies of the gaping natives who had assembled to see
us off. When we entered the gloomy Via Mala I confess to certain
misgivings; for the horses sometimes plunged up to the breast in
snow, and there was not a trace of the road to be seen, while
hideous precipices were marked with deadly white cornices, and on
the overhanging rocks above our heads, stupendous masses of snow
were poised, and wanted but a breath, a vibration, to bring them
thundering down and utterly annihilating us. With muffled sounds
came the groaning of the river as it rushed through its rocky bed;
otherwise all was still&mdash;the stillness of frozen death.
Terrible work indeed it was! And the narrow escapes we had of going
over the precipices, or of being hurled to destruction by the
avalanches, were little short of miraculous. Over and over again
did my companions plead to me to remain in one or the other of the
refuge stations; or seek shelter in some of the tiny villages <i>en
route</i>, several of which seemed absolutely buried out of sight
by the snow. But I was inflexible. I told them I had made a
contract and they must carry it out, or they would have no pay. So
sullenly they would go on again, and the horses laboured and
struggled to the point of absolute exhaustion. Fortunately we were
enabled to effect two changes of our steeds; namely at Zillis and
at Andeer.</p>

<p>So difficult had been the journey that it took us six hours to
reach Splügen. This village which is magnificently situated is
4,782 feet above the level of the sea, but in winter it is half
buried. The weather there had been fairly fine that morning and
there had been fitful gleams of sunshine. Twort and his companion
had spent the night there, and when I arrived they had started on
the continuation of their journey about two hours before. They had
been advised that it was doubtful if the summit of the pass could
be reached, owing to the snow, bat that on the other side of the
Alps fine weather prevailed. Having refreshed myself and my men,
and procured fresh horses we pushed on.</p>

<p>Immediately on leaving the village the road crosses the Rhine by
means of a narrow bridge, and then commences to ascend steeply
through the pine forests. So deep was the snow, so steep the ascent
that it really seemed as if our attempt to proceed would have to be
abandoned. Moreover snow began to fall lightly again. I could not
bring myself, however, to give the order to turn, and so we held
our way. Presently we reached a tunnel, and passing through this we
swept round a curve, and opened out a scene so wild, weird and
desolate that I will try to describe it.</p>

<p>This part of the route is a tremendous basin shut in on all
sides by riven and splintered mountains, which rise to an enormous
height. Not a tree or shrub is to be seen. The floor of the basin
is piled up with millions of tons of <i>débris</i>, which fall from
the surrounding precipices. It is a wrecked world in summer, the
silence only broken by the rushing torrents, and the weird
whistling of the lonely marmots. In the winter it is a world of
white death, and many a traveller has perished there from cold,
hunger, and fatigue. Looking at it from the position where we were
it seemed as if there was no outlet from this valley of desolation:
but as a matter of fact the road descends to the bottom of the
basin; then runs level for a quarter of a mile about, and emerges
by a series of precipitous zig-zags to the summit of the pass,
which is nearly 7,000 feet above the sea level.</p>

<p>As we gazed down into the terrible waste, so ghastly in its
whiteness, so deathlike in its unbroken silence, we noted on the
other side, looking like a toy, the sleigh we were pursuing. It was
a closed sleigh, and the top was piled with the fugitives' luggage.
Four horses were struggling to drag the heavy vehicle along; and
though a considerable distance lay between us it seemed now as if
we should overtake them before they could reach the frontier post
on the summit. If they succeeded in doing that they might yet
baffle me: for the officials at the Dogana, or Italian
custom-house, would probably refuse to take upon themselves the
responsibility of detaining the travellers. I therefore urged my
driver to push on with all speed, and down the descent we plunged;
then floundered forward through the drifted snow.</p>

<p>Through the snow-laden atmosphere I was enabled to discern the
other vehicle, looking dim and ghostly as it toiled up the steep.
Then suddenly if seemed as if between it and us a curtain had been
dropped. A tremendous blast of air struck us and almost turned us
over; and a muffling roar and a rumbling fell upon our ears. My
driver crossed himself, and murmured, dolefully:</p>

<p>"Lawine! Lawine!" (Avalanche, avalanche.)</p>

<p>The horses with the instinct of Alpine horses, which have a
great dread of avalanches, stopped dead, and neighed piteously. It
was some time before the air cleared sufficiently for us to see
ahead again. We had not been touched, but the sleigh we had been
pursuing was nowhere to be seen. It had been in the track of the
avalanche, and its occupants, the horses, the driver had been
hurled to destruction, and buried completely out of sight in that
world of white death. We looked at each other in mute anguish; then
my driver said:</p>

<p>"It is useless going on."</p>

<p>I knew what he meant; but I thought it possible we might yet be
able to render some aid, and told him so. He knew those dread
regions better than I did, however, and shook his head ominously
and sorrowfully. Nevertheless I told him to urge the horses
forward, and this he did until further progress was barred by
enormous, piled-up masses of newly fallen snow. No living thing
save ourselves could be seen; not a sound was to be heard. I
confess that my heart almost turned to stone as I realized the
catastrophe. I descended from my vehicle still thinking that
something might be done, but alas it was useless. The glare of the
snow blinded me. Before us was the compacted avalanche; around us
treacherous wastes of snow. It was absolutely impossible to go
forward. There was nothing for it but to retrace our steps. With
sorrowful hearts we rove back to Splügen where we reported the
circumstance. Everyone in that lonely mountain village knew by
awful experience how useless it would be to attempt then to save
the lives of the ill-starred travellers, buried as they were
beneath tons and tons of snow. Death would strike them with
terrible swiftness; the blast which is driven before a falling
avalanche would sweep them at once into eternity; and then the
avalanche itself would bury them deep, deep beneath its awful
weight. For days I waited, but nothing was found. A road was cut
through the avalanche for vehicles to pass; but it was not until
the bright sunshine and warm winds of some weeks later had melted
the snow that the bodies were brought to light.</p>

<p>Twort and his beautiful companion; the driver and his mate,
together with the horses were huddled together; all frozen in stony
death. They had been hurled over a precipice, and had fallen in a
heap. It was a terrible and totally unlooked for retribution that
had overtaken the fugitives, and I confess to a feeling of profound
sorrow.</p>

<p>Twort and Gwendoline were buried in one grave in the little
churchyard of Splügen; and on the plain slab of marble which marks
their resting-place the passing traveller may read the simple
inscription in English:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">SACRED TO THE MEMORY<br>
of<br>
TYLER TWORT AND GWENDOLINE SILVA<br>
OF LONDON.<br>
<br>
WHO WERE KILLED BY THE FALL OF AN AVALANCHE<BR>
NEAR THE SUMMIT OF THE SPLÜGEN PASS.<br>
<br>
"BEHOLD IT IS COME AND IT IS DONE, SAITH THE LORD."<BR>
"YOUR LIFE IS EVEN AS A VAPOUR THAT APPEARETH."</p>

<p><br>
From certain papers found amongst his luggage there was reason
to believe it was Mr. Twort's intention to ultimately make his way
to Mexico; and he was proceeding to Genoa with a view to getting a
vessel there when death overtook him on the wild Alpine Pass.</p>
