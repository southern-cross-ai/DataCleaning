<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">
THIS was April, 1868, with the combination work-passenger train
running up the valley of the Lodgepole toward Cheyenne.</p>

<p>More or less surrounded by the necessary junk that belonged to
his job, Frank Peace sat with his long legs across the opposite
seat and watched April's premature dusk slowly fill the desert's
empty horizon. Spring broke late this year, for a gusty wind boiled
against the car sides and the air scouring down the aisle laid its
raw edge against him. Out in the bleak foreground a band of
antelope rushed up from a coulee, scudding away into the farther
darkness; a window behind Peace squalled open and the man sitting
there pumped seven quick shots from his Spencer fruitlessly into
that bitten plain and slammed the window down again.</p>

<p>Fresher cold flowed along the car. They were cracking it up at
forty miles, through a suddenly condensed night. The trucks of this
car chattered a little and Frank Peace's body registered the sudden
bite of a curve with a professional interest. Idle as he was, he
could never divorce himself from this care; it had been so all the
way from Omaha, his ears and eyes attentive to tangent and curve,
to the rhythm of the wheels on the rail joints, to the flow of the
train along a grade scooped up from the desert only a year before.
At Hillsdale Station it was thoroughly dark, the lights of the
station making a yellow shine on the squad of Soldiers drawn up
along the platform. In the moment they stood to his view he saw
their stolid faces whipped red by the wind; and then the train ran
on, the engine's halloo roping back through the rush of weather.
Conductor Paddy Miles came by.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Stop at Archer, Paddy."</p>

<p>"Sure, Mister Peace," said Paddy Miles and went on down the
aisle, his broad shoulders pressing aside the men restlessly
congesting it. For this April was the beginning of another
construction season. The Union Pacific's steel rails, racing 240
miles across Nebraska from North Platte the year before, had
stopped eight thousand feet high in the snowy jaws of Sherman
Summit, beyond Cheyenne. But this was spring again and ten thousand
men of all degrees and kinds&mdash;graders, steel layers, bridge
builders, gamblers, freighters, gunmen, ex-soldiers, tradesmen,
mule skinners, cowhands, doctors and lawyers,
politicians&mdash;were bound back in one great tidal wave to
Cheyenne and to the end of track beyond Cheyenne for another
turbulent, wicked year. Young and old, worker and drone, reputable
and disreputable&mdash;the five passenger coaches of this train
were crowded with them.</p>

<p>Looking them over with a candid eye, Frank Peace saw one common
thing that held them together&mdash;a buoyancy, a high vigor that
sang in their voices and turned their muscles impatient. He had it
himself, a restlessness that made fifteen hours on the train most
intolerable. The lamplight of the car diffused itself feebly
through an air turned blue by the fumes of small-stemmed clay pipes
clutched doggedly between Irish jaws. All faces were ruddy and all
talk had the one major overtone; which was that tuneful and tenor
lilt of Erin. Some of these men were fresh from the old sod; the
rest of them were veterans of the shovel and, before that, soldiers
under Grant. In their cowhide boots and formless store suits and
round-brimmed hats they made a rough show, but Peace knew them well
and understood that these were the kind of men who would stand the
bitter blast of winter and the merciless heat of sun and alkali
better than any other breed. They would curse and complain and
fight, but they would work until work was done; and they would turn
from shovel to the stacked guns beside them and stand fast when the
Sioux and the Cheyenne and the Arapahoe raided the track. He liked
them because he had fought with them and against them&mdash;and
never had found them soft.</p>

<p>And then his eyes turned to another part of the car and he was
again puzzled, as he had been all the way from Omaha, to see the
girl with the yellow hair and softly smiling face placed opposite
Big Sid Campeaux.</p>

<p>There were two women in this car, but of the one who sat down
near the pot-bellied stove and seemed so cold and demure and
frightened he had no illusions. For her name was Rose, and wherever
the end of track would be there she would be.</p>

<p>It was the other girl he could not understand. She seemed to
know Big Sid, which was part of the puzzle, since Big Sid was no
man to hide his talents. At each successive end of track
town&mdash;north Platte, Julesburg, Sidney and Cheyenne&mdash;it
was Big Sid's huge tent saloon that trapped a large part of the
restless construction man's pay check. They burned for a while,
these towns, like a crimson fire against a shocked prairie, and
then the rails hurried on and they died and a new camp was born;
yet as fast as the rails hurried, Big Sid was there at the vanguard
with his saloon to meet the first engine chuffing with its load of
Paddies. More than that, it was Big Sid who represented the crooks
and desperadoes and gamblers clinging so relentlessly to the flanks
of the road as it pressed on. When Big Sid spoke he spoke for all
of them. A huge man, gray and bland of cheek, soft-spoken and well
dressed, he sat quietly with the girl and showed her a marked
courtesy.</p>

<p>She wasn't, Peace decided, Campeaux's kind of a woman. There was
a breeding about her, a pride in the lines of her features. She had
put her fashionable wrap aside somewhere on the trip and now wore a
long, blue military overcoat buttoned against the chill of the car.
Above its collar Frank Peace had an incomplete view of yellow,
well-combed hair, of cheeks very smooth and tinted pink by a
vitality that strongly impressed itself upon him. The sense of an
inward smiling was there for him, and the sense of a gallantry
somewhat rare in a woman was there too&mdash;on rather long lips
and in the clear hazel of her eyes.</p>

<p>She felt his glance; for her head came up and her eyes met his
with a moment's steadiness. Campeaux jerked his big round cheeks
about and showed Peace a strict civility&mdash;nothing else. The
engine's long whistling fled by in gusty waves and there was a
sudden break in the train's smooth running as it slackened for
Archer Station. Peace untangled his legs from the gear piled around
him and hoisted his long, flat frame one section at a time, as tall
men learn to do in crowded spaces, and started down the aisle. He
had to press the milling Irishmen aside. He did it without much
ceremony, but he grinned a little as he made his way. There was a
short chunk of a man in front of him who looked up&mdash;and
grinned back; a Welshman all over and a scrappy bridge foreman with
the devil in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Bully, me boy," he said. "This is the year we beat the Central
into Ogden."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Peace. But he knew how to handle these men and so
he added: "We'll get there if you can keep your bridges built ahead
of the steel. The steel gang has a better foreman, Barney."</p>

<p>"The hell it has!" yelled Barney, "I can lick any black Irish
steel layer in this world!"</p>

<p>The rivalry of these men was a keen, violent thing. A long
Hibernian yell rocked along the car and a brawling voice called:
"Where the jasus is that boy?"</p>

<p>Peace's grin grew longer and thinner, for the feel of this
reckless, headlong fighting crowd ran through him and set up a like
recklessness. He pushed his way to the end of the car where a
blackened gallon coffeepot sat simmering on the stove. He got a cup
and poured himself a jot of this stiff drink&mdash;strong enough to
float a track bolt&mdash;and drank it; he stood there a moment with
his face tipped down in a scowling pattern. Afterward he found a
second cup. He filled both. He worked his way across to the frail
Rose sitting so obscurely inside her closewrapped coat.</p>

<p>He said: "You look cold, Rose," gently, and watched her eyes
lift and cling to him.</p>

<p>She took the cup, but held it still&mdash;a faint shred of color
coming into her face, softening its stony expression. There was
something about the girl he never understood&mdash;and failed to
understand now; for in her was a faint grace that made him remember
his manners.</p>

<p>She said, in a slow, murmuring breath: "Thank you," and looked
down at the cup. There was a break in her reserve, a letting down
of that hard wall she showed the men of this car; he saw it and
turned away, not wishing to see more.</p>

<p>He said, "Gangway, you pick-and-shovel experts," and balanced
the remaining cup above him.</p>

<p>The packed Irishmen in the aisle were hard to stir, and he put
his free arm out without any ceremony and hauled them aside, and
came to Big Sid Campeaux's section. The girl there had been
watching him, measuring him in a manner that was straight and swift
and without a smile. The pride in her was like steel; she had a
breeding that in some way put him on the defensive. It seemed to
him she kept him this way a long enough time before she smiled and
accepted the coffee cup.</p>

<p>"It is very fhoughtful of you, Mr. Peace," she told him
calmly.</p>

<p>"Maybe," he answered. "And maybe not." He looked over to Big Sid
Campeaux who made a taciturn third party to this scene. The car
pitched more slowly along the rails and somebody said, "Here's
Archer, where Hills got killed last November." Then he drawled:
"How are you, Sid?"</p>

<p>"Glad to see you again, Peace," grunted Campeaux. "Been in Omaha
all winter?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;just a month." Peace's glance whipped again to the
girl. She had lifted the coffee cup to her lips, and her glance
came over its rim to him, alert and interested and faintly amused.
She had a quality, he thought swiftly, that struck him with a
definite impact. Raw and rough as this surrounding scene was, it
seemed to please her, it seemed to put a sparkle into the round
hazel surfaces of her eyes. The restlessness of all these men and
the shouldering of the desert wind outside seemed to appeal to a
sense of adventure in her. The lightness of her hair shed a remote
cameo glow across the smooth surface of her cheeks. She had a
resolute chin, and her lips were longer than he had first noticed,
and caught now in a smile, He didn't look at Campeaux but he spoke
to the man with a real impatience. "Your manners, Sid, are
rotten."</p>

<p>The train had come to a full stop and the car was swirling with
that high and emphatic Hibernian talk. "When did you get the habit
of expectin' help from me?" retorted Campeaux.</p>

<p>Peace stared deliberately at the man. The indolence went out of
him and his lips made a straight line. "That's right," he suggested
quietly.</p>

<p>There wasn't any expression on Campeaux's bland, gray-freckled
cheeks. The big man had power in him, and it made him soft and
noncommittal with his talk. A great diamond on one of his heavy
fingers caught the smoky car light and threw back a brittle blue
brilliance; and the sense of hostility between them was impossible
to prevent. A little of that deep and resentful feeling got into
Campeaux's eyes then and pulled his eyelids more closely
together.</p>

<p>The motion of a man's shoulders in the seat behind Campeaux
diverted Frank Peace's attention, and he saw Mitch Dollarhide
slowly rise from a half-sprawled position and bend forward to catch
his talk. Mitch's ragged mustache edged his mouth; the brim of his
hat came well down over his eyes. It was a secretiveness and a
shadowing in keeping with his ways, for he was Big Sid Campeaux's
creature, walking always behind Campeaux like a well-trained brute.
He watched Peace solemnly.</p>

<p>The train had been halted this while; and presently Paddy Miles
thrust his way down the aisle with a sheet of flimsy telegraph
paper in his hand for Peace. He said:</p>

<p>"Don't hold us up any longer than you can help, Mr. Peace. We're
late into Cheyenne now."</p>

<p>Peace bowed at the girl and turned away. He had his look at the
message; he took his time reading it, long legs braced across the
aisle.</p>

<p>Barney, the Welshman, was speaking in his hearty way:</p>

<p>"And you will recall it was here we had to stop the engines last
July when the buffalo went across."</p>

<p>Peace said: "Go ahead, Paddy," and returned to his seat.</p>

<p>The engine sent out its two short blasts; cold air poured down
the aisle again and all the shifting men wheeled as the car jerked
forward. Peace settled his long legs between his luggage and
smoothed out the telegram:</p>

<p class="telegram">make no plans for cheyenne tonight. reed.</p>

<p>Nan Normandy had a slanting profile view of Peace then.
Unobserved, she could let her eyes speculate. If she never saw this
man again, she told herself, she knew at least one thing about him:
He had little respect for barriers and he had a reckless temper. It
was there to be seen in the stubborn and slightly uneven lines of
his cheeks, He sat indolent across the seats, with his wide, flat
chest in repose; yet there was, she surmised, not the least repose
in him. His hair was ink-black, his eyes a smoky gray; and his
fists were hard. In one way he was elementary in his actions, for
he had wanted to speak to her and had found a quick way of doing
it. But he had done another thing, too, which lifted her interest
enormously. He had stopped on the way to give the other cup of
coffee to the girl sitting at the end of the car&mdash;a girl whose
place in life was easily enough read. He had smiled at the girl
with a sudden softening of his face. Men liked him, for all during
this trip she had seen these unruly Irishmen stop and have a word
with him; and she had seen his grin make a quick, rash streak
across his face.</p>

<p>She turned to Campeaux so suddenly that she caught his heavy,
studying look. "What did you say he did on the railroad?"</p>

<p>"His title," said Campeaux, "is assistant superintendent of
construction. Under Reed, who is superintendent, and under General
Dodge, the chief engineer." Campeaux let it ride like that a
moment, afterward adding: "You'll be likely to find him wherever
there happens to be a fight. Dodge and Reed use him to fix up
trouble. Any kind of trouble."</p>

<p>"He's young," mused Nan Normandy.</p>

<p>"Twenty-six, I guess."</p>

<p>"And very hard," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes," Watching Campeaux, she observed his face grow heavy. The
hatred between the two was something that couldn't be hidden. Yet
it was equally clear to her that Campeaux held a deep respect for
Peace. For he said later:</p>

<p>"He's got four years of the rebellion behind him, a year of
Indian fighting, and a year of this job. You get hard fast in this
country. Or you don't stay."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Though it is not pleasant to remember."</p>

<p>Campeaux permitted himself a thin smile. "You'll hear him
referred to as the man who tamed Julesburg."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Just a story."</p>

<p>She still had her eyes on Peace, watching that black head roll
to the motion of the car. He was relaxed, and he had forgotten her,
but there was a scowling line across his forehead and he had his
eyes on the yellow message. The Irishmen in the aisle were
beginning to boil again, dragging their belongings from beneath the
seats.</p>

<p>Carnpeaux spoke. "Practically to Cheyenne&mdash;and seven
o'clock."</p>

<p>"The Magic City of the Plains," murmured Nan.</p>

<p>Campeaux bent forward. "You'll like the country."</p>

<p>"I expect to."</p>

<p>He rolled his big body back against the seat. "It's for
gamblers. You're a gambler."</p>

<p>"In my own way&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Campeaux had a trick of lifting his heavy lids when he was
interested&mdash;as he did now. Considering the round, cold
inexpressiveness of that glance, Nan Normandy felt her guard go up.
But a moment later Campeaux's attitude became indifferent. His
hands, thick and soft, lay idle across his legs.</p>

<p>He said: "I want to help you."</p>

<p>Nan Normandy's shoulders lifted. But she didn't speak.</p>

<p>Paddy Miles yelled down the aisle: "Cheyenne!"</p>

<p>All the Irishmen were crowding toward the car doors and an
enormous confusion began to rack the narrow space. They were
laughing, and the long hours on the train had dammed up a wildness
that was about to burst through. In a quick half glance she saw
Frank Peace gather up his plunder and join this crush. He had not
looked at her again&mdash;he had forgotten her entirely, she
thought one man wheeled to say something to Peace and she noted his
swift grin return. The train stopped. Beyond the fogged window she
saw the lights of Cheyenne shining down a strange, raw street.</p>

<p>Campeaux said, "Mitch," without turning his head, and a great
creature rose from the seat behind Campeaux. Nan hadn't noticed him
before. He had a mustache shaped thinly like a crescent across his
flat lips and a pair of muddy eyes set up a little flash under the
brim of his hat. He came around and stood obediently in the aisle.
His face was very dark, his features blunt to the point of
brutality. "Take those things, Mitch," added Campeaux, and
rose.</p>

<p>The aisle was emptied and Nan preceded Campeaux along it to the
platform. A harsh wind struck her in the face. Lanterns flashed
along the station runway and many men roved the adjoining mud
calling out other men's names. In all those voices was something
eager and high-pitched and gay. Coming down the steps uncertainly
she stopped to wait for Campeaux.</p>

<p>Frank Peace's voice said, behind her: "Any way I can help
you?"</p>

<p>It turned her around. He stood there in the frosty glitter of
the weaving lantern lights. His head bent toward her. She observed
then the pale scar running across his left temple. There were two
other men in the background, obviously waiting for him.</p>

<p>Somewhere a man's leather lungs kept yelling at the disembarked
Irishmen. "Come over to the Club saloon, you faro sports, and give
us a bet! Come over&mdash;come over!"</p>

<p>A near-by gun was being fired unevenly into the turbulent night,
its reports stretched thin by the gusty, bitter wind. The other
girl on the train slipped down the steps and for a moment her white
face tipped to Peace. It was something Nan could not help
seeing&mdash;that strained, somber expression. Then she vanished in
the churning confusion.</p>

<p>Nan said: "You have been nice&mdash;and thank you. Mr. Campeaux
has offered to help me."</p>

<p>The change of his eyes astonished her. They darkened
immeasurably and showed disbelief. It was as though he had stepped
through a gate and closed it between them. She did not know why,
and the moment hurt her. Campeaux came on, speaking bluntly at
Peace.</p>

<p>"There's a few things, friend Frank, you ought to stay out
of."</p>

<p>Peace said briefly, "I suppose so." He turned on his heel and
joined the other two men waiting there. All of them shouldered
through the crowd. Something had definitely happened here, oddly
depressing her. Campeaux's man, Mitch, got his abnormally long arms
around all the luggage and stood patiently by.</p>

<p>"You will want to have a bite to eat," said Campeaux. "The
proper place is the Rollins House. Go on, Mitch, go on." He gave
his arm to Nan and they drifted slowly with the crowd. There was a
man standing by the line of cars, looking on&mdash;a short man with
very wide shoulders and a gray head. Something amused him and he
turned around, impelled to talk. There was only a stranger from the
train at hand&mdash;another Irishman with an emerald greenness of
the isle still thick about him. But the short one laughed with a
long amusement.</p>

<p>"You see that? That bully boy with the high-coupled
hips&mdash;that was Frank Peace, the man who wrecked Julesburg. And
him a-talkin' to the girl when Big Sid Campeaux steps up to take
her away. Now that was a thing. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Callahan&mdash;and where do I shleep?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the small man scornfully, "why should you be wantin'
to sleep? Listen to me, Callahan. I'm Collie Moynihan. Campeaux
took the girl from under Frank's nose&mdash;a rare sight and one
you'll nawt be likely to see repeated, When you buy a drink or
dance with the girls or try your luck at monte it is likely
Campeaux's pocket you'll be linin', It was so in Julesburg where
Campeaux and his gamblin' devils thought to dispute the word of the
railroad's marshal there. And so Peace drops back with a few of us
chosen ones, Callahan&mdash;a few of us railroad boys. We kill and
we cure and we leave fifteen of those bad ones to christen a new
graveyard, which Julesburg was a-needin', And here now Campeaux
takes this girl from bucko Frank. A rare sight."</p>

<p>"And why," said Callahan, very prompt in his answer, "did we not
shtep up there and show this Campeaux the evil of his way?"</p>

<p>Collie Moynihan slid one finger along his nose and
laughed&mdash;a long, cheerful laugh.</p>

<p>"If you're ableatin' at me&mdash;" suggested Callahan
softly.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of time, me green one, for fightin'. Indade
there is. An' you'll nawt be a much oulder man when it comes to
you. Come with me to the commissary shack."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">
THE three of them&mdash;Leach Overmile, Phil Morgan and
Peace&mdash;shouldered into the crowd, skirting the fresh
pine-boarded buildings of the railroad offices, turning around the
vast piles of steel and ties and boxed supplies waiting here to be
thrown forward to the end of track. Engines were backing down the
sidings, rattling up the long strings of cars. Men were working
near by on a new shed, with a huge bonfire to guide their hammers
and their saws. A recent rain had turned Cheyenne's main street to
a churned and beaten and knee-deep river of mud along which, even
at this late hour, the toiling freight wagons were moving hub to
hub in formless confusion.</p>

<p>Across the gulf of mud Peace saw the glitter of Cheyenne's
saloons and dance halls and business houses stretching away into
the windy night. Tent or log framed or pine-boarded, all of them
were booming with the traffic and trade of the newly opened
construction year. Over on the corner of Eddy the vast shape of
Campeaux's Club saloon, a circus tent fifty feet wide and a hundred
feet long, emitted its solid gush of light, and a band in there
made an enormous clatter through which the hoarse spiel of the
barker at the door rose and fell.</p>

<p>"Not a building here last July&mdash;and now look at it,"
observed Peace.</p>

<p>"Nine thousand citizens," said Leach Overmile, He was all Texan,
tall and thin and as soft-spoken as a girl. Cold as it was he wore
only a thin cotton shirt and a pair of striped butternut breeches
tucked into the low-topped boots characteristic of cattle land. A
Colt's .44 slapped against his right thigh. "Steeped in sin and
proud of it. Kinda tame against Julesburg, though. Vigilantes have
got the tough ones temporarily scared. What's Omaha look like?"</p>

<p>They turned into the Rollins House and walked up the stairs to
the room Peace kept against his frequent passages in and out of the
place. He dropped his plunder and lighted a lamp.</p>

<p>"Omaha's busy but dull. More than a month of office work would
kill me." He had his shirt off and he had poured himself a basin of
water; standing in front of the dresser mirror, he lathered his
face.</p>

<p>Overmile dumped himself casually across the bed, lying full
length. Phil Morgan, one of the junior civil engineers on the job,
sat more properly in a chair. He was a year or two older than
Peace, perpetually nursing a pipe. He had a settled, philosophical
manner, with a gravity lining his mouth. He was content to let the
others talk.</p>

<p>"Who was that girl?" demanded Overmile.</p>

<p>Peace brought his razor sweeping down his face. "Couldn't find
out," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"You tried," Overmile pointed out ironically. "All I got to say
is, Big Sid sure has taste."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>The door opened without ceremony and a pair of older men walked
in. Peace laid down his razor. He said, "I was just coming over to
the office, Sam. Hello, Jack."</p>

<p>Sam Reed said, "You've heard the news, I suppose."</p>

<p>Jack Casement said: "What's doing in Omaha?"</p>

<p>They were both small, wiry men. Reed, superintendent of
construction, had a rather gentle face set off by a heavy black
beard. As for Jack Casement, who held the contract for laying steel
all the way through, there was no gentleness about him. He was a
terrier, a doughty, scrapping little terrier, physically unable to
stand still, never unwilling to fight it out with any of the
thousands working under him. Like Reed, he carried a full beard,
the color of rust.</p>

<p>Peace went back to finish his shaving. Casement fished up his
pipe and began stirring around the room. Peace said: "Your brother
Dan told me to say you can have eighty cars of material a day.
Omaha looks like a freight dump. So does Council Bluff. Stuff piled
story-high on both sides of the river. Ferries workin' twenty-four
hours a day. What news, Sam?"</p>

<p>The door opened again with a bang. A burly young man came in and
said, "What the hell here, Peace?"</p>

<p>"Mama Tarrant's little boy, Ed, once more," murmured Overmile,
"This joint begins to resemble an old settlers' convention."</p>

<p>Ed Tarrant went over and shook Peace with a broad blow on the
back. "Here comes the swallow with the spring. So we whip hell out
of the Central this year, don't we? Had supper? No? Well, what this
room needs is a little more fraternity. Just wait right here. Don't
move a step." He wheeled around and waggled his thumb profanely at
Overmile and left them, slamming the door with a boisterous
violence. Tobacco smoke began to turn the light blue.</p>

<p>Overrnile said mildly: "That wild bull."</p>

<p>"What news, Sam?" prompted Peace.</p>

<p>Reed said: "Well, we had our schedule for '68 all set. We were
to locate to Salt Lake and lay steel as far as the Wasatch range.
With a little survey work done west of Salt Lake to Humboldt Wells.
But last night I get a wire from Dodge. He's dropped his work in
Congress and he'll be here within a week."</p>

<p>Everybody paid Sam Reed strict attention. Peace stood still, the
razor suspended. For General Dodge was chief engineer and his word
was law to all of them.</p>

<p>Reed went on in his dry way. "Our schedule's been knocked to
pieces. The order now is to make our location lines final all the
way to Salt Lake in thirty days, and to Humboldt Wells, 220 miles
west of the lake, in another sixty days. We are, moreover, to cover
the whole line with men, regardless of the cost, and get into Salt
Lake with steel as fast as possible. It makes no difference where
snow catches us this year. We are to keep on."</p>

<p>Jack Casement said, "You hear? Five hundred miles of steel to be
laid down, and no stops."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Peace.</p>

<p>Reed shrugged his shoulders. He had a trick of saying important
things without emphasis. He moved his cigar to another corner of
his mouth, speaking around it. "Under the original setup, the
Central was to build from Frisco east to the California line and
the Union was to build west from Omaha and meet them there. All of
us know Huntington and Stanford and Crocker have been too ambitious
to stop at the California line. So they had their charter changed
and came on. Now they have persuaded the Secretary of the Interior
that the Central is financially and morally purer than the Union
and so should have more rewards. Well, it looked like brag until
now. But the fact is that the Central has put the Sierras behind
and they've got all the level stretches of Nevada in front, whereas
we haven't yet reached our heavy work in the Wasatch chain."</p>

<p>"Which," said Casement, always preoccupied with the problem of
getting steel laid, "we'll hit in the dead of winter."</p>

<p>Reed went on. "So Central sprung its surprise. It intends to
beat us into Salt Lake. If it succeeds it will block us out of our
only logical terminal and dictate its own terms as to what the
Union will have in through traffic. We're hipped. If we lose, our
whole financial structure blows up. There's no revenue to be had
out of a road running nine hundred miles across a desert without a
terminal. The government will listen to the road reaching the lake
first&mdash;and Central means to make Union the tail of the dog. My
guess is that Huntington and his partners aim to beat us to Salt
Lake so that they can whip the Union into line and control the
whole road from Frisco to Omaha. We have got to reach Salt Lake
first regardless of cost&mdash;regardless of anything." He leaned
forward and his eyes brightened. "We've got to get there
first."</p>

<p>Ed Tarrant came banging back into the room, bearing glasses and
a bottle. He said, "Amity and concord and fraternity&mdash;that's
the ticket." But the thoughtful silence of the group struck him,
and he looked about with a curious eye and shrugged his shoulders.
Frank Peace finished his shave; he put his shirt and coat back on.
The rest of them were entirely caught up in their own
considerations, with the room turning a hazier blue from the rising
spirals of tobacco smoke. Ed Tarrant poured the drinks, passing
them around. "My God," he muttered, "is this a wake'?"</p>

<p>"We're going to have trouble enough," said Reed quietly. "Some
of it we can forecast, like weather and grading delay and operating
breakdown. Some of it we can't. We're going into country this
season that the Indians claim as private hunting ground. There's
some sort of a treaty about it. I don't know the rights&mdash;all I
know is I've been told to lay steel. But the Cheyennes are sore and
they're going to hit us. I know also we've got some agitators in
our construction gangs. Who's payin' 'em to cause trouble? Make
your own guesses. And I know that the gamblers aim to take control
of the end of track towns away from us this year. Our rule has been
hurting their profits. That's why Big Sid Campeaux came back early
this season. They've got their joints laid out already at Laramie.
Our tracks will reach there in two or three days. And then the ball
opens. The company has been served notice by these fellows, through
Campeaux, that they do not propose to observe the authority of any
mayor or town marshal we may appoint."</p>

<p>"A fight?" drawled Leach Overmile, and reared up from the bed.
His sandy hair made an unruly whorl down across his forehead;
eagerness gleamed out of his indigo eyes.</p>

<p>Reed said to Peace, "The construction train leaves for end of
track in an hour. I've had Overmile arrange for horses to meet you
there. Go on to Fort Sanders and locate Mormon Charley. He's close
to the Indians. I want you to have him use his influence with the
Indians not to fight us. You don't do any more office work this
year, Frank. From now on your particular job is to haridle the
grief along the right of way. And, in particular, you've got to
handle the toughs. The train leaves in an hour."</p>

<p>Peace said: "I haven't had supper. And I've got some personal
business."</p>

<p>Reed smiled a little bit&mdash;and the other men in the room
shared that. "All right. Give Eileen my regards. The train can
wait."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," put in Ed Tarrant, "how long should good liquor be
ignored?"</p>

<p>They were silent a little while, and then Peace lifted his glass
and echoed the thought that was in the minds of all of them.
"Here," he said, "is to '68&mdash;the year we beat the Central into
Salt Lake."</p>

<p>They drank on that and they broke up. Sam Reed stopped at the
door to drop an afterthought. "You don't travel alone this year,
Frank. Overmile sticks with you particularly. Phil Morgan is at
hand for your use. When you get to Fort Sanders you'll find
Lieutenant Millard has orders to accompany you on any trip off the
road."</p>

<p>"What's that for?" demanded Peace.</p>

<p>But Sam Reed only shrugged his shoulders and went out, Jack
Casement following. Peace remained in his tracks, a tall and unruly
presence in that room, with his black head faintly bent. There was
a sharpness and a hardiness in the look he threw at those three
deep friends ranged about him. He saw the way they studied him,
with an affection&mdash;and with a concern.</p>

<p>He said again: "What's it all for?"</p>

<p>Leach Overmile blew a ring of cigarette smoke casually upward.
Pure blandness covered the cheeks of this silver-headed
ex-cowpuncher and faint crew's feet wrinkles sprang shrewdly about
his eyes. Phil Morgan was an inscrutable figure in the chair, teeth
clenched about the stem of his pipe. Ed Tarrant lifted his glass
against the light, squinting through it.</p>

<p>"You don't know yet?" murmured Overmile,</p>

<p>"I don't like mystery, you slab-sided horse wrangler."</p>

<p>"No mystery," remarked Overmile quietly. "This Indian business
is just a side trip. Reed sent word to all the joints last night
that the railroad proposed to back up its authority in all end of
track towns this year&mdash;and that you were the man to clean 'em
up if they got tough. Ed Tarrant was in the Club last night when
the news trickled through. The gamblers held a meetin' about it. We
know for a fact they wired Campeaux, who, was winterin' in Omaha.
That's what brought him along in such a hurry."</p>

<p>He stopped and blew another smoke ring at the cloudy ceiling.
But Phil Morgan said evenly: "Tell him the rest, Leach."</p>

<p>Overrnile drawled: "At this meetin' the toughs decided to put
you to sleep if you started anything. Which is why Reed said you
wouldn't travel alone this year."</p>

<p>Frank Peace let his eyes narrow a moment, considering it.
Afterwarrd the grin they were all waiting for laid a taut streak
across his skin. He said indolently: "I'm to be chaperoned?
Brethren, I'll run you ragged. I'll have you sittin' on front
porches and back steps all summer. Now get away from my
sight&mdash;I'm busy. See you at the train in two hours."</p>

<p>"Another drink?" suggested Ed Tarrant hopefully. But Frank
Peace, bound for the door, swept him forward with a long arm. They
went down the stairs and out through the lobby of the Rollins House
into Cheyenne's windy, tumultuous street.</p>

<p>Peace said: "At the train," and swung away, cutting around the
corner of Eddy and going along it at a fast cruising stride. There
were men working at the guy ropes of Campeaux's Club saloon,
cursing the wind as they slid into the heavy mud; and a four-horse
team pulled away from it, high laden with freight. It was the way
all these joints worked. Tonight the Club was in full roar at
Cheyenne. But end of track crept on past Sherman Summit into
Laramie Plains, and Laramie City was only a few days from steel.
Tomorrow night Campeaux's Club saloon would be pitched in Laramie,
waiting for the Irish Paddies to come swinging in off the first
work train&mdash;money in their pockets, a thirst in their throats,
and the very devil in their bony fists.</p>

<p>And around the Club's enormous tent would be all the other
shanty hells, with their spielers crying across the street: "Come
on, you rondo-coolo sports&mdash;come on over and give us a bet!"
Spring was here, the railroad stirred from its sleep, and 1868
would be a lustier year, a more roaring year&mdash;and a deadlier
year.</p>

<p>He turned in front of a small two-storied frame building wedged
between other buildings of like rawness and newness. A sign above
it said briefly: OLIVER MERCANTILE COMPANY, and inside he saw
Bardee Oliver's pointed smooth Yankee face turning slowly and
obstinately from side to side at a customer across the counter, It
roused Peace's sense of humor. Bardee Oliver was on his way to a
fortune through that one gift he had of being able to shake his
head. In this prodigal country where men were turned giddy by the
buoyant air Bardee kept his senses.</p>

<p>He saw Peace. He said, "Hello, Frank," as a matter of course.
This casualness was something he never departed from, fire or storm
or gun fight. "Eileen," he added, "is just up the stairs," and
afterward he turned his attention back to the customer.</p>

<p>Peace went across the store more rapidly than he realized. He
skirted the piles of sacked flour, the boxes of canned goods, the
heavy tiers of lard tubs; he came to the narrow stairway and went
up two steps at a time to knock impatiently on the upper door.</p>

<p>A voice, like the cool, remote tinkle of porcelain, said: "Come
in."</p>

<p>He pushed the door aside. Across the room Eileen Oliver turned
slowly around, slowly and gracefully and without hurry.</p>

<p>It was this picture&mdash;the promise of this picture&mdash;that
had been long in his memory, stirring his restlessness during the
month he had been away, a restlessness that was like vaguely
remembering something valuable that he had left behind him and
might lose, A fear of that sort&mdash;a feeling of unease and
uncertainty. She had on a dress that lay tightly against her slim
waist, that accented the self-reliance of her small, square
shoulders. Her hair was quite dark, drawn back in the strict,
center-parted fashion of the time; her eyes were gray, and all this
darkness gave to her small, distinct and oval face a remote olive
tint. She was a quiet girl and her smile now sweetened rather than
lightened the grave, even lines of those New England lips.</p>

<p>She said, "I hoped you'd be in tonight, Frank," and the slight
gesture of her head sent two jade eardrops into quiet motion.</p>

<p>"Is that all, Eileen?" he said, and went straight across the
room. Her hands came up in a quick gesture of defense. But he
brought her to him with a hard sweep of his long arms.</p>

<p>She said, half in a whisper, "Frank!" When he kissed her he
caught the perfume of her hair. Her lips slid away from him and her
hands put a steady pressure against his wide chest. Her eyes were
very bright; color stained her cheeks. "Frank&mdash;why are you so
rough!"</p>

<p>He was laughing then, for he had remembered that self-possession
was the key to this girl and that she hated unsettling emotions.
There was that much of her father's casualness in her make-up. He
looked at her until her eyes dropped and that strange shyness
pushed his spirits higher than they had been. He reached down and
caught the point of her chin, and lifted it and said,
"Eileen&mdash;coolness is for strangers." But she had a need for
self-possession that he could not break through. Her eyes flashed
out quick anger and she shoved his arm aside.</p>

<p>"Eileen," he said, remotely stung, "are you afraid to be
alive?"</p>

<p>She caught her breath. She said, "Frank!" Her hands held him by
the coat lapels and he saw through her reserve, down into some part
of her that held flame. It was soon shut out. She dropped her
hands, and humor turned her lips frankly at the corners. "It
doesn't take us long to quarrel, does it?"</p>

<p>"If you fed me I'd be more agreeable."</p>

<p>She said, "Sit down," and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>There was, Peace thought, an unbreakable serenity in this room.
The boards hadn't yet been painted or papered, the furniture was
scarred by usage and travel&mdash;and the robust, turbulent echoes
of a Cheyenne busy with its work and its pleasure beat like waves
against the thin walls. Yet the personality of the girl was
stronger than these other influences. Quiet as she was, she had put
the impress of her will upon the room; it was a matter of
orderliness, of small touches of grace against the bare walls. He
got out his pipe and packed it, feeling ease go through him.</p>

<p>She came back and put a plate in front of him, and said: "Cold
scraps. Has Omaha changed?"</p>

<p>"Packed solid with railroad stuff. Mud hub-deep on the main
street. Steamboats tied by the dozen to the docks. It's a railroad
town now, Eileen."</p>

<p>She said: "We should be grateful for the railroad, I suppose. It
is life for all of us." She sat down opposite him, her arms resting
on the table; her definite mouth was minutely stubborn and a latent
unhappiness stirred the exact detail of her face. "But I shall be
glad when it is finished and all this roughness is gone. Listen to
those men outside."</p>

<p>This windy night shouldered against the pine wall of the
building, condensing the reports of Cheyenne's roaring activity.
There was a teamster directly under the window, yelling at his
horses caught in the muddy channel of Eddy Street. The board walk
down there was a-drumming with loud feet and out of the Club
saloon, the racket of the saloon's band poured interminably, laced
now and then by the barkeep's strident calling: "Come over here,
you rondo-coolo sports, and give us a bet!" Yonder by the depot the
ringing of the switch engine's bell kept on. Somewhere the
unsupported wall of a half-built house went down against the blast
with a long, flat crash.</p>

<p>Watching Eileen across the table, Peace realized that she hated
all this raw, lusty life with an unfathomed intensity; The vitality
of it warmed him like a fire&mdash;and only roused in her a hatred
for its disorder. Every fiber in her body was stiffened against it.
There was an insistence in her for exact ways, for gentility and
sedate manners; and the louder all that outside fury became the
more pronounced became the color on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"It isn't bad, Eileen," he said quietly.</p>

<p>She looked at him in her old way&mdash;which was cool and clear.
"I know, Frank. You love it. Excitement and fighting keeps you
going. You are hard. You are becoming harder."</p>

<p>He had finished his meal. He took up his pipe again. He was
smiling through the gray lift of tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>"I like it," he admitted.</p>

<p>"They have made a work horse out of you," she told him. "They
have made a slave driver out of you. What do these Irishmen call
you? Bucko Frank. A man that cleans up gambling dens at point of a
gun and knocks workmen down with his fists."</p>

<p>He said mildly: "it's the way to handle these fellows. I could
go out on that street now and yell and get a hundred of them around
me in five minutes&mdash;and they'd do anything I asked."</p>

<p>"I hate it, Frank! Killers call you by your first name and ask
you to have a drink on them. Women&mdash;" her voice turned
bitter&mdash;"those women&mdash;smile at you."</p>

<p>"Listen," he said carefully: "This is the greatest engineering
job in the world, When it's done there'll be other roads to build.
Here is where I make my way&mdash;for the next job to come."</p>

<p>She made a resigned motion with her small hand. "Have breakfast
with us, Frank. I haven't seen you for a month."</p>

<p>He shook his head. His smile was regretting. "Reed's sending me
to Fort Sanders tonight."</p>

<p>"Then I won't see you for another month! It isn't right. Why
can't he wait one day?" She was angry then, with the rose color
filling her cheeks. "How long do I have to sit and wait?"</p>

<p>He said, all at once laughing and reckless: "You're a lovely
woman when you get angry." He rose and came around the table, and
instantly she got out of her chair, and her hands lifted in a
self-defense she couldn't forget.</p>

<p>She said rapidly: "No, Frank&mdash;I don't like that!"</p>

<p>But he took her by the arms and looked down, losing his humor,
"What have I been thinking about in Omaha? Why do you suppose I
held up a work train for an hour and came here on an empty stomach?
Good God, Eileen, drop your manners for a minute! Don't be so
damned stiff and scared! The waiting is just as tough on me as it
is on you. But I keep thinking that the few minutes we have may be
worth the waiting. A woman in love, Eileen, doesn't act like a
Boston spinster in a museum. We're alive&mdash;and what are you
afraid of?"</p>

<p>She shook herself away, and her hand lifted and slapped him
across the cheek. He didn't step away. He dropped his arms and
stood there watching her, smiling once more.</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said softly, "you'd be human if we fought more."</p>

<p>She said, "Frank&mdash;I'm sorry." And stood rigidly in her
place, on the edge of tears. "But stay over tomorrow."</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>She flung her protest at him. "Who's being stubborn now? Do I
take second place to the railroad?"</p>

<p>He said laconically: "That's something you'll have to learn,
Eileen. Never make a man choose between his job and his woman.
There is a time for each, and the two things don't compare."</p>

<p>She faced him, resisting him quietly with her will. "I'm not
just a woman, Frank. I'm Eileen Oliver. I can't change that."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and was about to answer her when
somebody tapped on the room door. Eileen said, "Come in," and her
hands went up automatically to her hair, arranging it.</p>

<p>Ben Latimer walked into the room and stopped, and looked across
at these two people with a manner that was very cool and very
self-contained.</p>

<p>He said, "Hello, Peace. I heard you were back." And then he
bowed at Eileen, and his voice lost its distant ring. "There's four
thousand Irishmen abroad and the town's wild&mdash;and I got
lonely, Eileen."</p>

<p>Peace said: "A logical and orderly sentiment, Ben," and stared
at Latimer without expression. But a hard, violent impulse washed
through him and left him inwardly a-smolder. Latimer was young. He
was sound and dogged and full of nerve. Yet in the narrows of those
pale gray eyes was something wholly unsentimental. It reminded
Peace of old Bardee Oliver downstairs who calculated his chances so
dryly, so smartly. Latimer was of that same disposition, avoiding
enthusiasm, and thereby making his profitable way.</p>

<p>"Just so," agreed Latimer imperturbably. "Well, I guess we start
another year. You'll be interested to know I took contract on ten
miles of fill the other side of Laramie. I got twenty teams and
fifty men going now."</p>

<p>"You progress," drawled Peace.</p>

<p>"I guess I do," agreed Latimer. "One year ago I swung a shovel
at two and a half a day. I don't want to be breakin' in here,
though."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Ben," said Eileen. A coolness and a serenity had
returned to her. She said to Peace: "When will you be back?"</p>

<p>Peace took his hat and walked to the doorway. He kicked his
unruly temper into its proper place and spoke idly: "Not sure. Good
night, Eileen."</p>

<p>But she followed him and swung the door after her&mdash;and the
two were in the semidarkness of the landing. Her hand brushed his
sleeve softly; her voice was a quiet, urgent whisper. "When will
you be back, Frank? How long do I wait now?"</p>

<p>He said irritably: "Wait for what? Another argument? Go back and
entertain Ben by reciting the table of compound interest. It is a
safe topic and you'll enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Frank!" Her hand held him and the faint perfume of her hair was
a strong call in these shadows. He reached down abruptly and kissed
her again, and hoped for an answer. There was a yielding of her
body, yet even then he felt a remote resistance. She was giving him
a concession, she was trying to please him&mdash;but it was no more
than that. She couldn't break through her will; she couldn't be
generous in the way of a woman in love. It struck him hard. He left
her there and went down the stairs.</p>

<p>Bardee Oliver sat on his counter, waiting for trade. Bardee
said:</p>

<p>"Got a raise yet, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Haven't asked."</p>

<p>Oliver looked at him out of eyes surrounded by a net of shrewd
wrinkles. "Never get more if you don't ask. You been doing the
company's dirty work. Goin' to do more, according to rumors. Better
figure for yourself and lay by&mdash;like Ben there. Ben's smart
enough to know the bonanza don't last forever. You should be."</p>

<p>Peace only nodded. He entered the brawling, wind-choked street
and tramped toward the depot with his head lowered. Somebody in the
western edge of this formless, disorderly town was firing a gun;
and the monotonous pumping of the Club's orchestra kept going on
and on. By impulse he cut across the mud, ducking past a mired
freight wagon, and walked to the saloon's doorway, The spieler
there quit his talking&mdash;quit it suddenly and stared at Peace.
Men rolled in and out of this crowded place and a lamplight went
glittering along the bright fifty feet of Campeaux's portable bar.
Opposite the bar all the games were going and beyond, on the dance
floor, girl after girl in full evening clothes whirled with their
partners. The music stopped then and the promenade to the bar
began; a monte player kept calling in his tuneless formula:</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars if you spot it. Gentlemen, my hand against your
eye. Who's trying?"</p>

<p>Somebody came along the outgoing stream of traffic and said:
"Hello, Frank." Peace merely nodded. He turned toward the depot,
his long arms swinging. A heavy line plowed its way across his
forehead; the bite of the wind turned the scar on his temple
white.</p>

<p>A man called, "Wait a minute, Peace," but he kept on, a feeling
of frustration boiling up.</p>

<p>There was one passenger coach hitched to nine flatcars of steel,
with a helper engine coupled behind. A jet of steam exploded from
that engine and a bell kept ringing. At the steps of the coach he
found Overmile and Morgan and Ed Tarrant waiting for him, their big
coats turned against the wind. The conductor, Mike Connor, came
rapidly along the platform.</p>

<p>He said: "We'll be on our way, Mr. Peace?"</p>

<p>"Let her go, Mike."</p>

<p>But he stood there at the foot of the car steps, thinking of
Eileen's definite face turned so stubbornly to him, and he kept
thinking of the eagerness he had brought to that room and the
sultry irritation he had brought away from it. Back of all this the
shape of Ben Latimer lay like a shadow. Leach Overmile's voice
reached him as from a distance.</p>

<p>"Make up your mind, Mister Peace."</p>

<p>All his partners watched him closely. He shrugged his shoulders
then and swung up the steps. The coach threw its sudden warmth into
his face and the flicker of lamplights momentarily blurred his
sight. He found his stuff piled under a seat and sat down there,
the others coming on to join him. The engines were alternately
pulling and boosting the train out of Cheyenne with a lack of
unison that buckled the coach back and forth; the town lights slid
by and the speed picked up. Over on the right-hand prairie he saw
the barrack windows of Fort D. A. Russell strongly shining through
the pitch black. Afterward the steady steam blast of the engines
began to slap harder into the night as the track started to climb
the long grade to Sherman Summit. He considered his watch and found
it to be ten o'clock, and there was in him once more that deep
uneasiness he could not explain&mdash;the feeling of leaving
something behind him he treasured and would lose.</p>

<p>A little flash of color in one corner of his vision lifted him
out of this long study. He saw Nan Normandy sitting at the far end
of the car. She had her eyes on him and she held his attention for
a long moment, seriously and proudly, and with a faint show of
something that seemed like fear to him.</p>

<p>She turned her head away. He hadn't noticed until then that
Campeaux sat with her and that Campeaux's creature, Mitch
Dollarhide, held her luggage in an adjoining seat.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">
THEY labored up the heavy grade, buried between the high
shoulders of the Sherman Summit cuts. Engine smoke filtered in,
turning the flickering lamplight a more impotent gray. Wilder wind
boiled along the car sides and all the wheels howled on the curves,
and the exhaust of the helper directly behind this coach ripped its
lunging sound through the steady run of the weather.</p>

<p>Phil Morgan broke a long silence. "Last year Tom Durant got
enough cash to keep construction going. But the Boston investors
furnishing the money don't like his methods, so they told Oakes
Ames to take charge and remove Durant from the vice-president's job
on the road. Durant's been fighting back. He sent his consulting
engineer, Seymour, out here and changed some locations Dodge had
made. Then he came out himself. He's at Laramie now, promising the
folks there that Laramie will get the division point over Cheyenne.
That's why Dodge is on his way west. There'll be a hell of a blowup
when those two meet. Durant knew very well, two years ago, he had
to get Dodge as chief engineer if he expected government
support&mdash;because Dodge has got the full confidence of Grant
and Sherman, and they're pretty powerful. But now Durant figures he
can do without Dodge and wants to get rid of him. The line-up is
entirely clear to me. Dodge is building a straight road. Durant is
more of a plunger and speculator. He wants personal power and all
the subsidy he can get for the road from the government. It's going
to be a battle when those two meet. He'd fire Dodge in a minute,
but Ames won't stand for it. Ames is only one of the directors, but
he's got the stockholders back of him, and he's thoroughly honest.
It was Lincoln who asked him to come in and put his own fortune
behind the road. We're going to have a showdown some day."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Peace, "what her name is."</p>

<p>"Nan Normandy," put in Overmile promptly.</p>

<p>"Why is she here?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>Phil Morgan opened his sleepy eyes. "What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>Peace's glance strayed down the aisle. She sat gently relaxed,
her head resting on the back of the car seat and her eyes closed; a
well-made girl, strong in a way that he could not clearly define,
her presence in this car setting up an actual disturbance.</p>

<p>"A beauty," murmured Overmile.</p>

<p>"You know what happens to beauties up here," drawled Phil
Morgan.</p>

<p>Peace said irritably: "Premature judgement, Phil."</p>

<p>"Then why is she with Campeaux?" Morgan was always like that,
caustic and bitter in his estimates of women. All Phil's friends
knew some old memory burned deeply in him. They had seen it
occasionally squeeze him like a vise and press his lips thin.</p>

<p>"We might go find out," suggested Overmile, smiling in a soft,
rash manner. Peace noticed then that the long Texan's attention
could not leave the girl.</p>

<p>"And we might not," grunted Peace.</p>

<p>They ran on through the summit cuts. Construction fires played
livid, wind-raveled splashes of light across the condensed black,
shining on the dripping sides of the cut, shining on men crouched
there. The engines were easing off now, checking a sudden downgrade
speed. All this was fresh road, laid in a thawed uneasy mud. They
circled away from the summit, crawled tentatively over the high,
spider-legged Dale Creek trestle and swung northward into the
Laramie plains. Wind ripped at them with a gustier temper; rain
laid ragged silver splinters on the car windows.</p>

<p>Ed Tarrant said: "Sam Reed's been a white man to me, or I
wouldn't be such a sucker. I took contract to make a two-mile cut
near Medicine Bow River. I'm going to lose my shirt on it, even at
the maximum three-fifty per yard. Nobody else would take it, not
even Ben Latimer."</p>

<p>Overmile said: "She came all the way from Omaha with him,
Frank?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The train brakes were squalling against the grade. Construction
shanties and long rows of piled ties and dumped steel rose out of
the misty sleeze of the night. They paralleled a siding, running
slowly by Casement's boarding train where a thousand men slept;
they crawled beside Casement's enormous portable warehouse,
clanging for right of way with a steady bell. This was the end of
track&mdash;this dismal, disheveled clutter of men and material
lying under the full blast of that high wind beating across Laramie
Plain.</p>

<p>Overmile, always a restless man, was ready to rise but Peace
held his place, watching the scene at the far end of the car with a
downbearing interest. She sat erect now, the blue military coat
buttoned to her chin; and she had covered her pale yellow hair with
a man's broad-brimmed hat. At this moment she had her hands folded
together in her lap and her head was thoughtfully tipped down.
Campeaux waggled a finger at Mitch Dollarhide, who went down the
aisle with the girl's bags. Campeaux rose then and spoke to her.
She came to her feet, the sway of the train making her reach out
for Campeaux for support. And then her glance touched Peace. It was
like a faint far call that held some meaning he could not
understand, turning all his impulses powerful and impatient. A
moment afterward she passed on to the platform. The train had
stopped.</p>

<p>"A beauty," murmured Overmile.</p>

<p>Peace reared out of the seat and left the car by the other door,
stepping into a yellow clay soup two feet deep. Wind howled up from
the south and the lights of the surrounding shanties sparkled
through a thick, hard-driven rain. He stood there indifferently,
watching the girl crawl along the edge of the train, Campeaux
walked beside her and Mitch Dollarhide sloshed behind.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "Stand still and you'll sink out of sight. Come
on."</p>

<p>They found a walk cutting across the mud and took to it single
file. "I got the horses over there in that shed," Overmile
grunted.</p>

<p>Peace stopped so suddenly that they all banged together; Phil
Morgan fell off the walk, the mud reaching up to his knees. He
said, "Good God, Frank!" But Peace didn't hear. The girl stood now
on the track in front of the engine, its headlight playing on her.
Campeaux and Dollarhide had gone.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Bring the horses over there, Leach," and wallowed
deliberately through the mud toward her. The wind was a strong rush
in his ears; he had to lift his voice.</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>The glare of the engine's light made her drop her head. She had
her hands tucked into the pockets of the military coat, and water
dripped steadily off her hat.</p>

<p>She said: "How far is it to Laramie?"</p>

<p>"Four miles." He thought about that for a minute. "I'm going to
Fort Sanders&mdash;that's only two miles. You can put up
there."</p>

<p>"Mr. Campeaux has a rig waiting for us here."</p>

<p>He said; "All right."</p>

<p>Her head rose quickly. "I wouldn't judge too soon, if I were
you."</p>

<p>He kept his tone civil; he kept his temper down. "My
mistake."</p>

<p>"You've been trying to make up your mind about me all the way
from Omaha, Is it necessary?"</p>

<p>Two horses struggled across the mire, pulling Campeaux and Mitch
Dollarhide in a covered rig. Mitch Dollarhide jumped down and
slumped forward, his feet catching and throwing up the semi-liquid.
His shoulders were thrust forward, he swung his fists as he ran.
Peace turned to keep a strict eye on this man. He said to the girl:
"Good luck."</p>

<p>But she touched rhis arm. "Did you ever hear of a Jim Normandy
out here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Dollarhide reached the track's gravel. He stopped two yards from
Peace, expelling a heavy breathing. "We had enough trouble from
you, Bully. Get the hell away from us."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Mitch."</p>

<p>Mitch Dollarhide swayed, a savage and uncertain expression
licking across his mouth, Big Sid Campeaux tooled his team through
the rain-bubbled mud and stopped beside the track. He stood up in
the seat and threw a solid yell back behind him. "Al!"</p>

<p>There was a man riding forward from that darkness on a high gray
horse. He sloshed around the buggy, wheeling before Frank Peace.
Rain glistened all down his yellow slicker; it roped off his hat.
He tipped up the brim of the hat a little to show a face entirely
smooth and thin and unemotional.</p>

<p>He said: "Hello, Frank."</p>

<p>Peace murmered, "How are you, Brett?"</p>

<p>Mitch boosted his heavy complaint back over one shoulder, never
letting his eyes lose Peace. "I don't need any help to handle
Bucko."</p>

<p>Nan Normandy looked from Campeaux to Al Brett to Mitch
Dollarhide. All these three were taciturnly established in their
places, attentions narrowed on Peace. It was a scene, and it was
clear to her. Her words reached Peace calmly: "Don't make an issue
of it&mdash;not for me."</p>

<p>Al Brett said: "Trouble here, Campeaux?"</p>

<p>Campeaux said: "Ask Peace if he's lookin' for it."</p>

<p>"You standin' in the way, Bucko?" questioned Al Brett, gentle
with his talk.</p>

<p>Peace showed a hard and instant grin. It fired up his face,
swinging it immediately reckless. "You don't have to go with these
men, Miss Normandy."</p>

<p>Campeaux hurled his warning against an increasing wind. The rain
whirled rashly down from the ruptured clouds overhead, each fat
drop glittering diamond-bright in the headlight's glare.</p>

<p>"Don't interfere with me this year, Peace! Keep out of my
way&mdash;and keep your hands off my business! Mitch&mdash;help
Miss Normandy over to the buggy!"</p>

<p>Peace repeated himself. "You don't have to go with Sid, Miss
Normandy."</p>

<p>Al Brett unhooked the front of his slicker, the wind instantly
ripping it back from his wire-thin body. He put his right hand
casually on a holster there. He was remotely smiling.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be proud, Bucko," he called.</p>

<p>The engine's bell started up a steady ringing. Campeaux yelled
at Dollarhide; he swore at Dollarhide. "Lend Miss Normandy your
arm!"</p>

<p>A pair of Irishmen from the train stumbled forward into the
light, both carrying rifles; and at that moment Overmile and Morgan
and Ed Tarrant came up from the turbid blackness at a slashing
gait. They rode onto the track. Overmile got down; he took his
station near Peace.</p>

<p>"Mother," he drawled, "I'm about to be queen of the May. You
want a party, Al?"</p>

<p>"Anytime you say," called Al Brett and sat still. Mitch
Dollarhide shifted doggedly toward the girl. Water collected at the
corner of his stringy mustache and dripped down. He froze in his
position, dull and stubborn.</p>

<p>One of the Irishmen near the engine called out: "You want help,
Mr. Peace?"</p>

<p>Campeaux said: "What are you going to do, Miss Normandy?"</p>

<p>The girl swept the scene with a long glance. There was no give
to any of these men. An old hatred seemed to have brought them
together in this wild, bleak night; an old hatred kept them here.
She saw no fear and no softness. Their tempers were beds of tinder
waiting for a careless spark. Overmile's lazy, unmoved face
revealed a faint rashness. Al Brett continued his still attitude,
one hand touching the gun butt, a remote smile at the corners of
his lips. Campeaux was a shadow in the buggy. Dollarhide a dull
presence beside her. Frank Peace didn't speak again. He had his
head tipped toward her, and she clearly observed the long riot of
his temper. On the train she had guessed he was like this and her
guess was confirmed now. Not one of them would retreat; the idle
quietness they displayed was a lie.</p>

<p>She said to Peace: "Please," and took hold of Mitch Dollarhide's
arm. She went across the track and climbed up the hub wheel to the
seat, beside Campeaux, Dollarhide went around, crawling in behind
the buggy. Al Brett was broadly grinning now.</p>

<p>"No luck tonight, boys."</p>

<p>"Not tonight," said Overmile, only indolent.</p>

<p>Al Brett lifted his reins. Campeaux turned the horses around,
driving them straight through the mud toward the trackless grade
beyond. Fires far off to the north laid fitful beacon lights along
the way. Brett said coolly: "Don't worry, Leach. I'll blow a hole
through your guts before the summer's done." He had one more look
at Frank Peace&mdash;a long, smileless look. "See you in Laramie,
Bucko," he said, and rode away.</p>

<p>Overmile had left Peace's horse beyond the track. Peace slogged
through the mud and swung into a thoroughly wet saddle. He came
back, following the rails until they suddenly quit. Loose ties lay
scattered ahead, indicating where the steel would march tomorrow.
He paralleled the ties, his partners riding behind him, and came at
last to the pure dirt grade running north, Leach Overmile forged
abreast; Tarrant and Morgan made a pair behind. The engine's
headlight died out and they traveled beneath the uneasy, leaking
sky, the western wind slapping strongly on them. Deep rain pools
were forming, water channeled all the ruts, and yonder they saw
Campeaux's rig appear abreast another grader's fire and sink then
into the murk.</p>

<p>"If it keeps rainin'," said Overmile, "you'll want pontoons on
your trains."</p>

<p>Due ahead, the lights of Fort Sanders blinked intermittently;
farther on was the stronger glitter of Laramie Town waiting
restlessly for its hour to come. They passed the last fire on the
grade and found a harder footing. The way was gently downward
toward a creek that hit them on their boots when they forded.
Laralnie River, directly on the left, sent its swollen racket
through the black. Beyond, the high, rolling ridges ran westward
toward Fort Steele on the Platte; still beyond lay the flatness of
the Red Desert, bleak by winter and summer. Far over was the Green
River crossing and farther still the Wasatch range waited. It was
five hundred miles to Salt Lake. Somewhere out on the Nevada desert
this same brawling night the bonfires of the Central were burning
their crimson holes through the night, beside an end of track
pointed east.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "What in hell is she doin' with Campeaux?"</p>

<p>Peace bowed his head against the drive of the rain. The wind's
chilliness isolated him, it sharpened his thinking. Eileen's dress
had been a soft gray and tight around her waist. She brought
tranquility with her, whatever she was. The softness and the calm
of that room remained with him, not to soothe him now but to bring
vividly back the heavy emotion of touching something that he could
not hold, of possessing something that he would lose. Her voice, he
thought, had been uncertain in the hallway's darkness. She had
relented, to kiss him; it was as near surrender as she could ever
come. His life ran a different way, his days were full of heat and
trouble. He could not order them otherwise and he would not order
them otherwise; yet the controlling desire of his life lay back in
Cheyenne. He saw no solution, he could think of none, and his mind
grew weary with the struggle.</p>

<p>They turned into the Fort Sanders road. A low line of buildings
sat in scattered shape, marked only by faint lights hurning. A
sentry wheeled from the darkness, palms slapping curtly on his gun.
"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Frank Peace&mdash;and party."</p>

<p>"Halt, Frank Peace and party. Sergeant of the guard&mdash;post
number one!"</p>

<p>A lantern bobbed out of the guardhouse hard by, drawing the
slanted rain against it. The sergeant came on and lifted the
lantern above his head, revealing his own long, heavy-boned jaw.
Above a still mustache a pair of old soldier's eyes showed a sad,
surly gleam.</p>

<p>"Hello, Malloy. We're putting up."</p>

<p>"Come right ahead, Mr. Peace. You'll want Lieutenant
Millard."</p>

<p>"Not till morning, Malloy."</p>

<p>They splashed beyond the guardhouse and got down, Malloy called
back: "Egan, take the hawrrses. You'll go to the same house, Mister
Peace. That one to left of General Gibbon's."</p>

<p>Egan came. But Overmile was restless and he had changed his
mind. He got into the saddle again. He said to Peace, "I'll be back
after a while."</p>

<p>"Laramie?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Overmile, and turned away.</p>

<p>The others walked down the dark line of buildings, skirted a
picket fence and entered a house beyond, Sergeant Malloy had
followed them; he lighted a lamp and went out again. Phil Morgan
said: "Overmile's a fool."</p>

<p>"He's twenty-four years old," grunted Peace.</p>

<p>Within five minutes they were bunked down, Rain drummed along
the house. A sentry called from a distant corner of the post, and
that echo came in relays all the way to the guard post. Peace
dragged a hand across his face. He stared toward a ceiling he
couldn't see, remembering Eileen as she held to him on the dark
stairway, landing.</p>

<p>Overmile's voice woke him, Overmile was standing beside the bed,
vague in the chilly pitch-dark. "Frank. She's at the hotel in
Laramie. Damn Morgan for thinkin' different."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">
PEACE left Fort Sanders early the next morning with Lieutenant
Archie Millard and six troopers, bound south for the old Virginia
Dale stage station, Overmile went along, but Morgan decided to wait
for Peace in Laramie.</p>

<p>There was a sun shining and a soft wind running out of the west.
All the Laramie plain was wet and fresh, with its occasional
patches of forage grass turned brilliantly green. Northward and
eastward the land rose into the rolling, broken contours of the
Black Hills; off to the south lay the heavy peaks of the Medicine
Bow range. Less than a mile ahead of them the stacks of the Union's
construction engines funneled up a black smoke.</p>

<p>"Mormon Charley will be there all right," said Millard. "But I
doubt if you'll get any help out of him. He doesn't like to see the
road cross this country."</p>

<p>"Talked with him recently?" asked Peace.</p>

<p>Millard said: "I was down that way last week."</p>

<p>Overmile cast Peace a glance of amused understanding.</p>

<p>Millard caught that and flushed a little. He was an ideal
figure, hale and robust and ruddy with the typical cavalryman's
flair for the picturesque. Beneath a rakish hat the edges of his
hair showed a tawny color and his long mustache was of the same
shade, It was easy for him to blush, his complexion being as fair
as a woman's; but he had a strong, sweeping chin. "Damn you,
Leach," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Overmile, "how is the mountain beauty?"</p>

<p>"We're not discussing that," said Millard briefly.</p>

<p>They trotted brisklyalong the open plain, passing a solid stream
of six-mule freighters lumbering from end of track toward Laramie
and toward Salt Lake. The yellow embankment of the right of way was
directly beside them, on which Casement's Irishmen were dropping
ties methodically, They came to a small rise and stopped at Peace's
command near the end of steel, For the space of a quarter mile here
Casement's ambulating construction town littered the
plain&mdash;his enormous portable warehouse, his collapsible shops,
his great horse-and-mule compounds. The boarding train lay on a
siding, the drying clothes of the Irish Paddies hanging out from
bunk cars like so much festival bunting. A solid string of supply
trains stood on the main line, waiting their turn to feed the
endless line of freighting wagons bound away for the grading camps
and bridge crews flung like a thin skirmish line fifty and a
hundred miles ahead.</p>

<p>A thousand men worked at this immediate spot, the interplay of
all that human traffic setting up a restless, ant-like scene of
confusion under the sun. In the foreground end of track surged
forward thirty feet at a time, like a dull brown inchworm.</p>

<p>Peace watched that operation with a full, satisfying interest.
An engine pushed a load of rails forward, dumping them in an
avalanche of sound. Men lifted these rails to a small iron truck
pulled by a single white horse. The horse, disciplined in this
business all the way from Fremont, heaved forward and came on at a
dead gallop to the exact end of track. What followed was smooth and
fast. The steel gang trotted to the truck, four men to each
rail&mdash;lifted two rails and ran them forward. A foreman yelled,
"Down!" and the steel clanged on the waiting ties. The gauger
knelt, and jumped aside; the spikers swung their sledges with a
battering rhythm and withdrew; the bolters bent over and bent back,
and the white horse lunged on to the new end of track. In the
interval the Union Pacific moved toward Laramie as fast as a man
might comfortably walk.</p>

<p>"Pretty," said Lieutenant Millard.</p>

<p>The little column of men pushed forward, leaving behind the
crack of all those sledges, the groaning of the freighters, the
lash of men's strident voices, and the nervous chuffing of the
engines. A trail led up the gentle grade in the direction of
Sherman Summit, soon turning aside to enter a narrow pass pointing
toward the peaks of the Medicine Bow. The last echo of the engines
died behind and then there was only a long, riding calm, with the
soft squeal of leather breaking the drone of a warming day.
Millard's men sat relaxed in their saddles, all old troopers whose
skins were as weathered as the leather gear beneath them. Their
Spencer carbines lay tucked in saddle boots; their revolvers hung
at their hips, and they kept watching the higher ground around them
with a taciturn attention. Later in the morning they stopped to
roll their coats and went on again in shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>Millard said: "We got a wire from Sidney this morning. A band of
Dog soldiers of the Sioux tribe raided Elm Creek Station and killed
five section hands."</p>

<p>"Bad year coming up," said Peace.</p>

<p>"How's Eileen?" asked Millard.</p>

<p>Peace said; "Good," and let it go like that.</p>

<p>Millard had known him too long not to understand the clipped
finality of that single word. He appraised Peace carefully. "Seen
Latimer lately?"</p>

<p>"Last night in Cheyenne."</p>

<p>Millard said, in a rather quick way: "He's smart. Seems to smell
the grading jobs that won't make money for him. Twenty years from
now when this Country settles up he'll have his interest in
it&mdash;coal and cattle and land. Some men draw money to them.
He's that kind."</p>

<p>"Watch me," broke in Overmile.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I know cows and I know grass. Been lookin' at this territory.
When I'm through workin' for the railroad next year this is where I
squat. I got an eye on a pretty spot across the hump there in the
valley of the Little Laramie. Come back in twenty years and see my
beef roamin' these hills with me under my fig tree."</p>

<p>They rode like this for a good while, each man contemplative and
silent. They were young and the ferment of ambition was in them.
But Archie Millard's face held a set, dismal expression. He said:
"Twenty years? Well, men pray, but there are no answers. Twenty
years is a black tunnel, Who knows if it's daylight at the other
end?"</p>

<p>At noon they stopped for water and a long rest. The shape of the
land here was all rolling, broken by buttes and small domes and
outcrops of round, disintegrated rock. The stage trail led through
a low pass, leaving the Medicine Bow peaks over against the west.
Scrub trees and a few strands of the fragile-looking aspen grew
along the way; the hills were as green as they would ever be. In
the afternoon they came upon the Fort Collins road, struck a feeder
of Cache Creek and around five o'clock arrived at the Virginia Dale
stage station, pitching camp there.</p>

<p>Virginia Dale had the reputation of being the best station on
the Overland stage route, its low log buildings and its corrals and
barns sitting pleasantly beside a creek running down from the
Medicine Bow range. The ruts of the stage road were still deep
here, yet dimming perceptibly. The hurrying rails of the Union had
done that, cutting out the stage line section by section,
thistation which once was so lively with the traffic of those big
coaches rolling up around the prow of the Black Hills set more or
less idle now under the spring sun, kept alive only by the
freighting trade between Denver and Cheyenne.</p>

<p>A lank man came out of the main house and walked over to the
camp, showing them an interest which was neither friendly nor
unfriendly. He said: "Hello, Archie," barely nodding at Peace and
Overmile, He gave the troopers one careless look.</p>

<p>"Mormon Charley still here, Reese?"</p>

<p>"Out on a hunt right now. Back tonight."</p>

<p>Millard turned his fine big body half about. There was a girl
looking at him across the yard. She stood in the doorway of a small
cabin farther down the creek and Peace, sending his glance that
way, saw merely a round, dusky face. Immediately afterward she
retreated into the cabin. Millard said: "I'll see you later," and
went over there in long strides.</p>

<p>"Mormon Charley's girl?" asked Peace.</p>

<p>Reese shaved himself a thin slice of plug tobacco,
"Yeah&mdash;that's Cherry."</p>

<p>Overmile and Peace swapped glances. Reese saw that.</p>

<p>He snapped his knife shut and returned it to his pocket. "She's
good enough for your damned lieutenant, boys. Half Injun or
not."</p>

<p>Peace strolled over the little meadow, Overmile with him, and
sat down on the porch of the stage house. Shadows crawled out from
the Medicine Bow, turning this little valley blue. The troopers
mess fire sent its fresh wood-smoke odor keenly across the air.
Reese came up. He said: "Supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Peace. "All three of us."</p>

<p>Reese shook his head. "Just two. Millard always eats with Mormon
Charley and the girl."</p>

<p>"Know his ways pretty well, don't you?" asked Peace.</p>

<p>"Should," said Reese, "He's regular with his visitin'."</p>

<p>He went into the house and began to yell through it in an Indian
tongue.</p>

<p>"Another squaw man," pointed out Overmile.</p>

<p>"Reese? Yes, I knew that." Peace scrubbed his shoulders against
the back of the chair. Millard had gone into Mormon Charley's
cabin. He was still in there, with a quick twilight laying its
successive layers of powder-blue satin across the sky. A few men
began to collect around the yard; a peaceful Ute and his woman came
out of a ravine, bent over on their ponies, and made camp down by
one of the corrals.</p>

<p>Peace said: "When did all this start, Leach?"</p>

<p>"Last November in Cheyenne. Mormon Charley came to Fort Russell
to see General Stevenson. Brought the girl with him. Archie saw
her. Her mother was an Arapahoe woman who died a good many years
ago. Charley raised the kid, never takin' another squaw. Sent her
to a school in St. Louis for a few years."</p>

<p>"Pretty?"</p>

<p>"Wait till you see her."</p>

<p>"No matter," grumbled Peace. "It isn't the point. Here's a man
who graduated at the top of his class in West Point. Smart and
cool&mdash;and the best soldier along the whole line of posts. His
father was a general. So was his grandfather. In time Archie will
be. Now look at it. We've got to stop this, Leach."</p>

<p>Overmile smiled softly "How do you do things like that,
Frank?"</p>

<p>The supper bell rang. They went inside and sat up with half a
dozen other men to antelope steak, fried trout and fresh biscuits
served with wild honey. Soft darkness flowed around Virginia Dale.
Reese's Ute woman circled the room, moccasins making no sound, and
lighted the lamps. Outside, the troopers' fire was a pear-shaped
shield of mellow light. They were singing "John Brown's Body." A
little wind stirred the room.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
At eight o'clock that night Mormon Charley walked into the room, a
compact man with bright magpie eyes glittering out through an
enormous mat of a beard. He wore a buckskin suit black from the
swipe of many a greasy hunting knife across it; and his manner was
the manner of all mountain men, blunt and a little wild. Even as he
talked he seemed to be listening for other sounds. His eyes were
never still.</p>

<p>"Back for another year, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Till the road's finished," said Peace, and shook Mormon
Charley's hand cheerfully.</p>

<p>Mormon Charley shook his head. "Country's no damned good now.
Buffler's gone, no price to be had for beaver skins. Wagon tracks
all over tarnal creation and a thunder buggy snortin' through the
hills like God's judgment, skeerin' game an' puttin' a bad smell in
the air. I'm an old man. Jim Bridger's old, Bill Williams he's
dead, Kit Carson's turned civilized and lives greaser style in
Tows; Whar's the fun gone?"</p>

<p>"Let's make a little talk," said Peace.</p>

<p>Mormon Charley's restless, bead-bright eyes flickered around the
room, touching everything, Reese stood in a corner, listening. A
few other men were there, listening.</p>

<p>"You come to my lodge," said Mormon Charley and led the way out.
"Reese," he grunted, "is more Injun than a real Injun is. Where's
Archie?"</p>

<p>"At your place."</p>

<p>They crossed the meadow to Mormon Charley's small log cabin. A
single lamp burned on a center table, its light not quite reaching
the corners of the room.</p>

<p>Mormon Charley said, "How, Archie," in a swift, hearty way, and
added, "Cherry, let's git some coffee boilin'."</p>

<p>But for a moment the scene in here was dull and quiet. Peace's
glance ran over to a shadowed corner where Millard stood. Even in
this dimness he saw how strained and desperate Millard's face was.
It held no hope, yet a wild desire was there, too. Then he turned
his curious attention to the girl who remained by the table. And
received a definite shock.</p>

<p>This Cherry who was half white and half Arapahoe was a fairer
Indian woman than he had ever seen, fresh and slim and on the edge
of beauty. Her hands touched the table and her head was tipped
down, avoiding the glance of these men out of modesty. Her cheeks
were rather oval and her hair ran blackly and smoothly back on her
head. She wore a plain dress and a plain waist; a small gold chain
circled her neck, with a little gold locket lying against
well-formed breasts that stirred to a sudden, disturbed
breathing.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "Hello, Cherry," his drawling voice very
gentle.</p>

<p>Her chin lifted, and Peace was further astonished at the even
melody of her speech. She said, "I'm glad to see you, Leach." But
it was to Peace her glance afterward came and for a long moment she
explored his face, her eyes reading him with a sharp care.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "This is Frank Peace, Cherry. A friend of
Archie's."</p>

<p>She murmured, "How do you do," carefully. Yet Peace saw her
emotions change in that little interval. She had read him. She had
felt his antagonism, and her own eyes hardened against him and
dropped. She turned toward the stove.</p>

<p>"What's the railroad want now?" said Mormon Charley.</p>

<p>Peace took a chair. He got his pipe packed and nursed it a
moment until the smoke was drawing. "It's the Indians,
Charley."</p>

<p>Mormon Charley grunted. "Sure. Why wouldn't it be? Your dam'
rails are headin' across the finest game land in the world. I've
seen a thousand antelope in one band runnin' that plain. Injuns
don't like to see their grounds busted up, no better than
whites."</p>

<p>"We scrapped the Sioux and Cheyenne all last year, in Nebraska,"
went on Peace. "Well, that part of the road is done and we can
defend it. Far as that goes, we can defend the rest of the way. But
it slows us up&mdash;and we're due into Salt Lake twelve months
from now."</p>

<p>"Tell the Injuns that," remarked Mormon Charley, and laughed
shortly.</p>

<p>"What will they do?" said Peace.</p>

<p>Mormon Charley hoisted one foot over the arm of his chair, "The
Shoshones won't hurt you. Washakie's friendly to you and he'll keep
his people on their blankets. But that's all the help you'll get.
The Arapahoes have moved from their proper grounds&mdash;just
knockin' around this country and Iookin' for trouble. The Sioux
don't properly belong this far south, but they're fightin' the
Shoshones now'days, and they'll send parties down this year. That
applies to the Crows, too. Injuns are all busted up. White men have
pushed 'em from one place to another. They're stirrin', like
hornets. You can expect trouble. Mebbe not open raids on your
track. Last year taught 'em that a bullet won't go through an
engine, and they got respect for your Irishmen. But when you get a
hundred yards off from your right of way you're a-goin' to be in
trouble."</p>

<p>"Charley," said Peace, "why don't you go talk to them?"</p>

<p>"Me?" said Mormon Charley. He shook his head. "No. Was a time
when I had a welcome in any lodge. But there's too many whites
around here now, and I'm white, and the Injuns don't make any
distinctions. The old days are gone. Used to be strong friends with
the Arapahoes. Took a wife from the tribe. Week ago when I went
huntin', I near lost my hair to a bunch of young Arapahoes. Shows
you the change. I can't help the road, Frank. Ain't sure I'd want
to, anyhow. You've spoiled my country."</p>

<p>Cherry slipped up to the table with cups and the coffeepot. She
poured their drink enigmatically, never looking at them, and went
back into the shadows. Millard came forward and took his cup, still
standing. Mormon Charley raked the young officer with a keen,
bright glance.</p>

<p>"Whar's the fun? Mountain days are gone, and the settlers comin'
in ain't my style. I'm considerin' a move down to Navajo country.
Settlers won't be thar for another hundred years, and mebbe I can
potter around my melon patch till I'm rubbed out. I never was no
good livin' white style, I can remember when this was a pretty
land."</p>

<p>Archie Millard dropped his cup on the table, wheeling and
leaving the cabin. Peace, intent on catching all this, saw Cherry's
glance race across the room, round and vivid and alarmed. He
finished his coffee and got up. Outside, he waited for Overmile and
for Mormon Charley. They all went a little way into the meadow's
shadowy stillness. Millard's shape vanished somewhere beyond the
troopers' fire. Peace said abruptly: "Can't you stop this,
Charley?"</p>

<p>Mormon Charley's talk wasn't pleased. "My girl's good enough for
Archie, She's a woman with manners. I didn't raise her to be some
Arapahoe's squaw."</p>

<p>Peace shook his head. "No," he said quietly, "it isn't that at
all. Archie's on the edge of throwing up his commission. Then what
will he do? He was educated to be a soldier. It's all he likes.
Suppose he throws it over and marries your girl. It will be fine
for a while. But he'll keep remembering what he might have
been&mdash;and in time it will turn him bitter. No happiness there
for either of them, Charley."</p>

<p>Mormon Charley said: "And why can't my girl be an army officer's
wife? I told you she had learnin'."</p>

<p>Peace looked for a match and found it. Its exploding light
raveled along the pipe bowl; it showed his cheeks to be hard and
skeptical. The light went out. Overmile stirred on his feet, saying
nothing.</p>

<p>"No," murmured Peace. "There are no officers with Indian
wives."</p>

<p>Mormon, Charley cleared his throat. He had been brusque, he had
been impatient. But he spoke now in a deeply regretting way. "I
wondered about that. It's been a fine thought&mdash;that she'd be a
white man's legal wife. She's my girl, Frank. I got to see her
happy."</p>

<p>"It won't work," said Peace.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Mormon Charley, very soft with his words, "maybe
not. I felt it was pushin' luck too far. But it is somethin' I
can't tell Cherry. There's half of her with my blood, which is the
half I can understand. The other half's Arapahoe. That's the part
I've got no influence with."</p>

<p>He turned away from them, moccasined feet making no noise along
the meadow. Peace and Overmile strolled toward the main house.</p>

<p>"You can be tough," murmured Overmile, "Where's your pity?"</p>

<p>"It won't work," repeated Peace doggedly, There was a shadow
moving along a deeper part of the meadow. He saw it and paid no
particular attention. Overmile swung toward the troopers' fire.
"Think I'll sit in with the boys awhile."</p>

<p>Peace continued on toward the house porch. He was at the edge of
it when a woman's voice said, "Mr. Peace." It turned him and pulled
him along the side of the house, deeper into the darkness.
Charley's girl stood there, straight and motionless; when he got
closer he saw the oval surface of her face dimly showing him
hatred.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Cherry."</p>

<p>She didn't lift her voice, yet in its huskiness was a passion
capable of killing him. "Let us alone, Mr. Peace! Let us alone!"
That was all. She whirled and ran back into the meadow's farther
obscurity, leaving him with his unpleasant reflections.</p>

<p>The white blood in this girl cut her away frorn her own people,
it made her dissatisfied with her lot. It put a ferment in her
mind, a hope and an ambition. She was in love with Archie Millard,
her white blood permitting her to believe that happiness was
possible. She would be loyal to him with a stubborn, steadfast
intensity. And yet it was the Indian strain in this girl that
dominated all her actions and all her impulses&mdash;as in every
blood mixture. In the end she would fall back to a primitiveness
she could not escape; and beautiful as she was now, another ten
years would see her a stolid Arapahoe squaw, pulled back to Indian
habits and Indian reasoning. The tragedy of Cherry was a plain
thing to Frank Peace. She was not responsible for that warfare in
her own veins, and she could not escape it.</p>

<p>He went back to the porch and smoked out his pipe, and afterward
rolled his blankets by the troopers' fire for the night. Millard
hadn't returned.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">
AT six o'clock they rounded into Fort Sanders. Overmile was
restless and wanted to be directly on the way to Laramie but they
had supper in the officers' quarters before swinging out upon the
muddy trail north. Archie Millard walked beside their horses to the
guard gate, moody and withdrawn.</p>

<p>He said: "General Gibbon tells me I am at your disposal, Frank.
I shall be here whenever you want me."</p>

<p>The morning before there had been no track here; but now the
fresh yellow grade held fresh steel and a line of supply trains
crept across it, Laramie bound, the engine fireboxes guttering raw
crimson into the swelling dusk. All the cars held Irishmen,
pleasure bent, to christen this new town.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "They sure do work fast."</p>

<p>"Millard," sald Peace, "is about ready to jump his commission.
We've got to stop that, Leach."</p>

<p>"How do you stop the things in a man's head?" drawled Overmile.
He turned in his saddle to have a long look at Peace. "You're a
hard one, Frank. Give these two people some sympathy. It might
happen to you."</p>

<p>They rode out of the darkness into the full boil of Laramie Town
celebrating its birth. Lusty racket rolled down the muddy street to
meet them, a street bursting into swift and brilliant and wicked
flower from the raw earth. Shoulder to shoulder sat the tented
saloons, the dance halls, the flimsy-framed stores, their fronts
making a ragged up-and-down pattern. The hurdy-gurdy music of
Campeaux's big saloon rolled up to the astonished sky. The spielers
were calling their wares, and hammer and saw kept up a steady tone.
This was another Cheyenne, with the high-wheeled freighters jamming
the narrow way and two thousand Irishmen roaming the dark in search
of excitement, and the high piles of steel and ties and material
lying familiarly over by Jack Casement's portable commissary shack.
There was a single coach sitting in froot of Laramie's improvised
depot.</p>

<p>"Dodge is probably there," said Peace, and turned that way.</p>

<p>Overmile was chuckling in a pleased fashion, "A wild,
hellraisin' night. It makes a pretty show."</p>

<p>They worked their way through the heavy line of wagons, aiming
for the solitary passenger coach, A man stepped down from it and
walked leisurely forward, and at sight of him Peace dismounted
instantly. Overmile took Peace's horse and rode away toward the
railroad corrals.</p>

<p>"General," said Peace, "I'm mighty glad to see you."</p>

<p>General Dodge pulled a cigar from his mouth. He looked at Peace
with a gray, hard eye, and extended his arm, speaking affably.
"Understood you'd be here tonight. You look well."</p>

<p>He was a man of medium build, this General Dodge whose word was
law on the road. Still in his middle thirties, he had the calmness
and the certainty of one much older. Behind him stood a wonderful
army record and the thorough confidence of Grant and Sherman. A
short black beard hid the play of his face. He didn't waste much
talk.</p>

<p>"Reed's overloaded with work. It's all he can do to keep the job
organized, The responsibility of keeping trouble from tying us up
is yours. You've got to see that these contractors stay far enough
out so that the steel don't catch up with them, I don't want to
wait for unfinished bridges, and I don't want to lose time on
account of tunnels that haven't been bored. As for these towns, the
railroad is responsible for order. Government expects us to provide
merchants with a certain amount of protection. If the crooks want
another Julesburg cleanup give it to them."</p>

<p>He quit talking. His head turned aside from Peace and he put his
cigar between his teeth. A dapper and slightly stooped little man
with a Vandyke beard came forward at a rapid, nervous stride. He
said, "Hello, Dodge," and offered a slender hand. The two men shook
in a brief way.</p>

<p>Dodge drawled, "Durant, this is Frank Peace. He's Reed's
assistant."</p>

<p>T. C. Durant, vice-president of the road, nodded impersonally at
Peace. Dodge, thoroughly blunt, said immediately: "Hear you've been
telling Laramie people they'd have the connection to Denver,
instead of Cheyenne having it. And you sent your consulting
engineer out here to change my location lines."</p>

<p>"Seymour didn't like your Jines," said Durant. "As for the
change of division-point&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll play hell," broke in Dodge. "I told the Laramie people
an hour ago they needn't expect any connection from Denver. That's
Cheyenne's. And neither Seymour nor anyone else will change my
lines while I'm running the job. I don't propose to have it."</p>

<p>Durant flicked Dodge with a veiled, skeptical glance. "May be a
difference of opinion there," he said, and went on down the street
at the same light and nervous stride.</p>

<p>Dodge turned back to Peace. "I'm staging it to Salt Lake
tomorrow, Remember, the responsibility for keeping trouble down is
yours. Good luck." With that he wheeled back into the car, the
cigar laying a wake of smoke behind.</p>

<p>Overmile had put up the horses and returned. The two of them
idled across the wagon-choked street, being absorbed in the
restless, steady stream of construction men crowding the walk. All
the windows and doorways flushed the shadows with a raw, smoky
light, and the warm air gushing from these buildings had the strong
blend of sweat and damp woolen clothes and, tobacco smoke and
whisky and wood smoke. Caught in the human riptide boiling around
the wide entrance of the Club, Peace came face to face with Phil
Morgan.</p>

<p>Morgan grinned in his dry way. "Let's have a look."</p>

<p>The three of them shouldered into Campeaux's Club, the flash of
the fifty-foot mirror on the saloon's back bar coming against their
eyes, like an explosion. All the games were in full blast. The
orchestra&mdash;changed from afternoon's brass band to evening's
more decorous string instruments&mdash;sat on a far platform and
hurled its melody against the rising confusion. Over there on the
dance floor the white faces of women and the color of their evening
dresses went around&mdash;and around in a blurred and blending
pattern. The noise of this place struck Peace in every key. There
was no calm, only a kind of surge that swelled more and more
vitally against the canvas ceiling of the tent. The partners pushed
their way to the bar and caught the eye of one of the dozen
scudding barkeeps; they got their whisky and stood meditatively
together, drinking.</p>

<p>"Going with Dodge tomorrow?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"No, we've got another job." Then Peace said: "Wait a
minute."</p>

<p>A big-bellied Irishman with vermilion cheeks shouted, "Hello,
Bucko," and slapped him on the back.</p>

<p>Peace grinned and pushed on toward the side of the Club where
the gambling rigs were. Men kept drifting across his way; men kept
hailing him. The music stopped and the whole crowd swayed toward
the bar, the women on the dance floor starting the parade with
their partners. Blocked momentarily by this rush, Peace heard a
voice say in a swift undertone: "Mr. Peace," and he swung himself
around and found Rose&mdash;the pale, obscure girl who had come
from Omaha on the work-passenger train beside him. But she was
neither pale nor obscure now. Dressed in a low-cut gown as
attractive as fashion could make it, she made a jewel-like glow in
this confused atmosphere. Her hair was dressed carefully, piled
back on her head and edged with short ringlets. Her shoulders, bare
and smooth, rose faintly to command his attention; she had a pink
color on her cheeks&mdash;and she was smiling at him. Yet her voice
was guarded.</p>

<p>"Be careful tonight." Then her hands came up with a little
gesture of resignation, as though she had been refused, and she
wheeled immediately from him and put her hand through another man's
arm. She said: "To the bar, Paddy. Don't be stingy with your
money."</p>

<p>Peace parted the crowd before him with a swing of his shoulders,
coming beside Roy Lovelace who sat on a high stool and dealt the
blackjack game. An eye shade on Lovelace's forehead threw a green
light down across the spare and composed fatalism of his face. His
long fingers dropped the cards, one by one, in front of the
players; none of the rest of his figure, covered by a fine black
broadcloth suit, moved at all, But he felt Peace's presence and a
moment later lifted his glance, His expression didn't break out of
its strict indifference. Only his voice changed, becoming even and
cordial, "Hello, Frank."</p>

<p>A player's quick voice said, "Hit this," and Lovelace swung his
attention back to the game. A tall woman stood directly behind
Lovelace&mdash;Lovelace's wife who always remained behind him when
he played; showing this rough and violent crowd a strange, unmoved
fidelity.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Where are the kids, Helen?"</p>

<p>"In bed. Can you have supper with us tonight?"</p>

<p>"I won't be here. Just wanted to tell you I have a couple
presents coming from Omaha, for the children&mdash;and for
you."</p>

<p>She was like Lovelace, steeled against smiling. But a warmth
reached out from her fine eyes and touched him. He felt it even as
he turned back to the bar. Morgan and Overmile had vanished,
apparently too restless to wait. The turgid noise of this crowded
place slapped him more definitely as he pushed toward the doorway.
A woman's flat and excited laughter sliced through the confusion,
rasping across his nerves. Somebody prodded him in the ribs;
looking down, he saw a little man struggling against the tidal
pressure. The little man's lips moved. He reached up to pull at
Peace's shoulder.</p>

<p>He said: "You lookin' for Ed Tarrant?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peace.</p>

<p>The little man said gustily: "He's up to Straight-Edge Annie's
place, in trouble."</p>

<p>Peace said, "What&mdash;" But the current had caught the little
man securely in its undertow, dragging him away.</p>

<p>On the street again, Peace looked around and saw neither Morgan
nor Overmile. He got out his pipe and filled it, and dragged a few
long breaths of smoke into his lungs, his thinking at once
critically alert. The Club's orchestra was again hard at work;
somewhere down the street two shots made flat, detonating echoes
against the wind. Across the street an engine backed away from the
station house, its bell insistently clanging. Peace let the crowd
carry him toward the next corner; and here he slid out of the tide
into the comparative quiet of a short side street. Down this way a
few lights glowed through tent flaps and a few flashes came down
from the second-story windows of a pine-boarded building sitting
thirty feet further on, which was Straight-Edge Annie's place.</p>

<p>That way he drifted. There was a stairway leading up the outside
wall of the place; he stopped at the foot of it, studying the
surrounding shadows with his insistent eyes. Afterward he climbed
the stairs and put his hand to the knob of the door. It let him
into a hall illumined by one lamp bracketed against the boards.
There was a murmuring and a burst of nervous laughter from a far
room, and then that sound died completely and the uneasy stillness
of the place rubbed against him like a damp fog. A little ahead of
him, on the left side of the hall, he noticed a door standing ajar,
through the opening of which crept a thin slice of light.</p>

<p>He said casually: "Straight-Edge."</p>

<p>Silence flowed around him. But he had the smell of something on
his nostrils&mdash;the slimmest taint of powder smoke trapped in
this dead air. It moved him against the door. He laid the flat of
his hand against it, shoving it open. What he saw then jerked him
straight.</p>

<p>There was a lamp on the table, its sallow glow staining the
shadows of this room the color of mud. Ed Tarrant lay on his chest
on the floor, his face twisted to one side. A round, dully shining
pool of blood slowly gathered beneath him.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the hall a board squealed and, small as that
sound was, it was like a dynamite explosion to Frank Peace. He
wheeled in his tracks, ramming his fist into his coat pocket to
grip the revolver he carried there. A doorway across the hall swung
quietly back on its hinges. He saw somebody moving in the depths of
that room's blackness, and immediately he swayed aside. At the same
moment a round bloom of ragged light burst through the doorway. The
breath of the bullet licked across his face and the whole building
swelled and shook with the detonation. The slug struck into the
wall behind Peace with a small, snoring report.</p>

<p>Peace dropped to the floor, his long, loose body flattened
against the boards; the marksman across the way let out a windy
sigh and began to rake the room with a rapid, plunging fire.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">
FLATTENED along the base of the dark room's wall, his head just
short of the doorway, he listened with a wire-thin attention as
those repeated gunshots swelled and thundered echoes through the
house. A bullet ripped the casing just above his head; a bullet
made a chance target of the lamp on the table, shattering the
globe, whipping out the light. Powder smoke thickened around him, a
windowpane's burst fragments jangled down; one of Straight-Edge
Annie's girls was screaming as steadily and automatically as though
she were wound up. The whole building shivered. Peace counted those
shots as they came.</p>

<p>He counted five and drew one knee beneath him, and remained
crouched that way. There was one more shot to come. The hidden
marksman's breathing began to rasp through a palpitating stillness.
The man was smart; he wasn't wasting his last bullet. Peace brought
his weapon forward and stretched his arm full length into the
doorway, and dragged the barrel across the fioor, making a sharp
break in the quiet. Hard on the heels of the sound, the gun across
the hall drove one more bullet sullenly through the dark.</p>

<p>Peace said aloud, "six," and was on his feet, tramping through
the doorway without hurry.</p>

<p>The darkness was heavy, additionally thickened by powder smoke
pouring along the hall. The man over there scraped his feet
uncertainly across squealing boards&mdash;and quit moving. Peace
bent his high body forward. His fingers touched a wall and slid
along it until they fell off into the doorway. He went through that
opening low and fast, swinging in one fist, and struck the man dead
in the chest with his driving shoulders.</p>

<p>That long, stiff dive carried them both across that room until
they slammed into the far wall. The man's breath was hot and full
on him and a fist reached out of the black and laid a slanting blow
along his face, a ring on it ripping a clean furrow through his
cheek flesh. Both the man's arms gripped him doggedly then and a
knee came up and jolted him in the groin. He swung away and they
went wheeling around the blackness with the other one's weight
bearing against him, with the other one finding his face again with
those short, beating jabs. His gun hand was pinned to his side; his
free arm clung to the fellow's coat. His boots snagged the raw
floor and he fell backward, hauling the other over with him. His
head struck the boards fully, the concussion lighting up his brain.
He lay like that a moment, rolling his knees to protect himself. He
got his knees under the man's stomach and broke free. They were
both crawling around the black, but Peace heard the other one's
breathing continue to labor violently, and by that sound he placed
his target and lifted his gun. He put a single shot over
there&mdash;and heard it strike.</p>

<p>He heard it strike, and he heard the man suddenly roll and lose
his breath in a long, strangled sighing. Sitting on the floor,
blood creeping down a cheek that seemed to be on fire, he listened
to the man die. It was as plain and brutal as that. Stillness was
settling in heavy layers around him, but somebody's feet were
pounding up the outside stairway&mdash;violently enough to rock
this shell of a building. Overmile's voice smacked through the
dark.</p>

<p>"Peace!"</p>

<p>Peace said: "Wait a minute. Annie!" His call struck down the
black hall, piling against the closed doors. The outside stairway
rattled under more traffic.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "What's this?"</p>

<p>Peace rose and found the room's doorway. At the far end of the
hall a faint glow gushed out of a crack, as though a lamp had just
been lighted. Overmile was shuffling forward, exploring the
blackness.</p>

<p>Peace lifted his call more peremptorily. "Come out of there,
Annie."</p>

<p>Phil Morgan said, from the stair landing: "That you, Peace?"</p>

<p>A door opened, flushing its square beam of light into the hall.
Straight-Edge Annie walked from her room, throwing a high and bony
shadow before her. Of a sudden, other doors swung hack and women
stood there in the half light, all their faces strained and full of
fear. Morgan and Overmile tramped rapidly toward Peace.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "What the hell is this?"</p>

<p>"Annie," said Peace, "bring a light."</p>

<p>Annie's voice was as rough and heavy as a man's. She threw that
order behind her. "Bring a light." And then she advanced on Peace.
She was almost as tall as he was, with a head of iron-gray hair and
a half-masculine face.</p>

<p>She said: "Before God, Frank, I had no part in this!"</p>

<p>One of the girls came up with a lamp. Peace said, no feeling in
his talk, "Be quiet, Annie," and took the lamp. He swung it around
so that its light struck across the room in which he had staged his
fight&mdash;and so that it touched the dead one on the floor.
Overmile and Morgan were crowded beside him.</p>

<p>"Dollarhide," grunted Overmile.</p>

<p>Peace wheeled. His stare struck Annie hard enough to drop her
shoulders. Her talk jumped at him, frightened and quick. "Listen.
Mitch came here and told us to stay in our rooms. Next thing I
beard somebody run up the stairs. I heard Mitch call out Ed
Tarrant's name, and then there was a shot. It wasn't more than two
minutes before when you came."</p>

<p>At mention of Tarrant's name Overmile seized the lamp from Peace
and wheeled over to the other room. He stood there a minute,
shedding light down on Tarrant's still bulk, and came back, his
face drawn at once to a wicked, pale wedge. The light of his eyes
then was yellow; it was full of compressed, frigid rage.</p>

<p>"Annie, you slut!"</p>

<p>Peace stopped him there. He said, "Wait, Leach."</p>

<p>Temper rolled around his vitals, squeezing them. His talk beat
out at Straight-Edge Annie. It roughened her up, it bit her like
physical punishment. "You didn't open the door when Tarrant was
shot?"</p>

<p>"Me?" she cried. "No! Mitch told me to keep out of the way! How
was I to know? Mitch always carried out Sid Campeaux's orders. When
Campeaux talks to me I mind. Why not? He runs this place. It's his
building and he's my boss! My God, you know what he'd do to me?
He'd bust in my face!"</p>

<p>"You don't know how Tarrant came to be here?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>Phil Morgan looked at Peace. "How'd you get here?"</p>

<p>Peace told him. Morgan said: "Then that's how Tarrant got here.
Somebody told him he was wanted here, and he came up and ran into
Dollarhide's gun. Then you came up, marked for the next shot, It
was done cleverly. We were waiting for you in the saloon when
somebody walked ever and told Leach that Reed wanted to see both of
us at the train. We were pulled out of the way, like that."</p>

<p>Peace said: "Move out of here, Annie. You and your girls."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Peace walked into the room where Tarrant lay. He stooped down,
running his hand beneath the man's body, He pulled Tarrant up and
lifted him all at once over his shoulder, and marched down the
hall.</p>

<p>Annie said, "Frank&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>But Overmile growled. "Shut up," and these three men descended
the outside stairway.</p>

<p>Life boomed along Main Street; darkness and quietness still held
this side alley. The recent firing had meant nothing to Laramie
Town, it had drawn no crowd. There was a tent across the alley,
with light shining through its open flap, Peace walked into it,
laying Tarrant on the floor, A round, apple-cheeked little man with
bright eyes lay half turned on a straw mattress, reading by the
glow of a candle driven into a ketchup bottle. He pulled his
attention from the book. He reared up, at once complaining.</p>

<p>"Hey&mdash;this ain't no morgue."</p>

<p>Peace said: "Stop that, Ab."</p>

<p>Ab Kein took another careful look. He rose then. "Tarrant." He
ran one small hand across the absolute nakedness of his head. "My
goodness&mdash;my goodness! Such a terrible thing!" Then he thought
of something; it lifted his shoulders and caused him to remove his
spectacles and put them carefully away. "Boys, you wait till I get
my gun and I'll go with you."</p>

<p>Peace turned out. He stood a moment, with Morgan and Overmile
and Ab Kein beside him, his glance pinned to Straight-Edge Annie's
house across the way. Tarrant had been a solid friend, a big and
hearty man who cared more for the fun of these last two reckless
years than for the profits of his construction work. Peace
remembered him at Julesburg, standing squarely in the middle of the
rioting gamblers, his huge fists mowing them down as they came
against him, all the while laughing that deep, careless laugh out
of his chest. Peace recalled it vividly, the tone of Tarrant's
unquenchable voice with him now, as clear and resonant as in life.
The hatred of the toughs surrounded them like a blazing
fire&mdash;and the toughs had got Tarrant at last. It was, Peace
considered, the first break. Looking up to a sky sullenly glowing
from Laramie's lights, he realized then that neither Morgan nor
Overmile nor he could expect any letup in that fiercely unreasoning
animosity, They were out to kill him and to kill his own close
friends. They would never stop until they had paid him back for
Julesburg, until they had destroyed him.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "When you make up your mind, Frank, let's know
what it is."</p>

<p>"Rose," Peace muttered, "warned me. So this stunt was in the
air. It was bein' published on Campeaux's grapevine system. But
Lovelace didn't know it, or he would have told me."</p>

<p>"Trust no gamblers, Frank."</p>

<p>"Lovelace is white. Wait a minute."</p>

<p>He headed out of the alley, into the solid stream of wild
Irishmen roving through Laramie Town. Overmile said, behind him:
"Reed said I was to stick to you. So I stick to you."</p>

<p>Peace stopped on the walk, splitting the traffic with his
shoulders; it swayed him and turned him, but he stood there until
he saw the man he wanted to see, a gray-headed man built like a
water barrel, with his fists hanging down from his long arms in the
manner of rock chunks. Peace reached out and his fingers caught
Collie Moynihan. Collie looked up at Peace and smiled in a wicked,
happy way.</p>

<p>He said: "You want somethin', Mr. Peace?"</p>

<p>"There's a pile of double-bitted axes over in Jack Casement's
warehouse, Collie, Find yourself thirty good lads and go get 'em.
I'll be waiting for you in front of Straight-Edge Annie's."</p>

<p>Collie Moynihan had been in Julesburg with Peace. He looked
carefully up to the tall man now and saw the black devil in Peace's
eyes. Collie had been smiling; he laughed now and said, "'Twill be
less a wait than you'd think, Mister Peace," and whirled and went
down the street with his granite fists beating a path. He was
saying in a loud and hearty way: "Just thirty of the best, me boys.
Just thirty&mdash;a wan or two more&mdash;for some fun."</p>

<p>Peace tramped back into the alley. Morgan and Ab Kein were still
in front of the tent; two men came down the stairway of
Straight-Edge Annie's place, carrying the dead Mitch Dollarhide.
They crawled rapidly back through a little lane to one side of the
building. Lights began to sparkle through the windows of the place.
Out on Main Street a long, high tone whirled its way with the wind
and caught hold of the crowd, touching off the latent, tinder-dry
violence. At once the alley was full of noise, with Collie
Moynihan's chosen ones rushing headlong into it, the bright steel
bits of their borrowed axes whitely flashing in the little shafts
of light crossing the dark.</p>

<p>Collie Moynihan said: "And what is it to be, Mister Peace?"</p>

<p>Peace said: "There's a building that belongs to Campeaux,
Collie. Tear it down."</p>

<p>The wickedness of it went like fire through them and a rash,
high yell ripped the shadows apart. They were wheeling and running
against the building before he had quite finished talking, with
their axes slung forward, in the manner of soldiers storming a
fort&mdash;as in fact many of them had done during rebellion. They
struck Straight-Edge Annie's house head-on, slamming their axes
into the wood wherever they reached it. Collie Moynihan went up the
outside stairway with part of his crew behind him, into the second
story. Men made a breach through the sudden-shattered windows of
the lower floor. The door sprang off its hinge; the long, loosely
nailed planks began to groan and drop all around.</p>

<p>Straight-Edge Annie's girls ran out of the place, cursing as
they came, and all this fury irresistibly towed the restless
traffic off Main Street. Lanterns were striking a fresher beam down
the alley. Beds and mattresses and furniture tumbled from the
second-floor windows; shingles flew off the roof and a man, working
from the attic of the place, chopped himself a hole and crawled up
and walked along the ridge-pole. Others followed and immediately
they were strung out along the roof, tearing it apart. A whole
section of the front wall sagged out and fell. Peace, never moving
from his position, had a full look into one dingy room.</p>

<p>Leach Overmile grumbled, "Look out, Frank," and moved
deliberately in front of Peace, taking his station between Peace
and the thickening crowd at the alley's mouth.</p>

<p>Peace looked that way and saw only a mass of faces turned
in&mdash;the blackened faces, the boarded faces, the mixed faces of
a rough-and-tumble crowd avidly witnessing this destruction. These
were the men building the Union, these were the sharp-witted ones
and the mule skinners and the desperadoes. He saw that bulk for
what it was&mdash;raw and undisciplined and dangerous. Wild enough
for a wild country. But he wasn't afraid of it. Some of that mob's
virtues were his virtues, some of its faults his faults. There was
no quietness in it; there was no quietness in him. And afterward
his turning glance met a woman's grave eyes. Nan Normandy stood
over there, imprisoned in the crush. She was watching him, not the
collapsing house. She was watching him all the while.</p>

<p>A ripping detonation jerked him around. The roof had fallen in
on the second floor and Moynihan's boys were up there jiggling on
the flattened shingles. Others were crawling out of the wreckage,
coming down a stairway swaying under their weight. Like all
buildings along the road, this one had been nothing more than a
shell of boards hooked to a fragile skeleton&mdash;and now it fell
piece by piece. Moynihan came skipping down the stairs, Axes
slashed into the steps; two-by-fours began squalling against the
nails that held them, and then the stairway crashed to the ground.
A plank behind the building burst like a gunshot, releasing some
key support, and the weight of the wrecked upper story sagged on
the lower supports. Moynihan's men swarmed around to one side of
the building. Moynihan's voice yelled:
"Together&mdash;yo&mdash;yo&mdash;yo!"</p>

<p>They were putting their weight against it. Of a sudden the lower
floor slid sidewise and Straight-Edge Annie's house crumpled
completely to the ground, its skeleton and its framework, an
interlocked mass of boards pointed askew. There wasn't anything
left.</p>

<p>Overmile turned. He stared at Peace queerly. "What next?"</p>

<p>Moynihan trotted up, the sweat pouring down his face and
drenching his cotton shirt. He cocked his gray head, smiling in a
glittering, pleased way. "Would there be another buildin' to wurrk
on, Mr. Peace?"</p>

<p>Peace said: "The drinks are on Sid Campeaux."</p>

<p>Overmile murmured, "A nice thought," and betrayed the rage in
him by a sudden lift of his pale glance. He followed Peace as the
latter shouldered his way through the crowd. There wasn't any mercy
or caution in Peace then, and Overmile, keyed to expect anything
from this unpredictable partner, lengthened his gait. Moynihan's
men were storming along behind. Peace wheeled at the Club's wide
doorway and went in. And stopped.</p>

<p>The excitement outside had drained this vast barn of a place
dry. Through the layered smoke he saw the barkeeps making a lonely
stand behind the long bar; the band sat idly on the platform, and
all Campeaux's girls made a tight knot in the far corner, looking
uncertainly out across the barren floor. There wasn't a player at
any of the tables. Roy Lovelace sat on his stool, dealing himself a
game of solitaire, and his wife stood, as always, by his shoulder
with an indifference to whatever else might happen. The rest of the
gamblers sat by their rigs, woodenly watching Peace. Campeaux had
placed himself at the end of the bar with Al Brett at his right
hand, with four other men ranked behind him.</p>

<p>Moynihan's men crowded up. Peace crossed over, walking along the
bar until he was near enough to see Campeaux's lids rise and
uncover a blank, thoroughly inscrutable glance.</p>

<p>Peace said, over his shoulder: "Ask for what you want,
Collie&mdash;it's on the house, If you don't get it, take it."
Campeaux's lids drew nearer together. Al Brett's feet crept farther
apart. The pale composure of this blond gunman's face was
unbreakable.</p>

<p>"Sid," said Peace, "we've pulled your building down and the boys
are dry. It's your treat."</p>

<p>Campeaux murmured: "Your fun comes high, for me. Someday it'll
come high, for you."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be much of a job to pull this joint down, Sid,"
Peace said that softly, but there was no softness in him. He made a
black, high shape in this sultry light. The set of his face was
unruly, it was heavy with an anger prowling through him.</p>

<p>Campeaux lifted his arm to the nearest barkeep. "On the house."
Moynihan's Irishmen yelled. Al Brett's feet kept shifting on the
floor; a faintly florid color got into his cheeks.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Mitch Dollarhide made a mistake in judgment, and
he's dead. Don't send dumb men after me, Campeaux."</p>

<p>"I'll remenrber that, Bucko," murmured Campeaux. Then he
permitted a little emotion to warm his talk. "You're a fool, which
I have just discovered. You turned the dogs loose tonight, like you
did in Julesburg. It's a risky thing&mdash;as you'll remember when
I turn that pack against you."</p>

<p>Peace showed his streaked smile. "I don't hire men to do my
chores, Sid. Something about you stinks to me." He stared at
Campeaux in a way that was hopefully eager. "Take exception to the
remark?"</p>

<p>Campeaux's big jaws grew tight. He let the sighing moment go by;
his lids shut out another fraction of his eyes. "No," he said, "not
now. I'll just remember what you said."</p>

<p>Peace laughed then and that laugh slapped Campeaux across the
cheeks deliberately. He turned and walked across the long floor,
out through the doorway. Overmile, set on thin edge, slowly backed
away, not letting his glance stray from Al Brett, so obviously
cocked for trouble. He retreated in this manner as far as the
doorway and wheeled to follow Peace. Morgan had come up. The three
of them went along the walk, past Laramie's tents and log huts and
raw pine buildings.</p>

<p>"You cut things pretty fine," sighed Overmile,</p>

<p>"Where's Tarrant's people?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>Peace said: "We'll wire them tonight. In Omaha." There was the
smell of coffee in the wind. Peace saw a small counter inside a
tent-cabin's doorway. He swung there on impulse and went in. He had
his head down, and he didn't lift it until he had pulled his long
body up to a stool. But when he did he found Nan Normandy standing
behind the counter.</p>

<p>Overmile said, deeply pleased, "You're here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and continued to look at Peace. It was as he
had remembered&mdash;that pride and gravity written in her eyes. A
self-reliance that struck him with a force. But he dropped his head
again, weariness pressing on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Coffee, if you've got it." Overmile was talking, drawling
gaiety in his tone, definitely shaken out of his somber mood.</p>

<p>Peace heard her step back beyond a partition to a kitchen
beyond. He rested his head between his two broad hands, shielding
his eyes from the light. The aftermath of a fight was always like
this, the heat and the fury draining out a man, to leave him empty.
His muscles ached, his nerves were like hot wires.</p>

<p>Coming back with the coffee, Nan Normandy observed the drawn
quality of his face. She put a cup in front of him, gentle in the
way she spoke.</p>

<p>"You need this."</p>

<p>Overmile said complainingly: "How about me?"</p>

<p>Peace drank his coffee black. The heat of it jolted him a
little, it pulled him out of a deep hole. Nan Normandy stood back
from the counter, hands behind her. The light was kind to her,
softening and tinting her cheeks. Her shoulders made a pleasant
shape against the rough wall, and a remote smiling turned the
corners of her lips. It was something, Peace thought, that lived
unquenchably inside her.</p>

<p>Phil Morgan dropped his question into the silence with a suave
dryness. "This your place, Miss Normandy?"</p>

<p>She said, "Yes," and let her eyes touch Morgan a moment. The
man's manner put something into her glance that was thoroughly
enigmatic. As though she felt and reacted to the skepticism with
which he regarded all women.</p>

<p>"Rough country for you," commented Morgan.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, "I like life that way."</p>

<p>"It may be," agreed Morgan, and rose from his stool, paying the
bill.</p>

<p>Overmile got up reluctantly. "You're a light in a weary world. I
think I better drink my coffee more often. It ain't a bad habit."
The two men stood there waiting for Peace to go. Peace slowly
revolved his cup, watching the grounds stir in the bottom. He
didn't move and he didn't say anything, and Phil Morgan, keen in
his observations, spoke up then:</p>

<p>"Come on, Leach."</p>

<p>"What the hell?" grunted Overmile.</p>

<p>Peace looked around, minutely surprised. Overmile stood high and
solemn in the light, discontent rippling his cheeks; and then he
followed Morgan out of the place. Peace turned back to the
girl.</p>

<p>"Usually," she observed, "you are more direct in your
methods."</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed. "I wanted to stay. I wanted to see you."</p>

<p>"Here I am."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not for any reason. Not because I'm
curious."</p>

<p>She said gently: "Just because?"</p>

<p>"I guess so." He spread his elbows out on the counter, and he
let his glance absorb the fullness of the picture she made against
the barren wall. The color of her hair was rich yellow. Her eyes
were hazel and as steady as any he had ever seen. Self-reliance, he
thought again. But there was more to her than that. A love of life
that her lips could not entirely hide, a hunger that her reserve
could not entirely suppress. In all her ways she was a brave, fair
woman. He felt it more and more keenly.</p>

<p>He said, all out of patience: "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>She was suddenly smiling in a way that lighted all her
expressive features.</p>

<p>"Well," he admitted, "strike out the question. Maybe I am
curious."</p>

<p>She ceased to smile. "No," she said, "I want to tell you, I'm
here because it is where I want to be. Because there isn't any
reason why I should be elsewhere. My father ran away when I was
seven. My mother died a year later. I was brought up by relatives
in St. Louis&mdash;and I was supposed to marry a man there and be
content to go on living in St. Louis. It was a family arrangement,
made many years ago." She stopped to give him a long, thoughtful,
glance. "How can I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Restless?" he suggested. "Unhappy?"</p>

<p>"No, people have always been kind to me. But it has always been
an impersonal kindness. I never really belonged to anybody, after
Mother died. Nobody belonged to me. I stayed in a house with my
uncle and my aunt and my cousins. But I only stayed there, just
somebody extra. It didn't matter, to me or to them. Do you see? An
emptiness."</p>

<p>He said: "What do you expect to find here?"</p>

<p>Her small, reliant shoulders lifted and fell. "Who knows? But
life shouldn't be empty for anyone. It should be full, it should
mean something."</p>

<p>"There are some bad endings to that trail," he pointed out.</p>

<p>It was her strong pride that he saw then; it straightened her.
"Not for me. I'm not afraid&mdash;and I want nothing cheap." Her
manner changed. She came toward the counter. "You have been hurt. I
was walking in the alley, I saw you carry your friend down the
stairway."</p>

<p>He rose, tired and yet still restless. He said: "Do you have to
stay here?"</p>

<p>She gave him a long glance, that calm and direct and candid
exploration setting up in him a definite reaction. She said,
"Callie," and waited until a high-yellow Negro girl came out of the
back room. "Keep the place for a few minutes, Callie." She came
around the corner.</p>

<p>In the street, Peace took her arm and they walked like that
through the straying crowd. All the lights of this bawdy, turbulent
little town were glittering into the prairie black and all the
games were going again in the joints shouldering one another so
closely along the street. The band in the Club had resumed its
playing, and the solid boom of men's voices in there swelled
against the canvas. Across the muddy road a long work train clanked
past, carrying its materials to end of track just beyond town. The
wind was softer; the thin, high air had turned bland. They were
walking alone now, out in the darkness with the shadow of Laramie
Peak ahead. Peace felt the gentle pressure of her shoulder as they
strolled thus, he felt the softness and resilience of her body. It
comforted him, easing the low and heavy irritation that clawed his
nerves.</p>

<p>"There is one other reason," said Nan Normandy. "This spring I
heard that my father had been seen out here. I should like to see
him&mdash;to know what he looked like. He's the only person in the
world I can claim."</p>

<p>"Suppose you found him," said Peace. "What would you say to
him?"</p>

<p>They went idly on, a long silence coming between.</p>

<p>When she at last spoke her voice was very gentle. "I don't know.
I think he broke Mother's heart. Yet from all that I have been told
about him he was a man born with wanderlust in him, unable to be
still and unable to stand responsibility. I want to find him. To
tell him I hate him&mdash;or to tell him I'm sorry for him." Her
tone dropped to a gentleness. "I don't know which."</p>

<p>He stopped and the peremptory gesture of his arm brought her
around. Her face lifted, white and soft in this darkness, her
straight figure swaying faintly. He said, "There are few women like
you," and the sense of her presence was stronger and stronger to
him, feeding the wild impulse that flashed its way through his
restraint. He pulled her toward him, he lifted her head and kissed
her in a hard, half-angered manner. She let him have his way, with
the pressure of her lips, unsettling him beyond anything he had
known.</p>

<p>He stepped back. He dropped his hands. She made a still shape in
the shadows. He said carefully: "I don't think I can explain
that."</p>

<p>Her voice was one note above whispering. "I can. You are a very
full man, Frank. So full that your needs hurt you. You have a girl
in Cheyenne waiting for you, but Cheyenne is far away&mdash;and
you're lonely."</p>

<p>He said almost humbly: "How did you know?"</p>

<p>"It isn't hard to know about you. You cut too wide a trail not
to throw your personality across other men and make them talk about
you."</p>

<p>They turned by common thought and strolled back.</p>

<p>There was no more ease between them. Something lay definitely
here, troubling him in a way he could not understand. They reached
the board walk and went along it, as far as her little restaurant,
She stood a moment in the doorway, one hand holding to the sill,
composed and aloof. He removed his hat.</p>

<p>"I shall not make that mistake again."</p>

<p>"Mistake?"</p>

<p>He said: "Impoliteness, then."</p>

<p>She smiled, her lips turned in a sweet, womanly way.</p>

<p>But he could no longer read her glance. The candidness was gone,
the directness gone. She turned without saying more.</p>

<p>Peace sheered off into the crowd. He went toward the Club and
stopped to pull his thinking together. The traveling stream of men
slowly turned him and shunted him until he stood at the edge of the
board walk. There he remained, his head tipped down and a long,
sharp line creased across his brow. He thought: "I'll have to find
Doc Harrison and tell him about Tarrant," and got out his pipe and
tobacco. There had been a moment of ease, and afterward he had
kissed this girl and a door had closed in his face. He clamped the
pipe between his teeth, drawing in the good smoke; his lips
stretched, and thus he stood, squinting at the lights of the
commissary shack across the way, not really seeing them.</p>

<p>Ab Kein walked into a corner of his vision, stopping there with
another man. Kein had huddled himself close to the other one,
talking swiftly. "You want to speculate, hey? Don't speculate, You
put your money into something sure, like I tell you. Here is
Laramie. It's brand-new. Someday it will be the biggest town in the
West. Why not? Look, Setters. Here's the railroad. Here's the land.
What's to stop it, hunh? It will be the greatest city you ever saw.
Thirty thousand next year. It's got six thousand now, ain't it?
Smell this air. Good air, ain't it? Sure&mdash;and you wait and see
the people come out here to get their health back. A hundred
thousand by 1900, I bet you. Maybe more. Now that lot on the corner
across from the club I will sell you at positively a ridiculous
figure: Three thousand, You'll sell it for five within thirty days.
Sold, huh?"</p>

<p>Setters said; "I ain't buyin'&mdash;I'm sellin'."</p>

<p>Ab Kein paused. His shoulders, fell and his voice changed. It
turned lackluster and discouraged. "That lot you got? My friend,
you was stung on it in the first place. Laramie don't grow that
direction. It grows west. How do I know your lot won't end up out
nowhere with the town two miles away? But I tell you. I'll give you
four hundred."</p>

<p>Setters bawled: "Why, you sawed-off little runt! Who was talkin'
about the biggest town in the West a minute ago?"</p>

<p>"Can I help it if I change my mind?" complained Ab Kein
persuasively. "Four hundred?"</p>

<p>"Six."</p>

<p>"Four-thirty."</p>

<p>"Six."</p>

<p>Ab's voice took on a note of extreme confidence. "Tell you what.
Four-fifty and five acres in Julesburg to boot."</p>

<p>Setters said, completely outraged: "I still got a piece in
Julesburg you sold me. Look at that place now. Deader'n a herring.
Six or nothin'."</p>

<p>"Is it my fault if the railroad changes its mind? Five is
positively my last offer. You bargain too close, Setters.
Five?"</p>

<p>"Sold."</p>

<p>"Come," said Ab quickly, "and we'll get it signed,"</p>

<p>Peace pushed his way down the street to Doc Frank Harrison's
office. He said: "Ed Tarrant's dead in Ab Kein's tent; I'm wiring
his people tonight," and left Harrison instantly.</p>

<p>He crossed over to the depot, spending a bad fifteen minutes on
the telegram. Afterward he went to Casement's big portable
commissary shack, one room of which was headquarters for the
Union's engineers. Phil Morgan lay in his blankets reading a
week-old copy of the New York Tribune. Leach Overmile sat beside a
table. He had his elbows on the table, rolling cigarettes; there
was a whole row of them in front of him. He turned his slim face
toward Peace, not saying a word, and the expression in his eyes was
hard for Peace to understand, being harassed and almost surly.
Peace stood there a moment, trying to read this long Texan. The
backs of his legs were tired and the reaction of the fight washed
its fatigue through him.</p>

<p>Overmile moved his shoulders a little and swung back to his
time-killing chore. He said: "Better hit the hay, Frank."</p>

<p>Phil Morgan lifted his glance from the paper. His attention
traveled from Peace to Overmile with a dry, acute interest.
Whatever he saw he kept to himself, storing it away in his
head.</p>

<p>Peace turned in. Long after the lights were out he lay watching
the black ceiling, one image and another racing before his eyes.
There was no coherence to them. He saw Tarrant lying on the floor;
he saw Straight-Edge Annie's building crash down. Then it was
Campeaux standing in the Club, stolidly concealing his hatred,
Sixty-eight, he thought, would be a bad year. Nan Normandy's quiet
talk returned to him again. "Life should never be empty." And
afterward he was thinking of Eileen Oliver, and the confusion in
his mind grew greater. The turbulent echoes of Laramie in festival
heaved and rattled on the commissary shack.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">
MAY went along, with the wind losing its softness day by day and
the sun spilling out a greater heat. The bunch and buffalo grass on
Laramie Plains slowly gave up its greenness, the stubborn sage
began to glitter with dust. Winter's little alkali lakes and pools
were receding, their exposed edges as white and flashing under the
sun as salt.</p>

<p>The track ran north on a yellow scooped-up grade, pointing
toward the black shape of Laramie Peak. A mile a day, two miles a
day, three miles a day. Jack Casement's terriers swarmed at end of
track, sweating and swearing and quarreling but pushing that steel
girdle farther out. Nothing stopped them save failure of supplies.
Forty cars of material to the mile, six hundred tons of it to the
mile&mdash;that was the stint set by Dan Casement back in Omaha who
had to feed the front, There was no rest. The Union's engines
funneled up a black smoke into the astonished sky by day and threw
a guttering firebox glow out into the startled prairie by night.
Those long rows of highpiled cars made an endless traffic, a
nervous, whistling, chuffing traffic baptizing the fresh rails,
settling the ties deeper into the fresh soil.</p>

<p>Casement's boarding train crept on, leaving behind at each
moving the debris of a thousand hard-playing, hard-fighting
Irishmen. Strung out ahead, two hundred miles or more, nine
thousand graders gutted out the ocher dust of the hill slopes to
smooth the right of way. The bridge and culvert gangs were twenty
miles ahead. Once Casement's terriers came charging down upon an
incomplete trestle and Jack Casement stood there at the end of
steel, blasting that crew with a wickedness that never ceased till
they had finished. Afterward he crossed it and tore on to make up
time.</p>

<p>Tie and timber gangs roved through the Black Hills. Sawmills
sundered gulch and ridge with sounds those ancient mountains had
never heard before; all the little streams were choked with
material floating toward right of way. Ties that summer were $1.25
apiece, delivered to grade. The high lumbering freighters moved in
steady stream away from end of track to supply the working force
beyond, to supply Salt Lake, even to supply the Central hurrying
eastward across the high Nevada desert. Long bands of antelope
scudded beside the grade, lifting high banners of dust; the crack
of the professional meat hunters' guns boomed along every remote
canyon. In the first days of June the Union, swinging westward out
of the Laramie plain, crossed the Medicine Bow River, and dropped
Medicine Bow down casually beside its right of way.</p>

<p>From Laramie to here the pace had been two miles a day. And now,
with the organization well shaken down and rumors of the Central's
fast pace, Casement squared himself toward the broken Hanna Basin
country and wired brother Dan at Omaha to speed up the supply
trains.</p>

<p>Swinging away from Medicine Bow, the tracks left the last trace
of fertility behind. Ahead lay only alkali flats and red rolling
ridges, through which the grade ran in a series of cuts and fills,
laying open the burned brick-brown and brick-red soil and its heavy
layers of marine deposits. All of the water turned bad, frothing up
in the engine boilers, corroding men's stomachs. This was June,
with a sun rolling across the vacant sky like a huge iron ball half
melted and half distorted by heat. All that scorching brilliance
poured down, turning the rails of the right of way bitter hot. Over
in the south the granite cone of Elk Mountain lay vaguely against
the heat fog; of an early morning the shape of the Sierra Madres
was a dim substance in the remote southwest. The freighting teams
were rolling up thick clouds of flour-thick alkali dust all along
the line. Casement's Paddies left a grave a day behind them on the
plain, sometimes more, It was sunstroke, typhoid, dysentery and
gunshot.</p>

<p>On the last day of June the rails of the Union charged down upon
the shallow North Platte and crossed to Fort Steele. On July first
the work trains rolled into Benton, three miles beyond, to find the
flimsy line of saloon and dive and gambling joint waiting in the
midst of the bitter, treeless, grassless desert.</p>

<p>It was, on that day, one small street holding the Club's big
tent and a half a dozen other bawdy establishments, Two days later,
when Frank Peace came up from Cheyenne, two thousand people were
there. In the intervening forty-eight hours a hundred tents had
been erected and half a hundred houses knocked together from a
ready-to-build pattern. Overmile was at the depot to meet Peace;
and the two of them stood awhile in the dusk of a scorching day to
see that sight and to marvel at it.</p>

<p>"Ain't she lovely?" drawled Overmile, "Hell itself ain't got a
thing like it."</p>

<p>It was Cheyenne and Laramie rolled together, with the virtue
left out and the man-eating wickedness increased. Lights burst
through yellow windows, glittering against a dust that was like a
heavy sea fog. Bedlam hammered out of the joints, confusion rolled
down the streets. A man stood on one corner and lifted his gun, and
shot three times through a second-story window, and pocketed his
gun and walked away. The barkers were lifting their coyote yells
from every saloon doorway; freighters lashed their long teams
through this thick street. Irishmen, thirsty and gaunt for trouble,
heaved a steady tide down the dusty way and lanterns beamed down
from roofs where men sawed and hammered without pause. A woman put
her head through the window so recently shot to pieces and began to
scream, drawing no attention. Benton, 698 miles from Omaha, had
caught its lusty stride.</p>

<p>"Bigger and better," muttered Peace.</p>

<p>"Nan's restaurant is down there," said Overmile, pointing. "I
helped her get settled yesterday. Bardee Oliver moved in yesterday,
too. Sam Reed's in his office. Seems to be a pow-wow. We got some
trouble, I hear."</p>

<p>A faint wind came across the desert; at 6500 feet it was cool.
They crossed the track, turning beside a row of flimsy office
shacks.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "They transferred Archie Millard from Sanders to
Fort Steele. I don't see why. You could have had another officer
for escort."</p>

<p>"I had him transferred," said Peace. "Don't want him around
Cherry."</p>

<p>Overmile shook his head. They had reached Reed's little shack
before he spoke. "It ain't that easy, Frank."</p>

<p>Peace stopped there in the dust. He said unfavorably: "What
would you do? Let Archie go to hell?"</p>

<p>Overmile wasn't smiling. He scrubbed a hand across his face. He
had got irritable all in a moment. "I don't know. I'm not educated
like you or Archie. I'm just a cowhand. Maybe that's why I pull for
this Cherry girl. She ain't educated, either. She just knows what
she wants."</p>

<p>"Ten years from now they'd both be miserable."</p>

<p>Overmile let out a long breath. "It's now&mdash;not ten years
from now, Frank. You know what that girl feels? I do. She'd rather
have a month with Archie than a whole damned life of what's right.
You don't see it?"</p>

<p>Frank said more gently: "I see it, Leach. Today would be swell
for them. And then it would be all over. Archie's in a bad shape
now. But a little grief when he's young won't hurt him. Then he'll
be glad to look back on something that wasn't more than a pleasant
memory. If he married her he'd be a squaw man&mdash;lookin' back to
what he might have been. That's worse than anything else."</p>

<p>Overmile stared at Peace. "You're a hard nut, Frank. I never
knew a harder one. Nothin' means anything to you except what's
right. Except your job. Someday you'll get hurt&mdash;and then
you'll know."</p>

<p>They went into Reed's office, finding both Reed and Casement
there. The room was blue with tobacco smoke. Casement roamed the
small quarters like an impatient terrier. Reed sat more calmly at
his desk, but he showed a troubled mind.</p>

<p>"I think you won't have any more trouble from Cheyenne," said
Peace.</p>

<p>"Fixed up?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Reed said: "You don't waste much time, Frank. Well, we got
plenty more trouble to worry about. The Central's coming up the
Humboldt. They're on level ground now, building fast. Nothing ahead
of them but a few small ranges. Evans wires me from Salt Lake that
they've sent their engineers into Weber Canyon, setting their lines
on top of our location stakes. Huntington's in Washington, turning
the Secretary of Interior there against us. I wouldn't give a
nickel right now for our chances of beating the Central to Salt
Lake. Somebody's been talkin' trouble with Casement's crew. The
feeling among the men isn't so good. Somebody got at 'em. I can't
find out who it is. There's been a tie-up at one of the graders'
camps up ahead. Man was killed and the work's stopped. That's Nick
Moylan's camp at Bitter Creek. It's your job. I don't care who's
killed&mdash;but get that grading going again."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Peace.</p>

<p>"General Grant will be at Fort Sanders, with Generals Sherman
and Sheridan, on the eighth."</p>

<p>Peace pricked up his ears. "Grant?"</p>

<p>Reed said: "Dodge is staging back from Salt Lake to meet Grant.
Durant's been causing trouble again and there's to be a showdown.
Finances back East are bad. Congress doesn't like us much, and the
Indians have raided our section lines in Nebraska twice this week.
You ride to Moylan's camp and see what's wrong."</p>

<p>Peace went out with Overmile. They strolled across the tracks
again and stopped short of the street's deep dust. Overmile said
indifferently: "Cup of coffee?"</p>

<p>"Where's Oliver's store?"</p>

<p>Overmile pointed. "There," he said, and cleared his throat. "See
you later." He went into the street rapidly, cutting across it
diagonally in the direotion of Nan Normandy's restaurant. Peace
watched him, remembering the Texan's strange ways these last few
weeks. But there was an impatience in him, rapidly rising. He
crossed and turned into a less crowded walk. Bardee Oliver had his
sign over a one-story frame building; Bardee was inside, dry and
laconic as usual.</p>

<p>"Ever been to Salt Lake, Frank?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Oliver shook his head. "Must be a real smart place. I freighted
fifty thousand dollars worth of goods to one firm there this month.
Might be a good place to set up business."</p>

<p>"Not unless you're a Mormon. Bardee."</p>

<p>Bardee looked at Peace with his shrewd eyes. "Maybe," he said,
"I better read up on that religion. Eileen's in back quarters. Ben
Latimer's there."</p>

<p>Peace tramped across the room, discontent getting into him. It
showed on his face when he knocked and was summoned in. Ben
Latimer, sitting in his chair like a schoolmaster, came slowly to
his feet. He said, "How do, Frank?" and got no answer.</p>

<p>Eileen stood in a corner, as it seemed always her habit, her
small body making a picture to Peace. He said, "Hello, Eileen."</p>

<p>Ben Latimer went quietly to the door. "Don't wish to be
intrudin'. I got the contract for five miles on Bitter Creek,
Frank. Nice, clean work."</p>

<p>Peace stood stubbornly in his tracks, and heard the door close
quietly behind him. It was a picture that never changed, of
Eileen's black head shining a little under the light, of a dark,
quick face modeled in a kind of strict attention. She was a compact
girl, strong-willed in her quiet way, and the serenity that he
remembered was here in this room as in all rooms touched by her
presence. He had carried the thought of that serenity with him. It
steadied him now, softening his hungers.</p>

<p>He spoke as evenly as he could, knowing how much she hated
violence. "When a man's thirsty, Eileen, the first drink is the
sweetest."</p>

<p>She came toward him, which surprised him. She came straight
across the room until her hands touched his coat. There was a rose
stain on her cheeks; excitement brightened her eyes. She reached up
and kissed him, and stepped back; and then her eyes couldn't meet
his face. It was a modesty that was in her. But it drew a long,
cheerful laugh from him. It swung him into his high and reckless
mood and he stepped forward and pulled her to him, and had his kiss
in his own way. It was, he knew, a mistake, for there was a small
and protesting sound in her throat, and when he let her go he saw
fear on her face&mdash;and that faint blaze of anger again.</p>

<p>He said: "Well, you're learning, Eileen."</p>

<p>Her lips moved faintly; her breasts were lifting with the
strength of her feelings. "Yes," she whispered, "but be patient
with me, Frank."</p>

<p>"A hard thing to ask. I'm not Ben Latimer."</p>

<p>She was smiling in a way that relaxed the pride and the strict
order of her features. There was a woman's softness about her then.
"No, you're not Ben Latimer. How long will you be in Benton?"</p>

<p>"Going out in the morning."</p>

<p>She said, "Frank," and looked up at him carefully. The smile was
gone, its place taken by a sudden shadowed glance. He had one
fugitive memory then of a glance like that, of Bardee Oliver
looking so shrewdly across the counter. Her voice was hurried along
by a swift impatience. "How long must I always be waiting for
you?"</p>

<p>He said: "There's a minister somewhere around this town."</p>

<p>"No." She turned away and walked the length of the room.
"Whatever happened to that job you were offered with the railroad
in Boston?"</p>

<p>"Still open, I guess."</p>

<p>She said: "Take it! Take it, and let's get out of this country.
I hate all this&mdash;I hate the way I live&mdash;and the way you
live!"</p>

<p>There had beem a pleasantness, in the room. It went away and
left him braced against this girl's will.</p>

<p>He said very carefully: "Eileen, there never is a day I don't
think of you. There's never a time when I'm traveling away from you
I don't regret it and never a time when I'm coming back that I
don't want the train to run faster. No man ever had a stronger
picture of a woman in his head than I have of you. It makes
everything possible. I'm a poor hand at speaking the words you
ought to hear. I don't remember ever actually saying that I loved
you. I do. It's the thing that keeps me going."</p>

<p>She said: "Get your minister, if you want. We'll be out of here
by moming."</p>

<p>"No," said Peace. "I don't leave this job."</p>

<p>Her face was still tight. "How much do I have to give up to you?
Some things I can give up. But I'm not the woman to follow you
around from one shanty town to another the next forty years."</p>

<p>He thought of Ben Latimer's dry nasal drawl. He imitated it now:
"Don't wish to be intrudin'."</p>

<p>She came across the room swiftly and caught his arm. "Where are
you going?"</p>

<p>He said, in sultry humor, "Don't know."</p>

<p>"A cup of coffee, perhaps."</p>

<p>He said: "Been hearing things?"</p>

<p>Her color was at once deep. It made her lovely. It richened the
bright anger of her eyes. But she held the anger back.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she doesn't quarrel with you, as I do. I'm told she is
pretty."</p>

<p>"Better than that," he drawled. "Striking."</p>

<p>"Better get your coffee, then," she said, quite without
tone.</p>

<p>He stared down at her, troubled and irritated. He was like a man
handcuffed, unable to reach out for what lay so close by. Wanting
it, and not able to reach it.</p>

<p>"Eileen," he said, "I don't know you. I think I never will. We
can't get to any bargain. You don't like my life. I can't go back
to an office in the East. Maybe we'd be happy that way&mdash;for a
few months. But I'd soon enough regret it and make you
miserable."</p>

<p>She said again, near to crying: "How much do I have to
surrender?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "I don't know."</p>

<p>He knew there was no more ease in the room for him.</p>

<p>All the old ghosts of their past quarreling lay here to punish
him, to make him feel his loss. He said, "So, I guess that's all
for one night."</p>

<p>Her hands took hold of his lapels. She clung to him, her head
bowed against his chest. He couldn't see her face but he felt the
tremble of her body. It went an like this a long while, until he
reached gently down with his fist and lifted her chin. She had no
tears, and yet in her eyes was a despair that hurt him to see.</p>

<p>"Frank," she whispered, "don't you want me anymore?"</p>

<p>"How long has it been since I met you in Fremont? Two years and
a half. I wanted you then, Eileen, and I've never changed."</p>

<p>Her hands kept gripping his coat. "I've come to your terms one
by one, Frank. I have! I've lost every quarrel we've ever had. I've
changed myself almost over for you. Only, this one thing I can't
do. I can't follow you around this miserable country the rest of my
life."</p>

<p>He took her arms and put them aside. He said, "I think we've had
enough for one time," and went out of the room, searching his
pockets for his pipe. In the street he stopped, the empty pipe
bitten hard between his teeth. He stood with his feet on the edge
of the boards, all the sound of wicked Benton boiling about him and
yet not touching him.</p>

<p>A rider came past him and a voice was speaking. It was the voice
that brought him sharply from his gloomy thoughts. Through the
shadows he made out Al Brett's slim, sardonic face. Behind Brett
were four other men belonging to Campeaux. They passed into the
heavy swirl of main street, vanishing to the west. Peace marched
down until he commanded a view of the street. Brett and Brett's men
were galloping out of Benton at a long canter, riding westward on
the empty grade.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">
ESCORTED by Lieutenant Archie Millard and five troopers, Peace
headed west for the Bitter Creek region early the following
morning. As usual, Overmile and Phil Morgan went along; and with
them, too, on the trip was the company's geologist, young Dave van
Lennep. At five o'clock the faint chill of a high-altitude night
clung to the air; at eight the full blaze of the sun swept the flat
plain and another burning day began to oppress them. At Rawlins'
Springs they stopped to fill their canteens.</p>

<p>In the northerly distance lay the sweep of the Seminole
Mountains. To west and to south the Red Desert rolled its barren
sage-studded surface onward under a shimmering heat. Here and there
an occasional flat-topped butte broke through the condensing haze;
in the immediate south the route of the big freighting wagons was
marked by a succession of dust fumaroles spiraling like firesmoke
to the brassy sky. It went on like this without visible break,
Twenty Mile Desert, Red Sand Desert, White Desert&mdash;names
compounded out of the heat and the thirst and the glare of a pure
desolation. The outfit steadied down to a stolid riding, following
the raw line of the trackless railway grade.</p>

<p>Young van Lennep said: "Once upon a time this was a swamp, the
fern growths rising a hundred feet high, You wouldn't have been
able to see the sun for the steam rising. A thousand square miles
of it."</p>

<p>Overmile, schooled in tall tales, cocked an eye on van Lennep,
"When?" he asked skeptically.</p>

<p>"Oh, a million years, more or less."</p>

<p>Overmile considered this and dropped the thought with a dry
grin. "Before my time."</p>

<p>"Herb-eating animals stood twenty feet high, sixty feet from
nose to tail. Lizards in those days were forty feet long. The
biggest of the birds could cast a shadow over this whole party with
shade to spare."</p>

<p>Overmile growled: "I don't believe none of them damn educated
lies."</p>

<p>That night they put up at a water camp thirty miles from Benton,
The next day, riding on across the parched, faintly undulating
land, they reached the crest of the Continental Divide, so
flattened out here that they could not perceive it. They were 7100
feet high, with a faint breeze burning against them; they were
tipping down into the scorched plains of Bitter Creek. Around the
middle of the afternoon Peace halted the party.</p>

<p>He said: "I don't know what we'll find at Moylan's. A man was
killed, and the work's stopped, But it wouldn't do to bring
soldiers Into the camp. Put up here until I come back." He went on
with Morgan and Overmile. At dusk they sighted the yellow glitter
of Moylan's grade campfires.</p>

<p>Daylight died entirely as they followed the foot-deep alkali
dust of the right of way toward twenty or more tents lying on the
desert. A street ran between these tents. Men walked fotward and
formed a little group, waiting for Peace's party.</p>

<p>Peace murmured "Doesn't look good."</p>

<p>Overmile let one hand fall toward his hip, fingers casually
unlatching the holster flap. He murmured, "There's always a smell
to things."</p>

<p>They came to the street's entrance, the group of graders
standing across it with a sullen silence. Farther up the camp other
men were ducking out of their tents. Peace reined in. He reached
for his pipe and took his time filling it, his glance meanwhile
evenly running that line of resentful faces. Nick Moylan, a tough
one himself, always had the reputation for hiring the toughest
shovel hands he could find. They made a scowling barrier in front
of him, reflecting a mass anger caused by something he didn't know
about, He let his match glow against the pipe's tobacco. He whipped
out the light, observing that the quick motion of his arm seemed to
run a tremor along the group. They were jumpy, they were
suspicious.</p>

<p>He said, "Evening, boys. Where's Moylan?"</p>

<p>He thought he wasn't to have an answer. Somebody finally spoke
up from the rear of the group. "Other end of camp." And then that
man pushed his way forward, short and quick-muscled and with
immense eyebrows attached like awnings to a round, vermilion face.
He had a careful look at Peace. His voice was very careful:</p>

<p>"What you doin' here, Bucko?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Ring. Just passing through." But Peace knew something
then. Duke Ring would be the bully boy in this camp, or of any
camp. Whatever the trouble, Ring was in it. He was, Peace
remembered, a rough-and-tumble fighter and thoroughly merciless.
Nobody else had anything to say. Peace urged his horse on; the
group split to let him through. He rode along the street, pipe
stuck askew between his lips.</p>

<p>Overmile said, "I don't get this," but he said it in a guarded
way, for other graders stood at their tent fronts, close by. The
air had turned quickly cool and the woodsmoke of a cook shack
somewhere about drifted pungently with a little wind. Considerable
noise rose from a large tent at the exact end of the street. Peace
rode that way. They all dismounted.</p>

<p>Overmile said, "The smell gets worse."</p>

<p>Morgan stirred in his tracks, Iooking through the darkness with
a dry indifference. His talk held an ironic, half-weary note. "How
many thousands of years has the prairie been here, empty and
without sound, waiting for civilization? Well, here's
civilization&mdash;this miserable little dung pile made by white
men. Full of noise and murder and bad whisky. What a hell of a
joke."</p>

<p>Overmile suggested gently: "Maybe we better get about our
business."</p>

<p>Peace led the way into the tent. It was this camp's saloon, With
a bar made of rough pine boards, with half a dozen knockdown
gambling tables at the far end in full operation. The place was
built for perhaps thirty men and at this moment it was altogether
full. Peace saw Nick Moylan drinking at one end of the bar; there
was a gap between Moylan and the next nearest man. Moylan's ruddy
cheeks, netted with little veins, swung about. He saw Peace, but he
seemed too drunk to be interested.</p>

<p>"Frank," he grumbled, "come have a drink."</p>

<p>"We're pretty hungry," suggested Peace. "Your cook shack still
open?"</p>

<p>"I'll see," said Moylan. And yet he made no immediate move. Talk
in the tent eased off. A man clattered a pile of chips restlessly
through his fingers, the sound of that very large in the place.
Moylan pushed himself away from the bar and looked around him,
Peace, trapping every gesture of the man with his eyes, saw a faint
fear show through Moylan's bold Irish front. "Let's go see,"
murmured the contractor and laid the flat of his hands against the
bar, shoving himself away.</p>

<p>The barkeep's voice slid in. "A dollar for the drinks,
Nick."</p>

<p>Peace ran his glance back to the barkeep. He was in his fifties,
with one streak of white running straight back through his black
hair. Peace was about to turn away, yet some obscure interest roved
up and steadied him a moment longer. The man had a clean, thin face
marked deeply by time and trouble, but there was the sharp
reminiscence in it of gentlemanly dignity once, still remembered.
The insistence of Peace's glance drew the saloonman's eyes abruptly
up. He met that curiosity with a moment's steadiness, then took
Nick Moylan's dollar and retreated farther down the counter.</p>

<p>Moylan led the three men to the cook shack, indicating a long
table placed under a fly. He called: "Markie, here's three men to
feed," and stood uncertainly in his tracks.</p>

<p>Markie, in the cook shack, was all at once swearing in a
temperamental way. Moylan listened to it a moment. He said: "That's
all right, boys. You'll get fed. If he'd started throwin' pots
around you'd been out of luck."</p>

<p>The partners sat down, Moylan circling the shadows uncertainly
with his head tipped. Peace said: "Who was killed?"</p>

<p>"My foreman, Jack Ladue. Night before last."</p>

<p>"Know who did it?"</p>

<p>Moylan stopped his pacing, scanning the roundabout darkness
carefully. It wasn't like this rough, bruising Irishman to be
afraid of shadows. He said finally: "I guess not. It was a brawl in
one of the tents. Ladue was a bully foreman. He kept this crowd
humble. He had to. It's a hard bunch. They ain't worked since."</p>

<p>He quit talking. The cook came out of the tent to lay two pans
of food on the table. He dropped tin plates and cups before them
with a bad grace, made another trip for the coffee pot, and
retreated.</p>

<p>"You better get out of here," grunted Moylan. "I'm leavin'
tonight."</p>

<p>"What'll I tell Reed?"</p>

<p>"What you dam' please, I'm through."</p>

<p>"Nick," said Peace, "What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>Moylan came up to the table. He bent over, his talk soft in
Peace's ear. "I know Irishmen and I know how they fight. This is
different. There's money been put into this camp for causin'
trouble. You tell Reed he's buckin' somethin' besides weather and
bad water."</p>

<p>He wheeled away, bound back for the saloon. Peace ate his meal
and sat idly by the table, nursing his pipe. Overmile and Morgan
were slouched comfortably opposite him. The moon ran a low arc in
the west, three quarters filled and catching up the pale desert in
a crystal shining.</p>

<p>"They won't work, and they won't quit," murmured Peace. "Why?
That's not Irish style, which is to fight and forget. What's here
we can't see?"</p>

<p>"Moylan's scared," said Overmile.</p>

<p>"Then Ladue's shootin' was part of something else, and Moylan
thinks he may be next. Something here we're missing."</p>

<p>"This Duke Ring," murmured Overmile, "was a bouncer for Lou
Queed's joint in Julesburg, I just remembered it a minute ago. He
killed a man in a fist fight there. Got him down and kicked him to
pieces."</p>

<p>Peace made a waggling motion with his hand, They rose and
strolled toward the tent saloon. Something had changed the mind of
the graders these last few minutes, for Peace noticed they were
moving upon the saloon in a deliberately idle way. The squat,
chesty shape of Duke Ring, Peace observed, led them on. Under the
pale, flooding glow of the moon all those faces emerged from the
shadows with a sallow and flat and wicked expression. There was a
strangeness here, an invisible savagery plucking at Peace like a
little gust of wind. Turning his eye along the ragged semicircle,
he observed more men emerge from a near-by tent and come up. One of
them was Al Brett.</p>

<p>Brett joined the semicircle. He was grinning at Peace, his lips
wide, and a dry hunger lay whitely thin. His tone held the
inflections of some secret joke, "Long way from Benton, Bucko. We
thought maybe you'd be comin' out here."</p>

<p>Peace said, "That's right, Al," and understood the game
completely then.</p>

<p>Ring had quit talking, leaving the authority here to Brett. It
was Brett's private show, and Brett had his orders from Campeaux.
They wanted their chance at him; they had it now. But something
else interested him at the moment. The back edge of this crowd was
breaking off and men were drifting away into the hidden areas
behind the tents. Presently he had a complete knowledge of the
camp. Brett was still planted solidly in the dust, a man at either
elbow. Duke Ring stood fast, with one other Irishman beside him.
And that was the substance of it. Those other graders now
retreating from the scene were lukewarm to a fight. Peace let out a
long breath; he felt better from knowing how the situation
stood.</p>

<p>"When you go back," drawled Brett, "you can tell Sam Reed he
won't get any gradin' done here."</p>

<p>"Maybe, Maybe not."</p>

<p>Overmile shifted the weight of his high body. He took two steps
away from Peace and turned a little, and thereby presented himself
directly at Brett. It was a move as deliberate as the presenting of
a gun. Overmile was taking Brett, leaving Ring for Peace. At once
the tension screwed up.</p>

<p>Brett's voice fell into a monotone. "If you're itchin' for it,
Texan, go right after it."</p>

<p>But Overmile, so reckless and so rash, was smart in the ways of
this game, He let Brett's invitation slide off; he waited for Peace
to make the move. Meanwhile, Phil Morgan had quietly balanced the
greatest source of danger in that loose-strung group across the
dust and had made his own decision. Saying nothing at all, he
dropped back of Peace and stepped over to take a position near
Overmile, thus putting his weight against Brett and Brett's two
partners. It left Peace alone to handle Duke Ring and his
friend.</p>

<p>Brett's voice, higher and more unnatural, cracked out a
question: "What you waitin' for, Bucko?"</p>

<p>Peace let the silence run on. He watched Ring, he laid all the
pressure of his temper against that barroom fighter, driving it
boldly at the man. Ring pulled his shoulders forward; there was a
sweat glittering across the narrow width of his forehead. He moved
one foot behind him and stood in an awkward way.</p>

<p>He said: "I'm not carryin' a gun on me,"</p>

<p>Brett cracked him with one wild phrase: "You damned fool!"</p>

<p>Nick Moylan stumbled from the saloon, drunker than before. He
couldn't see the trouble before him. He walked into it. "Peace, you
still here?"</p>

<p>Peace said: "Where do we bunk, Nick?"</p>

<p>"There's blankets in the end tent. Listen, Peace. Tell Reed he
can bring his own Irishmen out here to make this cut."</p>

<p>Ring took a long step backward. He said, "Come on," and walked
down the street, his friend going with him.</p>

<p>"You tell Reed that," repeated Nick Moylan, and weaved back
toward the saloon.</p>

<p>"Tell him that," mimicked Al Brett wickedly. But there was a
change in the feeling here, a sudden sag. Brett stared at Peace,
some calculation brightening his eyes, and then he ducked his head
at the men beside him and followed Ring. All of them presently
disappeared behind the far tents.</p>

<p>Overmile murmured: "It ain't over yet." Suspicion rooted him to
the spot; his quickened senses keened the night for its
treacheries. They were three men spotlighted by a radiant moon,
with the voices of the graders murmuring gutturally all around
them. Lights began to drop off along the rows of tents. A few
graders came out of the tent saloon. Nick Moylan's voice grew
louder and louder in there.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Campeaux put Ring out here to stir up this trouble.
Then he found out we were coming and sent Al Brett."</p>

<p>"Ring lied," said Overmile, "He had a gun in his pocket."</p>

<p>"Shootin's not his best style. He wants to get at me with his
fists&mdash;and his feet."</p>

<p>"There's more to come of this," said Overmile, and began to
shift restlessly around. He wasn't satisfied with their
situation.</p>

<p>"In the morning," agreed Peace.</p>

<p>"Ring and his few friends have got the rest of the camp bluffed.
I think the boys would work if it wasn't for him. The showdown
comes in the morning."</p>

<p>Overmile went over to get the horses still standing by the
saloon, He led them off in search of water and hay. Peace watched
him march vaguely around the cook shack&mdash;and presently come
back.</p>

<p>"Put 'em on picket," explained Overmile; "Left 'em saddled."</p>

<p>Peace murmured: "We sleep somewhere else," and towed them out
into the desert. There was, a short distance from camp, a small
gully eroded ten feet down into the plain, They made a blanketless
camp here, each man finding a spot. The air was touched with a thin
chill; all the stars were bright in the sky.</p>

<p>"I'll take the first watch," volunteered Morgan.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Standing in front of the saloon tent next morning, Peace watched
these fifty graders finish breakfast and come back into the street
and stand along it with a visible uncertainty. The red, raw
embankment of the right of way ran directly in front of the camp,
and one man strolled up its dusty slope and stood there, smoking
his short-stemmed pipe, boot heels kicking at the loose clods of
earth, Peace saw that, and saw other men stand and stare at the
grade. Uncertainty, that was what controlled them. It was hard for
them not to be on the job. Duke Ring came out of the cook shack and
saw the man topping the grade. His voice sailed across the still,
fresh morning's air.</p>

<p>"Get off that, Mike!"</p>

<p>Peace drew pipe smoke evenly into his lungs, and expelled it.
Overmile and Morgan looked at him, narrowly reading his face. Nick
Moylan dragged himself from the saloon tent, sober but as haggard
as a man could be. Peace withdrew the pipe from his teeth and
knocked out the ashes.</p>

<p>"Let's see now," he murmured, and walked toward Ring's squat
shape.</p>

<p>He didn't know, until then, how closely and how intently the men
of this camp were observing him. The first step he took drew them
out from every angle; and when he stopped a yard away from Ring
there was a circle around him. Ring slowly adjusted himself, his
feet spread apart, his ramlike shoulders bowed down, He had a pair
of black, close little eyes and he was watching Peace with a
glittering, greedy hope. Looking above the man's head, Peace
observed Al Brett in the background. Overmile noticed Brett too,
for the Texan stepped aside until he had Brett fully in view.</p>

<p>Peace lifted and lowered the pipe in his fingers, Ring's glance
rising and falling with it, very interested in that small
motion.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Ring. Get to work or hit the ties for Benton."</p>

<p>"Me?" snarled Ring. "Hell with you!"</p>

<p>"Catch," said Peace, and threw the pipe.</p>

<p>Ring's hands lifted, and he came involuntarily off his crouch.
He was like that&mdash;half unprotected&mdash;when Peace, hurling
himself across the little distance, smashed him in the soft flesh
under the ear and sank him, like a struck ox, to the ground. A
great yeasty sighing went round the watching circle. Ring lay with
his mouth wide open, sucking in air; his knees threshed around and
he seemed to be stunned.</p>

<p>But Peace knew the cunning of that half-savage; knew it and
watched for it, and jumped into the air when Ring, a fiery rage
bawling out of his throat, came clawing; Peace stepped aside. He
lifted a knee and drove it up and forward into Ring's vitals, and
waited for the bully one's arms to drop; and when they dropped he
broke Ring's nose with one head-on blow and brought his other fist
in afterward, tearing the flesh down Ring's temple. Blood spouted
out. Ring spread his feet farther apart.</p>

<p>He made a spiderlike jump aside, and whirled and backed into
Peace and pinned down one of Peace's feet with a stamping heel, and
afterward, tried to carry Peace down in that rear fall. Peace bent.
He caught Ring on his hip and clamped Ring's neck into the crook of
his forearm. He swayed back until he felt the cartilage of Ring's
neck grind. Ring's feet were stamping down again catching the
arches of Peace's feet in pure stabs of pain. But the man's face
was turning color, the red dulling to purple; blood gouted out of
the raw cut in his temple. Peace turned him as he might turn a doll
and pushed him backward&mdash;and fell on him with his knees. He
broke a pair of Ring's ribs then; he heard them definitely snap.
There wasn't any mercy in him. He had an animal to punish, an
animal who would have gouged out his eyes who would have kicked his
face in and laughed at him, He had to give this bully one a savage
beating; he had to put the fear of God into the malcontents of the
camp, Ring's eyes were swelling out, turned to a glassy shining;
his tongue was caught between his teeth, bitten and swollen.</p>

<p>Peace pulled his knees up, he stepped back. He said: "Get a
bucket of water," and felt the deep, painful distension of his
lungs laboring for air. Dust swirled up from the ground, clouding
the faces of the grading crew standing by. Mauled and blood-smeared
and half dead, Ring made no motion.</p>

<p>Somebody came along with a bucket of water. Peace seized it and
sloshed the full load along Ring's body; the man's muscles
shuddered and fell loose again. Peace ran a hand across his
forehead, scooping the sweat aside. The dust was settling, a hotter
sun bit into a cheek bruise he didn't remember receiving. His eyes
touched Al Brett standing like a carved figure at the edge of the
circle. Brett's lips were pulled back; his nostrils flared out, as
though the hating desires in him were all aflood, But he broke his
long immobility and stared at the struck-still graders with a
calculating interest. It made Peace remember that these men were
here. He had his look at them.</p>

<p>"There's your bully boy," he said, "The fun's over. Nobody can
make you work, But get the hell out of this camp if you're through
with the job."</p>

<p>A cheerful voice said: "'Tis seven o'clock." It was like that,
The uncertainty vanished from this outfit&mdash;and they swung
toward the embankment. Al Brett turned his head to watch them go.
He had his two riders behind him, but they were fiddling around,
they were uneasy.</p>

<p>Peace said: "What's your intention Al?"</p>

<p>Al Brett's bright yellow head whipped back. The secret, careful
thinking laid a sharpness and a thinness across his cheeks. He made
up his mind then; for his narrow grin appeared and vanished, and he
looked once at the bruised Ring still knocked out and moved across
the dust with his men. Peace saw them swing into their saddles and
wheel out of the camp, boiling up the dust.</p>

<p>Nick Moylan remained here. And the saloonman remained here, too.
Moylan's voice was shocked. "My God, Frank!"</p>

<p>The saloonman's face was without expression; and yet Peace
watched him with an interest he could not define. The man stirred
memory in him, faintly reviving an image that would not focus. Ring
had begun to groan, The saloonman dropped his head and went rapidly
back to his tent.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Peace.</p>

<p>"Bill Wallen," said Nick Moylan, stupidly. "My God, Frank, I
thought you were goin' to tear his heart out!"</p>

<p>Ring pulled himself as far as his knees. He crawled painfully
that way a foot or so, his head sagging. Blood collected on the tip
of his nose and dropped in steady blobs. He made two efforts before
he got to his feet. There was a long interval before he recognized
Peace.</p>

<p>"Ring," said Peace, "start walkin'." But he quit being
interested in Ring. He had whipped the man in front of the graders.
He had broken Ring's power here. The sun was a burning, brilliant
flare in the morning sky and all the freshness was gone from the
day.</p>

<p>"See you later, Nick," Peace said, and turned back to where the
horses were. Presently they were riding the grade eastward toward
Benton. His fists were alive with pain and he thought he had broken
a knuckle.</p>

<p>Overmile hauled himself out of a deep reflection. "Frank," he
said "you're top dog. Know what happens to top dogs?"</p>

<p>Phil Morgan broke his customary taciturnity. "I was thinking
about that, too. You made a lot of enemies at Julesburg, which time
didn't soften. This year you've hurt Campeaux badly, killed
Dollarhide and knocked the teeth out of this Ring. Twice now Al
Brett had to back down before you. Campeaux and Ring and Brett. And
the gamblers behind Campeaux. Your chances get slimmer, This thing
here was a trap. We almost got caught in it. They'll never rest
until they rub you out."</p>

<p>"Perhaps!"</p>

<p>"Campeaux never forgets what he's after. He won't forget
you."</p>

<p>Six miles out they sighted Archie Millard's Camp. When they came
up he was ready to march; and they all fell in and continued on.
Millard asked the news and Overmile told him. Millard glanced at
Peace.</p>

<p>"You're pretty hard, Frank. Valuable to the road. Dangerous to
yourself. I'd hate to be in your shoes."</p>

<p>"See?" said Overmile to Peace.</p>

<p>The heat of the day squeezed further talk out of them. Millard,
having spoken once, said nothing more during the course of the day,
except to give the occasional orders for rest. Peace was struck by
that down-bearing silence. Millard's tall, soldierly figure made a
fine shape in the sunlight; but the face of the man held no light,
no vigor. Definitely Millard fed upon himself, a hope in him
seeming to flicker always lower, leaving less expression in his
gray eyes.</p>

<p>Once Morgan mused: "Archie, life is a pretty sorry joke. But
still not as bad as that." But Millard, paying a faint and puzzled
attention, shrugged his shoulders only. They camped beyond the
Continental Divide and arrived in Benton the following evening to
find headquarters swept by a minor tempest. Dodge had returned by
fast stage from Salt Lake, his driving temper quickening an
organization already geared to a nervous pitch. General Grant's
party had anived at Fort Sanders 130 miles back on the line. Dodge
was to be there the following afternoon for the conference.</p>

<p>Reed said: "You're going with Dodge, Frank."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">
THE photographer said, "If you please, gentlemen," and waited
for the group to come to a pose.</p>

<p>In front of the camera, posted along the white picket fence
which enclosed the headquarters house of General Gibbon at Fort
Sanders, General Grant's party slowly and somewhat stiffly arranged
itself. Phil Sheridan, olive-skinned and sardonic in expression,
removed his hat and stood beside General Potter's wife. General
Sherman hooked a thumb into his pants' pocket and swung a little
aside. Dodge was in the background. Durant, the dissenter and the
fiery one, sat partially on the fence, his hands clasped across his
vest. These and a dozen other full major generals of the recent
rebellion surrounded Grant, the least striking of the group. Grant
laid both his hands on the picket fence; he made a still and
closemouthed figure there, dressed in a wrinkled black suit and a
Panama hat turned up all the way around. His cropped beard lay
close against the noncommital face.</p>

<p>The photographer said, "Thank you," and the group dissolved,
going slowly back into General Gibbon's house to resume the
conference.</p>

<p>Dodge saw Peace standing in the background with the lesser
officers of the post. He said "Come here, Frank," and then spoke
quietly to Grant. Grant swung in the doorway, his even glance
surveying Peace. Dodge said: "General, this is Frank Peace. He was
a major under me during the Tennessee campaigns. I depend on Sam
Reed to push the rails forward, and Sam depends a good deal on
Peace to keep the way clear."</p>

<p>Grant shook Peace's hand quickly. "Glad to know you," he
murmured and went on into the house. Peace started to turn away,
but Dodge touched him on the arm and motioned for him to follow
Grant. Inside the room, Peace took a discreet station in one
corner, watching the party collect.</p>

<p>A high and wordy controversy, filled with temper, had gripped
these men during the morning, and some of that agitation still
showed on Durant's suave cheeks. He came in and walked once around
the room, his small fingers plucking at the tip of his Vandyke; his
eyes were shrewd in the way he measured the other men. Grant sat
down and Sherman and Sheridan sat down, none of them revealing any
expression. There was a poker-faced impassiveness about them, a
sort of dogged, ground-in taciturnity.</p>

<p>Dodge said: "Some things I want to make very clear."</p>

<p>Grant looked carefully at Dodge. Sherman turned to listen. And
one thing Peace understood then. Both of these men had been Dodge's
commanders in the war; they knew him and they trusted him in the
deep, strong loyalty the war had engendered. And Peace knew also
that neither Grant nor Sherman liked the civilian Durant. It was to
be seen in their attitude.</p>

<p>"The government commissioners complain of the changes that have
been made in the right of way," Dodge said; "They dislike to
approve a line unless they know it to be a sound line, built for
traffic and not for subsidy. As long as I'm in charge I'll build
the line for traffic. I will not have the private contractors
agitating for changes that will make their own pieces of
construction work more profitable to them. I will not have Durant
sending his own set of engineers out here to set aside my
orders."</p>

<p>Sherman cast a glance of sly, iron humor at Grant, who sat
imperturbably in his chair, the acrid smoke of a cigar rolling
around his face. Durant moved his slight, stooped body nervously
about the room. He said: "I have no particular intentions of tying
up General Dodge. But I should like to remind you that it is the
investors who must be pleased. They're spending the money; they're
entitled to any changes that will bring in further government
revenue."</p>

<p>"The investors or the stock manipulators?" asked Dodge
bluntly.</p>

<p>Durant lifted his shoulders, an expressive gesture. "Is it
necessary to use the word? I realize the general public back East
considers the Credit Mobilier contracts to be tainted. I understand
very well that the public considers certain men to be feathering
their own nests. That's an unavoidable public reaction when a large
project is under way. Particularly when government subsidies are
involved."</p>

<p>"But look at it from another angle. Private money is building
this road. It is a gamble. Who knows if we'll get that money back?
At the same time we are building something that is an instrument of
national defense. We're binding the two coasts together, Therefore
private investors have a perfect right to insist on all the help
the government can give them. The subsidy for the first five
hundred miles was only sixteen thousand dollars to the mile. Over
these hills and out into the Red Desert it will be forty-eight
thousand dollars. In the Wasatch we'll receive&mdash;we'll
earn&mdash;thirty-two thousand dollars to the mile. It is not
excessive. And I want to remind you this money is a loan by the
government to the road, A loan we must repay, It is not a
gift&mdash;as the public seems to think. Nor are the land grants in
any sense graft. What was this land worth before the road went
through? Nothing. Whatever value it attains is due entirely to the
building of track, I think the government is getting a bargain. I
think it should not complain&mdash;and certainly General Dodge
shouldn't&mdash;if we change the lines occasionally, Consider this,
gentlemen. The Credit Mobilier is under a terrific strain. If it
collapses there'll be no more building&mdash;and no
transcontinental road."</p>

<p>Grant said: "How about that, Dodge?"</p>

<p>Dodge said: "I want the road to be safe, and I want it as
straight as it can be built. I want the government interest
protected. And I want the private investor protected. Oakes Ames
represents the private investors to a greater degree than Durant
here&mdash;and Ames wants the road built straight. If he does,
Durant shouldn't be so greatly worried about the investor. I cannot
have either the private contractors or financial interests
dictating the layout of the line. There is a good deal of
dissension and arguing back East. A good deal of fighting for
control. That is not my province. I'm simply concerned with putting
down a railroad according to my best engineering judgment. As to
that, neither Durant nor any other man will interfere, as long as
I'm chief engineer. If change is insisted upon I'll quit."</p>

<p>The silence came on, loaded and strained, Sherman looked at
Grant. They were all watching Grant. He had no real authority here;
he was still a private citizen. Andrew Johnson sat in the White
House, an embittered, suspicious man who had no faith in the road,
But the shadow of the presidency already hovered over Grant, and to
him already men were beginning to bring their affairs. And it was
Grant who, two years before, had given Dodge a furlough from the
army to become the Union's chief engineer. He sat there a long
while, silently and secretly weighing what had been said. Nobody
spoke. Durant's fragile fingers kept pulling at the tip of his
Vandyke. Grant rolled the cigar between his lips and pulled it
aside. He spoke quietly:</p>

<p>"The government expects this railroad to be finished, The
government expects the railroad company to meet its obligations.
And the government expects General Dodge to remain with the road as
its chief engineer until it is completed."</p>

<p>He had not lifted his tone, but it was an ultimatum,
nevertheless. Sherman's seamy face held again that glint of iron
humor. He looked around at Durant, as all of them were doing.</p>

<p>Durant had straightened, Color got into his rather pale face;
and a flash of anger got into it. But he was a shrewd man, a clever
man, and now he looked at Grant with a steady, calculating glance.
Somewhere among these moments he made a lightning-swift change of
front. He said, almost affable, "I withdraw my objections. We all
want Dodge to stay with the road."</p>

<p>To Peace, Durant's reasoning was as clear as if it had been
spoken aloud. Grant would be president and Grant was Dodge's
friend; and to Grant friendship was like a point of honor. Yet
Peace, looking at that elegant little man with the neat,
distinguished countenance, felt that Durant was thinking of other
means and other strategies.</p>

<p>The group broke up, moving out to the special train that waited
to carry them westward as far as Medicine Bow. Peace climbed into
one of the coaches and settled himself down. At Cheyenne all the
town had massed to meet the party and, a band there began to blast
the hot afternoon; and there was a long stillness and Peace heard
Grant's stiff, unhurried voice roll out from the end of the last
coach. Applause washed up and the train moved on. Sam Reed broke
through the solid ranks of spectators and caught the handrail of
Peace's coach on the dead run. He saw Peace and settled down in the
same seat.</p>

<p>"What happened at Sanders?"</p>

<p>Peace told him, whereupon Reed's energetic features expressed a
dark doubt. "Grant will no doubt be President. The soldier vote
will put him in. But Johnson's term still has eight months to go
and Johnson's secretary of the interior, Browning, hates us. We can
be hamstrung in a day. That ain't all. The Credit Mobilier is just
about out of money. When it's gone the construction stops. Where's
more money to come from? Maybe Oakes Ames can raise it in Boston.
But Boston people won't trust their dollars with Durant. So
Durant's got to go&mdash;and he's too clever for Ames. Last week I
raised my boys to three dollars a day. There's been trouble makers
workin' on 'em. Campeaux has got all the toughs lined against us,
for his own reasons. What they are I don't know. The Central's
building faster than we thought. On top of that Brigham Young
threatens to throw his influence with the Central if we don't build
into Salt Lake town. And we can't do it. Ogden is the only feasible
engineering point. I wouldn't give a nickel for our chances to beat
the Central into Salt Lake Basin."</p>

<p>"You're tired, Sam. You need a rest."</p>

<p>"And we'll be in the Wasatch range when winter comes. Forty feet
of snow to buck through. An impossible job, but we have to do it or
we're licked."</p>

<p>At Laramie the train stopped. Grant spoke again. There was a
long yelling outside. "Three cheers for Unconditional Surrender!"
"Three cheers for old Tecumseh!"</p>

<p>The train moved on through this tumult, clicking down the
Laramie plain smoothly, passing small groups of graders gathered to
see Grant go by. They reached Medicine Bow at four o'clock, and
here Peace got off the special, which was, going no farther, and
took a construction train for Benton. Sam Reed had stopped to talk
with Dodge, who was returning to Omaha with Grant's party.</p>

<p>Peace sat sprawled across the seat in the lone coach of the work
train, moved by a strange thinking. Cheyenne was a quiet little
town now, its streets emptied of the rash, wild construction gang.
And Laramie was quiet now. But these two towns, bereft of
excitement, were nevertheless steadily growing. The canvas houses
were giving way to wood; and white paint appeared and neat square
fences, and trees were being planted in the shifting dust. The
construction crews roared and shouted in the deeper desert, leaving
the sober and industrious ones behind to plant and to reap the
fruit of permanence.</p>

<p>Permanence and something in life that was serene.</p>

<p>These were the things that lifted his mind hopefully. How long
since his own life was ordered that way? In '61 he had left Ohio
for the war. In '66 he had cruised the plains with his cavalry
regiment. Now it was '68 and he lived at the end of track where the
tidal wave reached its foaming, turbulent peak. There was something
in him, born of the long years of excitement, which needed the fire
and fury of that boiling life. The dust and raw pine smell, the
sweating energy of men, the long flow of violent shadows at dusk
across a strange and empty land. These things were vivid and
satisfying on his senses. And so he was balanced like that. The
pull of a wildness to one side of him. The hope of softness and
security and Eileen Oliver strong on the other. He sat long-legged
across the coach seats, seeing twilight pour like water across the
desert; eaten by doubt, feeling again that imminence of loss, that
hopeless personal confusion.</p>

<p>They reached Benton at eight o'clock, and he stepped into the
bawdy, bawling glitter of that wicked town and stopped a moment on
the platform. Nan Normandy's restaurant lights were directly over
the dust. Bardee Oliver's store was to the right, down an alley.
There was a desire in him to go straight for the alley, yet the
lights of Nan Normandy's place oddly held him, Morose and
irritable, he stood there, wondering what kept him so still.
Watching the restaurant, he saw Overmile come strolling from it;
and an emotion that was almost anger got into him, though he did
not recognize it. Overmile idled across the street.</p>

<p>Peace said gruffly, "Where in hell have you been?"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
When Archie Millard returned from the westward trip with Peace he
dismissed the squad of troopers and went to his quarters at the
Fort Steele bachelor hall. He cleaned up, had a late meal at
officers' mess and took a stroll across the parade ground. Tired as
he was, he could not return to quarters; his troubles obsessed him,
and his desire to be near Cherry gnawed at his mind in a way that
sometimes frightened him with the thought of insanity.</p>

<p>Beyond the parade ground, just past post number one, he saw a
small, slim figure standing under the heavy moonlight. The figure
of a girl with her face turned his way.</p>

<p>He said: "Cherry!" and swung over there rapidly. "Cherry, how
did you get here?"</p>

<p>He took hold of her and kissed her. Her body came against him,
wholly soft and willing; there was a tempest in this girl as well
as in him, for her cheeks were strong with feeling, and her lips
clung to him and would not let him go until he touched her
shoulders and pushed them gently back. He noticed then that she had
changed from the gingham dresses she habitually wore to buckskin
garment and high moccasins.</p>

<p>She saw his face change. She was alive to it, as she always was.
"What don't you like, Archie?"</p>

<p>He repeated his question. "How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"You didn't come to Virginia Dale. It has been almost a month.
So, I came here. My father and I are living in the tepee
there."</p>

<p>He saw its conical shape standing against the bright moonlight,
a hundred yards away. He put his hand to her arm, and they walked
towerd it. He said: "I don't like you in a tepee, Cherry. I don't
like you in buckskin."</p>

<p>She bowed her head, her jet-black hair shining in the moonlight.
"It is what I am," she murmured.</p>

<p>"No," he said shortly, "not a blanket woman."</p>

<p>They went into the lodge. A lantern hung down from a thong,
glowing on a clean, blanket covered floor. There were neither
tables nor chairs in the place; only two beds made on the
floor&mdash;at opposite sides of the tent&mdash;a parfleche trunk,
and a rack containing some of Mormon Charley's guns.</p>

<p>"My father went on a hunt yesterday," she said, and sank in a
graceful, turning fashion to the bed. He remained standing, his
silence lifting her chin. Her eyes were round and soft; they held a
depthless fidelity. Her face was all sober, stirred by faint, wild
beauty. Of a sudden it dragged him down to the bed. He put his arms
around her waist and stared at her, strain turning his expression
harsher and harsher.</p>

<p>"I don't want you a tepee woman camped outside a fort!"</p>

<p>She had a dignity, a pride. Her shoulders straightened. "You
want me to be a white woman. I have tried. But I am not a white
woman. If I were we would be married by now. Do you want me to go
back to Virginia Dale?"</p>

<p>His answer was ragged, half groaned. "No, Cherry."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave Sanders?"</p>

<p>"I've been transferred to be with Frank Peace. I have had no
leave since or I'd have been to see you."</p>

<p>"Peace," she murmured. Her eyes were at once bright and bitter.
"Peace. He doesn't want us to be together."</p>

<p>"It was an army order, Cherry. Not Peace's."</p>

<p>She smiled at him obscurely, her lips making a gentle curve.
"All right, Archie, I say nothing against your friend."</p>

<p>Stillness crowded the tent. She sat by him, watching his face,
watching his eyes. Her body was quiet within the possessive circle
of his arms, quiet and warm and obedient. His blond head sank a
little, the full and ruddy features of the man turning
hopeless.</p>

<p>"You have pride," she said, slowly. "And I have pride. But my
pride is not as great as yours, Archie. I can forget mine."</p>

<p>He stared at her. His question was dully spoken. "What?"</p>

<p>"My father," she murmurred, "is a kind man. He sent me to
school. He put me in white clothes, I have lived with chairs and
high beds and cotton dresses&mdash;even silk ones. This is the
first tepee I remember since a little girl. I carry a gold cross
around my neck. I speak English and I learned the manners of your
people. My father has done this for me, because he is kind. Why am
I not married to you. Archie?"</p>

<p>"I've told you," he said.</p>

<p>Her glance was wise, it was sad. "Yes, I know. White officers do
not have Indian wives. You are an officer. It is what I have
thought. So, Archie, marry me and put me away somewhere in a town
where nobody will know&mdash;and come to me when you can."</p>

<p>He reared back. "Never! I'm not ashamed of you. If I married you
I wouldn't hide you!"</p>

<p>She said, "Why would that matter? We are in love. You see? You
are proud. Well, then Archie, I am not proud. Do not marry me in
your way. Marry me in mine, which is no way at all. I shall be in
this tepee when you come. I shall be near, wherever you are. You
keep your pride and I will keep you, which is enough for me."</p>

<p>He said doggedly, "No."</p>

<p>She put herself against him, her arms slipping around his neck.
"Yes, Archie. I am wiser than you are, I think. No other way is
possible for us. Don't go away! Don't forget me."</p>

<p>"I won't always be out West," he said.</p>

<p>Her voice begged him with a faint and tender and breathless
whisper: "I know. Someday you go away. But I'll be old
then&mdash;and it won't matter."</p>

<p>He lifted her face with his big hand and kissed her again. They
remained this way, mutely clinging to each other. The sentries'
calling floated across the night. "Eight o'clock and all's well."
That echoing went all around Fort Steele's parade. The slow tramp
of the guard relief crossed the distance; the smash of a sentry's
palm against his presented rifle sent a jarring sound through the
bland shadows. Flame raveled up from the lantern's wick, smoky and
dying. Millard saw Cherry's face in the last glow, dark and wild
and sweet, and then some of that wildness got into him and touched
off his reckless despair. The light died and left them there in a
darkness turned the color of silver by the moonlight shining
through the tent.</p>

<p>"There's some way out of this, Cherry," he groaned.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">
ROY LOVELACE and his wife Helen had two rooms in Benton's flimsy
hotel. A touch of air came into the windows to relieve the trapped
heat of late July day. Dusk was flowing down Benton in layers of
powder-blue color and lights were once more setting up a crystal
glitter along the street. For a brief hour it had been quiet, but
now the work trains loaded with Irishmen were pulling in from the
end of track to fill the veins of the town with a wicked vigor. It
was Saturday evening.</p>

<p>Peace drank the last of his coffee. He pushed his chair back
slightly from the table so that he might cross his legs. The
shadows of the room were round and pleasant until Lovelace's Irish
girl came in with a lighted lamp. Helen Lovelace said:</p>

<p>"It is too hot for the twins to sleep yet, Mary. Take them for a
walk."</p>

<p>The twins slid from their chairs and stood formally in the
center of the room a moment&mdash;two small girls with their hair
combed tight back from their theads into pigtails. One of them
bowed and showed her company manners. "Good night, Mister Peace."
The other gravely mimicked that; and then a little gust of giggling
disturbed them and they ran from the room, Mary following.</p>

<p>Lovelace put his hands flat on the table, his long fingers
flexing. "How long do you suppose we'll be in Benton. Frank?" The
whiteness of his still shirt's front accented the pale and solemn
wire-thin face. Somewhere and sometime, Peace knew, this man had
lived in well-born surroundings. It was to be seen in his soft
ways, it was to be heard in the smoothness of his speech. Lovelace
and his wife were altogether alike&mdash;living in a world to which
they didn't belong, with a shadowy strain showing, with a remote
sense of tragedy showing.</p>

<p>"Green River," said Peace, "is the next controlling point.
There'll be a good town there. We'll reach it around the middle of
September."</p>

<p>"Six more weeks here, then," murmured Lovelace.</p>

<p>Campeaux's musicians were collected at the Club doorway,
throwing their brass blare up and down the street to announce the
beginning of another roaring night; instantly the sound of Benton
stepped up to a quicker and more humming pitoh. Lovelace looked at
his hands. Helen Lovelace rose as though possessed by impatience.
But she stood motionless, her head turned toward the windows, her
smooth features stilled by some remote thought. She was to Peace
the meaning of fidelity, and he thought then that she would be
beautiful in a black velvet dress, with diamond eardrops glittering
against the dark luster of her hair. That kind of a woman.
Gracious. Too proud to show her hurts. They were both listening to
Campeaux's band in a way that seemed to tell Peace they hated
it&mdash;and could not help obeying it. A rebel yell from the
construction hands lifted Benton's flimsy rafters. Helen Lovelace
tipped her head at her husband, quietly watching him. Lovelace
said:</p>

<p>"I never knew a more evil town than this. But it has been good
to us. The best of all towns for a gambler. In a way, I shall hate
to leave it. My luck's run good here, as good as it ever has.
Something tells me it is a climax."</p>

<p>Peace stirred in the chair. "A dead man every morning. A girl
dead from laudanum every week. When are you going to take your
family out of this, Roy?"</p>

<p>Lovelace lifted his steel-indifferent eyes. But Peace knew he
had struck a tender spot and wasn't sorry. Lovelace's shoulders
shrugged.</p>

<p>"When my luck goes out, Frank, I'm through. This is my life. I
can make money in no other way. But I'm not the fool you may think.
My draft goes to San Francisco every week&mdash;and some day my
family will be done with this."</p>

<p>"When?" said Peace skeptically.</p>

<p>"Fortune always runs out. When I get my warning I'll obey,
because I'm gambler enough to understand. Will you?"</p>

<p>Peace said: "What?"</p>

<p>"Sure, It applies to you as well. Helen and I often talk about
it. You bear a charmed life. The risks pile up and still never hurt
you. There is no man on this right of way better liked and none
better hated, You think that's going to last forever? It won't. The
law of percentage will take care of that. One day your luck will
run out and that's the end of Frank Peace."</p>

<p>Peace said: "Where will you go when you're through with the
game? Back East?"</p>

<p>Lovelace let a quick gust of irritation come out of him, "Why
don't you listen to me when I give you good advice?" He shook his
head, his voice changing to a tone that was regretful. "No, never
back East. That's closed to us. San Francisco, I think."</p>

<p>He rose and went across the room for his hat. For a moment he
stood in the soft light, clipping the end from a cigar. There was a
scene here of a man mustering up the ingredients of the part he had
to play; the quietness, the detachment, the tight-lipped
indifference of the gambler. Pushing himself to his feet, Frank
Peace could not help asking this.</p>

<p>"Why," he murmured, "why do I always find you standing behind
him, Helen?"</p>

<p>But it was Lovelace who answered that, swiftly and very simply:
"Because she's my luck. I couldn't turn a card without her."</p>

<p>They were tall and still in the room, with that deep silence
full of a speechless pride. Peace turned his eyes away from them;
it bothered him to be a witness to something he had no right to
see.</p>

<p>"Your luck," he said, "runs in more ways than one, Roy!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have thought of that," answered Lovelace, and led the
way from the room.</p>

<p>The twins were racing up the steps, noisy and out of breath.
Lovelace bent down; he removed the cigar from his mouth, and kissed
them and went on. At the bottom of the stairway Peace looked back
and saw their round, big eyes peering between the stairway
standards. They were giggling again.</p>

<p>Peace stopped in the street and removed his hat. "The meal was a
treat to me&mdash;and the visit pleasant, as it always is."</p>

<p>Helen Lovelace gave him one quick glance; as though that touch
of civility startled her, She had no smile for Peace, yet he saw
the softening of her glance. He watched them go, two fine figures
moving side by side with a self-contained dignity through the
thickening traffic of Benton's undisciplined crowd. The fragrance
of a passing pipe reminded him of his own and he stepped to the
edge of the walk and casually fired it. He saw Overmile stationed
against the front of a building ten yards away; he caught
Overmile's eye, Overmile barely nodded. Drawing in the good smoke,
Peace tried to understand his partner's sudden remoteness and could
not, Something had got into the string-shaped Texan to turn his
sunny humor sour, All the pleasant parts of his life, Peace
considered, were being pulled away from him this hot, savage
summer. More and more he found himself alone.</p>

<p>Ab Kein walked up. "Ask me about business, Frank."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Ab. "I buy ten lots from the railroad for
one-fifty each, That's twenty-eight days ago. The last one I sell
tonight for twenty-five hundred. I buy three back and resell, I
ain't got a nickel's worth of property left in Benton, This town
makes me nine thousand dollars, So now, where's the next town?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," suggested Peace, "you could do more dickering
here."</p>

<p>"Benton's all through. I can smell the end of a boom. Sixty days
from now you know what this town will be? Just a pile of tin
cans."</p>

<p>His cigar, to this point caught loosely in one corner of his
mouth, at once shot upward like a storm warning. He had been loose,
thoroughly at ease; but a faint quiver got into him, the sure sign
of his mental machinery in motion again. He lifted a hand to the
cigar; he pulled his shoulders together.</p>

<p>Ben Latimer, plodding forward at a high-kneed, methodical gait,
pulled in beside Peace. He said, "Howdy, Frank," and seemed not to
see Ab.</p>

<p>Ab said, floridly genial: "Hello, Ben. Anything on your
mind?"</p>

<p>Ben Latimer stuck his hands in his pockets. He began to talk to
Peace in a different way. "Got a kind of a problem, Mr. Peace. Like
to get your idea. I'm minded to settle in Wyoming when the road's
done. What's your notion of towns&mdash;Laramie or Cheyenne?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't guess," said Peace.</p>

<p>"Cheyenne," put in Kein, "And look, I got four lots there you
can have. What am I doin' with Cheyenne property when I'm movin'
West? Your own price. Two thousand for the whole bunch."</p>

<p>"I was thinkin of Laramie," mused Ben Latimer to Peace.
Afterward he appeared to remember Ab Kein had spoken. He turned on
the little man, exposing a sharp and dry expression, "Those lots?
No good."</p>

<p>"Hey?" said Ab Kein. "The Denver road's goin' through two of
'em. What's no good about that? And the other right where the
elegant residences will be."</p>

<p>"Your first two will get condemned for right of way and you'll
get a hundred dollars, mebbe, As for the residential proposition,
there ain't nothing elegant about Cheyenne and, prob'ly never will
be. Mr. Peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look," said Ab earnestly, "Cheyenne or Laramie, that's good
property, Wyoming's goin' to grow, ain't it? Cheyenne's the magic
city, ain't it?" He grew thoroughly confidential, he came up and
began to tap his fingers on Ben Latimer's flat chest, "Don't tell
nobody Ab Kein made a sacrifice like this. Only because I ain't got
time to bother with land that far away&mdash;a thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>Latimer showed no enthusiasm. He wheeled as if to go arnd was
stopped by an afterthought. "You paid a hundred apiece for 'em,
from the railroad. They ain't worth it. But that's what I'll give
you. Four hundred for the bunch."</p>

<p>Kein yelled; "Absolutely not!"</p>

<p>Latimer said, "All right. Didn't want 'em, anyhow. Don't think
Cheyenne's the right town," He said, "I got ten miles of grading
from Reed tonight, Mr. Peace&mdash;east of Green River," and walked
off without another glance at Ab Kein.</p>

<p>Kein stared at Latimer's retreating back. The smoke of his cigar
boiled furiously around his bright eyes. At once he yelled; "Wait,"
and scurried after Latimer.</p>

<p>Peace had listened with only a little interest. The pipe rose
and lowered between his teeth; his eyes kept rummaging the crowd,
Overmile still remained at his self-established station against the
building wall, seeming to catnap on his feet. And at that moment
Peace's head lifted another notch, a keenness threading his nerves.
Jack Cordray appeared from the black maw of an alley and stood
indecisively at the edge of Benton's main street, having a general
look at the scene.</p>

<p>Peace thought; "Why is he here?" and watched carefully. Cordray
was thinner and flimsier than when he had last seen the
man&mdash;which was at Julesburg the year before. After that affair
Cordray had vanished with a bullet in his shoulder. He seemed to
Peace to be on the edge of consumption; a grayness lay on the
skeleton-bare outline of his face, a grayness like the powdery
alkali dust of Benton's street. Against that pallor his eyes burned
bitterly black and a roll of jet hair lay down against his
forehead. It meant something to Peace that Cordray had again
appeared. He thought, "Campeaux needed another clever hand with a
gun," and noticed how Cordray's quick inspection roved its way
through the traffic. In a moment Cordray had found him; he saw
Cordray's whole face break with a recognition and afterward
strictly compose itself. The man wheeled swiftly back into the
alley.</p>

<p>Overmile came out of his spurious repose, noting Peace's
steady-placed stare. It turned the Texan at once, and he had his
own sight of Jack Cordray disappearing. He breasted the flowing
column of Irishmen on the walk, coming directly up to Peace.</p>

<p>He said: "Listen, Frank. Be smart now."</p>

<p>The two were knocked apart by a huge rawboned shape that swayed
and was near to falling. The man had a long bronze beard, beneath
which his lips moved vaguely. "I'm from Tennessee. You from
Kentucky?"</p>

<p>Peace threw him backward. "Get out of here."</p>

<p>"I can whip anyone from Kentucky," growled the big one&mdash;and
lurched beyond them, looking for trouble.</p>

<p>Peace said: "It's all right, Leach."</p>

<p>He stepped into the traffic and let it carry him onward past
Campeaux's Club, past Lou Queed's smaller joint, past the lusty
riot of a dance hall. Abreast Nan Normandy's he paused, pushing
Irishmen off his elbows, and saw Nan serving a full counter,
Campeaux, he noticed, was sitting in there talking with her. He let
the tide boost him forward again and slid out of it at the next
alley, A line of freighters was jammed up in front of Bardee
Oliver's store, loading merchandise for the Salt Lake trade.
Lanterns danced here and men were laboring hugely through the
threshed dust. Peace, heavier humored than he realized, found his
way into the store. He went on back and knocked, and entered the
rear room at Eileen's cool call.</p>

<p>The noise dropped off and the feeling he had was of being
suddenly folded in a softness, in comfort, in serenity. For a
moment it was always this way. Something in him let down; the edge
of his hard temper dissolved. The room cushioned his weariness.</p>

<p>He stood a moment, seeing Eileen's black head lift from a basket
of sewing. He had nothing to say that would interest her; he had no
desire to speak. And it wasn't possible for him to know the picture
he made to her, gaunt with the drive of his work, a ragged flare
brightening the gray surfaces of his eyes. He had forgotten to
shave; the line of his mouth was long and very thin.</p>

<p>She said gently: "Sit beside me, Frank."</p>

<p>He took the near-by chair and settled his frame in it, letting
all his muscles go loose. She dropped her eyes to the sewing.</p>

<p>But if her hands worked at the needle her mind was far from that
chore. His presence disturbed her, as it always did. Every entrance
he made into this room sent strange, wild currents rolling across
it. She was, she knew, a little afraid of this man, afraid of the
utter helplessness he produced in her. She hated to be detached
from her certainty, and always he disturbed the ordered little
world she struggled so resolutely to create in the midst of these
raw camps. And it was like tragedy to remember that she could not
handle him, could not bend him.</p>

<p>She said, not looking up, "You seem so tired to me, Frank. Where
have you been this week?"</p>

<p>"Bill Stagg reported Indians along Bitter Creek. Archie Millard
and I went there and saw nothing but signs."</p>

<p>"Have you had supper?"</p>

<p>"With Roy Lovelace and his wife." He stirred, impatient even in
his weariness. "I wish they'd get the twins out of this."</p>

<p>A quick hurt thrust through her. She laid her small hands on the
sewing and faced him. "You could have come here."</p>

<p>"Lovelace," he said irrelevantly, "is the only square gambler in
town. His wife has a quality hard for me to define. You ought to
know her."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>His faint grin appeared. "Don't always push the world away,
Eileen. There's fun in it which you're missing."</p>

<p>She tipped her chin toward the sewing again. She laced her
fingers together and, held them still. "I can only be what I am.
Frank."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's my mistake, not to realize that." The idleness,
the down-running indolence of his voice broke abruptly; it turned
rough. "You're all a man could want, if you'd let yourself be."</p>

<p>She murmured: "How, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you ever learned what men and women mean to each other?
Love isn't cold. It isn't calculating."</p>

<p>The ivory color of her face had turned to pure rose.</p>

<p>Her chin dropped so that he might not see her eyes, so that she
might not see his.</p>

<p>"Rash and reckless, and you think nothing of tomorrow," she
whispered. "That way, Frank?"</p>

<p>He pulled himself up; he checked the rush of his temper. He knew
she didn't like it. When he spoke again he was dry and a little
ironic: "That's the theory of it, Eileen."</p>

<p>"You're not very patient with me, Frank," she murmured. Then she
dared to look at him, and a forlorn little cry came out of her:
"What's to become of us?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer. Sprawled back in the chair he watched her
rise, her face so stirred that all its lines were lovely, Yet even
then she couldn't forget the orderliness she had to have, Her
shoulders lifted, and then she had put her will against him.</p>

<p>He said brusquely: "If you wish me to leave say so, But don't
stiffen against me as though I were a stranger."</p>

<p>She let go with an anger that straightened him in the chair:
"Don't bring your work manners in here. You have became calloused
and brutal. All the gentleness is gone out of you! It is your way
you've always insisted upon&mdash;and now you're sullen because I
don't give my mind over to you for keeping."</p>

<p>He said, "You become human, Eileen."</p>

<p>"I think we've had enough of that, too," she retorted. "I can't
be vulgar, if that's what you mean by human."</p>

<p>He hoisted himself wearily to his feet. Comfort was gone from
the room. He rubbed his hand across the flat plane of his jaws and
felt the stubble there. He needed a bath, he needed sleep, he
needed something beyond that. It was the first time he had realized
how thin and tight his nerves were. Campeaux, he understood, had
put a pressure against him that wouldn't relax. Campeaux meant to
break him down.</p>

<p>"Why are we fighting again?" he said.</p>

<p>She faced him with a touch of defiance that was strange.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said, "we never fight when you have your way. It is
only when I stand by myself that you talk to me like this. I can't
go any further. I told you that last time. I mean it. Do you see?
I'm a person, I'm Eileen Oliver. I can't be part of your baggage,
to be thrown in stray car seats and lugged around from one
construction town to another for another forty years. And I can't
be just a casual wife, living outside your world. Your world is
your job. I'm not in that. I have no share of it. You come here
when you are finished with that. You go back to it when you're
finished with me. No. Not ever, Frank."</p>

<p>He had nothing to say. He stood with his feet apart, braced
against the insidious creep of weariness, and knew he could never
break through that indomitable resistance. He could not tell her
how he felt, he never had been able to do that. He listened to her,
and in his mind a far light got dimmer and dimmer. When she had
quit talking the silence was very thick.</p>

<p>Somebody knocked on the door and presently, Ben Latimer,
scarcely waiting to be invited, came in. He saw what was here and
stopped, his glance scrupulously polite, shrewdly sharp. Peace
waited for the man's characteristic apology, but it didn't come and
then Peace, resentment having its savage turn in him, saw that
Latimer was smiling, that Latimer was venturing to be boastful.</p>

<p>Latimer said: "I knew Kein wouldn't let a dicker die, once I put
it in his mind, Mr. Peace. I got those four lots at my price, as I
aimed to do. Kein didn't know an ice company wanted to build next
to the tracks, on that ground. As for the other two, they'll do for
what I want."</p>

<p>Peace said, "Good night," and left the room.</p>

<p>Latimer closed the door. He stood against it, dogged and fairly
resolute. "Seems," he said, quietly, "I always come in to find you
two quarrelin'. Why should a man quarrel with you, Eileen? God
knows that bein' here in this same room where you stand makes me
humble enough."</p>

<p>Eileen looked at him. He had done something that put pride in
him. He was a flat figure against that door; he was a man she
hadn't seen distinctly before.</p>

<p>"What money I have made," he said carefully, "I have made in
Wyoming territory. It has been good to me. Someday Cheyenne will be
a pretty town, the capital of the state. The dust and trouble will
be gone, and there'll be shade on the streets and well-thought
people to live beside&mdash;like back East." He let that talk go
and abided the silence a little while. Afterward he said: "I bought
a couple lots in the heart of it today. A sightly spot. I bought
'em for a big house."</p>

<p>She said: "Have you had supper, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said in some surprise, "I was so busy baitin' a hook
for Kein that I straight forgot."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Ben," she said, and stood a moment to gravely
consider him.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Peace tramped back down Main Street as far as Nan Normandy's. He
had no purpose in his head, but when he saw her place to be empty
he turned through the doorway on impulse. She had her back to the
counter, arranging a pile of dishes; but she swung about when she
heard him. There was a change on her light-loving face, a quick
expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>He said stupidly: "Maybe it's coffee I need. We'll try
that."</p>

<p>She put her hands behind her. She had a gentleness for him. "How
long has it been since you've slept?"</p>

<p>A little current of humor rippled the set of his cheeks. "It
wouldn't be the help you'd think."</p>

<p>She shook her head. Suddenly she went toward the door of the
kitchen. "You're careless, Frank. With yourself as well as with
others. Come back here."</p>

<p>He followed her through the kitchen to her own room in the rear.
There was a decent bed in the place and a few matched chairs and a
table supporting a lamp. On the wall, one picture, She said, "Sit
down," and returned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>He dropped on the chair and got out his pipe. But he held it
idle, elbows propping him against the table. The weariness in him
made his head dull, it was deep down in his bones. Through the thin
partitions of this building he heard the diminished brawling of men
in the adjoining joint. Gunshots beat doggedly along the street;
the rumble and jolt of a big freighting caravan on the main street
telegraphed through the earth and through the walls. Nan returned
with his cup of coffee, placing it before him, He laid aside his
pipe. The coffee helped some. That sound of shooting kept up and a
man yelled in a wild, savage way out in front of the restaurant.
Peace pulled up his head to find her standing against a wall of
this little room, carefully watching him.</p>

<p>He said: "I wonder why I'm here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I get a little lonely, too, Frank."</p>

<p>"Do I strike you that way?"</p>

<p>"Not lonely, so much. But of being terribly alone, even with all
your work and all your friends."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"I know you," she told him gently.</p>

<p>He rose, no particular thought in his mind. "The coffee helped,"
he said, and turned about. The pressure of fatigue was in his
knees, strange to him. He had not known that he could be this
tired. He put his hands on the edge of the bed and sat down. The
softness of it pulled him back, and he lay full length, one hand
shading big, eyes against the light. She saw that and came about
the table until her body shut off the glare.</p>

<p>He said: "You're not afraid of anything&mdash;that's my guess.
You have a pride that can freeze a man out in a minute. Yet you
remind me of a little girl standing in the middle of an empty road,
hoping something exciting will come along."</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured. Her lips made a long, wistful curve against
the smoothness of her face, The love of laughter, the hunger and
the eagerness for the strong emotions of living could be seen so
plainly in her. For a moment the barrier was down, and he saw the
richness, and the desirability of this woman again. He reached over
and took one of her hands and held it in his own broad palm; and
closed his eyes.</p>

<p>It seemed a long while afterward that he heard her speak in a
hurried, uneven whispering: "Sometimes you can be very cruel,
Frank."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. "How?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>She drew her hand away. "It isn't that you mean to be."</p>

<p>He said: "I have never lifted a gun or a fist against a man
before he moved first, Nan."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that."</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>She said: "Shut your eyes."</p>

<p>But for a moment he held her glance. The silence was stirred
with something like a quick heat rushing between them. She was
smiling in a remote way, the corners, of her lips softly curved. A
long excitement raced through him. And then he closed his eyes.
"There's a comfort here," he said.</p>

<p>Something brushed him faintly across a cheek, and suddenly he
was wide awake. Nan Normandy sat beside the bed, her face lifting
away from him. Her cheeks were soft and rose-colored in the gentle
lamplight. She said: "Do you know you've been asleep for two
hours?"</p>

<p>He sat up at once, ashamed of himself. "That's the second time
I've made a mistake," he grumbled. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "No, I guess not." He rose and walked around the
room, his restlessness returned. He got out his pipe. "The sleep
helped. You're a wise woman. Nan."</p>

<p>"I said I knew you, didn't I?" She sat in the chair, hands
folded; her eyes followed his impatient circling.</p>

<p>He stopped in front of her, looking down. Her blond hair was
palely shining in the light; all her features were clear and even
and vivid to him. He said: "I like women who follow Eve's
pattern."</p>

<p>The color deepened instantly on her cheeks. She dropped her
chin, not looking at him. "She was a restless woman, Frank. She
made Adam miserable."</p>

<p>"But she was a woman," he drawled. "And I never thought much of
Adam's farm and fireside disposition."</p>

<p>It made her laugh. She rose. "You're feeling better. So I have
done my Christian duty. You'd better go."</p>

<p>"Been out to end of track yet?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow's Sunday, but they'll be laying steel. We'll catch the
morning work train."</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "I'd love to go."</p>

<p>He said, "Good night," and went to the door. He turned there and
looked back. She wasn't smiling. The barrier was between them
again, as though danger had come to this room. He felt it and could
not understand it. One moment they were friends; and then they were
strangers looking across the wall. He went out through the kitchen
into the full boil of Benton's street. Back at engineers' quarters
he found Morgan, as usual, propped up in the bunk reading an old
newspaper.</p>

<p>"Where's Leach?"</p>

<p>Morgan looked over the top of the paper. "Out nursin' a grouch
somewhere." He let his shrewd eyes cover Peace a moment and then
returned to his reading.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">
At eight o'clock they left Benton on the work train, Nan and
Peace and Overmile and the imperturbable Morgan. On the train also
were the two inseparable bulldogs of the road, Sam Reed and Jack
Casement. One of the government commissioners joined them at
Rawlins, fifteen miles out. These and the usual quota of Irishmen
bound back to grading camps filled the coach.</p>

<p>For some reason Morgan exhibited a quality of cheerfulness not
usual to him; and for some reason Leach Overmile, ordinarily full
of dry humor, had nothing to say. The same dismal temper that had
been in control of him for almost a month still possessed him.
Relaxed in the coach seat, Peace painstakingly sought to discover a
reason for the Texan's aloof silence and could not.</p>

<p>Morgan's good nature was easier to explain. In the beginning
Phil had disliked Nan, as he disliked most women. But it wasn't
hard to look at Nan this morning and understand why a man should be
charmed by her personality. Her gayness went along the car like
warmth. Jack Casement came forward and, sat on the arm of a seat,
his scrappy Irish face openly appreciating Nan. Reed came up to
have a word. Silent while the talk went on, Peace noted the way her
mouth stirred, softly showing the play of an inner laughter. She
was speaking to Reed, her voice composed and calm, and the tilt of
her face strangely quickened Peace's interest. She had a womanly
fullness behind that smiling reserve, a richness that was for none
of them.</p>

<p>Her eyes came to him, feeling his glance. Reed said: "We'll have
to put a guard around you when we get into Utah territory, Miss
Normandy. Brigham's boys are shy on wives." She nodded, holding
Peace's attention. Her lips were straight and still, with sweetness
on them, and a thought struck straight across the space to him,
direct and plain, excluding the other men.</p>

<p>Overmile abruptly rose and went down the aisle. Morgan smiled,
"Our long drink of water from the Lone Star State feels like bitin'
himself this momin'."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Peace earnestly, "I knew why."</p>

<p>Morgan stared at him. Morgan shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Let it go."</p>

<p>All the desert ran its monochrome surface off into the dim
powder-blue heat mists of this heated day, The flash of the sun was
full and harsh. They ran up the gentle Creston grade and dipped
over the Continental Divide, diving through the red walls of the
reoently cut right of way, Beyond, on the baked flatness of the Red
Desert, they passed a half-mile line of laden material trains
waiting on the siding. Two hours from Benton they reached end of
track.</p>

<p>Casement and Reed hurried off. Overmile wasn't to be seen and
Morgan went his own way, leaving Peace and Nan alone. Peace took
her arm and started straight down the track.</p>

<p>This was Casement's capital city&mdash;this formless, dusty,
confused and hurry-scurry habitation lying across the sun-blasted
Wyoming plain. The long boarding train stood on a siding; the
shacks and warehouses and corrals and shops that fed materials to
ten thousand men scattered two hundred miles to the front stood in
formless rows under a pall of alkali whipped forty feet into the
sky. Great dumps of steel and ties lined the right of way, and
wagons and men crossed and recrossed the powder-churned earth. A
material train slowly backed along the rails, stopping at the very
end of steel. Half a dozen soldiers squatted under the false
protection of a tin-roofed lean-to, their faces broiled black.
Coming beside another huge row of ties, Peace gave his arm to
Nan.</p>

<p>"We'll get a good view from there," he said, and helped her
climb the ten-foot vantage point. From that spot the activities of
the track gang lay directly under their eyes. The rush of the steel
truck and its galloping white horse, the runout of the rails, the
bronze-voiced "Down!" of the steel foreman, the clang fall of those
rails and the swift attack of the sledges beating the spikes
home&mdash;these things were part of a familiar routine to Peace.
Familiar and strongly satisfactory. Watching Nan, he saw that her
attention was full with the picture. The material train chuffed
forward another length of track, funneling a black smoke into the
agitated sky. The whistling of other advancing material trains cut
hoarse, beating patterns of sound into this sweaty racket. Out
forward, far forward, the line of waiting ties made a flickering
gray-white row along the grade. In the greater distance, smoky dust
spires marked the travel on the Salt Lake stage road. In all
directions this rolling, sage-studded desert heaved its faint
undulations away.</p>

<p>She turned to him, her voice wistful. "They work so very
hard."</p>

<p>"And fight hard and play hard." he said. "That's your
Irishman."</p>

<p>"And die from heat and disease and accident and bullets," she
added. "I have wondered why they are so violent and so savage when
they hit Benton. Can you blame them?"</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "you'd tell that to the Eastern moralists who
came out here to pass judgment. Sure, Benton is wicked. It couldn't
be otherwise, with the sort of man that comes to it. But that's the
only sort of man that could swing a sledge or heave forty-pound
steel or swallow shovel dust in this heat."</p>

<p>"You like them rough and tough," she said. "You like them when
they laugh in your face and come at you with their fists."</p>

<p>"They're alive."</p>

<p>"That's why you like them."</p>

<p>Sam Reed came past the tie pile rapidly, shaking his head. "This
sun's no place for you, Miss Normandy. Should have a parasol."</p>

<p>Peace started to climb down, but she caught his arm and said,
"Just another moment."</p>

<p>Deep in the south the vague shoulders of the Sierra Madre range
were visible; and afterward his eyes fell to dust jetting up from a
coulee a quarter mile beyond end of track. It pinned his
attention&mdash;that spreading shroud of alkali. Nothing showed
along the earth.</p>

<p>Nan said: "The driver of the steel truck is only a boy!"</p>

<p>He had turned to her; now he turned back. One long, high and
excited yell split the camp, and hard on the heels of the yell a
gunshot laid its flat burst across the hot, windless air. Out of
the coulee and up from the spreading dust spilled a column of
Indians, flattened on angular, long-maned ponies, racing down upon
the steel gang. More guns began to split the heat; the construction
engine's whistle set up an intermittent hooting and all the
Irishmen in the camp began to charge across the grade toward their
rifles stacked near by. The little squad of soldiers rushed out of
the tin lean-to and deployed and knelt and began firing. The
Indians, holding to that single wedgelike column, tore straight
down upon the camp.</p>

<p>Peace wheeled and swept the girl up in his arm and, thus holding
her, made the ten-foot jump to the ground. He went down on his
knees, stung by the drop, and rolled awkwardly to cushion her fall.
He saw her face whiten as her head hit the dust, but she let go of
him as he kept rolling away, and when he got up again she had risen
and was standing against the tie pile.</p>

<p>He said, "Flat against it," and put himself at a corner, She
hadn't known he was carrying a gun. It came out of some pocket, and
she saw him steady himself and take aim&mdash;and wait.</p>

<p>The graders were deployed against the slight right of way
embankment, their rifles driving short, spanging echoes against the
hoof-drum of the Indian ponies, against the steady howling of the
savages. Dust rolled more thickly along the grade and the shapes of
the Indians were dim in it. They were firing as they came, driving
their bullets down into the crouched Irishmen, and charging on. The
whistle of the construction engine kept up its alarm; a man in the
cook shack banged his fist regularly on the bottom of a pan as
though he were swarming bees. The kid driving the steel truck made
one long dive and landed, flat on his stomach, at Nan's feet under
the half shelter of the ties.</p>

<p>Peace said, "Arapahoes," and opened up with his revolver,
targeting those ruddy shapes weaving up through the dense dust. His
gun roared and kicked back, and straightened and roared again.</p>

<p>A bullet shaved a long sliver from a tie over Nan's head.</p>

<p>The Indian column rushed on through the camp's irregular street,
pounding by the far side of the tie pile, shots rattling against
the sides of the adjacent boarding train like the burst of popcorn.
Dust was thicker than rain mist from one end of the camp to the
other; the bullets of the graders, pursuing the Arapahoes, began to
strike dangerously close to the tie pile. Up out of the pall raced
a single buck, his thin and tall and naked torso presented squarely
at Peace as he charged the ties, Peace's revolver caught him a
scant ten yards away, knocking him physically off the pony. There
was a rope tied to the waist of the savage and when he fell the
pony wheeled and bolted after the departing column, dragging the
Indian through the up-ripped alkali.</p>

<p>The graders moved forward from the embankment like soldiers
making a charge. Down at the end of the camp's street the high
battle wail of the Arapahoes slimmed out to an echo that presently
blended with the tattoo of their pony hoofs. The firing died to a
few solitary shots. Men were milling along the street, half hidden
by the dust and cursing out their vivid Irish wrath. Sam Reed ran
forward and stepped by the tie pile. He grasped a Spencer carbine
in one fist, the glitter of excitement turning his eyes pale. The
whole front of his black suit had the appearance of being dipped in
a flour barrel.</p>

<p>"Miss Normandy!"</p>

<p>Peace whirled around, Nan stood directly by him. Her cheeks were
faintly white. Yet Peace, thoroughly aroused, saw no fear in her.
She said to Reed: "Nothing's happened to me."</p>

<p>Reed said: "My God," in a deeply relieved way, and went trotting
over to the embankment.</p>

<p>A man over there said: "Hack McKinley's sure dead," in a wholly
matter-of-fact way. The graders were straggling back down the
street, dragging the butts of their rifles in the dust. The steel
truck boy got up and grinned at Nan and started for the track.</p>

<p>Peace said brusquely: "I'd like to think of the right word to
describe you, Nan," and took hold of her arm. She swayed to his
touch and he felt the faint tremor of her body. But she was smiling
at him in a manner that drove a long, rash pulse through his blood.
For a moment they were two people, quite alone, a quality pulling
them more closely together; the heat and the dust and the sound of
all the voices of the camp fell aside. Peace let his arm drop. Some
of the fighting bitterness loosened its grip on his long mouth. The
long regret in his voice was very clear to her.</p>

<p>"Some day, Nan, you're going to make some man's life a pleasant
thing, full of fun and sweetness. I envy that man."</p>

<p>"Does it mean that much to you?" she murmured; and then, before
he could answer, her talk broke in hurriedly. "Let's go on."</p>

<p>The steel truck rolled forward with its fresh load and the
sledges of the track crew fell resonantly on the rail spikes; the
broken rhythm of the job was resumed. The material train crept
forward another length of newly laid track. The squad of cavalry
trotted back from a short and futile, stern chase of the Arapahoes
and settled down once more under the sultry shade of the tin-roofed
lean-to. One more flurry had passed by.</p>

<p>At noon Peace and Nan ate in Reed's office car with the official
staff. Around two o'clock they boarded the day coach hooked to a
Benton-bound construction train. Phil Morgan ambled in and sat with
Nan. Overmile wasn't to be seen. Traveling the length of the coach,
Peace found him crouched in the vestibule, smoking through a glum
silence. He stared at Peace, saying nothing. Peace returned to Nan;
the train got under way.</p>

<p>Phil Morgan said: "'Think that was the red man's swan song as
far as direct attack on the right of way is concerned. He'll roam
the edges and catch the fellow foolish enough to stray beyond
proteetion, But he's learned be can't monkey with a bunch of
Irishmen who were educated at Vicksburg and Lookout Mountain,
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nan Normandy suddenly wiped a clear patch in the car window's
dust-fogged surface and looked through it. A man came abreast of
the car, mounted on a big roan horse, and waited there for the
train to pull by. Nan said in a swift, strange way: "Frank!"</p>

<p>Peace stared out there and had a moment's sight of the rider
whose face straightened on the car with a suddenly impaled
interest. Peace said, "Bill Wallen&mdash;a saloon-keeper at Nick
Moylan's camp."</p>

<p>She started to rise from her seat, the strangeness of her
expression increasing. Peace tried to catch another view of Wallen,
but the man had wheeled this pony away at a dead gallop. The train
gathered speed and slid past the solid line of cars on the siding.
Nan Normandy fell back in the seat; her eyes, wide and stirred,
sought Frank Peace's face.</p>

<p>"Wallen?" she murmured. "You're sure?"</p>

<p>He said, "Wait," and grabbed at the edge of a picture that slid
fugitively through his head. He failed to get it. "Yes. Somebody
you know?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer. That expression, startled and half afraid,
slowly settled. Peace noticed Overmile at the vestibule door,
staring down the aisle to Nan.</p>

<p>They got off the train at Benton shortly after five and walked
across the street to the restaurant, pausing there a moment in the
harsh flood of the day's last sunlight. She turned so that the
pleased, happy expression on her lips was there for him to see.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much, Frank."</p>

<p>He had a question in his mind and found it hard to shape up. It
came out of him lamely and wasn't what he wanted to know at all.
"You're getting along all right?"</p>

<p>She said: "Perhaps I ask for too much."</p>

<p>He didn't understand it; he showed that by the quick crease
springing across his forehead. She smiled and put her hand to his
arm. "Never mind, Frank. Do you approve of me?"</p>

<p>He said carefully: "If it matters to you I do."</p>

<p>She was grave then, grave and still. "It seems to matter, I
don't know why." But her ingrained honesty, always so near to the
surface, made her add something. "That was a silly question. I'm
sorry I asked it. There shouldn't be any obligations between us.
You have troubles enough, Forget it."</p>

<p>A voice behind him, clear and self-possessed, said: "How are
you, Frank?" Turning, he saw Eileen walking up, parasol tipped
against the sun.</p>

<p>He removed his hat. "Eileen, have you met Nan Normandy?"</p>

<p>Eileen's voice was like the gentle, crystal tinkle of glass. "I
have heard of you, Miss Normandy."</p>

<p>There was a comparison here that was, for Peace, hard to make.
Dark and slim, Eileen stood before Peace in a way that was
willfully proud. The orderliness of this girl covered her like a
hard finish; and no emotion showed through it. It was a contrast he
could not overlook, For Nan's presence, even now, was as the stir
of a soft, wild wind against him.</p>

<p>She said: "Thank you again, Frank," and smiled at Eileen, and
turned into her place.</p>

<p>Eileen said in that straightened, unmoved voice: "Walk a way
with me, please," and kept beside him along Benton's empty street.
This day's dull lethargy still locked the town; the smell of
tobacco, smoke and whisky puffed out of the saloons in stale
eddies. They turned down the alley, their steps striking together.
Eileen's voice was rigidly controlled: "I never thought that I
should ever take a man publicly away from another woman,
Frank."</p>

<p>He said nothing. They entered the store and went through it.
Inside the back room, she turned to face him with a swiftness that
he didn't understand, with a passionate force that destroyed all
her calm. "I never thought I would ever beg for a man! I walked
that street for an hour, waiting for you to come back with her. Do
you think it was an accident I passed you? It wasn't! I hate myself
for doing it. To be cheap and ordinary!"</p>

<p>"Eileen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have never been very patient with me, Frank. I know. You
have been tiring of me&mdash;because I can't help being proud! Oh,
Frank, you don't know what misery is! I want to be myself, but you
will not let me be. Every time we quarrel you beat me lower and
lower in my own eyes. I have nothing left except the thought that
one day we'll be out of this country and away from this kind of
life. But you won't even let me hope for that! I have to be your
kind of woman, if I want you. I have to throw away my own ways.
Frank, you're so cruel!"</p>

<p>"Eileen," he broke in sharply, "what have you done?" She made a
gesture that changed her completely from the woman he knew. She
raised her arms, she opened them. "All right, Frank, If you can't
change I must. So here I am, just as you want me to be."</p>

<p>He reached out and pulled her in. The pressure of her arms was
tight and complete on his shoulders, and her lips met his mouth
swiftly and gave him all that he wanted. The beat of her heart
struck quick and hard against his chest; her body shook. When he
lifted his head he saw that she was crying, a thing she never had
done before.</p>

<p>"I can't lose you, Frank," she said. "My pride goes before
that." And then, seeing the look in his eyes, her fingers dug
fiercely into his shoulders. "Isn't that enough? What more do you
want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said gently.</p>

<p>"Then," she said quickly, "let us be married. At once.
Tonight."</p>

<p>He said: "There was a minister through here last week. He's back
in Cheyenne now."</p>

<p>"We can go to Cheyenne tonight."</p>

<p>"I have to leave tomorrow for a trip into the Wasatch tie camps.
I'll be back inside of three weeks."</p>

<p>She looked at him. "Have you changed your mind about me?"</p>

<p>He said, "No," and didn't like the sound of his voice. He
repeated it. "No, Eileen," and kissed her again. The setting of a
ring on her finger had slipped around; it bit into his neck as she
held him.</p>

<p>When Peace entered the bunkroom at the commissary building half
an hour later he found Overmile there. Overmile stood up and
carefully took a cigarette from his mouth.</p>

<p>"Peace," he said, "what the hell kind of a man are you?"</p>

<p>Peace looked at him. "You've got something on your chest. You've
had it there a long time. Get it off if you think you'll feel
better."</p>

<p>"The company," said Overmile, "pays me to rustle horses for you.
That's my job, and I'll do it. But, by God, I can't stand by and
see you make a fool out of a woman!"</p>

<p>"Is that it?" said Peace.</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Your job doesn't include my personal affairs," said Peace quite
softly.</p>

<p>"No," said Overmile. "No? Maybe it's my personal affair,
too."</p>

<p>"Keep it to yourself. I don't want to hear it."</p>

<p>Overmile's temper was a wicked, thing when it lifted. He paled a
little. He said: "I don't take that talk, Frank. Not even from you.
And I don't let any man livin' hurt Nan Normandy."</p>

<p>Peace said, "Who?" and his freshening glance saw something on
the Texan's face then that shook the anger out of him. He walked
over to Overmile; he put a hand on Overmile's shoulder. "I'm sorry,
Leach."</p>

<p>"Sorry?" growled Overmile.</p>

<p>"I misunderstood you," answered Peace. "The field's all yours.
Eileen and I are getting married the day I come back from the
Wasatch camps."</p>

<p>Leach stared. There wasn't any light on Peace's face, there
wasn't any lift in his talk. It made the Texan narrow his lids and
search Peace with a long, solid attention. Afterward he dropped his
head, turning the burning cigarette around and around between his
fingers. "Maybe," he said dryly, "we both better get drunk. Some
folks hold to that theory." He drew a long breath. "I've had a hell
of a month, son. Let's forget it."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">
THIS was September. On the high Continental Divide plateau the
sun struck men down with its sledgehammer strokes and the fine dust
was a constant mist along the grade; by night the water in the camp
bucket froze an inch deep and the deep cold stiffened the tough
Irish in their bunks.</p>

<p>Racing across the broken flats of the Red Desert, the Union hit
its stride. Three miles a day. Four miles a day. On one memorable
day, seven. Jack Casement, nervous and indomitable, drove his
terriers as he drove himself, The dull steel rolled forward; it
caught up with a dallying grade crew in a stubborn cut and waited
not at all. Jack Casement hurled the grading crew aside and threw a
thousand of its own chosen Irish into the breech, eating out that
obstructing cut between sunup and sundown, The flow of material
faltered, Tugging at his red beard, Casement burned up the wires to
Omaha where his dogged brother Dan fought to keep the life-blood
rhythm of supplies pulsing smoothly toward an end of track now
eight hundred miles away. Wired brother Jack: "I'm building a road.
What the hell are you doing back there?" Answered brother Dan:
"You'll get your steel," and threw his long, heavy-laden trains out
across the Nebraska prairie.</p>

<p>One hundred cars a day. Two hundred. Three hundred.</p>

<p>It was a dark stream ceaselessly flowing, the Union's straight
engine stacks belching smoke into that virgin sky, the Union's
fireboxes shuttering a blood glow into startled dark. Up the Platte
Valley the diminishing buffalo herds snorted away from the clank of
the iron monster; high on Laramie Plains antelope bands scudded
like a low wind into the remoter hills at the hoarse blast of the
engines' exhaust pipes. Silhouetted on distant ridges, the
intractable Sioux watched that steel band more firmly girdle the
very bosom of their land.</p>

<p>The first day of September found end of track past the middle
barrens of the Red Desert into the equal desolation of the Bitter
Creek region. Following that dry and meandering stream's bed, the
road ducked its way through one geologic fault after another. On
the fifteenth it dropped Rock Springs Station hurriedly behind and
pressed into the Bitter Creek canyon. On the twentieth it broke
into the valley of the Green, to find the white tents of another
hell-on-wheels waiting for the thirsty construction men. But the
Welsh Barney's bridge gang had already passed this way and so,
scarcely pausing at Green River, the road rushed over the waiting
bridge, hoisted itself out of the river's gorge and reached Bryan
at the edge of Black's Fork on the twenty-seventh.</p>

<p>Bryan roared overnight. Directly ahead the rugged Uintah chain
waited. Sixty miles to the south the thirteen-thousand-foot spire
of Gilbert's Peak glittered whitely in the sun, warning the
construction crew. Salt Lake lay two hundred miles west, with
winter and nothing but heavy mountains ahead.</p>

<p>Jack Casement stood in Bryan's street that night and considered
the rolling hills before him. He said to Reed:</p>

<p>"There will be no more four-mile days. Where's the Central
now?"</p>

<p>"Coming up the Humboldt, 260 miles from Ogden."</p>

<p>"Sixty miles farther from Ogden than we are. But they've got
nothin' but level ground to cover. Or almost so. Our heavy work's
just started, We're goin' to get snowed in ninety days from now.
They could beat us, Sam."</p>

<p>"Damned if they do."</p>

<p>"I was only statin' a possibility," said Casement mildly.</p>

<p>"I hear Oakes Ames and his Credit Mobilier is about busted.
Where's the money to build this road comin' from, then?"</p>

<p>Reed said: "From somewhere."</p>

<p>"It had better," answered Casement. "This winter work is goin'
to cost the company twenty million dollars."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
That same night a small, nondescript man whose sober moments were
occupied in swamping out Campeaux's saloon with a bucket and a
broom drank a little deeper than usual. His name was Heck Wolver
and his station in these rough-and-tumble surroundings was
thoroughly obscure. Trained to jump when ordered aside, trained to
smile when some roistering Irishmen shoved him back against the
wall, he long since had forgotten what pride was. But once in a
while, when thoroughly drunk, Heck Wolver remembered that he was a
man and something crawled abysmally through him.</p>

<p>The barkeep said: "You've had your round of free drinks, Heck.
Don't block the way."</p>

<p>Wolver turned obediently and went out into the street, being
jostled this way and that by the crowd until he found himself
standing alone beside the main line track. There was a round,
bright moon paling the shadows, with wood smoke keen in the crisp
mountain air. Wolver stared up at the moon like a gaunt coyote,
grewling to himself in a husky way, lashed by the thought of all
the wrongs done him. Without much purpose, he walked along the
right of way, out toward Bryan's edge. When his eyes focused he was
in front of a small shanty, looking through an open doorway. There
was a woman moving about the single room&mdash;the young wife of
Ned Beard, telegrapher.</p>

<p>Wolver stared at her, his soaked and irregular face put into
order by a strangling impulse. He turned his eyes to either side of
the house, and he listened and heard only the woman's footsteps.
After that he crept into the place.</p>

<p>She saw him; she saw what he was completely. She backed away,
warning him. "Get out of here."</p>

<p>But Wolver murmured, "You come here, honey," and went directly
for her. Her hand slapped him across the face, shaking his vision.
After that he went after her, hit her on the mouth with his doubled
fist and lifted his boot and drove it into her stomach, He said,
"I'll teach you something, honey." She screamed as she fell, and
then fainted.</p>

<p>Wolver rushed from the shanty. He reached the track, stumbled on
a rail and plunged headlong into the gravel. Somebody yelled at
him, and when he got up he swung his head and discovered a pair of
men racing for him; the light from the shanty hit him fully at the
moment and one of the men yelled, "Wolver, come here." Full of
panic, Wolver rushed across the uneven ground, reached the back end
of Bryan and crawled under the edge of Campeaux's big tent. Before
he quite got through his feet were seized and he was dragged
out.</p>

<p>He had been sighted by two men; but there were a dozen around
him now. Somebody said very calmly, "Go get Collie
Moynihan&mdash;we'll be at Miz Beard's house," and started Wolver
back along the trail he had made.</p>

<p>Other Irishmen began to trot up from the main street, to be
warned away by this quiet little group, Feeling the bite of two
tough fists into the flesh of his arm, Wolver complained:
"Gentlemen, there's been a mistake."</p>

<p>Nobody answered him. At the door of the shanty they stopped,
Collie Moynihan came running up the track&mdash;the laughing Paddy
who had wrecked Straight-Edge Annie's place on Peace's command. He
knew what this was when he saw it and said only, "Take him inside,
bhoys," and preceded them into the shanty, carefully removing his
hat. The telegrapher's young wife sat on a chair and pressed a
towel to her bruised face.</p>

<p>He said: "Is this the man?"</p>

<p>"A mistake," said Heck Wolver, "All a mistake."</p>

<p>Mrs. Beard groaned faintly. "Send for my husband&mdash;that's
the man."</p>

<p>They took Heck Wolver out of the shanty. Collie Moynihan dropped
a soft word that sent a man running back toward Casement's big
warehouse, and afterward they marched Wolver on down the track into
the farther darkness. The despatched man presently returned with a
length of rope over his shoulder, A quarter mile from town Collie
pointed to a short telegraph pole&mdash;merely pointed to it.
Somebody threw the rope across the arm of the pole, and somebody
found an empty box by the right of way and stood it under the
dangling rope.</p>

<p>"Get on it, Heck," ordered Cellie.</p>

<p>"The hell I do!"</p>

<p>A pair of men lifted him up to the box and slipped the rope
around his neck, and tightened it until he felt the pressure. They
tied the free end to a spike in the telegraph pole, and got another
piece of rope and bound his arms. A figure was trotting along the
track, throwing gravel fast beneath his boots. Moynihan drew a gun
and called that way:</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, my bhoy." The man stopped, not speaking.
Looking at him in the pale moonglow, Wolver identified one of
Campeaux's gamblers, He called desperately at the man:</p>

<p>"You get Sid here. Tell him to get Al Brett."</p>

<p>But the man yonder didn't speak; nobody in the group spoke. The
box beneath Wolver tipped in the loose soil, making him cry out
again: "Gentlemen, I'm falling!"</p>

<p>One of the crowd suddenly pulled up his shoulders and ran toward
the box, Heck understood immediately what was to be done, and his
last shrill, rattling yell was for Campeaux's gambler in the
background. "Frank Peace's men got me! Tell Campeaux that!"</p>

<p>Heck Wolver dropped sharply; the rope tightened and snapped back
a little as Heck's feet kicked up and down.</p>

<p>The gambler in the background suddenly whirled and threw himself
toward Bryan.</p>

<p>Collie Moynihan said, after a long stillness: "That'll be all,
bhoys."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Campeaux waited in the small office room off the main tent. He had
a desk there and one chair, which he occupied. Hung above the desk
was a painting of a big-thighed woman lying on a couch, enfolded by
an immaterial bit of gauze. The title was "Beauty," and Beauty
smiled ambiguously down upon the men collecting in the little room.
Queed came in, a straight, roan-haired man with one long scar
slashing his lefit cheek. His lips were very short, coming together
in a single straight line. Above them sat a pair of eyes without
the power of warmth. Sailor Dick Shugrue, whose saloon favored
knockout drops when the customer had money, followed after Queed.
Faro Evans, operator of Number One House, stood in a corner and
pared his fingernails casually with a pocket knife. Half a dozen
other owners of Bryan's saloons and dives were here. Al Brett and
Jack Cordray stood by the door. Duke Ring was just outside,
watching the alley.</p>

<p>Queed said: "Wolver wasn't any loss to you, Sid."</p>

<p>"I protect my men," stated Campeaux. "Even the bums."</p>

<p>"You'll play hell protectin' him now," joked Faro Evans. "His
neck's stretched a foot. Who did it?"</p>

<p>"Collie Moynihan."</p>

<p>"Peace's man. Where's Peace?"</p>

<p>"Just got in town."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Faro Evans, "you were going to do something
about it. That's a nice picture on the wall. Give you fifty for
it."</p>

<p>"I want to talk about this," said Campeaux.</p>

<p>The rattle of glasses, the scrape and turn of feet, the
undulating waves of talk came through the flimsy office wall from
the Club. Campeanx's wide jaws loosened on the cigar he held
between his lips.</p>

<p>"I thought once it would be a simple matter to knock Peace out
of the way. Then I got to thinkin' maybe we could stand a little
bit of order in these towns as long as we did a good business.
That's all I want&mdash;business. But we're bein' pinched out.
Benton was a fine place. We were all set to have the same thing at
Green River. Then the road jumps Green River and comes here. I have
found out we won't be here but a couple of weeks. See the idea? We
move towns so fast that we shake a lot of floating population
loose. They ain't following us from Benton. I'm losing a thousand
dollars' worth of trade a day on that account. And this moving
around every week costs money. Freight charges and carpenter work.
Business ain't as it was."</p>

<p>"Couldn't expect it to last forever," said Faro Evans.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Campeaux. "But the railroad ain't reasonable.
Moynihan's vigilantes beat hell out of two of my gamblers last week
for cleaning a couple suckers. That's Peace's idea. He's tightened
up. Well, I know we don't have much more of this left. But while it
lasts I want things open."</p>

<p>Queed said, out of his stony calm: "We made our mistake away
back at Julesburg. We let Peace have his way there. He's had, it
ever since."</p>

<p>Campeaux murmured: "I mean to open this camp. From here on to
the end of the line we'll run things our way. I'm just telling you
the lid's off, so go ahead."</p>

<p>Sailor Dick Shugrue said skeptically: "How?"</p>

<p>"You'll know before the night's over."</p>

<p>Queed stared at him. "There's only one way to handle Peace, Sid.
Don't waste your time on anything else."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Campeaux.</p>

<p>"Better be sure, about it," insisted Queed, and left the room.
The others took this as a cue, leaving Campeaux sitting
enigmatically in the chair, his wide body spilling over its edges.
Duke Ring came in to join Al Brett and Jack Cordray. Campeaux
considered Ring a moment, the slate surfaces of his eyes thoroughly
unchangeable.</p>

<p>"Ring," he said, "you go up to the nearest tie camp.
Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Ring, and left.</p>

<p>Campeaux hunched himself forward, his index, finger wagging at
Cordray and Brett. "Now we're going to have some fun!"</p>

<p>"Moyniban?" drawled Brett. His pale face loosened up and he
showed a faint, curled smile.</p>

<p>"No, Al," said Campeaux. "Come over here."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
At his blackjack table, Roy Lovelace paid off a round of bets,
dealt and broke himself again. His long fingers nudged and measured
the chips out against the bets placed; and for a moment he let his
hands lie idle, one fist holding the card pack, the other palm flat
on the table. Faint sweat coated his forehead; looking around, he
observed the speechless alarm lying deep in his wife's eyes. He
said to the crowd at the table: "Deal's closed a moment," and
walked across the room to the far corner of the bar. A water bucket
with a tin dipper stood on a stool against the partition of
Campeaux's office; he heard Campeaux's talk, heavy and calm, come
through the shrunken edges of the boards.</p>

<p>He helped himself to a drink, thirsty from the strain of a bad
hour's playing, The cards this night were running out on him, and a
man waited back at the table with the offer of a thousand-dollar
bet. He could refuse it, but he never had. The voices shuttling
back and forth in Campeaux's quarters came against his own hard
reflections and made no dent in his mind; not until he heard
Peace's name mentioned. It was that word which opened a wide and
receptive alley through his head. He bent over the bucket in a
manner that put his ear nearer to the partition, and skimmed a
little speck of dirt from the water's surface. One of Campeaux's
barkeeps looked casually at him and nodded. Men went out of
Campeaux's office.</p>

<p>Al Brett's dry question was quite clear: "Collie Moyniban?"</p>

<p>"No, Al," said Campeaux, "Come over here."</p>

<p>Lovelace skimmed the water back and forth, his cheeks wholly
unstirred, He lifted the dipper again and drained it. And stood
there a moment, staring at the bright flash of the back bar's
mirror. No saloon west of Chicago had an elegance equal to this
place whose huge paintings showed out between their golden frames,
whose cut-glass goblets threw a thousand slivers of diamond light
down upon the glow of the polished mahogany. The near-by barkeep
turned to look at him again, showing curiosity. The orchestra's
music of a sudden filled the tent. Lovelace walked back to his
table.</p>

<p>"Take a thousand?" said the player.</p>

<p>"A bet," said Lovelace, and dealt.</p>

<p>Two cards to the player. Two to himself, one face up. The player
covered his cards with a palm and cautiously lifted their edges,
bending down to read them.</p>

<p>He said: "Good."</p>

<p>Lovelace had a king showing; the other card, when he tipped it
over, was a five. Fifteen. He could stand on that and hope the
player had less; or he could draw and risk going broke beyond the
limit of twenty-one. The player had been lucky all night; and in
the man's veiled, set expression was no sign to help Lovelace now.
His fingers more or less made the decision for him; they drew and
turned a card. It was a ten-spot and it broke him.</p>

<p>His wife's presence was a weight behind his shoulder.</p>

<p>He laid down the pack, measuring out the chips to the player.
The player said evenly: "Take two thousand?"</p>

<p>"The game," said Lovelace, "is closed for the night." When he
had cashed the chips he racked them all in the box, put away the
cards and walked quietly from the Club, his hand guiding Helen
through the crowd. They went on in pure silence, past the lights of
the stores, out into the flood of moonlight beyond town. She spoke
then, careful to make her voice indifferent: "How much have we
lost?"</p>

<p>He said: "Five thousand tonight." He admired her for the
restraint she always wore; he felt humble now for the way her hand
went through his, arm. He said: "I've said I'd quit when my luck
ran out. I'll know in another week's playing if it really has, But
that's not why I closed the table. I happened to overhear Campeaux
talking when I took a drink of water."</p>

<p>They went on, swinging together through the still, pine-scented
night. Bryan's noise was a low, churning echo behind them. "Helen,"
he groaned, "what a rotten life this has been for you!"</p>

<p>"We have grieved enough over that, Roy."</p>

<p>He said, bitter as a man can be: "Two things I have never ceased
to regret, and never will. Your being in that saloon. The kids
living from pillar to post, in every cheap lodging house along the
road, Well, a man's got to have one rule of conduct to hold his
pride up. I have mine. I've kept my word, Helen. I've never
betrayed a secret. No matter what I've heard in that saloon the
information has stayed inside me. Gambler's honor. Good God, what
irony the word holds!"</p>

<p>She said, "Roy," in a soft-deep-concerned way.</p>

<p>"I know better now," he muttered dismally. "It's been my boast
to be the squarest dealer in town. But I was always fooling myself.
A gambler's a gambler. Straight or crooked, there's no difference.
Why has Frank Peace been our friend?"</p>

<p>"Because he likes us, Roy."</p>

<p>"I wish to God he never knew us!" groaned Lovelace. "It would
make the situation easier for me now. A gambler's a fool to have
friends. All he can do is lose them when the showdown comes. It's
come to me. I can't squeal, Helen. By God, I can't! That's the only
thing I've stuck by. Campeaux trusts me. I've made my living in his
tent for two years. I've kept my mouth shut. But Peace trusts me.
What am I going to do?"</p>

<p>"Roy," she cried, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"You can't help me, Helen. Whatever I do I'm lost."</p>

<p>There was a ledge of rock stretching across, the moonlight, like
a bench along the earth. He stopped there and sat down. She took
her place beside him, as she had always done, and put her arms
softly around his shoulders. He had northing more to say, gripped
as he was by his own savage problem. She swayed gently, rocking him
as though he were a child.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">
PEACE got back from a long swing through the mountains that
night shortly after eight. His plans had called for a three-week
trip, which had stretched to five. Weary as he was, he could not
break the long-established habit he had of reporting directly to
Reed, and so he turned toward the superintendent's portable office
the moment he dropped from the saddle, Reed and Casement, he found,
were sitting together by a table disordered with a mass of grading
bids. Reed grinned at Peace's inch-long beard.</p>

<p>He said: "All you need now is a squaw and a string of traps over
your shoulder."</p>

<p>"You're going to get all the ties you want," said Peace.
"There's ten little sawmills scattered between here and Weber
Canyon. I made contracts on the spot. Ties to be floated down Bear
River to Tie Siding and picked up there by the contractors."</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Reed.</p>

<p>Peace smiled wryly. "From ninety cents to a dollar and a quarter
per tie, at the siding. The hauling by the contractors is
extra."</p>

<p>"We ought to be using golden spikes for ties at that price,"
commented Casement.</p>

<p>Reed shrugged his shoulders. "We can't choose. I told Frank to
get ties. He got 'em."</p>

<p>"Your bridge timbers will be waiting for you in Echo
Canyon."</p>

<p>"Where you been all this time?" questioned Reed.</p>

<p>"I met Dodge in the Weber River gorge. He was bound for Salt
Lake and took me along."</p>

<p>"I got a wire from him a week ago," said Reed. "He said the
Mormon situation was all right but the right of way business
wasn't. What's that?"</p>

<p>"We stopped at the Townsend House," explained Peace. "We meant
to go straight to see Brigham Young. But he came right over to see
Dodge. Dodge told him it was impossible to build into Salt Lake
Town. That Ogden was all we could do. Young blew up. On Sunday he
preached a sermon at the tabernacle scorching the hide of the Union
and making Dodge pretty much a personal devil. Dodge went right
back to give Young the facts of the case. He told Young the Union
couldn't hit Salt Lake town, and neither could the Central. It was
the first time Young knew the Central wasn't going to skirt the
south side of the lake. Dodge is pretty smooth. Next Sunday Brigham
preached another sermon and said the Union was probably Utah's best
friend, after all. So that's settled. Brigham sees a chance for his
people to make some money in construction work."</p>

<p>The three of them sat in silence a moment.</p>

<p>"Dodge," remarked Reed finally, "could build roads through hell,
But what's this right of way trouble he mentioned?"</p>

<p>"Durant was in Salt Lake," explained Peace.</p>

<p>"Yeah," put in Casement. "He came through here ten days ago,
traveling like a wild man."</p>

<p>"Dodge met him with a proposition," said Peace. "He thinks it's
foolish for the two roads to keep grading past each other. At the
rate we're going there never will be a connection. The Central
means to beat us to Ogden and come right on through Weber and Echo
canyons. Dodge suggested that he get together with the Central
officials and agree on a meeting point somewhere west of Ogden.
Durant blew up and said the Union was to ignore the Central
completely and lay its grade clear out into Nevada, past the
Central's completed track. Never mind the cost or the waste. Get
every mile of government money it can. Well, those were orders. So
Dodge is shooting his grading outfits up toward the Humboldt."</p>

<p>Casement spoke pessimistically. "The Credit Mobilier
construction contract runs out when we reach Piedmont Station. Poor
Oakes Ames, who's been a white man all the way through, can't get
any more Boston money. He's personally busted and his shovel shop
is about gone. He said he'd sacrifice it before he saw the Union
quit. So where's the cash coming from then?"</p>

<p>"Maybe Durant will pull another white rabbit out of the hat,"
suggested Reed.</p>

<p>"He'd better. I don't understand the man."</p>

<p>"A fight for control," said Reed, "that none of us understands.
All I know is we've got to get to Ogden before the Central or we
haven't got a railroad."</p>

<p>Peace said, "I think I'll get some supper," and left the room.
Going past the station, he found Collie Moynihan waiting for
him.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, Mister Peace," said Collie, and softly explained
the lynching of Heck Wolver. He said afterward, "Did I do
right?"</p>

<p>Peace looked down at the solid chunk of an Irishman. "You did
right, Collie. But it was one of Campeaux's men. So watch
yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah," retorted Collie, "it's yourself that should be careful.
Campeaux wastes no time on little ones like me. 'Tis you he'll hate
the more."</p>

<p>Peace went to his quarters and shaved and scrubbed off the
riding dust. In the mess shack he found Overmile and Morgan and
Archie Millard loitering over the meal. There wasn't any army post
near by and Millard, accordingly, was attached to the commissary
for quarters and rations. He sat before the table with his coat
unbuttoned, the long yellow hair carelessly falling down across his
fine, broad brow. Looking at the man at that moment, Peace was
shocked to see the quality of misery in those blue eyes. His mouth
was really bitter behind the tawny sweep of his mustache.</p>

<p>"Frank," he said, "do you have need of me the next three or four
days?"</p>

<p>"I forgot to ask Reed. I'll do it tonight."</p>

<p>Millard's words were stiff and strained. "As a particular favor
to me. I'd like to get away for a little while." He reached into
his pocket and drew out a letter, tossing it before Peace. It had
been crushed into a ball by pressure of Millard's powerful fists,
smoothing it, Peace recognized a departmental order from Fort D. A
Russell in Cheyenne.</p>

<p class="letter">Lieutenant Archibald Millard, Troop A, 1st
Cavalry,<br>
serving on detached duty, will report to Fort D. A.<br>
Russell, Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory, not later than<br>
the 15th of December, for transfer to Governors<br>
Island, New York.<br>
<br>
J. D. STEVENSON, B'V'T MAJ-GEN.</p>

<p>Millard said, dull and angered, "My regiment stays, but I'm
transferred back East. I don't understand it. I've served here less
than a year."</p>

<p>"I'll ask Reed what we have to do. Tonight."</p>

<p>Millard stood up, tall and solid and thoroughly a soldier; he
buttoned his coat and adjusted his hat. He looked a moment at
Peace, those blue eyes narrowed by a hard thinking. He said, "Let
me know," and left the room.</p>

<p>Morgan and Overmile were studying Peace. Morgan said in a direct
way, "You have anything to do with that transfer?"</p>

<p>"I wrote Stevenson a letter a month ago," admitted Peace.</p>

<p>Morgan said nothing. Judgement with him was always slow in
forming. But Overmile shook his head in a regretful manner. "Sorry
you did. Know what he wants the leave for? Cherry's at Fort
Bridger. He'll go there and see her. And when he sees her he'll
come to the conclusion that's been in his head all summer. He'll
resign and marry her."</p>

<p>"Then," said Peace, "we're doing him a favor by bringing his
problem to a head. He's been eating his heart out for six months,
unable to make up his mind. It's a tragedy either way. If he sticks
with his profession he'll never cease to regret losing her. If he
resigns he'll be a squaw man&mdash;and in time to come he'll
remember what he might have been."</p>

<p>"What would you do?" softly questioned Morgan.</p>

<p>"I think I'd stick to my job."</p>

<p>Morgan murmured: "You're a hard nut, Frank, and that's what
you'd do."</p>

<p>"Each man has to cross his own rivers," stated Peace.</p>

<p>The food was before him. He ate a little of it, though he wasn't
hungry any longer, and stoked his pipe and sat with his elbows
propped on the table, not realizing that he was scowling at the far
wall.</p>

<p>Morgan and Overmile kept watching him through that pervading
silence. He had no laughter in him, nothing to remind them of the
deviltry that once had been so characteristic. There wasn't any fat
on him. His cheekbones were flat and high on a deep-tanned skin. A
scar from the fight with Duke Ring made a pale V on the back of his
right hand. Morgan turned his head and met Overmile's glance; and
Overmile quietly shook his head. He got up.</p>

<p>"Think I'll take a walk," he said, and left the room.</p>

<p>Morgan gently repeated what Peace had last said. "A man has to
cross his own rivers. Didn't think you had that wisdom in you,
Frank. Fighters usually don't."</p>

<p>Peace said, "What's that, Phil?"</p>

<p>Morgan rose. He was smiling, a rare thing for this man; smiling
in a quiet, sad way. "Was a time in my life when a good many things
mattered. But I crossed my river and left practically everything on
the far bank. All I seem to consider important now is a little
sleep and a little food and some amount of friendship. I hope that
never happens to you. You're right out in the middle of the street,
swapping punch for punch, raising a hell of a racket, making this
damned sorry world mind you. I want to see you win out. People
seldom do. That's why I stick with you." A little gust of emotion
got into his voice. "Damn it, kid, never change your ways! Ask for
what you want&mdash;and take it&mdash;and let others do the crying!
Don't be sentimental, and don't be a gentleman. I was."</p>

<p>He left the room, leaving Peace in an astonished solitude. He
put down his pipe, the taste of the smoke unsatisfactory on his
tongue, and scrubbed a palm across his cheeks and rose because he
could sit still no longer. Going out the door, he saw Morgan half
across the street, aimed at Campeaux's Club. He started that way
and then felt the weight of somebody over to the left of him,
somebody standing in the deep darkness falling down the side of a
steel pile. A voice said; "Wait, Frank."</p>

<p>Roy Lovelace walked forward. Roy's face in this vague light was
quite pointed. His voice wasn't natural.</p>

<p>"I have got to warn you to be careful. I can't tell you any
more, but I can tell you that much."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"Your luck," murmured Lovelace, "is running out. I think mine
is, too." He turned and vanished beyond the steel pile.</p>

<p>Peace strolled by the station, a small chill fiddling through
his nerves; the sense of trouble always reached him this way, with
a premonition such as comes to the cat animals, clearly and
sharply. Beyond the tracks, at the edge of Bryan's crooked, narrow
street, he paused and had his look at the roving shapes across the
way. A crisp, cold air flowed off the Uintah range; the deep,
growling clamor of the Club rolled up against the shining night.
There was a man stumbling along the track. He came up to Peace; and
Peace recognized Bill Wallen, the bartender of Nick Moylan's
camp&mdash;thin and prematurely old, with an air of a remote
elegance still clinging to him.</p>

<p>He said: "How are you, Peace," very civilly and stood with his
eyes pointed across the street. The edges of a familiarity brushed
Peace's memory again, as they had before in this man's presence,
and went away. Wallen murmured: "What is the girl's name in the
restaurant, do you know? No offense meant by the question, of
course."</p>

<p>"Normandy."</p>

<p>"I knew some Normandys, a long time ago&mdash;in Missouri,"
explained Wallen, and turned away. Peace watched Nan's restaurant
lights a Iong while before crossing the street. When he passed the
restaurant he didn't look in. At another alley he turned toward
Bardee Oliver's store.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Leach Overmile went directly to Nan's from the mess hall. There
were some men eating at the counter and he had no chance to talk to
her for a moment. Afterward she called the colored girl out of the
kitchen and beckoned Leach into the back room.</p>

<p>"I've missed you," she said candidly. "How far did you go?"</p>

<p>"Clean to Salt Lake with Frank." He grinned, and ceased to grin.
"I missed you, too."</p>

<p>"What a nice compliment."</p>

<p>He said: "Campeaux bothered you much?"</p>

<p>"He pays me an occasional visit."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that man's record by now?"</p>

<p>"Leach," she said, very sober, "don't scold me. Campeaux has
always been kind." Her glance followed Overmile's high, stringy
shape as he circled the little room. He had to duck his head at the
corners. She said, her voice quite even: "How is Frank?"</p>

<p>He stopped, and nothing could conceal the misery; the doubt and
the discouragement, lying in his honest eyes. "I wish to God I
knew," he blurted out.</p>

<p>"Leach&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>It was a quick half cry of alarm, though he didn't recognize it.
For he was thinking of his own wishes, this indolent-shaped and
yellow-headed young cowhand who had no power to conceal his
thoughts before her. "A man," he said, "ought to have the right to
consider himself. Shouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I know."</p>

<p>"You know? Why, honey, how could you know about me that's kept
my mouth stric'ly shut?" She didn't answer that. Her lips were soft
and sad; and they held an answer for him, though he didn't see
it.</p>

<p>He went on, his words running out rapidly. "I'll say nothin' I
shouldn't say, though the Lord knows my heart's plumb full. Is
there any chance for me?"</p>

<p>She stepped over and laid her hand on his arm. "I hate to hurt
you, Leach."</p>

<p>He pulled up his head; his lips came together in a severe, thin
line. He cleared his throat in a noisy way and looked down at his
hands. It was quite a while before he shrugged his shoulders in a
manner that tried to be careless, before he achieved a faint, wry
grin.</p>

<p>"Shoot, what was I thinkin' of in the first place? Comes to me
now somethin' Frank said tonight. I didn't get it. I got it now. A
man has to cross his own rivers. Yeah."</p>

<p>She murmured: "How did he say it, Leach?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Sometimes I don't know Frank." He watched
her carefully.</p>

<p>She dropped her glance from him, and she spoke quite slowly; "I
heard he's to be married rather soon."</p>

<p>"Yeah," grunted Leach. He cleared his throat again, "Well," he
said, and clapped on his hat and went bowling out through the three
rooms of this building, He stepped into the street's dust, cutting
under the nose of a freighter's lead horse.</p>

<p>The freighter, yelled: "What you tryin' to do?" Overmile stopped
in his tracks. He said wickedly: "Shut up or I'll pull you off that
seat," and changed his mind and turned back. He entered Campeaux's
saloon in no respectable frame of mind. Morgan was at the counter.
Overmile joined him.</p>

<p>"Where you been?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"Nan's."</p>

<p>Morgan shook his head. He said gently: "Sorry."</p>

<p>Leach drew a long, uneven breath. His voice went downward along
a hopeless note. "That was a kinda wide river to cross, Phil.
Leaves me pretty far from nowhere."</p>

<p>Morgan seemed to be speaking to himself. "A man's life is a
weary walk through the dark. A long way back on the trail little
lights are shinin', That's memory, Leach. You'll never get back to
those lights. But they'll be a comfort to you&mdash;in a way." His
eyes lifted to the vast mirror behind the bar and found the
reflection of Al Brett and Jack Cordray crossing it, on the way to
the door. Morgan paid for his drink. "See you later," he said, and
left the saloon. Cordray and Brett had put themselves swiftly out
of sight. Morgan stood with the point of his shoulder touching the
saloon's door casing, his head bowed in dark consideration.
Presently he, too, moved out of sight.</p>

<p>Entering the back room of the Oliver store, Peace found Ben
Latimer keeping Eileen company. Latimer got up, saying, "Won't
intrude," and started for the door. But he stopped near Peace and
braced his stocky feet apart. "I'd offer you my congratulations, if
I could." Some latent touch of feeling disturbed the dryness and
the coolness of his character. "Eileen deserves better. I mean no
offense at all. I say she deserves better than anything she'll find
out here."</p>

<p>Peace grinned. "Good for you, Ben."</p>

<p>Latimer inclined his head and left. Eileen had been sitting at
the end of the room's table. She got up now and came over to Peace.
He hadn't expected this swiftness; this odd possessiveness. She
lifted her arms, her dark face losing its order, its willed
serenity.</p>

<p>She said, "Frank," and put her lips up to him. She swayed
against him, the enfolding pressure of his arms locking her there.
There wasn't any resistance when he kissed her, there wasn't any
reservation. He could think of these things even as he held her; he
could have strange thoughts in his mind even then, thoughts that
were remote from this deep, pure pleasure. She was coolness for a
man, she was a fragrance and a soft light shining. Always her
presence laid its gentle pressure on the wildness of his mind and
the gustiness of his temper. It was like coming into a tranquil
harbor. Stepping back, he saw her glance search him.</p>

<p>"You've been gone for so long," she whispered, and led him
across the room. He sat down, at once relaxed. She took her place
by the table again, laying a sewing basket into her lap. Her head
dropped to the quick turning of the needle in her fingers. "Did you
have a good trip?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She threw him a swift, sidewise glance. The silence ran
on&mdash;until she broke it with a casual talk. "Things move so
fast. Each town gets a little smaller and a little more wicked.
When the road is finished Father has decided to keep his business
in Cheyenne. Ben's going in with him to handle the freighting.
Ben's already started a line from Cheyenne down to the Colorado
mines. And they have decided to pool some land they got north of
Cheyenne and stock it with Texas beef. Ben intends to run for the
legislature this year." He rolled his head against the back of the
chair, watching her clear profile. Energy in him ran low; he had no
desire to speak. She said: "A girl in Campeaux's place killed
herself last week. And the gambler who ran the chuck-a-luck game at
Queed's was found dead yesterday morning beyond the depot."</p>

<p>"How," he said curiously, "would you be knowing things like
that?"</p>

<p>"My world is too small for you, Frank, So I've had to take an
interest in yours. I have been told that Al Brett and Jack Cordray
mean to kill you." Her needle stopped; she looked directly at him,
her small shoulders squaring. "What will you do when you're through
here?"</p>

<p>"Another railroad, another place."</p>

<p>"Frank&mdash;have you any money at all?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Got some pay checks stuffed away somewhere."</p>

<p>"Father's made himself wealthy&mdash;a country storekeeper who
came West and took the opportunities he found. Ben, slow as he
seems, will be rich, too. These chances are here. You build a road
and help make them. Why aren't you taking them, Frank?"</p>

<p>"I have no talents toward accumulating."</p>

<p>"No," she murmured. "Not unless you put your will to it. Your
will&mdash;which is hard as any man's, once it is set." He said:
"There's a Baptist minister in town, Eileen. Will he do?" She put
the basket on the table and came over to him, dropping to her knees
so that she might read his face, which was so hard to read now. She
was quietly crying: "I thought you had changed your mind!" He
pulled her up until she lay against his big chest.</p>

<p>And he held her there a long while, the warmth of her body
penetrating him. "No," he said. She stood up finally, a scarlet
color staining her skin.</p>

<p>"How much you have changed me! What kind of a woman was I? What
kind am I now?" He pushed himself to his feet. "You have nothing to
be ashamed of, Eileen. You've grown up. I'll be back in a few
minutes." He went out of the room, tramping taciturnly across the
store quarters. He saw Bardee, and stopped, "I think you're getting
the son-in-law you don't want."</p>

<p>Bardee shrugged his shoulders. "I don't presume to shape
Eileen's mind for her. It would do me no good. If she wants you,
Peace, she'll have you. Her mother was like that."</p>

<p>Peace walked into the street. He got out his pipe and filled it,
not sure of what he wanted to do next. A tall shadow of a man
strolled along the far side of the alley and wheeled out of view.
Peace noted that casually, himself going on toward the main street.
Overmile dawdled along, caught in the stream of Irishmen. Peace
caught him by the arm with a relief he could not explain.</p>

<p>"Leach," he said, "there's a Baptist minister somewhere around.
Down at the Mission Hall, I think, Bring him over to Oliver's for
me."</p>

<p>Overmile said, "What for?"</p>

<p>"Oh hell," said Peace irritably and swung on through the
traffic, leaving Overmile planted crookedly in his tracks. Peace
got out of the traffic again, idling through another one of Bryan's
alleys. A man staggered down, the outside stairway of Faro Evans'
place, holding both hands across his stomach. Freighters were
backed up to Haley and Leisure's store, loading cased liquor for
the Montana mines, Beyond that the houses straggled to an end and
he walked through the silver-paled shadows, his thought spiraling
farther and farther downward, beyond his control. He had loved a
girl for two years with a hunger that never varied; this night he
was marrying her. Where was the feeling a man ought to have? There
was shame in him, because he was going back to Eileen without
it.</p>

<p>The small sound of a breath swiftly drawn in pulled him from his
thoughts; and he lifted his head and found Nan before him, her body
pulled up to a startled straightness. The moonlight laid a crystal
screen between them, but the sense of her waiting there was a power
that pulled him on until her lifting features were clear to his
eyes. She said nothing. She didn't need to. Her personality, so
rich and so gallant, was again like a soft wind coming, out of wild
places, stirring every sense he owned. She did this for him, giving
his life a meaning, freeing him of all darkness. He reached out and
took her hand, the long, warm fingers lying obediently in his hard
palm. She was, at that moment, completeness for a man.</p>

<p>She said, in a low, quiet whisper: "Make no more mistakes,
Frank."</p>

<p>He said, "No," and let her hand slide away. He removed his hat
and watched her turn and go rapidly across the uneven ground. And,
standing there, torn inwardly apart, he heard a shot roll out of
one of Bryan's alleys behind him. Afterward a woman screamed, and,
a swift gunplay ricocheted across the night.</p>

<p>He wheeled back, led toward that sound ripping through the alley
which held the Oliver store. He came into the foot of it, clawing
his revolver from an inside pocket. A man stood in the little beam
of light made by Oliver's store lamp and turned and fired and
turned again, quietly losing his balance. Gunlight stabbed short,
purple-red fingers out of two black corridors of the alley, the
bullets of those guns striking this exposed man with a small,
merciless tearing sound. He turned once more and his face showed
itself to Peace, who cried at the top of his lungs, "Morgan!" and
raced forward.</p>

<p>The little jets of fire bloomed around and direct in his eyes. A
lead slug clipped his boot and he fell purposely in the dust and
rolled against the wall of the store, and rose and smashed his
return shots into those black corridors. He heard Overmile shouting
nearer and nearer. Windows above him shrilled up and Morgan's voice
called dimly to him from the dust. "Frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ran across the alley, straight at the jaws of one of those
corridors; there was a man stumbling down it, scraping the close
walls of the buildings to either side. He drove a bullet at that
vague image and saw the man fade entirely, out into Bryan's back
area. Then his hammer dropped on a fired cartridge.</p>

<p>Overmile was raging down the other side of this building, the
echoes of his gun shaking all the boards. Men were scudding into
the alley toward the prone Morgan; and Morgan's voice kept calling,
kept growing weaker. "Frank&mdash;" Peace went back, kneeling in
the dust. He pulled Morgan half up; he saw Morgan's weary smile
creep across pale lips. "Frank," he murmured, "I've had a lot of
fun with you this last year. I want you to know that."</p>

<p>"Phil&mdash;who did it?"</p>

<p>"I ran into it. Two men&mdash;in Oliver's store. They shot
somebody in there and came out. I took it up. Here I am. It doesn't
matter at all."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" ground out Peace.</p>

<p>Morgan's shoulders lifted gently. "I hope you win out. I'd like
to live to see that."</p>

<p>His weight fell fully against Peace's arms; and, he was dead
then. Overmile tramped back from his chase. A woman in Oliver's
store was crying. Peace laid, Morgan gently on the dust and
stumbled to his feet, going to the store&mdash;Eileen was in the
center of the room, her head dropped, her hands stiff and clenched.
Ben Latimer rose from behind the counter and solemnly motioned.
Going over there, Peace found Bardee Oliver lying full length
inside the counter, a bullet hole's black blemish on his cheek.
Latimer lifted an arm and pointed behind him&mdash;and Peace's
following glance hit the open doors of Oliver's safe.</p>

<p>Latimer said: "I came in the back way and had no gun. They were
just leavin'&mdash;two thin fellows wearin' burlap masks. Was four
thousand dollars in, the safe."</p>

<p>Men began to crowd the room. Overmile drove his way through
them, pale, crazy-eyed and murderous. The Baptist minister followed
Overmile and stood gently by, saying nothing. Latimer walked back
from the counter.</p>

<p>Standing there, having I nothing to say, Peace watched Eileen
pull up her head. She looked at him and she looked at Latimer. She
put out her hand and it was Latimer she touched, and afterward it
was Latimer she swayed against. Latimer held her awkwardly with his
arms.</p>

<p>"I'll be here, Eileen," he kept saying. "I'll be here."</p>

<p>Peace wheeled. "Leach," he called, and smashed his way through
the crowd. In the street he found men lifting Morgan out of the
dust. He yelled, "Leach, damn you!" and walked toward Main Street.
Leach came trotting up, breathing fast. At the edge of Main Street
Peace stopped. He said: "Give me some cartridges."</p>

<p>"Two tall fellows," said Overmile. "Brett and Cordray are
tall."</p>

<p>"We'll find out."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">
PEACE loaded his gun with Overmile's cartridges and put it in a
coat pocket, the long fingers of his right hand gripping the butt.
He said again, "We'll see, Leach."</p>

<p>Overmile's arm stopped him. "Wait a minute, Frank."</p>

<p>"What for?" growled Peace.</p>

<p>Wild as the Texan was, he had a saving coolness. He saw the
temper of his partner burning like a white flame, its light rushing
out through Peace's powder-gray eyes, and he understood how little
caution there was in the man at that moment, how terribly Peace's
fighting impulses hammered at his head and swelled his big muscles.
Roused like this, Peace was altogether past realizing that a bullet
could kill him. Overmile remembered Julesburg, He remembered Benton
and Nick Moylan's grade camp.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's Brett and Cordray we want," counseled Overmile. "I
don't much doubt it. But they know your way, Frank, and they'll be
waitin' for you. We don't step into no traps. That's what Ed
Tarrant did, and I think that's what Phil did. Both times the
bullet was meant for you. We walk easy."</p>

<p>"Come on, Leach."</p>

<p>"Look at the street."</p>

<p>Casement's chosen Irish tramped the board walk as usual, turned
restless by the excitement; and down by the Club saloon Collie
Moynihan's gray head bobbed and disappeared somewhere along the
ceaseless flow. Peace found nothing in the faces of those men to
warn him; they were tough, but they were loyal. Then, looking
farther up the light-slashed street he caught what Overmile meant.
Wagons were rolling in from the Uintah slopes, loaded with graders
and camp hands.</p>

<p>He said, "Come on, Leach," and went on.</p>

<p>Lou Queed stood in a near-by doorway, a stiff figure cut against
the glow of his joint; his glance clawed across Peace.</p>

<p>Overmile stretched his long legs and got beside Peace, softly
murmuring: "You and me&mdash;we got damned few friends."</p>

<p>His shoulder points lifted and fell. His gun hung low from his
right hip and his fingers kept brushing its butt. The thin cotton
shirt he wore clung to his flat muscles, stretching as they
stretched. Those wagons rolled forward through the street, the
graders and the tie cutters springing into the dust and hurrying
forward; the jam in front of the Club's doorway slowly got worse.
Peace rammed into the crowd and pushed on. Collie Moynihan's rash
Irish face caught his attention, and Collie's head slowly moved
from side to side. The arriving men surged in, packing that little
area densely.</p>

<p>Somebody began to swear. "Get the hell back from me&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Overmile used his knees and elbows to keep up with Peace. It was
like walking across loose sticks of dynamite&mdash;and Peace didn't
seem to know it. They wheeled into the Club, Overmile expelling a
long breath. The orchestra slammed its music across the hall, and
girls' white faces and white shoulders went round and round till
they were blurred; and the smell of sweating bodies and smoke and
whisky laid a rank stench before Overmile's sensitive nostrils. His
swift-searching glance located Roy Lovelace behind the blackjack
table&mdash;and ran beyond and stopped. Both Al Brett and Jack
Cordray were sitting in at Diamond Jim's poker game. The three of
them together. With the other chairs at that table empty.</p>

<p>He murmured, "Careful, Frank," and obediently tagged after
Peace, who cut a straight path through the rising confusion and got
to that table. Diamond Jim jerked his head back and ran a hand
nervously along his heavily oiled mustache. The worry in his eyes
was very plain. But neither Brett nor Cordray seemed to be aware.
Brett laid three cards in the center.</p>

<p>"Three, Jim," he murmured, and put his hands down on the
green-felt surface. Overmile watched Brett's shoulders faintly
lift; he watched Brett's chest faintly arch. The man was
cocked.</p>

<p>Peace drew back a chair; he sat down at the table, beside
Diamond Jim and opposite Brett. Overmile kept standing until Jack
Cordray's sallow features rose to him and showed a thin glint of
venom. Overmile took a seat then. Al Brett was directly at his
right elbow, but he wasn't interested in Brett; his impartial mind
had adjusted and balanced the weight of this game. Brett was
Peace's problem. Jack Cordray, across the table, belonged to
him.</p>

<p>Brett said, "How are you, Frank?" His skin was pink as a girl's
and some secret thought released his rash grin.</p>

<p>Diamond Jim gathered up the cards, uncertainly speaking.
"Gentlemen, who's playing?"</p>

<p>Brett laughed aloud. "What's the matter with your nerves, Jim?
Too much opium?"</p>

<p>Peace pulled a hand full of silver dollars from his pocket and
stacked them on the table. But Overmile drawled, "I'll rest
out."</p>

<p>Brett's sky-blue eyes turned an insolent humor on Overmile. "All
Southerners are born tired."</p>

<p>Overmile let it go. It was Jack Cordray's gaunt fingers and
Cordray's eye pupils he watched. The man was cocked. One crazy
impulse or one quick word would do the trick. Cordray was that kind
of a wolf.</p>

<p>Frank Peace picked up his cards one by one, as Diamond Jim dealt
them. He was loose in the chair, slouched a little, his knees
touching the under side of the table top&mdash;deliberately placed
that way. The motion of the crowd in here kept changing the angles
of light, the hum and the crackle of talk kept drumming against his
ears. The music stopped with a final crash.</p>

<p>One of Campeaux's floor men yelled: "Promenade to the bar," and
couples wheeled around the table. A girl's arm came more distinctly
into his vision and he focused it and he saw the frail Rose look at
him with something charged in her long-lashed eyes. She went
by.</p>

<p>He pushed his stack of silver forward. "Open," he said.</p>

<p>Cordray coughed and bent forward. Peace stared at him and saw a
man half dead. In Julesburg a bullet had ruined Cordray; that
memory, with its tenuous, toxic desire for revenge, was all that
kept the man breathing.</p>

<p>Brett dropped his chips into the pot. "Stay with you," he said
evenly. "I always have and I always will. You bluff a lot of
people, Frank. But you don't bluff me."</p>

<p>"Your luck," pointed out Peace evenly, "has so far only been
fair."</p>

<p>"It'll change," grinned Brett.</p>

<p>"Cards, gentlemen," suggested Diamond Jim, and caught his
breath.</p>

<p>Peace said, "One." Brett's high blood laid a fuller flush on his
skin. Restlessness kept pulling at his lips; it kept drawing at the
corners of his eyes. All this was on the man's surface; and Peace
wasn't fooled. Behind that lay a fixed and tremendous desire. "Bet
ten dollars," murmured Peace. The sweat of recent exertion had
dried across Brett's forehead, gluing dust to it; and dust was
plain along the yellow edges of Brett's hair.</p>

<p>"Call," said Brett, and laid down a pair of kings.</p>

<p>Peace tossed three duces to the table and raked in the center
pile. Brett's lip corners stiffened. "What are we playin' for," he
challenged recklessly, "pins or money?"</p>

<p>A huge call threshed the turmoil. "Any damned scoundrel here
from Kentucky? Stand up! I'm from Tennessee!"</p>

<p>Brett looked fretfully back of him to the big, red-bearded man
swaying in the center of the hall. A deeper, thicker talk rushed in
through the Club's doorway and the pressure of bodies out there
sagged its canvas sides. Brett was smiling again.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Been sittin' here long, Al?"</p>

<p>"Not long," retorted Brett boldly. "Just came in from a little
walk."</p>

<p>"A fast walk, judging from the dust in your hair."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Brett.</p>

<p>The music started with a full, sharp crash. It caught Jack
Cordray off guard; he flung himself up from the table with all his
muscles shaking, his head twisted over at a hard, painful
angle.</p>

<p>Brett growled, "Hell's wrong with you, Jack?"</p>

<p>Overmile quietly put his palms flat on the table, waiting in
that half-eager position. Cordray circled his chair and sat down
again.</p>

<p>Diamond Jim called out in his shaken voice: "Gentlemen, are you
going to play cards?"</p>

<p>"Ask Peace what we're going to do," snapped Brett.</p>

<p>The giant with the red beard bawled again: "Stand up, you whelps
from Kentucky!"</p>

<p>Peace observed Helen Lovelace move around the nearby blackjack
table, her expression agitated and pale. Her eyes met his and
turned expressively. Obeying the signal, he looked to the saloon's
far corner and saw Roy Lovelace walking into Campeaux's office
door.</p>

<p>"Peace," rapped out Brett, "I don't like waitin'. What do you
want?"</p>

<p>A man strolled toward this table, drunk&mdash;and curious; he
stopped behind Brett's chair. But somebody ran across the room and
dragged him back, murmuring: "Don't be a damned fool!"</p>

<p>Peace didn't answer Brett. He kept watching that patch of dirt
on Brett's forehead. Overmile's palms were beginning to rub the
felt cloth with a circling, feline softness. Cordray sighed and
strangled back a cough. Brett's lips quit smiling; change shuttered
across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Here," he said angrily, rashly, "I've got a handkerchief in my
pocket. I'll take one end&mdash;you take the other. We'll draw, and
shoot away. To hell with this crawlin' around!"</p>

<p>There was a row of faces beyond the table, dimly at the edge of
Peace's narrowed vision. He saw that row fade farther and farther
back. There wasn't any music going; he couldn't hear much talk
around him. Blood slogged steadily through him, his underlip made a
thick roll across the gathering violence of his face. He put his
left arm across the table; the big bone of his wrist sliding from
his shirt sleeve. There was heavy, ink-colored tuft of hair running
down the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"All right, Al. Drag out the handkerchief."</p>

<p>Cordray coughed again, the force of it wrenching him around the
chair. Overmile remained in that same bland attitude of waiting.
But a color rushed solidly across Brett's skin; he held his fists
on the table and refused to move them. His recklessness veered
away; he was at once reserved and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"You've turned killer," he muttered. "I didn't notice it
before."</p>

<p>A floorman walked across the hall and bent at Brett's side. "Sid
wants to see you."</p>

<p>A long, heavy breath spurted through Brett's nostrils. He
dragged his hands back from the table, never letting them drop
below its rim. He stood up. "Come on, Jack," he said.</p>

<p>Cordray got uncertainly to his feet, like a man knocked
groggy.</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of?" taunted Peace,</p>

<p>Brett said, more careful than he had been. "Now now, Frank. Now
now." Cordray came around the table and Brett preceded him across
the room, thus using Cordray as a screen against Peace.</p>

<p>A long, low surge of talk rolled through the saloon. The
Tennessean staggered out of the background, his heavy voice rising:
"You from Kentucky?"</p>

<p>Brett stopped; he whipped his slim body about. The Tennessean
saw him do that and began to claw his thigh, to catch the gun
hanging there. Brett jerked his own revolver out of its holster,
lifted and aimed it and fired once. The Tennessean's long bowl beat
against the tent wall, ending in a wild and broken scream; when he
hit the floor he was dead, his crash shaking all the chairs and
tables in the place. A woman began to cry.</p>

<p>"That's the end of one damned nuisance," said Brett, and walked
on to Campeaux's office.</p>

<p>Overmile shook his shoulders. "You cut it kind of fine,
Frank."</p>

<p>Peace watched the door close on Brett and Cordray. He threw back
his chair. He said: "Let's go," and started for Campeaux's office.
Floormen were lifting the dead Tennessean.</p>

<p>A barkeep yelled: "Hey, professor, get that music goin'," and
the orchestra jerked into another tune.</p>

<p>Overmile said, "What in God's world do you want, Frank?"</p>

<p>"I want him to fight," growled Peace.</p>

<p>A gun ripped its hard ecsoes down Bryan's street; and the noise
of the growing crowd out there was like a mob howl. A man ran in
through the tent's doorway, but a long ax handle cut a swift circle
through that doorway and whacked him across the head; he dropped
without a sound. Peace rammed his way directly across the dance
floor, making a pathway that Overmile followed silently.</p>

<p>The fragile Rose wheeled in front of Peace and lifted her
shadowed glance. "Mr. Peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head, pushing her gently aside. At Campeaux's
closed door he lifted his foot and smashed it against the knob,
breaking its latch. He went on through; Overmile made that opening
in one long jump, pushing the door to behind him.</p>

<p>Brett and Cordray both whirled and laid their stiffening shapes
against the far wall of the office. Campeaux sat with his huge,
soft bulk overflowing the chair&mdash;the freckled, full-moon area
of his cheeks intractably set. Roy Lovelace stood in the center of
the place, stone-calm. Slow fury boiled inside Peace&mdash;and yet
his mind was clear enough to receive an indelible impression then
of Lovelace's proud, gentlemanly bearing, of a look reflecting
sadness and ruin in a way he could not understand. Afterward Peace
put his glance on Brett, and his voice sliced and pounded and
stabbed at Brett.</p>

<p>"What're you afraid of? Where's your guts, now, Al? I'm right
here in front of you. That's what you've been howling for the last
year. Come on&mdash;come on! Do you always have to catch a man in
the dark&mdash;or beat him over the head behind a counter? Come on,
Al&mdash;here's your chance."</p>

<p>Al Brett said from a long, cool distance, "I'll pick my
time."</p>

<p>"Go up to Faro Evans' and put on a nightgown," said Peace
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I'll pick my time," repeated Brett, gritting out the words.</p>

<p>"Campeaux," called Peace, "both your hound dogs are yellow."</p>

<p>Silence came on, strained and uneasy, and filled this room until
the air was hard to breathe. Cordray was a skeleton shape against
the wall. Al Brett stood motionless, encased by a steely
indifference. Only once had the attentive Overmile seen Peace's
words break that aloof calm and bring a yellow flash from Brett's
narrowed eyes; but instantly Brett had pulled himself behind that
protective stillness again. Campeaux eased his body in the chair.
Neither surprise nor anger got through the gray veil always
covering his features.</p>

<p>"You're pretty proud right now, Frank," he observed softly.</p>

<p>Peace said: "What do you want with Lovelace?"</p>

<p>"Lot Withers said he saw Roy listening in at my door a little
while back," murmured Campeaux. "I'm kind of interested. What'd you
hear, Roy?"</p>

<p>Lovelace said: "Whatever I heard, Sid, I kept to myself."</p>

<p>"Always trusted you," remarked Campeaux regretfully. "But you're
Bucko's good friend."</p>

<p>It disturbed Lovelace. He looked directly at Peace, "Did I carry
any information to you, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a warning to watch out for myself."</p>

<p>"That's all it was, Sid," said Lovelace carefully. "I don't give
a damn what you do to me&mdash;but I wouldn't like to have you
think I was a blabber."</p>

<p>"Let it go," suggested Campeaux, and laced his soft, white hands
across his stomach. Lovelace shook his head, saying no more. He
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Campeaux laid a sly glance on Peace. "What do you want
Frank?"</p>

<p>"Nothing I can get here," retorted Peace. "But listen to me,
Sid. If Lovelace is touched I'll be back to see you."</p>

<p>"Very proud," said Campeaux in a dreaming tone.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. You'll get what you want in due time."</p>

<p>Sound rioted and raced beside Campeaux's saloon, swinging
tidally off the main street down an adjacent alley. Peace heard
glass breaking; he heard shots flatten through the yonder dark.</p>

<p>He said, "Come on, Leach&mdash;the air's pretty foul here," and
walked back into the saloon hall.</p>

<p>Campeaux turned on his two motionless henchmen. He said:
"Why?"</p>

<p>Brett broke his long-maintained position; a dammed violence
whirled him around the room. Pallor turned his florid skin the
color of wax. He stopped in front of Campeaux. "Never brace a
killer when he's primed. He's a killer, Sid. I didn't know that
before. He's been crowdin' me for an hour."</p>

<p>"Afraid of him?" Light as the question was, it stung.</p>

<p>"I'll pick my own time," growled Brett. "But it won't be when
he's running on his luck. You can't beat his luck."</p>

<p>"Faugh!" snorted Campeaux. His head swung around and be listened
to the rising roar in the alley. The crowd was smashing down the
boards of somebody's store. Campeaux nodded. "Ring's brought his
tie crews in. The town's open. Let Peace try to stop that."</p>

<p>"What about Lovelace?"</p>

<p>"I'll handle that."</p>

<p>Brett swung toward the door on the alley side. But be thought of
something and turned back. "You keep that money locked up, Sid.
Jack and me will be back for our share."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Peace went straight across a saloon floor that had been deserted in
favor of the wild tumult outside. The barkeepers were idle, the
tables empty. He saw Lovelace and Lovelace's wife standing soberly
together.</p>

<p>Overmile said, "What now, Frank?"</p>

<p>"I want Brett to make a fight!"</p>

<p>"You sure have tried."</p>

<p>A weltering, savage confusion slapped at them when they stepped
from the Club. Irishman fought Irishman all along the street. More
men were charging into Bryan, more graders bent on trouble; and
Casement's Irish track layers were swarming up from the boarding
train to resist that attack. A construction Paddy lay full length
in front of the Club, badly beaten around the head, and men stepped
over him and surged into the swell of the hand-to-hand fighting now
sweeping down the alley. It had turned instantly into a bitter
affair between Casement's terriers and the tie cutters and the
graders; without argument, without reason. Peace saw a tie hand
swing a pick handle brutally down toward the white top of Collie
Moynihan; Collie Moynihan lifted a long yell, and then the tie man
was reached at by a dozen avid hands, and he sank into the dismal
oblivion of the dust.</p>

<p>Rose, the dance-hall girl, ran out of Campeaux's and tried to
catch Peace by the arm. But he was plowing through the melee and
she missed him&mdash;and turned and lifted a pale face to Overmile,
whispering something to him. One of Casement's men saw her and
laughed, and lifted her without effort, carrying her into the
Club.</p>

<p>"Ye'll keep out of this, darlin', if you don't want a busted
mug. In your business such a sad thing would help you none."</p>

<p>Peace beat his way through the shouldering conflict. The crowd
plugged this alley from side to side, indiscriminately slugging and
wrestling and heaving toward Haley and Leisure's wholesale liquor
store farther along the alley. Lights glittered out of a
second-story window and threw pale, agitated beams across the
wrecked boards and torn canvas sides of the store, half revealing
the bloody fist battles Tolling around the vicinity of that
wreckage. Men hauled themselves from this turmoil, climbed the
broken sides of the buildings for a breathing spell, and then threw
themselves boldly down into the fight again. Peace came against an
Irishman who, knocked totally unconscious by a stray rap on the
head, was caught so tightly in the jam that he could not fall.</p>

<p>A bushy-bearded fellow yelled at the top of his voice: "There's
Bucko!" and drove forward, trying to reach Peace. Overmile drew his
gun and batted that man's on-plunging skull once with the weapon's
barrel.</p>

<p>They broke through the storming edges of the mob, reaching the
smashed doorway of Haley and Leisure's store. A handful of
Casement's Paddies held back the attack here; but inside Peace saw
a group of men breaking open stacked whisky cases and passing
bottles out through the wide gaps in the store wall. Overmile shot
past Peace and began swinging his gun barrel in wide, scythe-like
strokes. Steel cracked on bone. White faces wheeled and dropped,
and men's lips stretched wide apart as they fell. Peace caught a
man at the store counter and bent him over it, banging his head up
and down. A bullet spit across the surface of the counter,
scratching a white track deep in the pine; and the raiders in this
room rushed out through a side door.</p>

<p>Archie Millard's curt order cut through the racket.</p>

<p>"Straight through," and he ran in the back entrance, his
troopers behind him.</p>

<p>Peace said, "Good boy, Archie." The troopers crowded the small
room, and crossed it and passed out of the front doorway, spreading
against the crowd. Out there Millard said calmly: "Take aim.
Fire!"</p>

<p>That volley sailed above the crowd, its long and beating report
falling like a hot breath down into all those swinging faces. "Take
aim." repeated Millard in an unstirred voice.</p>

<p>Men were cursing in a high, screaming tone&mdash;turning and
kicking and clawing. The tide rolled back toward Bryan's main
street furiously. One of Casement's Irishmen, hard used in his
defense of Haley and Leisure's store, said, "Bedad, soldier boys,
you can have it," and sat down on the walk, altogether
exhausted.</p>

<p>Millard said, "Clear this alley." The troopers stepped across
the street, spreading against the sullen, withdrawing edges of the
mob. A man appeared in a second-story window of Sailor Dick
Shugrue's dive, intent on some trouble of his own invention. Peace,
following the troopers, pulled up his gun and threw a shot that
way, driving the man back.</p>

<p>The crowd recoiled into the main street; it turned there, facing
that silent, thin troopers' line. Casement's loyal Irish were
pulling together, outside the range of the carbines. The tie camp
men and the graders rolled reluctantly toward the railroad tracks.
A violent, smoky half silence brushed Bryan. Millard stepped into
the middle of the street, square and tall and undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said succinctly, "get on your wagons and leave
Bryan. I am closing the town for tonight."</p>

<p>Peace, watching that mob closely, saw Duke Ring slowly slide
backward into the shadows and disappear. A grader stepped forward
from the group, his lank cheeks glittering with sweat, to speak for
all of them.</p>

<p>"The hell we will."</p>

<p>If they got their backs up, Peace thought instantly, they would
make a slaughterhouse of Bryan. The spokesman's taunt rippled a
mass rage along the close-packed ranks; it pulled those bitter men
together. He walked around the troopers, suddenly knowing what he
had to do, and came before the spokesman who stood dismally still.
The man's eyes narrowly watched.</p>

<p>"Bucko," he murmured, "I'll kill you!" But his arms came up too
late: Peace cracked him under the chin with one swift drive of his
fist and dropped him to the dust.</p>

<p>Somebody in that group said in a dead, groaning voice, "Other
times comin', Bucko," and walked toward the wagons. Hatred flowed
like a stream of acid around Peace; but he stood there and saw the
graders break&mdash;and move on to the wagons.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">
RING came into Campeaux's office. His flat lips were crushed and
blood dripped along a fresh cut in his forehead. A bright animal
glitter disturbed his muddy pupils. "I can't buck soldiers,
Sid."</p>

<p>Campeaux drawled, "That's all right, Ring, I saw the play."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Ring, "if Bucko ever gets away from the end of
track the tie hands will kill him for what he's done tonight."</p>

<p>"Ring," said Campeaux, "fade from town. Get yourself a job in
one of the tie camps."</p>

<p>Ring murmured: "They'll kill him," and went out of Campeaux's
back door, He stood in the alley, rubbing the blood from his
forehead. Millard's troopers still stood in the middle of the
street; the graders and tie cutters were pulling away from Bryan
and Casement's faithful Irish roamed back toward their quarters
beyond the tracks. Ring saw Peace talking with Millard and a
wildness crawled through the squat, senseless fighter and turned
him loose from his reason for a little while. He started up the
alley toward Peace. But afterward he dropped back,
disappearing.</p>

<p>Peace said to Millard: "Thanks, Archie."</p>

<p>Millard shook his head. "Who started this?"</p>

<p>"Campeaux, I think."</p>

<p>"You've got the graders all stirred up."</p>

<p>Peace said: "I'll see Reed about the vacation you want."</p>

<p>"I won't leave with things like they are. That can wait.
Something rotten here."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Peace. He looked around him. His manner changed.
"Where's Overmile?"</p>

<p>"Didn't see him."</p>

<p>Peace looked through the diminishing crowd of construction hands
and wheeled back down the alley.</p>

<p>Millard hitched his belt more exactly into place, turning to the
troopers. "Quarters," he said, and went over into the shadows of
the depot. Somewhere along the side of Casement's vast warehouse he
saw a stooped and familiar shape coming up from the open desert
beyond Bryan.</p>

<p>"Charley," said Millard.</p>

<p>Mormon Charley stopped. "Whar's the fightin'?"</p>

<p>"All over."</p>

<p>Mormon Charley keened the cold night wind. "Used to be a man
could smell the smoke of a Injun camp five miles off. Moccasin
tracks on the ground meant somethin', Waren't no noises except
buffler travelin'. Now the mountains are full of engine smell and
the hootin' and tootin' of fools, and a man's sleep is sp'iled by
tincan towns like this." He grunted in the manner of an Indian, to
show his complete disgust. Afterward he said: "Cherry's in the
lodge. I got to take a train to Sanders to see General Gibbon." He
went off, making no sound with his moccasined feet.</p>

<p>The lodge was a quarter mile out in the desert, a pale wedge in
the moonlight. Millard saw Cherry standing by the door flap, and he
caught her in his big arms and kissed her in an awkward, hungry
way. Her head slid down against his coat; her voice was very quiet:
"Here I am, Archie."</p>

<p>"I thought you were at Fort Bridger."</p>

<p>"Bridger's a long way&mdash;and you didn't come."</p>

<p>"I had planned to start in the morning."</p>

<p>She drew him inside the tent, and pulled him down to the
blanketed bed, sitting in front of him with her two hands holding
his arms. Candlelight threw a vague softness across her round
cheeks and brightened her eyes, A narrow beaded band circled her
black hair. "We can travel back together."</p>

<p>"Peace is in trouble. I'll have to stay here for awhile."</p>

<p>"What trouble?" said Cherry.</p>

<p>"The toughs are on his trail."</p>

<p>She said, "His trail is your trail, Archie?"</p>

<p>"He's my friend, Cherry. To me that means something."</p>

<p>"To me it means something, also," she murmured. And her glance
dropped away from him. Her lips were heavy with what she was
thinking at the moment; her face was stolid with the wild, cruel
hatred she conjured up against Frank Peace.</p>

<p>Millard said unhappily: "I don't like to see you sitting here
this way. You belong in a house that has chairs and furniture. You
ought to have a proper woman's dress&mdash;not this buckskin."</p>

<p>She murmured obediently, "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Go back to Fort Bridger. I'll come when I can."</p>

<p>She kept her glance on her hands; her round breasts stirred from
a long, swift breathing. "You will never come," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Cherry&mdash;Cherry!" he groaned,</p>

<p>"No," she said in that low, sweet, relentless voice, "you will
never come. That is what I see, Archie. You are a soldier and you
are a white man. I can't take you away from that."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Cherry. I have an order in my pocket transferring
me to New York. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She cut into his talk, her tone almost guttural. "Who did
that?"</p>

<p>"That's the army way, Cherry."</p>

<p>But she was thinking of Peace who represented all that she
feared, who seemed to be taking from her the hope of her life.
Millard said: "I have made up my mind. I shall resign within two
months." He had spoken so quietly, so drearily. Her glance wept out
to him, reading him through and through. She saw the misery and the
struggle and the doubt there; and a light in her mind flickered out
and left it dark.</p>

<p>"I am here, Archie."</p>

<p>He said irritably: "Don't let your voice sound that
way&mdash;singsong and harsh."</p>

<p>She held his hands tightly. She crept toward him until her
shoulders were against him, "You see?" she murmured. "You see?"</p>

<p>His big arms took hold of her and cradled her as though she were
a child. The warmth and softness and the wild, willing sweetness of
this girl swept like fire through him. "Cherry," he groaned,
"whatever it costs me, I love yon."</p>

<p>"Let us not speak of trouble," she whispered, "for that will
come to us soon enough. I wish I had not gone to school. It has
taught me nothing. I knew what my heart wanted, long ago, I shall
remember your arms&mdash;many years after I have forgotten to speak
your tongue. That is all the wisdom I need."</p>

<p>"I'll be out of the army soon, Cherry."</p>

<p>Her lips came against his and stopped his talk.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Peace stopped at Nan's restaurant. He said to the colored girl,
"Overmile been here?" The shake of her head sent him on. He turned
down the nearest alley and came by Bardee Oliver's store. He could
hear Eileen's choked crying tremble out from the rear room;
standing there on the board walk he could hear it&mdash;and feel
it. He leaned against the door casing a moment and considered going
in to comfort her. Yet there wasn't any comfort in him and he could
think of nothing to say. Paused like that, ashamed of his
reluctance, he remembered how she had turned to Ben Latimer for
support.</p>

<p>Latimer walked out of the inner room, softly closing the door.
He saw Peace and came over.</p>

<p>"Overmile been here?" asked Peace.</p>

<p>Latimer shook his head. He dug his hands into his pocket. "Mr.
Peace," he said, "I don't understand. She was in there, wantin' a
man's help, a man's arm. And you went away just then, forgettin'
her, riskin' your life in a street brawl."</p>

<p>"Let it go, Ben," said Peace softly.</p>

<p>Ben Latimer was quick with his stout answer. "No, sir, I can't.
No fight in the world could draw me away from Eileen if she wanted
me. You use her hard, Mr. Peace. Well, you use all things and all
people hard. Maybe it's right. I don't propose to intrude my
advice. Only I want you should know how I stand. Bardee took me as
a partner last week. Tonight Eileen said she hoped I'd run the
business. And so I will, because there's nothin' she asks I won't
do, till I drop. And I reckon it's fair I should tell you I'll
press my own case with her. Because I can't help it."</p>

<p>Peace continued down the alley, his boots striking into the
stillness of a town emotionally exhausted. Ben Latimer's talk
stirred a low, raveling irritation around his head and left him
depressed. The lights in Faro Evans' joint were going out one by
one; a girl came down the stairs, recognized Peace and dropped back
into the shadows. He remembered Al Brett's sudden surprised stare
across the poker table and Al Brett's wondering remark: "You've
turned killer." Well, Latimer was right and Brett was right; and he
tramped the boards of this evil town with the smell of powder smoke
in his clothes, with the hatred of men pushing him into the
protective darkness. A lonely, dismal thought came to him then:
This was the way killers walked.</p>

<p>The sharp rap of his boots on the board walk pulled him up. He
turned at the end of the alley and skirted a building and entered
the adjoining alley; moonlight laid a frost-silver glow along the
rippled dust. Somewhere a man in a lodging-house room drew a low,
melancholy tune out of a fiddle. Into this alley's absolute
emptiness, into its velvet silence arrived the sharp urgence of
Overmile's voice.</p>

<p>"Frank&mdash;get back!"</p>

<p>Peace was in the middle of the dust, the glow of the moonlight
revealing him. He couldn't see Overmile, he couldn't see anybody.
But he swung, his leg muscles cutting the dust, and slammed against
the nearest building. A gun pumped swift, shocking echoes into the
alley's dead calm; a bullet bombed up a round ball of dust where he
had been a moment before, and this continuing lead lifted and
followed him as he retreated, crushing through the building wall in
little rapping sounds, like the flick of a thumb on a sheet of
paper. His striding legs backed him into the black strip of a
between-building corridor; he rolled around and slapped up his gun.
He dug his knees and chest against the wall, feeling little gusts
of air roll at his face as the bullets plucked by. There were two
of them targeting this spot in the alley; two men farther up the
street, their angling fire not quite reaching him. Overmile called
sharply out of his covert across the alley.</p>

<p>"All right, Frank?"</p>

<p>Peace hooked his head around the building corner and saw the
foot-long flash of a gun leap out of a black spot near the back
side of Campeaux's big tent. He drove a shot at that darkness. At
the same time Overmile opened up. Four guns were going at once,
beating the dreary calm out of Bryan, slamming at the walls and
windows of all the flimsy structures along the alley. But it didn't
last long. The bullets quit fanning past Peace, and Al Brett's
insolent call sailed out from the dark niche near Campeaux's.</p>

<p>"I'll pick my time, Peace."</p>

<p>They were both rushing back through the rabbit warrens of
Bryan&mdash;Brett and the other man&mdash;who probably was Cordray.
Overmile came into the moonlight. "Frank." Peace listened to the
fugitive sounds run out. Afterward he walked over to Overmile,
"Follow?" grunted the Texan.</p>

<p>Peace said, "No."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it," sighed Overmile. "The night's been kinda on
the ramp." Then he cocked his shrewd glance on Peace. "What a hell
of a time we're goin' to have from now on."</p>

<p>The two of them went wearily out of the alley, bound for the
commissary building. Looking behind him, Peace saw Nan Normandy at
the doorway of her restaurant. Her eyes were on him for a moment;
for a moment only. This night, he thought, had changed his world.
Somehow it had placed him apart from Nan and apart from Eileen.
There was no way he could get back to either of them. He stumbled
on the tracks, bringing Overmile's curious glance around. He and
Overmile were altogether alone, a pair of men as good as condemned.
The wildness of the toughs grew greater; the hatred of the toughs
laid a harder pressure against him. It was two hundred miles to
Ogden. He doubted if he'd ever see Ogden. He was weary of fighting
and yet Campeaux had made a target out of him; Campeaux had hoisted
him up like a turkey on a pole. The odds were getting slimmer and
slimmer, as Roy Lovelace had forecast. There was always an end to
luck.</p>

<p>He murmured: "Campeaux wanted an open town, He didn't get
it."</p>

<p>"Other towns comin'," growled Overmile.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Late in September, with the premonition of early winter in the
wind, Casement's terriers left the unsavory dust of Bryan behind
and pushed up the foot slopes of the Uintah range. Bryan with its
"man for breakfast" each morning for five straight days, with its
graveyard holding fifteen men and three women violently dead,
became only a memory. Only a yellow station house sitting alone
beside the empty ruts of the main street. Coyotes came down and sat
on the rubbish heaps; and where Campeaux's tent had been, so
furious and glittering for a little while, a snake crawled and
coiled itself under a colder sun.</p>

<p>In spite of dismal prophecies, the Union leaped the rising
contours at a dizzy pace. The word was out among Casement's dogged
Paddies that over in Nevada the heathen Chinese coolies were
slamming down track toward Ogden at a rate that might beat the
Union; and Casement's Paddies cursed and spat on their
hands&mdash;and the steel spurted on. Dan Casement's material
trains howled up the long grades in endless file by day and by
night, and the constant clang of the steel being dumped was like
the beat of a great gong in the high, windy wilderness. The fever
of hurry was in everybody. Ties were laid on broken clods and
scantly smoothed surfaces. Ballast was left for the clean-up crews
coming behind. It ceased to be important whether the rail joints
met on tie surfaces or hung between; that could be done later.
Masonry work was abandoned in favor of ready-cut timbers that could
be swiftly bolted.</p>

<p>The steel swung up out of Bryan, struck Black's Fork and surged
on to Granger, into the provisional limits of Utah territory. At
Church Buttes they were 6300 feet in the air. Seventeen miles
farther on they dropped the station house of Carter to honor the
old suzerain of Fort Bridger, Colonel Dick Carter. That fort lay
eleven miles to the south, on the old road still used by the
overland stages. At Piedmont they reached the huge stacks of ties
waiting at Tie Siding and reached also the first summit of the
Wasatch range. At Piedmont, too&mdash;or near it&mdash;Oakes Ames
and his Credit Mobilier contract was ended, with the reverberadons
of Ames's financial crash already trembling out along the track.
Somewhere Durant got money, and Dodge flung Casement's tireless
Irish into the breach; and the grading went on. Aspen Station found
the rails poised at 7500 feet. Plunging down from this dizzy
height, sweeping around the heavy grades of these bold hills, the
Union's rails touched Bear River and found the evil-spawned Bear
River Town waiting.</p>

<p>All the peaks of the Wasatch range were a-glitter with snow; all
the higher meadows were filling with it, and just beyond Bear River
Town snow touched the hasting Union rails for the first time, the
bleak howl of an eastern wind announcing winter.</p>

<p>Coming back from end of steel at seven o'clock of a quick gray
night Peace stepped into a half gale that rattled Casement's
tin-roofed warehouses and bellied in Bear River Town's tent sides.
Snowflakes the size of half dollars drove slantwise through the
uneasy darkness. Under this blast the little huddle of tents and
shacks made a forlorn, dreary show. It was, he understood, a town
that belonged to the tie cutters&mdash;and the tie cutters, snowed
out of the hills, drifted up and down that single street and
sampled the saloons impartially. Here, too, were a good many
private contractors' crews, awaiting work. None of them had any
love for him. Casement and Casement's faithful Irish were up the
line, driving toward Evanston. Reed was there and Millard and
Overmile were there. He stood here alone, returned because he
wanted to see Eileen.</p>

<p>He crossed over near Campeaux's big tent. Wind drove his heavy
overcoat against his knees and hit into his solid face. A pair of
men went by, staring at him in a swift, sidelong way. Nan
Normandy's little restaurant cabin adjoined Haley and Leisure's
store, its heat-fogged windows showing a pleasant light. Bill Haley
came from the store and saw Peace.</p>

<p>He said: "Just the man I want to see. Duke Ring came into town,
drunk as a lord and raisin' hell. The vigilantes got together and
locked him in an empty cabin."</p>

<p>"Proper," said Peace.</p>

<p>Haley shook his head. "Ain't so sure. The tie hands are actin'
funny tonight. You'll be around?"</p>

<p>"Till the next train west."</p>

<p>"I got the boys ready, if anything should happen. This is a wild
camp, Frank."</p>

<p>Peace trudged through the wind to the end of the street and went
into the Oliver-Latimer store. And for a moment be stood very
still, the making of an illusion before him. Latimer was behind the
counter, looking up at Peace with a shrewd, dry expression. It was
as Bardee Oliver had looked; and Bardee's personality seemed to
shine out of Latimer's eyes. Ben said, scrupulously even:</p>

<p>"She's in the back room."</p>

<p>Time did all things. Frank Peace walked on and knocked at
Eileen's door, remembering past days that had seen him cross this
store's threshold so impatiently, so eagerly. He heard her call in
the same quiet, crystal-chiming voice, and went in. Eileen sat
before a high, nickel-ornamented parlor stove with a basket of
sewing in her lap.</p>

<p>She murmured: "How are you, Frank?"</p>

<p>He unbuttoned his overcoat and sat down, spreading out his long
legs. Heavy hair lay ruffled and unruly across his forehead.</p>

<p>Eileen said: "You never change. Last night I thought of how you
sat in that chair, of how many times you have stretched out like
that&mdash;and scowled because of so many things in your mind I
never could understand. And here you are, doing it."</p>

<p>"I'm not hard to understand, Eileen. There's little enough to
me."</p>

<p>"That's not true, Frank. You've done things to me I can't
explain. There are ways about you that are so dear to me. And some
I hate. I can't help it." She looked at him, smiling. "You haven't
kissed me yet."</p>

<p>He rose promptly and went over, his rare white smile appearing.
He pulled her up and kissed her; and his heavy fingers deliberately
disarranged the even swirl of her hair. She caught his arm. "Once
that would have made me furious."</p>

<p>He said: "I wonder where your heart is, Eileen?"</p>

<p>She stared at him. She whispered, "Why should you wonder?"</p>

<p>He said carefully: "It was to Ben you turned the night your
father was killed. Not to me."</p>

<p>"He stood beside me. You were a stranger that night, Frank. You
were a man I'd never seen, You had death on your face."</p>

<p>"I suppose," he drawled, and sat down again. They talked on,
without much effort. There was a thing in his mind he wanted to
bring up and failed to find the words for. Never since that wild
night had she mentioned the interrupted marriage; nor had
he&mdash;though it was something that lay mutely between them. He
felt that. Long after he looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Train time," he said, and felt relieved.</p>

<p>"You'll come again?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night." He got up and buttoned his coat. He stood
indecisively there, and presently went over and kissed her on a
cheek. Her eyes brightened; the corners of her lips turned soft and
wistfully pleased. She put up a hand and held him in that bent
position quite a little while. Not saying anything. Just watching
the expression on his features. After a while she let him go. He
said, turned ashamed and humble by that moment, "Good night," and
left the room.</p>

<p>In the street again, he sought for his pipe and packed it. The
wind blew out his matches, and finally he stepped into the
irregular joining of two buildings and tried again. The smell of
coffee drifting across his nostrils. He drew smoke heavily into his
lungs, one shoulder point propped against the wall of Nan's place,
his mind hard and keen with the memory of her voice and her
laughter and the wild, gay sweetness of her personality. A few men
stumbled over the tracks, coming from the black area by the station
house. Somebody near him wheeled and ran back into a building. And
then he saw a whole line of shifting bodies emerge from the station
house's side and move deliberately upon Bear River Town's single
row of buildings. A voice in that group said:</p>

<p>"There's Peace. There's the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man didn't finish. One single shot ripped out of a store
near Peace and semebody in the oncoming group stumbled and fell.
And afterward the group broke into a maddened charge and the windy
night was burst apart by the slash and roar of rifles letting go, A
pure, cold sliver of pain drove its way all through Peace and
shocked and astonished him. Of a sudden he made a small gesture
with his arm and fell full length on the board walk.</p>

<p>Vaguely he heard the metallic boiling of that gunfire all around
him. Long after he heard a woman's voice in his ear&mdash;a voice
that called his name between gusts of crying. He remembered he had
dropped directly in front of Nan's restaurant, and then he floated
out on an ebb tide into blackness that had no relieving light.</p>

<p>Through the fogged windows of the restaurant Nan saw him fall,
and was in the street at once, crouched on her knees beside him.
The graders were wheeling out of the dark; they were charging the
log shack beyond Haley and Leisure's store, where Duke Ring had
been jailed by the vigilantes. They were firing at the
store&mdash;and being met by a solid sheet of flame and lead from
the vigilantes barricaded inside.</p>

<p>She was scarcely conscious of all this as she got her arms
around Frank Peace's shoulders, and lifted him and called his name.
She was crying&mdash;crying bitterly. For this proud, stormy man in
whom life was so vital and hungry and demanding a thing had no
answer for her. It was like the drop of sun from the sky to see him
so lifelessly there, the fiery greatness of his personality
extinguished utterly. He was, she thought, dead, or close to the
gray border of death.</p>

<p>"My dear," she whispered brokenly. "My dear!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">
YOUNG Frank Harrison, the company doctor, lifted the dressing on
Peace's chest and pressed his fingers gently along the edges of
that ragged wound. The bullet, striking a rib, had been deflected
upward, tearing a wide path through Peace's flat muscles. He
replaced the dressing.</p>

<p>"I've always heard you were a lucky man, Frank."</p>

<p>"When do I get up?"</p>

<p>"Ten days, maybe. It isn't the walking that matters&mdash;it's
the chest muscles we'll have to favor."</p>

<p>Peace stirred in the bed, not happy about it. Harrison said:
"Better get lazy. That's something it wouldn't hurt you to learn.
Your philosophy is all action. It could stood a little gentling.
Look at the world. It's a damned beautiful one right now&mdash;if
you could forget the men in it."</p>

<p>The coach sat on a siding near end of track&mdash;a coach rigged
up by Reed to be Peace's private hospital, They had built a bed
between a pair of seats and brought in a stove, Beyond Peace's
window a shoulder of snow six feet high rubbed the side of the car.
Looking over that wall, he could see pure whiteness sweep away
under the heatless glitter of a November sun, rising fold on fold
to the heavy Wasatch ridges. Up there a ragged row of peaks lifted
sharp spires to the sky. A work train slugged its way laboriously
along the main line.</p>

<p>"I've had some thoughts," admitted Peace, "but none of them very
gentle."</p>

<p>"It's a good time to catch up with yourself. Your sort of man
never does, unless he's flat on his back."</p>

<p>"I never did find out what happened back there at Bear
Town."</p>

<p>"Fourteen dead graders," answered Harrison, and shook his head.
"They were trying to get Duke Ring out of the log jail. They did,
too. You got caught between fire. I happened to be coming through
on the eastbound work train, just in time to see what I could do
for you. You weren't much of a prospect at the moment, being pretty
well bled out."</p>

<p>Peace asked his question with a show of idleness.</p>

<p>"Where was I?"</p>

<p>"In Nan Normandy's back room." Harrison got his doctor's grip
together. He stood a little while longer, looking down at Peace
with a faint speculation, with the manner of waiting to answer the
next question to come. But Peace turned his head back to the
window; and Harrison left the car.</p>

<p>The noon whistles were blowing. Men struggled along the outside
drift, sinking hip-deep in it, all their faces ruddied and bitten
by the constant sweep of the wind. Collie Moynihan walked down the
car aisle, short body swaying to the motion of his topheavy
shoulders. The scars of the Bryan fight were healed welts along his
dogged face. He paused by Peace's bed, an ineffaceable grin
mellowing the bulldog grip of his features.</p>

<p>"And you're a good deal better today," he observed. "You're
a-scowling, which is a healthy sign. Twas only a while back that
you lay there and had no strength for anger. Then I felt a
fear."</p>

<p>Peace grinned back. "We've done a lot of fighting, together,
Collie. Maybe too much."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Collie, the Irish lift in his voice, "let it be.
There's some as must be mild and there's some as must be black and
always in the thick of it. You're that. It is nawt a thing to deny.
The mild can only come along when you have broken the wicked skulls
that must be broke. Shleep on that. You will have the fun and the
mild will have their profits. Which is the better?"</p>

<p>"The mild ones smoke of a night on their own front porches,
Collie. They'll own this country when you and I are drinkin' alkali
out of a tin can somewhere else."</p>

<p>Collie cocked a bright eye on Peace. He said irrelevantly, "I
have observed a woman admires a careful man, but it is the reckless
one she loves and breaks her heart on."</p>

<p>"You're a rash scoundrel, Collie,"</p>

<p>"I have had me fun."</p>

<p>"What are those boys doing outside the car?"</p>

<p>"Ye've noticed them? Well, they'll be guardin' the car as long
as you're in it. 'Twould please Campeaux's fancy ones to settle you
now. It's a bitter game."</p>

<p>Overmile and Millard arrived, Overmile stamping the snow off his
legs. He didn't like the weather and said so profanely. "Ain't my
kind of country at all. There's ice in my blood. I can feel it
grittin' around."</p>

<p>Collie went quietly away. Overmile considered Peace with a
thoughtful irony. "You know, Archie," he said, "this man Peace is a
skinny-lookin' guy when he's flat on his back."</p>

<p>"Hell with you," grumbled Peace.</p>

<p>"Sure, I know. You can't beller, you can't bawl, you can't stand
on your hind legs and paw the dust. You lie here and watch men walk
by, you hear the steel clankin' up ahead&mdash;and it just gravels
you to feel the world marchin' on, leavin' you just a shadow in a
hospital coach, Yours truly, L. Overmile."</p>

<p>"Feeling better?" asked Millard.</p>

<p>"Something around here smells," grumbled Peace. "I think it's
Overmile. Take him away, Archie."</p>

<p>Millard faintly smiled, and soon ceased to smile. He said: "See
you later," and left the coach.</p>

<p>"He's worse," commented Overmile.</p>

<p>"Did he go to Fort Bridger?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Last night he sat in the bunk shack for two hours without
a word. I think he's going to resign." Peace said: "Tarrant's gone.
Morgan's gone. Archie, the poor devil, is ready to ruin himself.
Well, here we are. Who's next, Leach? You or me?"</p>

<p>"Cross that bridge when we come to it," was Overmile's careless
answer.</p>

<p>Peace scrubbed the back of his head restlessly along the pillow.
"How are you making out with Nan?"</p>

<p>"What?" grunted Leach, as though he hadn't heard. But Peace's
glance penetrated his partner's scrupulously maintained calm. Leach
looked down a moment. "Dam' boots get wet fast. Better get a new
pair. Nan? Oh, I see her once in a while."</p>

<p>"Wonderful woman,"</p>

<p>Overmile cleared his throat. He said: "Where'd you get the idea
I had any notions that way?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk like a fool."</p>

<p>"No, Frank," murmured Overmile. He was smiling now, gently and
regretfully. "If I had a chance I'd push my luck. But there ain't
none."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Found out," said Overmile.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Leach."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know," began Leach, and then quit talking, He laid
a long, narrow glance on Peace's face. "Well, never mind. I'll drop
in later."</p>

<p>After Overmile had gone Peace tried to turn on his side. Needles
jabbed a trail up and down his chest and he grumbled, "Damn such a
thing," and resumed the flat position that had begun to be
unendurable. He pulled one arm cautiously up to his face, shading
his eyes. The one o'clock whistles hooted down the wind; more work
trains came by. He attempted to bring his mind back to a definite
point, to grip a question that lay like shadow in the top of his
head, darkening all his other reflections.</p>

<p>But his thoughts kept pulling away and images flickered by his
inner vision in transient, disordered haste. He remembered the time
a cannon shell blew him out of a rowboat in front of Fort Donelson,
and remembered the wheeling scream of Minié balls all about the
river as the Confederates fought to hold the fort, There was the
name of a Sioux chief that kept bothering him, a chief he had met
down on the Washita in '66 under Custer. It wasn't important, yet
that savage's face crossed and recrossed his mind's eye. He
recalled the fight at Julesburg, seeing Ed Tarrant's big shape
beating a wide hole through the massed rank of gamblers; he heard
Tarrant laughing, clearly as if big Ed were at the end of the car.
All these memories unrolled and grew large and warm companioning
his solitude.</p>

<p>A man's life was a strange thing in retrospect; and strangest of
all was the feeling he had of looking back, detached and unmoved,
at the things he had done. Admiring some of those things, despising
others&mdash;yet never quite seeing himself as the one who had done
them. Back there Frank Peace was another man whose acts he observed
critically, whose faults he saw with a naked eye. All that seemed
to stir him now was an odd feeling of growing old. One day he would
be another Collie Moynihan, rubbing his memories in the way a man
would rub his cold hands over a lantern's globe. Nan's face
appeared, and Eileen's appeared; and they both blended, and he
could not distinguish either clearly.</p>

<p>Collie Moynihan brought his supper in at six. Darkness closed
down, with the cold wind brushing along the coach and setting up
thin, eerie sound currents. One of the guards came in to stroke the
stove, Overmile presently arrived and sat en the edge of the
bed.</p>

<p>"Where's the end of track?"</p>

<p>"Near Evanston."</p>

<p>They didn't have much to say. Overmile rolled a cigarette for
Peace. They smoked through a long silence. Overmile slouched back,
staring toward the car's dark ceiling.</p>

<p>"Town there?" said Peace.</p>

<p>"Was to've been. Reed changed his mind. Winter quarters at
Wasatch&mdash;that's the plan."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Overmile looked at his watch. "Twenty feet of
snow in Echo Canyon," he said, and strolled down the aisle.</p>

<p>The overhead lamp dropped irritating splinters of light in
Peace's eyes; he lifted his arm to shade that away, and fell into a
sleep broken by a troubled dreaming. He crouched before a
campfire&mdash;he did not know where&mdash;with the sound of
coyotes ululating all across a dark, wild desert. A dog lay beside
him, the hair on its neck ruffed up, growling dismally; and then
Mormon Charley's girl appeared from the dark. She stood across the
fire, with her eyes sprung round and wide by a personal hatred that
poured a strange heat through him.</p>

<p>Nan Normandy's voice called his name, softly repeating it:
"Frank ... Frank."</p>

<p>He was wide awake, sweat crawling across his face. Nan stood
beside the bed, her glance oddly concerned. "Frank&mdash;what is
it?"</p>

<p>The near-by stove poured out an insufferable heat. He said,
"Please close the damper," and watched her shoulders gracefully
stir and turn. She swung back to him.</p>

<p>"You seemed so troubled," she murmured. "Or I wouldn't have
wakened you."</p>

<p>He said, "It's good to see you."</p>

<p>The room's warmth strengthened the color of her cheeks. Her lips
were softly turned. She pulled off the snug cap she wore, a heavy,
beaver-furred cap that came down about her ears. The light of this
dismal coach lifted. She made a small, faintly reckless gesture
with her arms and sat on the edge of his bed. Her hands caught his
hands, and for a little while she let him see what lay behind her
hazel eyes. It was a gallantry that made her beautiful, the glow of
a womanliness rising out of its secret places for a man to
behold.</p>

<p>"I'm not very wise, Frank. This time I'm making the mistake. I
shouldn't be here."</p>

<p>"I wondered when you'd come."</p>

<p>"I have thought of it for three days. I have thought of almost
nothing else."</p>

<p>"It isn't my idea of a mistake, Nan."</p>

<p>Their glances came gently together. For him there was again, as
always in her presence, the feeling of a wild wind lifting his
spirits high. There wasn't any strength in him, which was all that
kept him from pulling her down to him. The reflection of that
gusty, hungry desire was very plain to Nan. She bent and her lips
brushed him, then she straightened back and tried to smile. And
then they had passed some point they would never pass again.</p>

<p>"Do you see now, Frank?" she whispered. "We keep repeating the
same mistake."</p>

<p>"I ruin what I touch," he murmured.</p>

<p>Her fingers tightened on his hands and held them like that, for
a moment possessive. "You change people," she told him wistfully.
"I've seen it happen often, whenever you walked along the streets
of all these wicked little towns. Well, you've changed me. I'm not
the same girl that came up the grade into Cheyenne seven months
ago."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Her answer came out like a cry. "Why? I'm not! I'm
happy&mdash;I'm grateful! Didn't I tell you I didn't care what
happened to me, except that I didn't want my life to be empty."</p>

<p>"Nan&mdash;"</p>

<p>She let his big hands go and got instantly up from the bed. She
put on her fur cap with an odd swiftness, her fingers tucking under
the edges of that rich hair. She stood a moment longer beside the
bed, so quietly smiling, so wistfully sad; and a door closed, and
the intimacy that had for a little while pulled them together
definitely vanished.</p>

<p>"When I'm gone, Frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>His question jumped at her. "Gone where?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, her glance veiled and downslanting and
tender. "All things come to an end. I have wondered. What will you
do when this road is finished?"</p>

<p>"Another road, I suppose."</p>

<p>She thought about that, watching the solid features of this man
slowly compose themselves into a somber calm. "Your life," she
murmured, "will always be that way. Full of unexpected things, full
of fighting." Then her voice dropped to a faint tone. "And
sometimes full of loneliness. I know you, Frank." With that, she
turned sharply and left the coach.</p>

<p>He lifted his head, the broken muscles of his chest painfully
stirring, and saw only a shadow at the far end of the coach, and
dropped his head. The outer sides of the car windows were solid
sheets of ice; the Wind had lifted a notch, shrilling around the
car eaves and through the adjacent telegraph wires. He was
thoroughly tired, with an ache in his bones, with a pure confusion
in his head. It was painful to realize that his affairs were so
badly scrambled, for he had always managed his life with a drastic
simplicity, and it came as a shock to discover in himself a strange
inability to meet the problem uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>Until now everything had seemed so clear. He could look at
Archie Millard and see the decision Archie had to make, and he
could feel a little surprised at Archie's failure to make it. A
man, be had thought, ought to seize his difficulties and break them
quickly with his bands before they broke him. This was the way to
live.</p>

<p>Or so he had believed. Yet, looking at himself with an irritable
distinctness, he understood how exactly Millard's problem was also
his own. Archie could not solve it; and now he could not solve his.
Flat on his back, with nothing but time to spend, he could not hold
court on himself and reach judgment. He thought: "I've got no
reason to condemn Archie. I'm making, a poorer show than that."</p>

<p>A faint step sounded behind him, pulling him up from his
thoughts. He said, "Who's that?" Afterward Eileen turned before
him, her cheeks dim and cold between the lifted collar of her heavy
overcoat.</p>

<p>"Are you too tired, Frank?" she asked numbly, "You look
tired."</p>

<p>He remembered that Nan had left only it moment ago, and noticed
again the chill that gripped Eileen's slim body and faintly shook
it. "Eileen," he said, "have you been waiting outside?"</p>

<p>She said, "Yes," and bent her head toward the stove. "That's all
right, Frank. I wouldn't interfere with her."</p>

<p>He said roughly, "That was a fool thing to do." But he saw how
that hurt her. Her mouth tightened, like a child's; and a
gentleness swept over him. Suddenly she stripped the heavy gloves
from her hands and dropped to the bed, lying beside him with her
face against his cheek, her body disturbed by a silent crying. He
put one arm awkwardly to her shoulder. "Eileen,
honey&mdash;Eileen," and he was borne back by an emotion that he
could not explain to the time he first had seen her standing in
Bardee Oliver's store doorway at Fremont. He recalled how the pride
of that slim, dark girl had crossed Fremont's dusty street, how it
had turned him in his tracks.</p>

<p>"Eileen," he said, "I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sat up, eyes very bright. "Don't talk, Frank," she murmured,
and laid her cool fingers across his mouth. "We have always talked
too much always hurting each other by it. And what could wishes do
for us now?"</p>

<p>He said curiously, "What would you wish?"</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, Frank, you shan't know it." She sat with her
small, straight shoulders bowed toward him, that little girl's
humbleness, that little girl's sense of waiting in
patience&mdash;coming strongly from her. When she smiled a
sweetness was on her lips for him to see. In her presence he always
felt that deep comfort of a man arrived home. He felt it now. It
was a warmth that soothed out the trouble in his head and made him
surer of himself. How long had it been since he'd been touched by
that sense of ease?</p>

<p>She talked to him with a deliberate lightness, soothing him with
the even run of her words. "Bear Town's been very quiet since the
fight. The tie cutters are going up toward Wasatch. Ben's getting
ready to move the store there for the winter. We had some tourists
come through the other day, from Boston. I entertained them and it
was quite like old times. They told me everybody back East was in a
fever to try the transcontinental trip when the roads were
finished; but that the Credit Mobilier was quite a scandal. Poor
Mr. Ames is bankrupt. Of course you've heard. General Grant has
been elected President."</p>

<p>He spoke from a deep drowsiness. "Eileen, where have you been
these last five days?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer for a moment and he opened his heavy lids to
see her lips half pale and pressed together. "Doctor Harrison came
by every day to let me know," she said. "You were badly hurt,
Frank. I saw you that night lying in Nan Normandy's room."</p>

<p>"I didn't know."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to bother you too soon. You're very tired now. I
wish I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes. But he said: "What would you wish,
Eileen?"</p>

<p>He felt her sway downward toward him. Her lips were near his
ear. And her whisper was crowded with a passionate emotion. "I have
my wish now, Frank. To be here with you."</p>

<p>He said: "That's the way it will always be, Eileen. If you still
want me."</p>

<p>She touched him with her hand, brushing her soft fingers across
his forehead. "My dear&mdash;my dear!"</p>

<p>When she rose from her crouched, cramped position fifteen
minutes later he had fallen asleep. She drew on her mittens and
turned up her coat collar, and, stood there beside the bed. The
heavy fighting lines were out of his face and his solid lips were
near smiling. He lay like that, the square, unsymmetrical and
thoroughly masculine body relaxed from its stormy energy. She
reached down and pushed the jet ends of his hair back from his
forehead; and a little color came across the ivory smoothness of
her cheeks, and her eyes were soft with the secret pleasure of her
thoughts then. She reached up and dimmed the car lamp, and left
it.</p>

<p>Ben Latimer sat in a cutter, holding a restless team. She got
in, drawing the lap robe around her. Ben said,
"Belle&mdash;Star&mdash;g'dup," and sent the cutter down the
hard-packed snow crust. A wilder wind raced across the Wasatch
chain and huge flakes turned the night to a dense, mealy, agitated
gray. Bear Town, three miles away, showed its lights with a thin
and intermittent glitter. "He's all right?" asked Latimer.</p>

<p>"Yes." Cloaked by an extra blanket, Eileen bowed her head. Her
thoughts carried her to a warm, bright world remote from this
one.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">
TEN days after the Bear Town fight, Peace rolled aside his
blankets and stood on his feet. He walked down the car aisle and
back again, and returned to bed. When Overmile came in that night
he found Peace in a gusty, grinning temper.</p>

<p>"You've been up&mdash;against orders," accused the Texan. "Cut
it out, Frank, or I'll steal your pants."</p>

<p>"Son," said Peace, "I could walk into Ogden now, pants or no
pants."</p>

<p>"Sure. It's just a little stroll. The snow's so deep up the line
the boys have to shovel down to find their tents, and you can get a
clean shave any time by just stickin' your face out in that wind."
Overmile considered himself gloomily. "The bottom half of my lungs
is froze solid. Last night Millard let the fire die in our room.
When I woke up things was droppin' down on my face. Know what?
Well, every time I blew out a breath it floated up in that cold
room and turned to ice and fell smack on my nose. It's ten below
outside right now. I wish I was to hell and gone back in
Texas."</p>

<p>Casement and Reed and Millard entered the coach, the three of
them turned white from head to foot. They stripped off their heavy
coats and gloves. Casement shook up the fire; and they settled
themselves comfortably around, listening to the violent slash of
the outer wind. A strengthening light flushed along the
coach&mdash;being the head lamp of an engine roaring up the track;
under full power, bucking the snow with its attached plow.</p>

<p>"Got to keep that up from now to March," said Casement.</p>

<p>Reed, dark and restless from his worries, snapped at the
thought. "We're nine hundred and fifty miles from Omaha. I've been
dreading the approach of winter ever since last April. We'll see
forty feet of snow at Wasatch Station in another month. I hope I
never have to take another job laying down a road under conditions
like that. We'll try it&mdash;if the material doesn't fail us,
which is something we can expect. If the weather really gets bad
all the snowplows in hell won't keep the track clear."</p>

<p>"Where's the Central now," asked Peace.</p>

<p>"Twenty miles short of Humboldt Wells."</p>

<p>"A little over two hundred into Ogden," commented Peace. "We've
got about seventy-five to go."</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to swap our seventy-five for their two hundred,"
said Reed. "Those people are smart. Their track through the Sierras
has been snowshedded, Nothing's going to stop their supply trains.
They'll be at Humboldt Wells in a week. Man came through the other
day and said there wasn't any snow yet in eastern Nevada. They've
got a straight shoot into Ogden, except for a few hills that don't
amount to a damn. They'll be layin' three mile a day to our one.
But if this road is blocked behind us for any length of time we'll
lay no steel at all."</p>

<p>"Where's Dodge?"</p>

<p>"Salt Lake. Brigham Young's struck a bargain with him. The
contract reads for Young's Mormons to assume the grading from
Wasatch to Promontory."</p>

<p>The engine on the main line backed down the track and came
forward again, roaring into the snow. All these men listened to
that sound attentively; the engine's bell set up a sharp clanging
and men were yelling against the wind. A second engine whistled
through the lower darkness.</p>

<p>"That's the helper," grunted Casement, "Two engines to run one
plow. In November, What'll it be like when January comes?"</p>

<p>Reed Iooked at Peace. "Dodge wired in from Salt Lake yesterday,
asking about you. We've got another job, when this is through."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Buildin' a railroad across Texas."</p>

<p>They sat there in silence, eased by the heat issuing from the
red-bellied stove; considering, as men will do when an adventure
nears its end, the vivid memories commonly shared. Long afterward
Reed said simply, "I miss Phil Morgan."</p>

<p>Casement cleared his throat. He got up and buttoned his coat.
"Texas is a long way off. We ain't built this confounded line
yet."</p>

<p>Reed said to Peace: "Take your time about movin' out of that
bed. I don't know any other place half as comfortable. We'll reach
Wasatch Station in probably seven days. That's our winter camp."
Casement and Reed went out together. Overmile strolled behind.
Millard remained by Peace's bed.</p>

<p>"What would you do in my place, Frank?"</p>

<p>Peace said: "I can't help you, Archie. You'll have to make your
own choice."</p>

<p>"I know. But what would you do?"</p>

<p>"I'm the poorest man you could come to for advice."</p>

<p>Archie Millard shook his head. "There's no other man I could
turn to. My mind's about made up, but I've got to have your advice
before I do the hardest thing of my life. I'm not a soft man. I've
got a good deal of pride, and God knows it's hard for me to choose
between Cherry and the army&mdash;the only two things that count
with me at all. I had come to a conclusion last night. And then I
got to thinking of you. I know what you want me to do. I don't
blame you for that, because you're my friend&mdash;and I'm proud
you are. But I want to ask you a question and I want you to answer
it honestly."</p>

<p>"The day you quit the army," said Peace gently, "is the day you
begin to be a disappointed man. You'll never quit thinking of what
you might have been. Cherry's a fine girl, but she's an
Indian&mdash;and you'll be a squaw man. Some men can do that.
Mormon Charley could. But you'll eat your heart out and the things
in your mind will drive you crazy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Millard quietly, doggedly. "But I want to ask
you this single question." He stood with a balanced
straightness&mdash;a splendid figure, a soldier born. He was, Peace
thought, as sharp and perfect and gallant a type as generations of
soldierly men could produce. The yellow mustache lay evenly along
his sober mouth; his ruddy cheeks were strict with gravity. He drew
a definite breath. "Put yourself in my place for a minute. Put
yourself there honestly. You had no business loving this girl; but
you did. That's a destiny none of us can order. You paid your
compliments to her until she put her trust in you. There's no
halfway giving with Cherry. Her life is yours to dispose of,
because she wishes it to be that way. Whatever contentment she
might have had living her accustomed life with her own
people&mdash;you have destroyed, because you showed her another
kind of life. She built her hope around you. If you go she has no
hope left. Would you leave her, Frank?"</p>

<p>Peace lifted his hand to shade the light from his eyes&mdash;to
avoid seeing the desperate look on Millard's face. He wondered then
how much Millard knew of his own problem&mdash;it fitted so closely
into the groove that his mind kept endlessly circling. This was the
question he had not been able to face.</p>

<p>He said: "No, Archie."</p>

<p>"You see?" said Millard. He shrugged his broadspread shoulders.
"Well, there are things a man can do, and things he cannot do.
Either way a penalty hits him. I'm supposed to report back to D. A.
Russell for transfer within ten days. Next Saturday I shall send in
my resignation from the army." He wheeled and left the coach.</p>

<p>Peace rubbed his palm slowly hack and forward across his face,
the simplicity of Archie Millard's words remaining behind to stir
him in stnange ways. He remembered Eileen standing in the bleak
nighht by the car, waiting for Nan to go; he, remembered Eileen
lying against him, crying. He had made up his mind at that moment
What he had to do. He had told Eileen. And yet, his thoughts
terribly clear, he knew there had been a faint hope surviving in
his heart, like a doorway held ajar for escape. The sense of shame
in him deepened and deepened. Mentally, he reached out and closed
the door; and when he did so his hope died. Nan had seen all this
so muoh more clearly than he had seen it. He recalled her as she
stood by the bed, her lips soft with the wishes of a woman, her
glance wistful in a way he couldn't comprehend. He murmured, as she
had done, "All things come to an end," and knew he was as near the
truth as he would ever be.</p>

<p>In Nan was a richness, a completeness; in her was a flame he had
seen. All men, even the toughest of them, had a picture like that
secretly in their hearts, fashioned out of their deep desires. So
had he. To few men did the picture ever completely materialize;
and, it had been one of the profound shocks of his life to see her,
the image of his wishes, sitting in the smoky coach of the
Cheyenne-bound work train. She had been faintly smiling, and that
smtle he would never forget, calling like wind across the width of
the world.</p>

<p>Through his sleep, long afterward, came the howling of an
engine's whistle against the wind. He felt the coach roll along the
track; he lifted himself on an elbow, to see the solid banks of
snow creep by. They were moving upgrade.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Evanston's few houses showed their ridgepoles as vague angles on
the surface of the rising snow. Past Evanston the steel mounted one
frigid mile at a time, through glittering wide walls twenty feet
high, from one contour to another across a world turned solidly
white. Foot by foot the telegraph poles disappeared beneath the
drifts, the crossarms near enough to reach by the lift of a hand.
Standing on the platform of the coach, Peace watched the boarding
train creep another completed stretch toward Wasatch, now six miles
away on the howling, winter-beleaguered heights. Snow laid a
thick-driven screen across the sky; the bundled forms of Casement's
terriers were vague shapes at a distance of twenty feet. A man
stood propped against his shovel as the coach rolled by, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Ye'll do better back where it's warm, Mister Peace."</p>

<p>That night Eileen rode the cab of an engine up from Bear Town to
see him. She was excited and pleased at the trip and the
little-girl glow in her eyes brought on Peace's smile. "They were
quite nice to me," she said. "I sat on the engineer's side."</p>

<p>"They should be nice to you, Eileen. You're an old-timer on the
Union Pacific now."</p>

<p>"It's you," she said thoughtfully, "that makes them nice to me.
They know that you and I&mdash;" But she bit the sentence between
her teeth and a quick color stained her cheeks. "I didn't mean to
say that."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. Her old pride straightened her shoulders. "I
don't know your mind very well, Frank. You're not a changeable man.
Yet you have changed, and I won't hold you to any promises. I want
you to regret nothing. I couldn't have you sticking to a bad
bargain."</p>

<p>She had been speaking in a quiet tone; but that last sentence
came out swiftly, like a repressed cry. She was offering him his
release, and she was trying to be casual with him and not
succeeding. He turned his head away, staring at the solid frost on
the window. And shame stirred him painfully. He said gently: "No,
Eileen. You're all a man could ask for. I'm happy over my
luck."</p>

<p>The silence came rushing on. He rolled his head around again.
Her eyes were bright and near tears; yet that steady glance went
into him powerfully and searched him. Afterward&mdash;and he could
not tell what her thoughts were then&mdash;she sat down on the edge
of his bed and her fingers touched his hand in a light, brushing
way. Afterward her talk was faintly gay.</p>

<p>"What will you do when you're through here, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Reed says Dodge has us booked for another road, in Texas."</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured. "I thought it would be something like
that."</p>

<p>"It won't be so bad, Eileen. I'll promise you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not complaining," she broke in instantly. "Oh, perhaps I
was once. It seems so long ago and so many things have happened.
The things I thought then aren't very real now. Only one thing is.
I want to be with you, Frank."</p>

<p>There was a fragrance and a simplicity about this girl; there
was a humble candor that kept deepening his shame. He remembered
when she had been so certain of herself. But he had destroyed that
world she lived in&mdash;all its security and its beliefs; and now
she sat beside him, not afraid of what lay before her, yet hesitant
and disturbed. He thought again of the only comparison possible.
Like a little girl walking through darkness.</p>

<p>He said: "It's a little hard for me to pull myself up, or I'd
come after a kiss."</p>

<p>It brought back her deep color. She caught her two hands
together and looked at them, afraid of his eyes. She put them on
the bed and bent, her lips warm when they touched him, warm and
shy. She drew back, uncertainly smiling.</p>

<p>"Why should I feel a little guilty, Frank? I always do." An
engine backed down the grade, the hiss of ejected steam sibilantly
cutting the high run of wind. Brakes squalled abreast the coach and
a whistle hallooed.</p>

<p>"There's your buggy," said Peace.</p>

<p>She stood up, her fingers hurrying with the buttons of her coat
Excitement showed in her eyes again and her laugh was soft and
suppressed. "It's fun. Ben's packing up the store. We'll be at
Wasatch next week. I don't know when I'll see you next."</p>

<p>"In Wasatch, then," said Peace, and watched her slip down the
coach aisle.</p>

<p>Thoroughly weary, he soon fell asleep and was vaguely conscious
of the coach being towed, late at night, up another constructed
mile of the grade. In the morning he woke to a whiter, higher
world, and slid into his pants and tramped the coach aisle for half
an hour, testing his strength. That night end of track lay three
miles from Wasatch; and Overmile came in and gossiped a bit and
went away. There was no letup to the gale sweeping viciously across
the world, there was no diminution to the dense, driven snowfall.
The following day they made another mile, and then took two days to
gain an additional mile. Winter fought Casement's Irish bitterly,
knifing through their coats and numbing their hands; the-right of
way hourly vanished and had to be discovered again. Five days from
Eileen's visit a savage night roared down on Peace's coach, with
Wasatch Town five hundred yards ahead.</p>

<p>Harrison dropped in, looked at Peace's chest and said, "You can
buckle on the harness tomorrow," and left. With that cheering news,
Peace fell asleep.</p>

<p>A voice said, "Well, Frank," with an intonation that dragged
across his shallow slumber. For a moment, not quite wakened, he
thought it was one of Collie's guards announcing daylight. Bitter
cold flowed through the car and the roar of the wind was like the
rush of water over a high fall, shaking the coach on its heavy
springs. Light dropped a pale glow against his eyes when he opened
them.</p>

<p>Al Brett stood beside the bed. He had his hands stuck into his
overcoat pockets and a thin smile stretched a line across the
wind-whipped coloring of his cheeks. His lashes were white with
frost.</p>

<p>Shock pounded through Peace in long, somersaulting beats; it
whipped his mind keen. His gun hung behind him, beyond sudden
reach. The fire had gone out of the stove and he knew then Collie's
guards had deserted him. He lay wholly still, murmuring: "How are
you, Al?"</p>

<p>"Cold," said Brett, soundlessly laughing. "Cold and damned
sleepy. It's a hell of a job to plug through this wind. But I was
kind of curious, I'd heard you was to be a cripple. That would be a
joke, Frank Peace a cripple. What's the answer, Bucko?"</p>

<p>He had been drinking; his eyes were yellow and restless. Temper
fluxed uncertainly in them, like the unstable spooky reactions of a
cat animal. His fists bulged his coat pockets, but the right pocket
sagged under the weight of a gun held there. His hand, Peace
guessed, gripped the gun. Peace remembered the lashing he had given
this man in Campeaux's saloon at Bryan.</p>

<p>"I've got to disappoint you, Al, I'm all right."</p>

<p>"Disappoint me? Me?" That rash, bold grin stretched its tighter
line across Al Brett's mouth. "What the hell did you think I came
here for?"</p>

<p>Peace said: "You answer that one."</p>

<p>Al Brett quit grinning. A faint noise at the car's end whipped
his head around; it swung as swiftly to Peace again, eyes bright as
shining silver. As warmthless. "Your guards got thirsty and walked
up the grade to get a drink. I saw 'em go."</p>

<p>"That's what you waited for, Al?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," murmured Al, and rubbed his boots gently along the car
floor.</p>

<p>Peace considered his possibilities and found them no good. He
could not get at his gun; and the guards were beyond call. He
twisted his head along the pillow; his long toes made a tented
shape in the blankets at the feet of the bed. The bitter air
scouring down the coach aisle sparkled like frost in the dim
light.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One o'clock of a damned rough night," Brett's stare was a
ceaseless, greedy pressure against Peace, like the insistence of a
knife point, Brett's cheeks were strict and smooth. "You're a hard
gent, Bucko," he mused. "I give you credit. You know what I could
do to you right now?"</p>

<p>"It's a thought," said Peace indolently.</p>

<p>Brett growled, "You knew damned well it is. And you're thinkin'
I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peace, "I think you will."</p>

<p>Brett scowled. "Listen. I was sittin' in Campeaux's tonight. I
got to considerin' those guards Collie Moynihan's been puttin'
around this coach. It made me sore. To hell with you, Bucko! You
can figure Duke Ring or Jack Cordray for this sort of a stunt. But
I never assassinated a man in his bed and I never will! I got a
little pride. I want you to knew it. I'm not Ring and I'm not
Cordray. I'm Al Brett. I'll fight any man that lives and one day
I'll fight you, in my own way. But you'll be on your two feet when
I do&mdash;see? You'll be on your feet, able to take care of
yourself. I don't shoot my turkeys on the roost. I don't have to.
That's what I come to tell you, Bucko." He was angry then, angry in
a bold, flaming manner. "I don't want any advantage from you and I
want the whole damned world to know it," he snarled, and brought
both his hands from his pockets, and wheeled down the coach
aisle.</p>

<p>An hour later, when Collie Moynihan's two guards came back from
Wasatch they found Peace sitting up in bed, cleaning the barrel of
his gun. He said: "Wish one of you boys would get that fire going.
It's twenty below if it's anything."</p>

<p>Around two o'clock of the following storm-lashed afternoon he
stood on the steps of the coach as it crawled slowly up the grade
and stopped in front of the depot. Wasatch's main street was a
white canyon running back from the new track; a canyon feeding
tunneled-out passages leading back into a double row of scattered
cabins entirely lost in the snow. He stepped down from the coach,
his legs spread apart in the manner of a sailor touching firm
ground; his knees were a little uncertain, But he stood there and
bowed his head gratefully against the full beat of the wind,
grinning at Overmile and Millard who waited for him.</p>

<p>"Got a job for a good man?" he said.</p>

<p>Overmile said: "What's your specialty, pilgrim?"</p>

<p>"Trouble, I guess."</p>

<p>"Hired," stated Overmile. "And, brother, you're goin' to get
stoop-shouldered from the work."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Bill Wallen walked down Wasatch's bitter street through a
premature, wind-torn twilight. Opposite Nan's he paused and saw a
man enter the restaurant; and so he resumed his endless tramping,
circled the depot and started back. At Campeaux's Ring stopped him.
"What you doin' here? Thought you was down by Echo Canyon."</p>

<p>"No," said Wallen, and went on.</p>

<p>Nan's windows were covered by a milk-white sheet of ice. He
stood there, touched by a faint current of warmth creeping out of
the building cracks, and tried to see through. Presently somebody
left the restaurant&mdash;the same man he had seen enter a little
earlier. He paused at the door, stiff and uncertain, as ready to
run as to go in, thoroughly at the mercy of his contrary impulses.
He didn't know what made his hand turn the knob. He closed the door
behind him, the light harsh on his eyes.</p>

<p>Nan said, "Sit down."</p>

<p>He waited a moment until his vision had cleared. He unbuttoned
his buffalo coat and took off his cap. The streak running back
through his black hair was almost pure white and his face had a
wire-drawn thinness. He put his shoulders against the door,
watching the girl in a weary, humble way.</p>

<p>"Are you sick?"</p>

<p>He said, "No. Just a little bit cold. I walked in from the head
of Echo."</p>

<p>She was listening to him. Her eyes were guarded, and he saw her
lips change expression. His voice ran very carefully along the
words, as though he remembered what decent speech should be like.
"I suppose there is no reason why I should be here. It would be
simpler if I weren't. Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>She said, so calm that the moment went black to him: "I think
you are my father."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that's right," and had no hope in him at all.
"I thought you ought to know. Perhaps I'm wrong. It occurs to me
I've been wrong most of my life. Of course, after fifteen years I
couldn't expect to mean anything definitely to you." His teeth
chattered. "You have become a lovely girl. Your mother also had
yellow hair. Good night."</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>She came around the counter, up to him. She looked at him. "I
have always remembered," she said quietly, "the sound of your
voice. You used to read to me. It was a book of stories about
strange lands. Your voice is still the same." Then she said, at
once near tears, "Why, I'm like you!" And laid her hands on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>He put his arms around her, turning his face. He spoke in a
ragged, broken voice: "I think your mother would think a little
more kindly of me if she were here to see this."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
That night a wild blizzard lashed across the Wasatch peaks and
drove every living thing from the howling streets of this camp.
Work trains were caught on the grade, telegraph wires went down,
isolating end of track. The snow piled higher and higher.</p>

<p>That night Peace lay in his room in the commissary shack, a
roaring fire warming him. Casement and Reed were there, uneasily
listening to the storm. Reed said: "I think we're lost." In the
back room of the Oliver-Latimer store Eileen bowed her head over a
sewing basket and tried not to think of Peace. And at this moment
Archie Millard sat before a soap box and lantern in one of the
boarding train cars and wrote out his resignation from the
army.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">
TWO days later a harried, exhausted operating department cleared
the road from Wasatch back toward Green River, releasing half a
dozen storm-bound construction trains strung along the way; and
that day Archie Millard put himself and his horse in an eastbound
boxcar without saying anything to Peace and rode to Bear River
Town. Here he got into the saddle and took the Fort Bridger road
through a soft, mealy fall of snow. Late at night he hailed the
guards at the fort.</p>

<p>It was a two-company post, with the usual row of army quarters
stretched along a little parade ground. The civilian Colonel
Carter, more or less a court of first and last resort for a
territory a thousand miles square, had his house adjoining the
military quarters. A few mountain men wintered here in cabins built
long ago by old Jim Bridger; and out a short distance from the
fort&mdash;but under its sheltering wing&mdash;a wandering band of
Arapahoes had pitched their tents.</p>

<p>Archie Millard put up his horse, paid his respects to the major
commanding the post and sought out Mormon Charley, finding him in
the sutler's shack fraternizing with half a dozen restless-eyed
beaver trappers. Mormon Charley said, without being asked:</p>

<p>"Cherry's visitin' her cousins. It'll be the biggest tent."</p>

<p>Millard walked back across the parade and past the guard line,
deeply angered. Smoke spiraled up from the Arapahoe tent tops, and
he heard the murmuring of indian talk and short bursts of Indian
laughter. A dog ran before him, growling as it came, lifting its
feet gingerly from the snow. Millard turned at the largest tent and
had to bend low to crawl through the half-laced flap.</p>

<p>The smell of damp clothes, of food and of bodies reached his
nostrils in a rank, strong wave. There had been a little
conversation going on, but it stopped; and he stood up in this
semi-dark interior and looked around, more irritated than curious
to see a typical Indian family hunkered down along the edges of the
tent. A few old women and a few old men. Three grown girls in the
background. Half a dozen young bucks sitting side by side. A very
young baby laced into its carrier and propped against a roll of
blankets. Cherry was with the girls in the rear of the tent, seated
like the rest of them, her shoulders drawn forward, her whole body
immobile. She didn't show any expression. He was a stranger here
and made to feel so by the opaque stare of all those eyes; they had
stopped talking and they had stopped moving&mdash;and they were
waiting for him to speak and be gone.</p>

<p>"Cherry," he said, "come with me."</p>

<p>She rose instantly. One of the young men, thin and bold-nosed
and wide of lip, turned his head to her, running out a quick row of
Arapahoe words. Cherry said something briefly back and came across
to Millard. He went out before her, tramping back the trail. But a
few yards on he stopped short and turned back. She was following in
his steps Indian fashion, her head bowed down. Her eyes, incurious
and obedient, lifted to find why he had halted&mdash;and that pure
Indian look sent a duller and more painful resentment through him.
"Go in front of me, Cherry," he said, and trailed her to the parade
ground. She took him into one of the small cabins, into the
familiar presence of Mormon Charley's guns and traps and
accumulated plunder. A slow flame in the fireplace lifted light
across the room. Cherry stopped, her hands idle beside her, waiting
for him to speak.</p>

<p>He said, in desperate protest: "Why do you go there?"</p>

<p>"They are my people, Archie," she murmured.</p>

<p>This girl's shoulders were even and softly rounded, and her body
was slim; the sparkle and glow of girlhood was in her, the hot
temper of life was in her. But he was thinking of the older women
in the tent, turned slovenly and formless by the years, their
cheeks wrinkled by a thousand tent fires, their manners stolid as
beasts.</p>

<p>He said, "Each time you go into that tent, Cherry, you're pulled
down another inch. Each time you sit on those blankets it becomes
harder for you to use a chair and a table. I don't want you going
there."</p>

<p>She said, "Where shall I go?"</p>

<p>"Make your friends among my people."</p>

<p>"They will not have me. I can only go where I'm welcome. In that
lodge nobody is ashamed of me."</p>

<p>"I don't want you going there!"</p>

<p>She said submissively: "Then I will not go."</p>

<p>The softness, and the gentleness of this girl took all the anger
out of him. "Cherry&mdash;Cherry," he groaned and pulled her
against him. She held his arms, her fingers fiercely biting into
his muscles and lifted her suddenly lovely face for his kiss. He
forgot the difference that separated them and did not remember it
for a long, long interval.</p>

<p>"I have resigned from the army, Cherry."</p>

<p>She pulled back, reading his eyes, reading the lines of his
cheeks. "Are you sorry?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, and threw his will against the doubts creeping
grayly like ghosts into his mind. "Come with me." They crossed the
parade ground to Colonel Carter's house and found him sprawled in
wide-legged comfort before a cheerful fire, a big man with a
tremendous voice. "Lieutenant Millard," he said, as though he spoke
to all the desert, "I'm kindly pleased to see you."</p>

<p>"Colonel," said Millard, "you are a legal magistrate. It is our
desire to have you marry us."</p>

<p>The colonel was a diplomat who had learned to keep his emotions
well concealed in this land of willful individuals. He said, "So,"
in a slightly changed voice and got up and crossed the room to a
table. He put on his glasses and stood in mild
meditation&mdash;seeing the handsome shape of Millard fill out the
blue uniform, seeing Cherry's dark eyes turn back his interest with
a show of half fear. He said, "You're quite sure, Millard?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>Carter lifted his voice, throwing it through the house.
"Mother&mdash;Quincy, I want you both." He turned to a little shelf
at the corner of the room and found a weathered brown book
containing the laws of Iowa, and riffled its pages. Mrs. Carter and
a young man came in. Carter took off his glasses and put them
immediately back on again, He spoke in a way that was, for him,
very quiet. "How old are you, Cherry?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-two,"</p>

<p>"Both of you," suggested Carter, "wish this?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cherry. "Yes." Millard only nodded.</p>

<p>Carter looked at the book. He cleared his throat. He said: "I
don't believe I ever knew Mormon Charley's last name. What is your
last name, Cherry?"</p>

<p>Cherry threw a quick glance at Millard. Her fingers held to his
arm. She said: "I heard him speak it once. La Bonte. That is it. I
am Cherry La Bonte. My mother was Little Woman. She was afterward
named Katherine by a black-robe priest who once rode through Bear
Valley and asked my people to pray."</p>

<p>Carter thrust a quick look of appeal to his wife and got no
help; and then he looked at the statute book, and closed it, and
spoke hurriedly from memory. "I, William Carter, by virtue of the
authority vested in me by the laws of the territory of Wyoming, do
pronounce you, Archibald Millard, and you, Cherry La Bonte, to be
man and wife."</p>

<p>Millard said evenly, "Thank you, Colonel," and bowed to Mrs.
Carter.</p>

<p>Cherry stared at Carter. "Is that all? Are we married?"</p>

<p>Carter saw the doubt in her eyes. He had dealt with Indians the
greater part of his life, and he understood the suspicion with
which they looked upon white men's customs. Even Cherry, half
white, could not quite escape that primitive distrust. And so,
because he knew this&mdash;and knew how to answer&mdash;he reverted
to the manner he used on Indians speaking slowly and rather
sonorously. "My words will be written in a book. I shall write them
in the book. Any man may come to the book and see that you have
been married. The words will say so. They will not grow dim."</p>

<p>"That is right," said Cherry and smiled.</p>

<p>Millard touched her arm. They went into the silent snowfall, and
crossed to the cabin. Mormon Charley was there, waiting. He threw a
sly, sober look at them.</p>

<p>"I have married your girl, Charley," said Archie. "Tomorrow I'll
get another cabin. But for tonight, if you don't mind too much,
I'll put you out of this one."</p>

<p>Mormon Charley laughed. "For a squaw man, Archie, yo're a polite
cuss." But he had some feeling in him and it sobered him when he
looked at his girl. "Cherry," he said, "I reckon I lose you now.
God knows it's been my wish for you to be a happy girl." She didn't
move, nor did she speak; and Mormon Charley, knowing her better
than she knew herself, patted her awkwardly on the back and left
the cabin.</p>

<p>She kept her round, dark eyes on Millard who stood so solemnly
in the room's soft fireglow; She missed nothing that was on his
face. She whispered: "Will you ever be sorry, Archie?"</p>

<p>His words were as gentle as a man could make them: "I am not
sorry, Cherry."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Coming into Fort Bridger the middle of the next day, Frank Peace
found Millard standing in the cabin doorway, smoking his pipe.
Millard had got himself a civilian suit; he hadn't thought to
shave. When Peace dropped out of his saddle he observed the reserve
in Millard's glance.</p>

<p>"You're too late, Frank. I'm a squaw man now."</p>

<p>Peace shook his head, "I heard you'd started for Bridger. But
the weather was so confounded bad I got worried."</p>

<p>"Take your arguments and go home," said Millard roughly.</p>

<p>Peace said: "I had no arguments, And I wish you luck."</p>

<p>But he had something on his mind that wouldn't leave. "What will
you do?"</p>

<p>Millard shrugged his shoulders. Something, Peace thought, had,
gone out of his man the moment he put his uniform aside. A pride of
carriage. A hope&mdash;replaced by a stolidness that wasn't real.
"Doesn't much matter. But I've got a civil engineer's education. I
guess I can use that, running boundary lines for cattle ranches and
homesteaders."</p>

<p>"You'll stay here?"</p>

<p>"No," said Millard definitely. "I'm taking Cherry away from
these Indian relatives. Probably we'll move over to Laramie Plains
and set up a ranch of our own."</p>

<p>"I've got a little business with Carter," reflected Peace. "Then
I'll be on the road back." He smiled a little, but it was a
regretting smile, formed by memories of his friendship for this
man. "Will I see you again, Archie?"</p>

<p>"I've got to go to Wasatch to get the rest of my plunder."</p>

<p>"Come with me."</p>

<p>"No," said Millard, drawing back inside that stolid shell again.
"I'd rather not talk with you. Good-by, Frank."</p>

<p>Peace said gently, "So long, Archie," and went rapidly across
the parade, leading his horse.</p>

<p>Cherry, coming out of the sutler's cabin, saw Peace stop to talk
to Archie, and saw him go on. That fear she could never quite rid
herself of turned her toward the soldiers' quarters. There she
stood a good half-hour, watching Millard poised in the cabin
doorway, watching Colonel Carter's house. Peace presently came from
Carter's house, got on his horse and rode back down the parade, her
straining glance catching no sign between him and Millard. When
Peace had disappeared beyond Bridger's picket line, riding into the
heavy fall of snow, she went over to the cabin.</p>

<p>Millard followed her in, knocking the ashes from his pipe. "I'm
going up to Wasatch to get the rest of my things. I'll be back in
two days."</p>

<p>She didn't answer. She stood against the cabin wall, watching
him pull on his long coat and strap a revolver belt about him. He
saw how bright and intent her eyes were as they followed him, and
saw the rigid shape she made. He went over to her, faintly smiling.
"It's all right; Cherry." When he kissed her he felt her arms hang
to him and afterward he had to pull them down. He repeated himself:
"I'll be back in two days," and left the cabin. At the doorway she
watched him get his horse and ride across the parade, following the
trail made by Peace. He lifted his arm and waved it at her, but a
numbness held her there, beyond the possibility of answering him; a
numbness made by fear. And behind that fear was a formless,
helpless, primitive anger. After the white snow screen had covered
him up she ran out of the cabin, her head lowered and swinging from
side to side, and came into her relatives' lodge. Only one man was
there&mdash;the bony big nosed man with a wide mouth, who was her
cousin. He said, in their own language: "What do I see? A woman
running from the lodge of her man. He will come here and beat you.
That is right."</p>

<p>She called him by his name. "Walks-at-Night. There is, another
man, a friend of the lieutenant's, who hates me. He came here now
and talked, and went away. The lieutenant is following. He won't
come back."</p>

<p>"So," said Walks-at-Night. "Your man is weak to listen to this
other."</p>

<p>"This other," said Cherry, "has a power. A bad eye."</p>

<p>She folded her hands tightly across her body; she swayed and she
said in a wild, terrible way: "He should be dead! He should be
dead! The lieutenant will not come back."</p>

<p>Walks-at-Night looked at his cousin carefully, his slack big
lips meeting in a straight line. After a little while he left the
lodge. In another lodge he got a gun, discarded his blanket in
favor of a white man's blue army shirt, and trotted out into the
woolly drive of the snowstorm.</p>

<p>Without particular hurry he followed the up-and-down ridges
northward; the straightness of his trail avoiding the curves of the
Fort Bridge-Bear Town road. An hour later, well satisfied he was in
front of Peace, he settled himself at the top of a low roll of
ground overlooking the road and squatted down to wait.</p>

<p>He had not been there long when a horse and rider materialized
through the thick and continuous screen of snow. The rider was
dressed in a long blue army overcoat and he had his head bowed
against the snow. Walks-at-Night laid his gun sights on that figure
and followed him this way another twenty yards, or until the target
was too plain to be missed. His shot sent a muffled, damp echo
across the smothered world; the rider, never straightening from his
bowed position, fell from the horse slowly and lay still.
Walks-at-Night drew back into the gray mists and vanished, pleased
from knowing he had destroyed the man with the bad eye.</p>

<p>But Peace had taken another trail toward the railroad; and it
was Archie Millard who lay in the trail, his hand reached up to
grasp a button of his overcoat and halted there, his yellow head
uncovered and his life quite gone.</p>

<p>When Mormon Charley returned to the fort from a scouting trip
that evening he heard the news. Millard's horse had drifted back to
the fort and a squad of soldiers, tracing the trail, had found
Millard and brought him in.</p>

<p>Mormon Charley saw his daughter neither at the cabin nor at
Colonel Carter's. He knew then where she was&mdash;and went
directly to the Arapahoe camp, to the tent of her relatives. She
was alone in the tent, a small, round huddle of clothing in this
growing darkness. She was swaying back and forth; she was saying
something in the Arapahoe's language. When he called to her she
lifted her head and, old and tough as Mormon Charley was, it gave
him a shock to see the red, savage gleam of her eyes. She stared at
him and refused to know him.</p>

<p>She said, "Go away, I live here. Go away."</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">
BURIED by great drifts of snow, blasted by a blizzard wind that
howled steadily and unrelentingly across a world without sun and
without sky, Casement's Irish doggedly fought their way out of
Wasatch toward the head of Echo Canyon four miles away and seven
hundred feet lower. To cover that drop, Reed's engineers had
projected two high trestles across a pair of gullies and a tunnel
seven hundred and seventy feet long through the shoulder of a
ridge. The bridge gangs had finished their chore; but the tunnel
crew had not. Caught here by the weather, they had to handle the
ice-hardened red clay and sandstone as they would have handled
solid rock, blasting it with nitroglycerin. Each yard of excavation
was costing $3.50; and the bore moved one painful, reluctant foot
at a time.</p>

<p>Reed and Casement and Peace held a meeting on that.</p>

<p>Time pressed them cruelly and they were getting nowhere. Each
night the Union scouts over in Nevada wired the day's work of the
Central. The Central, still free of heavy snow, pressed across the
high desert, their construction crews forging through the low
passes of the Pequop and Toano ranges. They were doing a mile a
day; they were doing two&mdash;and sometimes three. Huntington, the
Central's driving force, had some wily plan up his sleeve. His
instructions to the Central's engineers were common knowledge.
"Come right on as fast as you can and leave a good road
behind."</p>

<p>"If we could get by that tunnel," said Reed, "we could lay steel
in Echo Canyon."</p>

<p>"Build a Z around it," said Peace.</p>

<p>"How're you going to make a grade, when the ground's twenty feet
under snow?"</p>

<p>"Lay your steel on the snow," replied Peace.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," protested Reed, "that won't do."</p>

<p>But Casement, made desperate by the sight of his terriers
standing idle, came into the argument. "The tunnel won't be done
for a month. The Central can come fifty miles in a month, or maybe
a hundred. Try it. Try anything."</p>

<p>So Casement's Paddies backed away from the tunnel, dug an
entrance through the solid alley of ice that imprisoned them on the
grade, and charged out upon the solid, pure drifts. They dropped
their ties on this naked surface and bolted down their rails; and
so by ten miles of uneven, precarious and temporary trackage they
came down upon the head of Echo and back to the main grade. When he
rode over the completed Z for the first time Reed looked at the
ties andsaw the engine's weight slip them down the side of the
stiff hill.</p>

<p>He shook his head: "It won't work."</p>

<p>His gloomy guess was well borne out. The next train ever the Z,
carrying ten loads of steel and a caboose, reached the lower
switchback, broke the rail fastenings and slid, engine and all, a
hundred feet to the canyon's bottom.</p>

<p>Casement came storming up to the break with his terriers and
repaired it. He went back then and got another engine and another
load of steel, and, asking no man to do what he wouldn't do, took
the train down himself. Peace fired for him. They reached the head
of Echo without accident.</p>

<p>"We've licked it," crowed Casement.</p>

<p>They thought they had, Yet that afternoon when they returned to
Wasatch the down-drifting snow had begun to boil before a
strengthening wind. At five o'clock it was pure black and a roaring
arctic blizzard smashed Wasatch terrifically and ripped the snow
dunes high, like huge breakers at sea. The telegraph wires,
scarcely repaired from the previous storm, went down again; and
again traffic on the read came to a full stop and this camp was
shut out from the world.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve, Peace got out the gifts he had ordered
from the East and pulled on his heavy coat. There was a huge
celebration going on in the commissary shack, with all the
engineering staff sitting up to turkey and champagne. Peace made
his rounds, passing out boxes of cigars to all his partners, and
went on to the boarding train to leave a few choice bottles of
Irish whisky with Collie Moynihan. Afterward, bucking through a
blinding sweep of wind and snow, He went down the street and turned
into Roy Lovelace's shanty.</p>

<p>He found them sitting up to the table, Roy and Helen and the
twins, and the young Irish girl. He laid his packages before them,
not bothering to loosen his coat.</p>

<p>"Next Christmas," he said gently, "I'll miss you. I suppose I'll
be in Texas. Where will you be?"</p>

<p>They had changed&mdash;these two people. Something had happened
to Lovelace; it was harder for him to keep up his proud,
gentlemanly front, After the Bryan episode he had set up his own
gambling establishment, but it was common knowledge that his luck
was consistently bad. There was, Peace thought, more gray in
Lovelace's hair; and his eyes were rather bitter. Helen had dressed
for this dinner&mdash;a touch of old times she remembered. Her bare
shoulders stirred expressively under the light. She couldn't smile
and her voice was soft and deeply sad.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Frank."</p>

<p>Peace said: "Why don't you get out of this, now, Roy? You'll
recall what you said about your luck."</p>

<p>Lovelace stared down at the table, his dropped shoulders bucking
up the smooth front of his white shirt. The twins were softly
giggling between themselves.</p>

<p>"I know," murmured Lovelace. "I know. But I think it will turn
better. I think it will."</p>

<p>Helen lifted her eyes to Peace and he saw a misery in them that
made him turn away. "I wish you a merry Christmas," he said, and
tapped each of the twins affectionately on the head, and left the
room. The onhurled snow was like a cinder blast against his face,
cutting and burning as it struck. A few laggard souls plugged down
the street, bound for one or another of the saloons; and all these
saloons this night were a-roar with a festival crowd. There would
be more than one man found in the snow when morning came, Peace
realized. Bound back from the boarding train, they would fall
drunkenly down and never wake from the insidious, pleasant slumber
of freezing death.</p>

<p>When he passed the snow tunnel leading into Carnpeaux's Club
sound rolled out hugely&mdash;sound and warmth&mdash;and the
glitter of many lights. A woman half ran toward the Club and
collided with Peace. She gripped his arm and he saw the dark,
prematurely wise eyes of the fragile Rose lift to him. He swung
about so that his body might shelter her from the wind.</p>

<p>"Rose," he said. "Merry Christmas."</p>

<p>He saw her lips moving and bent down. "It was what I wanted to
wish you," she said. Her hand lifted to him, and her fingers opened
to expose a small package. "This," she said, "is for you." But he
stood there, not quite understanding, and she slid her hand along
his overcoat, dropping the package into his pocket. "You've been
nice to me."</p>

<p>"Rose," he said, "you're young enough yet to get out of here. Do
you need help?"</p>

<p>She looked at him carefully, the faint and anonymous smile she
showed so many men softening her lips. But he saw a strangeness
stir her glance. "Not now, Mr. Peace," she told him. Her fingers
touched his coat a moment, and dropped reluctantly. She turned into
the Club funnel; but just before she pushed the doors aside she
swung her head and looked at him again, She was laughing then, and
her white face stirred to a recklessness.</p>

<p>He trudged on, his band touching the package she had given him.
Ab Kein's voice sailed out of some dark doorway's crack. "Merry
Christmas, Frank." Peace entered the Oliver-Latimer store and
crossed to the rear room. Eileen's voice pulled him in.</p>

<p>She was waiting for him. He saw that. He saw how it colored her
cheeks, how it laid sweetness across all her even features. She
wore a dress he had not seen before, the lines of it tightening
around her slim hips and lying smoothly across the soft swell of
her breasts. The table was set for only two, He spoke of that.</p>

<p>"Where's Ben?"</p>

<p>She shook her head; and the shyness she could not help showing
made her drop her glance. "Not tonight, Frank. I asked him to eat
at the hotel."</p>

<p>"That's too bad&mdash;for Ben."</p>

<p>"You're sorry?"</p>

<p>He said, "No," and crossed to take her between his heavy arms.
Her hair ran neatly and beautifully across her head; two turquoise
earrings stirred as she came forward. He kissed her, the flavor of
her eagerness reacting strongly in him. But she pulled back to show
him how quietly she was smiling.</p>

<p>"I do not know a happier Christmas, Frank. Sit down."</p>

<p>She went into the small kitchen. Peace took off his overcoat,
finding it pleasant to observe the grace of this girl as she moved
around the table. She beckoned him, and they sat down to the meal.
Somewhere she had found old linen to cover the table&mdash;and a
silver candelabrum to hold the spermacetic tapers that threw a soft
glowing over the room. The corner stove's heat eased him. Outside,
the savage roar of the wind scoured the street with a sound like
the rolling of deep drums. She sat quietly in her chair, not
speaking, and then he knew she was waiting for him to set the
pattern they were to follow through the years to come. She was
waiting, quietly and curiously. This was the beginning.</p>

<p>He lowered his head and said a brief blessing. He hadn't done it
since boyhood, but it wasn't difficult to do, for his memories this
night made him humble and the soft pleasure in Eileen's eyes made
him humble. When he raised his bead he saw that she had clasped her
hands and was far away from him at the moment in a prayer of her
own.</p>

<p>They talked a little as they ate, of things out of the past. It
was, he recognized, something they had not done before nor felt
like doing. When he spoke of his own past be observed the quietness
of her attention, as though she were trying to visualize the kind
of man he had been; and it came to him suddenly that she had a
grace and a charm and a dignity which belonged to surroundings he
might never be able to give her. She belonged to a fine house; she
belonged to a kind of life that was gentle and mannerly. In his
vision he could see her come into a drawing room filled with
people, so calm and graceful that she commanded it.</p>

<p>"What do you think of, Frank?"</p>

<p>"I'm not giving you much, Eileen."</p>

<p>She murmured: "It isn't like you to be wistful, Frank. Do you
know what fullness is? I do&mdash;tonight."</p>

<p>They were through. She rose and brought in a bottle of
champagne; and they stood together by the black, cold outline of
the window and touched glasses and drank. He put down his glass,
troubled by the moment to come, and got a box from his pocket. His
heavy fingers opened the box and drew out a ring whose white facets
streaked a bright glitter across the room. He took her left hand
and put the ring on the third finger.</p>

<p>When he looked up from her hand he saw how white her cheeks had
turned. He couldn't understand this, and in all his life, he never
did understand it; but there was an expression in her eyes then so
shaken and so strange that it might have been despair or it might
have been happiness. He didn't know, She came against him, her
cheek against the rough surface of his coat. It went like that for
long, long moments&mdash;until he heard her say in a deep, outgoing
breath:</p>

<p>"No, Frank, you don't know what fullness is. But I do." She
stepped back from him, her manner turned gay.</p>

<p>He helped her with the dishes; and afterward they sat by the
stove, all the outside pressure of a mad world cracking against the
building front. Shot echoes raced thinly with the wind; a tin tub
of some kind went banging down the street.</p>

<p>She said: "I heard that Nan Normandy found her father. He was a
gambler in a grading camp. Or a saloonman."</p>

<p>He looked up. "When was this?"</p>

<p>She looked at him. "Didn't you know? I thought you would."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Haven't seen her lately." He bent over in
the chair, rubbing his big palms slowly together; a long line cut
its way across his forehead. She watched him, gone quite still.</p>

<p>"Frank," she whispered, and drew up his glance. But he shook his
head, the scowl erased by a slow smiling.</p>

<p>"No, Eileen. No."</p>

<p>"What are you thinking?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, he pulled on his coat and braced the storm
again. Above him and around him was a screaming emptiness, all the
saloon lights being pressed back by the thick weave of snow.
Somebody staggered out of Campeaux's but another man ran through
the door and caught him and pulled him into the place again. Braced
against the bitter wind, Peace crossed over the street and headed
for the commissary. Nan's restaurant&mdash;and he had not
consciously realized this&mdash;was directly in front of him, with
its windows turned to opaque milk-white by the layered ice. He
paused by her door, his shoulder resting against it, and thought of
her with a hunger that he couldn't prevent. He stood like that for
two or three minutes and then went on. The party in the
commissary's dining room was at high tide, but he avoided it, going
to his own room.</p>

<p>Overmile, notoriously an early riser, woke Peace in the bitter
black of the next morning, "Merry Christmas," he said. "There ain't
no track in sight and every door in Wasatch is frozen solid. Snow
measures thirty feet deep at Campeaux's. You know that girl
Rose?"</p>

<p>Wind still drummed and whined across the tin roof of the
commissary building. Peace lighted a match to look at his watch. It
was five o'clock. "Rose? Sure."</p>

<p>"They found her dead. She took laudanum. It's breakfast
time."</p>

<p>Overmile stamped out. Peace lighted a lamp and got dressed. He
thought of something then and went to his overcoat, lifting out the
package Rose had given him. She had found a piece of tissue paper
somewhere with which to wrap it. When he pulled it open he found a
small heart-shaped locket attached to a thin gold chain, He brought
it nearer the lamp and wedged his thumbnail against the locket's
edge, opening it. The lamp light was bad and he couldn't see very
well; he turned up the wick, forgetting the bitter bite of the cold
air. Inside the locket was the picture of a little girl who stood
braced by a tall chair, all her clothes stiff and starched and her
hair braided back from a pleasant face. She looked straight out at
him, her mouth on the verge of a smile, her eyes direct and
trusting and without shadow. This, Peace understood, was the
childhood Rose&mdash;as the older Rose wanted him to remember
her.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
At New Year's the storm swung off. The first week in January it
struck again. The sundered telegraph wires remained down. In and
near Laramie Plains two hundred miles of track lay buried and could
not be opened. Snowplows cut a way back to Evanston and got stuck
at Piedmont Station. Casement's terriers cleared the road to the
tunnel so that the men there could continue the bore and clear off
the buried Z. In that merciless cold their heavy clothes helped
them little and they had to build a chain of bonfires along the
road to keep alive, There was no wood except the ties painfully
hauled from the higher Wasatch canyons. Laid down on the grade,
those ties cost six dollars apiece. It was Collie Moynihan who
estimated he warmed his hands over a hundred-and-fifty-dollar fire
at the head of Echo Canyon. Pneumonia laid them low and frostbitten
members crippled them&mdash;and there was no steel coming up the
grade from Omaha.</p>

<p>It was that lack which turned Reed desperate as he trampled the
right of way and saw no progress. Caught in the jaws of a vise that
would not let go, the Union lay within hand's grasp of the prize of
Ogden, which was only sixty miles away, and could not reach it; and
meanwhile the Central would be striding over the level Nevada high
desert.</p>

<p>Peace said: "Tear up the sidings and use that steel."</p>

<p>Casement jumped at the thought. His terriers backtracked all the
way to Bear River Town, ripping up every secondary rail; and thus
they crept over the Z with their loot and tossed it to the track
gang nervously waiting at the head of Echo. Three weeks after
Christmas Dan Casement's first material train broke through the
Laramie Plains and carne snorting up the Wasatch grade. The wires
into Ogden were mended. The Central, came the message, was within a
hundred and twenty miles of Ogden and advancing fast.</p>

<p>"They've cut our lead in half," said Casement. "To hell with
'em. Watch us go."</p>

<p>All that delayed material glutted the narrow jaws of Echo. The
track layers slogged forward, dropping rails on ties that squirmed
in snow slush and semi-liquid mud. Echo Creek roared bankfull
beside them. Thaw and freeze alternated, buckling up the track and
dropping it; when trains passed this way Casement's Irish laid
their crowbars beneath the rails to support the load.</p>

<p>Down Echo they went, through its narrowing walls to the high
black shoulders of the Weber Gorge, where the snow-fed Weber River
stormed at their very feet. Echo City bloomed and wilted, all in
the course of a week. Near the first of February they passed the
lone pine standing out of the rock&mdash;one thousand miles from
Omaha. And that day the wires from Ogden were full of the Central's
newest trick. The wily Huntington, playing his trump card, had
filed on the right of way all up the Weber and Echo canyons in
Washington, claiming government subsidy on it, claiming a prior
right to it. Dodge wired Reed to come to Ogden.</p>

<p>Reed called Peace into the office shack. "You'll take this job
here. I've got another one at Ogden. Huntington's smart. Our steel
covers the ground he's claimin'. But the administration doesn't
like the Union and it may allow his claim. If it does we've built
sixty miles of track that he'll say belongs to the Central, which
is just another way of shutting out out from Ogden. Dodge sees it.
It's a game two can play. I've got my orders to grade out of Ogden,
clean through Nevada, paralleling the Central's track. So we'll
see."</p>

<p>It rained in Weber Canyon, and snowed, and thawed, and froze.
The rails swung down that gorge without regard to footing or
ballast, bridged the river, tunneled the outcropping shoulders, and
fought forward, At Devil's Slide the Union track layers came upon
the Central graders working up the canyon, tangible evidence that
Huntington meant to make his threat good. But the Union, gathering
momentum, broke through Weber's gateway with a rush on the last
days of February, to see the glitter of Ogden Town's lights, ten
miles away, shining across the valley. And on March third, with the
military band from Fort Douglas blaring out a welcome tune and
Captain Wadsworth's artillery booming its salute, the Union's first
train rolled through Ogden.</p>

<p>'They had won the thousand-mile race for Ogden. One hundred
miles to the west, crippled by a steel train tearing through a
trestle, the Central's track layers limped slowly on. It was the
Union's victory&mdash;hooray!</p>

<p>But that night the weary Union staff, gathered together by
Dodge, heard bad news. Dodge held a telegram in his hand; he waved
it before Reed and Casement and Peace and the others.</p>

<p>"We beat 'em to Ogden," he said dryly. "But apparently we've
lost. For the Secretary of the Interior has approved Huntington's
claim of the whole sixty miles from Ogden to the head of Echo. The
bonds, totaling $1,333,000, have been issued the Central. The
Central hasn't laid an inch of track there&mdash;our steel covers
the whole distance. But we don't get a dime of it, and in addition
we have been told in so many words that our entry into Ogden is
illegal."</p>

<p>The staff sat there in stunned silence. Casement's stubborn
Irish face turned scarlet. Reed's shoulders sank&mdash;the first
time Peace had ever known this indomitable man to show physical
defeat. Dodge was smiling in a grim way.</p>

<p>"President Johnson never trusted the Union," he went on. "But I
want to remind you that tomorrow is the fourth of March, the day of
Grant's inauguration. What Johnson has done Grant can undo. That's
the only hope we have. We're working on that proposition in
Washington. Grant knows what we have been up against. He's fair,
which is all that we ask."</p>

<p>"Have we got to fiddle around and wait?" said Casement, never
liking inaction.</p>

<p>Dodge shook his head. "If the Central wishes to play that kind
of a game we'll play it with them. They intend to lay track east of
Ogden, paralleling ours&mdash;shutting us out of this town. Very
well. We'll build west of Ogden and make our claims to shut them
out. I don't like it, but we can do nothing else. So now, we head
for Nevada. We head right straight for San Francisco. Maybe that
will bring Huntington to reason: Our claim will match the Central's
claim&mdash;and that's the basis of a horse trade. I want to see
the steel go down, fast."</p>

<p>On March the fourth Casement's Paddies, aroused by the thought
of competition, swung out of Ogden with a yell. The track raced
northward along the borders of the lake. Spring touched Salt Lake
Valley and the rigors of the Wasatch winter became a memory. Dan
Casement's supply trains hurried in from Omaha by night and day,
and the flow and swing and roar of another construction year
disturbed a brightening Utah sky. The Central's steel was
seventy-five miles away but the Central's graders were coming down
the lake beside the Union's steel; whereupon Casement's terriers
only laughed and ran out their rails and dropped them and hurried
on. Thirty-one miles from Ogden and twenty-five days from Ogden the
Union's trains touched the edge of Bear River and spawned
Corinne.</p>

<p>All of a sudden fever touched Corinne. Overnight it became the
queen city, and men hurried up from Salt Lake to shape a great
non-Mormon town in the basin; suddenly a huge freighting trade
lumbered out of Corinne for the Montana and Idaho mines. All the
riffraff and hangers-on who had pursued the Union as far as Green
River and had been driven back by winter now swarmed over the
mountains. The high, thin air went like wine to men's heads;
optimism ran not. Corinne's streets grew, row on row. Nineteen
saloons, two dance halls and eighty girls made Corinne's evenings
large; the Corinne <i>Reporter</i> reported corner lots
successively at two hundred dollars, at five hundred dollars, at
one thousand dollars, at three thousand dollars, and forecast a
population of ten thousand people in two years.</p>

<p>At night, lighted by tar flares, men stood on soap boxes and
spoke of Corinne as a colossus that would stand in the
midcontinent, looking west to China, looking east to Europe. This
was Cheyenne and Laramie and Benton and Wasatch all rolled into
one. Campeaux's club roared, pandemonium surged through the streets
with the Union's construction crew. Four men died of gunshot wounds
the first week.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Bill Wallen came into Nan's restaurant late in the evening and sat
at the counter, gravely watching expression play across his
daughter's cheeks. "The road," he said, "will be done before long,"
and fell wonderingly silent, absorbed by a regret he could never
forget and by an affection he could not express.</p>

<p>"Cheyenne seems too far back," she remarked. "It's hard to
realize all this will stop."</p>

<p>"You're not sorry?"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew."</p>

<p>"You're wondering what comes next for you."</p>

<p>She looked at him. "How did you guess that?"</p>

<p>He had a slow, small smile that turned his features half
handsome, "I've come to the end of things a good many
times&mdash;always wondering what was next. I can suggest something
for you."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I've seen most of the world. It isn't much fun for me any more.
There's always a time when the novelty wears thin and the hope
wears off, and afterward your eyes get tired. I have money enough,
Let me show you the world, Nan. I think you'd like it&mdash;and
maybe I could see something new, through your eyes, which are still
fresh."</p>

<p>"I think," she said softly, "you want to change me."</p>

<p>"I happen to know how you feel about Frank Peace."</p>

<p>She didn't answer him. She stood against the wall, her hands
tucked behind; her eyes were beyond reading. He couldn't guess how
deeply she was hurt.</p>

<p>"There's another reason," he added. "The thing that ruined me
was a restlessness I couldn't kill. I thought there was something
in the world I was missing. Well, I know better now&mdash;but I
learned the lesson too late. I can see some of that in you, too.
You think there's something in the world you're missing. I don't
want you to spoil your life that way. We'll take a look&mdash;a
good, long look. Then I think you'll see."</p>

<p>She said, "All right," in a quiet, unemotional way.</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>That brought a quick answer. "I'd like to see the rails come
together. Then we'll go."</p>

<p>He considered her with his gentle, shrewd glance. "It isn't the
joining of the rails, Nan."</p>

<p>She met his eyes. "No, maybe not."</p>

<p>"When you end a thing," he said, "end it clean. Close your mind
to it&mdash;and never carry any lost hopes away. It is hard to do,
but it will save you pain."</p>

<p>"I'll be ready to go, whenever the road is finished."</p>

<p>He got up. He said carefully: "It will be a happy time for me,
Nan. I had thought life was about through with me. I've had no real
peace since I left your mother."</p>

<p>After he had gone into the robust, brawling noise of the street
she remained behind the counter, the pale glow of her hair throwing
light down across the struggling darkness of her eyes. Her father,
she knew, was wrong. It wasn't possible to forget. It wasn't
possible to shut out of her mind the picture of Frank Peace.
Wherever the years took her she would remember him. She could say
good-by&mdash;she had already said that to Frank Peace. She had put
away her hopes. But she couldn't forget, and never would.</p>

<p class="first">
DUKE RING came through the alley door into Campeaux's office.
Campeaux stirred a little in the chair, shoulders rolling. He
lighted up a half-smoked cigar. "Ring," he said, "you're a pretty
good black-jack player."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Ring.</p>

<p>"I heard Roy Lovelace's luck ain't been very good."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>Campeaux opened a drawer. He laid a roll of gold pieces on the
desk. "Take that," he said, "and go bust him."</p>

<p>Ring weighed the gold in his hand a moment; the glint of
cupidity rising unsuppressed to his eyes. "Maybe I'll lose."</p>

<p>"Go find out. Push the works at him, first bet. If you lose come
back here for another thousand. If you win drag your thousand and
play his money. Double it up."</p>

<p>Ring listened to his instructions carefully. "It's his cards I'm
buckin'," he observed.</p>

<p>"He's square," said Campeaux. "He's square&mdash;and a fool. Do
what I tell you."</p>

<p>Ring put the money in his pocket and left the room. He started
to shut the door, but Brett and Cordray had been waiting there.
They came in. Cordray closed the door and put his back to it, his
skeleton-thin body needing support. Carnpeaux had turned to his
desk, but he swung around again and took a long, cool look at these
two men. Brett showed him a dry grin.</p>

<p>"Just to jog your memory, Sid. We want our money."</p>

<p>"What money?"</p>

<p>Brett's grin lengthened across his lips, pale and containing no
humor. He talked over his shoulder to Cordray:</p>

<p>"Hear that, Jack? Sid don't remember. We thought you wouldn't,
Sid. Four thousand dollars was the amount we took from the old man
Oliver's store in Bryan. That's ours."</p>

<p>"Sure," murmured Campeaux. "But you don't get it now."</p>

<p>"No?" said Brett smoothly. "No?"</p>

<p>"This business is about over," stated Campeaux. "I can see you
boys are gettin' restless to pull out, I've made a meal ticket for
you, Al, all the way from Fremont, and I guess you've done a little
forgettin' yourself."</p>

<p>"Peace?" suggested Al Brett.</p>

<p>"Afraid of him?" asked Campeaux.</p>

<p>"I'll pick my time," said Brett.</p>

<p>Campeaux's scorn was more and more evident. "I've heard that
before, Here's Cordray, wholly useless to me, and a damned sight
better off dead to himself. Here you are, goin' yellow."</p>

<p>Brett's cheeks whitened until only two round, small, bright
stains of color remained high on his cheekbones. "You're a little
brash, Sid."</p>

<p>"I saw you back up from Peace," growled Campeanx, "He backed you
and Cordray against that wall. He called you every name a white man
ain't. Both of you brave boys stood there, sickly as ever I saw men
look."</p>

<p>Cordray shook his head. He said in a dead, weary tone: "Never
mind, Sid. Never mind; Brett knows what he's doing."</p>

<p>"And what's he doing?" challenged Campeaux.</p>

<p>"Holdin' off, Sid. Holdin' off till Peace forgets to be careful.
That's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brett grunted: "Be quiet, Jack." Yellow light filtered out of
his eyes&mdash;heatless and wicked. "No man speaks to me that way,
Sid. You hear?"</p>

<p>"I spoke to you that way," retorted Campeaux.</p>

<p>Whiteness crept more and more around the edge of Brett's
nose&mdash;the pure pallor of a man sickened in his stomach, or of
a man whose passions crowded his blood back into its main channels.
But in the end Brett let his stiff muscles relax.</p>

<p>"All right, Sid. You're welshin' on that money. That's bright.
You make a small fortune and use men like me to do your dirty
chores. Then you welsh on 'em. Very bright, Sid. But listen. I'll
ask you once more for that money. When I do I want it."</p>

<p>"You know how to get it."</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;I do," said Brett. "Come on, Jack."</p>

<p>Outside, Brett stopped Cordray. He only touched Cordray's arm,
but the latter's body was so weak that this little pressure whirled
him half around. "Listen, Jack. I don't want Peace to see you and
me together. Catch the next work train out to Blue Creek."</p>

<p>Cordray was seized by a long and terrible spell of coughing.
Standing back, Brett watched the man with a glance that was
impersonal and without sympathy. Cordray finally got possession of
his breath.</p>

<p>"We better get this over with soon," he gasped. "I ain't got
much farther to go."</p>

<p>"It'll be soon," said Brett, and stood in the shadows, watching
Cordray walk uncertainly toward the depot.</p>

<p>Peace came in from Blue Creek that night, as weary as he had
ever known himself to be, and went to Eileen's. She saw the dull,
ground-in need for sleep when she kissed him. It impelled her to
push him toward a chair&mdash;and to go make a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>He had the satisfaction of knowing that the long fight was about
over; for this day Durant of the Union and Huntington of the
Central had, come at last to an understanding. The two right of
ways which, if the fight kept up, promised to parallel each other
from Omaha to San Francisco without ever joining, were to meet ten
miles beyond Blue Creek, at the top of the Promontory range. He
told Eileen that.</p>

<p>"But it's been a hell of a month. We got caught short at the
edge of those hills. There's no decent grade from the flats up into
Promontory. We've been working twenty-four-hour shifts, lifting the
grade by long fills."</p>

<p>She brought him his coffee and sat beside him. "But it's over?"
she said.</p>

<p>He noticed the deep relief in her voice. "Almost," he said.</p>

<p>She said: "Are you glad, Frank?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>She considered him, calm and clear-minded. "I have wondered. It
is your life. So much so. When it is done there will be so many
things to regret losing, so many friends to leave."</p>

<p>"How do you know that, Eileen?"</p>

<p>She said: "Your feelings are very deep, Frank. You don't show
them&mdash;but they are."</p>

<p>He said: "It's time you and I did some talking."</p>

<p>She got up, plainly agitated by his words. She moved around the
room. "Whatever you wish," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Dodge wants me to be in Texas within a month. We have that
month, Eileen. I think we'd better begin it pretty soon."</p>

<p>She whirled. "Frank," she said swiftly, "are you sure?"</p>

<p>He dragged himself out of his thinking. Excitement unsteadied
her features; and faint fear was in her glance. He got up and went
over to her, "I answered that question once before," he told
her.</p>

<p>"I know. But sometimes I'm frightened."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Things happen to you. They always do and they always will. You
can't help being what you are. You can't ever stop men from liking
you&mdash;and women from loving you. You can't ever stop other men
from, wanting to kill you. I wish we were a thousand miles from
this town tonight!"</p>

<p>"Spring's here," he said gently, "and the world's a pretty
pleasant place. Let's have a look at this queen city."</p>

<p>They went through the store. Ben Latimer stood in the doorway,
staring into the restless traffic and not hearing them come up
behind him. Eileen said, "Ben," in an affectionate voice, He
stepped aside for them, looking soberly down at the girl. He had no
answer for her smile; and afterward, ignoring Peace, he wheeled
back into the room.</p>

<p>They went along with the flow of the crowd, her hand holding
Peace's arm. Corinne stretched out under the night, all its lights
glittering through a soft damp, May air; freighting wagons rolled
by and horsemen cut through this steady traffic, now and then
lifting their voices to pedestrians roving the street. Campeaux's
orchestra laid a lively racket over the housetops. At the edge of
town a long train whistled and ran slowly by. The surface of the
lake was all rippled and shining; in the west the outline of
Promontory blackened the horizon, To the east the Wasatch range
lifted its massive walls.</p>

<p>"Ben," said Peace, "feels badly about this. He loves you."</p>

<p>"Do you mind?" she whispered.</p>

<p>He looked down at her and his smile was very gentle. "How could
he help himself? I'm sorry for him."</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;you're not jealous?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, Afterward her silence turned his eyes again; and
he saw that his answer had in some strange way hurt her
feelings.</p>

<p>Down the street a tar flare sent up a round, smoky light; and a
crowd blocked the corner entirely, listening to a man speak from an
impromptu platform. His high, long-drawn words ran out with a tenor
ringing. "Reach down, each one of you, and take up as much dirt as
you can hold in your fist. Gentlemen, mark me&mdash;and mark me
well, You will live to see the day when land in Corinne&mdash;that
land you hold&mdash;will be worth its weight in gold! Here's the
great agricultural and mineral heart of America. Here's the
railroad. Here's the lake. Here's opportunity. It taps you on the
shoulder now. Now! Don't let it go by! It will never come to
you&mdash;and you&mdash;and you again!"</p>

<p>Al Brett turned the edges of this crowd, coming forward. He saw
Peace and stopped; and his reckless face showed a thin smiling as
he removed his hat and bowed to Eileen, Peace, covering this man
with an alert and steady stare, felt Eileen's fingers dig into his
arm. But Brett's smile broadened.</p>

<p>"Peace," he said, "I wish you well."</p>

<p>Peace drawled, "From you, Al, that's an unnatural wish."</p>

<p>"I realize it sounds poorly," murmured Brett. His yellow head
stirred and his glance jerked around, sizing up the crowd; it was a
habit he could not break, rising as it did from his self-preserving
instincts. The ruddy, cream complexion of the man strengthened in
the guttering light of the tar flare; vitality and arrogance were
qualities that showed so plainly through him. "I've been looking
for you," added Brett.</p>

<p>"I'm here," stated Peace. Eileen's fingers hurt him with their
increasing pressure.</p>

<p>"No," said Brett. "No trouble, Bucko. The road's about done.
I'll be soon gone. You and I've been on different sides of the
fence&mdash;that's the way it had to be. But I want you to know I'm
through working for Campeaux, which is what I want to tell you. I
hold no resentment. I hear you'll be married shortly. Well, my
congratulations to you and my best wishes to the lady." Brett's
laughter seemed to Peace then a stronger and stronger thing. "Maybe
you don't get it. I'm no hand to explain. We ain't in each other's
way any more, so why should I be holdin' a grudge? It's a big world
and I figure we won't be meetin' again. Leave it go like that."</p>

<p>He was pleased with himself; the long lips of the man framed
that assured grinning as he swung back into the street. Peace
watched him go; and not until the man had disappeared somewhere
beyond Campeaux's did his own muscles relax.</p>

<p>Eileen murmured: "Don't believe him! Don't trust him!"</p>

<p>Peace, keen to the shapes and sounds of this boiling street, saw
Overmile stroll out of a doorway and walk over the street&mdash;and
take a position opposite the alley down which Al Brett had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Don't trust him," repeated Eileen.</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;never&mdash;never!" shouted the man on the
platform. "You will never again see a chance like this! How would
you like to own a corner in the middle of Chicago? Gentlemen, your
chance to be a millionaire lies here&mdash;tonight! Some day these
corners will be as valuable as those in Chicago. Why not? Look
around you and see this land. No town ever had Corinne's
opportunity!"</p>

<p>Bill Wallen carne along the street and stopped. "Frank," he
said, "I found my daughter the day you brought her to end of track,
beyond Benton. I wish I could thank you."</p>

<p>Sudden embarrassment caught hold of Peace. Eileen was a still
shape by his side, Wallen was trying to hide an emotion; he cleared
his throat and spoke again, "You were mighty kind to her. It is a
thing I'll remember. We're leaving as soon as the tracks are
joined."</p>

<p>Peace said woodenly, "Good luck," and watched Wallen go. He
turned with Eileen and they went back to the Oliver-Latimer store.
He said, "I've got to find Reed. I'll see you again tomorrow
night."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, whispering: "Will you see her, Frank?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered and did not realize how short his voice was.
"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"I wish," she repeated with an intensity that astonished him,
"we were a thousand miles from here tonight."</p>

<p>"Eileen."</p>

<p>She paused in the doorway, darkness lying across her features.
He removed his hat and the edges of his unruly hair dropped down on
his forehead; he had an expression then that showed the raggedness
of his temper. Her glance, always so sharp and discerning, saw
this.</p>

<p>"Go see her, Frank, if it will help you."</p>

<p>"Don't read things in my head that are not there, Eileen."</p>

<p>She murmured humbly, "I'm sorry, Frank," and touched his arm,
and hurried into the store.</p>

<p>Going back down the street toward the depot, he was intercepted
by Overmile. "What was Brett wantin'?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He wished me luck."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" intoned Overmile. "What kind of luck? I saw Cordray pull
out on the work train. Why? You better go see Lovelace. Duke Ring
bucked his game tonight&mdash;and busted him."</p>

<p>"Now what will Helen and the twins do?" groaned Peace.</p>

<p>"Go see him."</p>

<p>But Peace shook his head. He remembered Lovelace's haggard
expression and the misery in Helen's eyes. They would be having a
bad evening and his presence wouldn't help. He said, "I've got no
business there tonight. Let's go over to headquarters."</p>

<p>They strolled on. Presently Peace said: "You'll be here
tomorrow, Do me a favor. Find out if Roy's got any immediate plans.
I've got to stand back of those people."</p>

<p>"Yeah." Then Overmile said, very casual with his, words: "I hear
Nan and her dad are pullin' out after the rails meet."</p>

<p>Peace didn't answer. Overmile's glance whipped across his
partner's cheeks and fell thoughtfully aside.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Lovelace revealed no expression, and his voice didn't change. He
said to Ring: "That's all."</p>

<p>"Another thousand?"</p>

<p>"Game's closed," said Lovelace.</p>

<p>He watched Ring's short, broken-boned fingers pick up the money
on the table and drop it into a coat pocket. Ring's face was soft
and greasy, the crushed lips pulled at the corners by nervous
muscular spasms.</p>

<p>"Go back to Campeaux," said Lovelace, "and tell him you did your
job."</p>

<p>"What?" said Ring narrowly.</p>

<p>"I realize he's had his way with me at last," droned Lovelace.
"Tell him that."</p>

<p>Ring shot a quick look at Lovelace and at Lovelace's wife
standing wholly still in the background, "Too bad," he said, and
left the little room. Lovelace walked to the door and closed it,
and turned around. He racked the chips and put away the pack of
cards. His fingers did this automatically. In the rear living
quarters the twins were chuckling, copying each other's strange
noises. Lovelace lifted his glance to Helen.</p>

<p>"We're broke," he said,</p>

<p>He could not understand his wife's manner. She looked on, all
her features drawn inexpressibly sober. She had something in her
eyes very strange to him&mdash;a calmness surviving this bad night.
She was always calm, always steeled to the misfortunes of their
life. But this seemed deeper, so deep that it would never
leave.</p>

<p>"Altogether broke, Roy?"</p>

<p>"Ring took the last of it." He said, as a barren afterthought:
"I was right. Benton was the top of our luck. I knew it
then&mdash;I knew it would never stay like that."</p>

<p>"Have you any money at all?"</p>

<p>"A ten-dollar bill in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Possibly you could horrow for another try."</p>

<p>"I'd lose it. There's nothing, left&mdash;no luck, no money, and
no hope. I wasn't smart enough to quit when I saw the end coming.
So I'm a sucker&mdash;a tinhorn."</p>

<p>She said, gently: "You're through?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Quite through?" she repeated in that same breathless,
relentless way.</p>

<p>He nodded. This pride was out of him and he saw himself with the
sunless, shadowless clarity of total disillusion. He was a weak
man, he knew it then. His life had been useless and the little
dream of honor was something that never had existed, a
self-deception to cover his failure to face reality. He had led his
wife to ruin, he had laid an indelible mark against the future of
his children.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said Helen, a tone rushing out of her in a manner
that was terrible and passionate, like the release of heartbreak.
It jerked him up. She had been so steady, she had been at his right
hand for so long, supporting him by her presence, with never a word
of regret or of reproach, or of longing for the life they had left.
But here she stood with all the reserve vanished from her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've lost!"</p>

<p>He said dully: "What's there to be glad about, when I've brought
you down to poverty?"</p>

<p>"How long a wait it's been," she said, "How cruel a wait it's
been. I have laid awake many a night&mdash;wondering if this time
would ever come&mdash;if you would ever reach the end of your luck,
and know that you had reached the end, and be willing to quit."</p>

<p>"I know nothing else. I'm good for nothing else."</p>

<p>She said: "We can be honest people, Roy. It doesn't matter how
hard it will be to live. At last we can live and not be
ashamed."</p>

<p>The gambler's immobility of expression on his cheeks broke; he
dropped his head across his arms lying on the table, and then a
rasping despair shook his shoulders and laid a weird, choking sound
across the room. Helen moved to him. Her hands touched his
shoulders; her eyes were soft and lovely and maternal. Her voice
had a singing melody in it.</p>

<p>"I could cry for you, Roy. For all that you have lost yourself.
But this is the first day's happiness I have felt for many
years."</p>

<p>Leaving Lovelace's place, Duke Ring walked in the direction of
Campeaux's Club. Near the back entrance of the saloon he stepped
into a little area of shadow and looked very carefully about him.
His right hand was in his coat pocket, touching the money he had
won; and an impulse, long nursed, now set him about on his heels
and carried him down one of Corinne's side streets to a stable. His
horse was here; he got it and saddled it and trotted out to the
street again, turning southward in the direction of Ogden. At the
corner he hauled in on his reins. "Campeaux."</p>

<p>Sid Campeaux stood beside an empty building. Darkness crowded
this rear street; the sound of Corinne's busy heart carne over the
housetops to touch it with muted echoes. Campeaux threw his cigar
out into the dust, the lighted end bursting into glitter-pointed
fractions of light.</p>

<p>"It ain't ever very hard to figure you out, Duke," said
Campeaux, and shot Ring through the heart.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The Union's grade swept out of Blue Creek to tackle the Promontory
range by main force. Casement's Paddies rushed forward, as they had
done for two years, charging that stubborn barrier like old
soldiers deploying against an enemy line. Two long trestles lifted
the Union's rails out of the flat lands and Promontory's forbidding
flanks were broken by huge charges of nitroglycerin. Great cuts and
fills carried the track at last onto the tabled surface of the
range; on April twenty-eight the questing terriers, dashing the
sweat of this heavy labor from their brows, saw the twinkle of the
Central's campfires in the near distance. Promontory, last lurid
stand of the end-of-track dives, mushroomed up from an inhospitable
soil on May the first, its one street paralleling the right of way.
Discharged graders and construction men began to drift through
Promontory, back through Blue Creek and on to Corinne settling old
grudges and old thirsts. All trains out of the East were bringing
in tourists for the final epic spectacle of the age. The Union's
Irishmen swung their picks side by side with the Central's Chinese
and laid a "grave" for the yellow men, the blast burying a dozen of
them.</p>

<p>Campeaux moved his Club to Promontory and for a few days the
dance hails whirled to their tinsel pleasures, and the three-card
monte cappers called across the street, and bravado reached its
highest frenzied pitch when two gamblers, pitched into sudden
quarreling, seized the opposite ends of a bandanna across the width
of a poker table and shot each other to death over the doubtful
affections of one Peigon Bess. Campeaux sold the painting of the
enigmatic gauze-draped lady to Faro Evans, who cherished it, for
fifty dollars; and Sailor Dick Shugrue, serving one too many
knockout drops to an Irishman with fat pockets, was next day beaten
into unrecognizable shape and pitched out a second-story
window&mdash;to be patched partially together by Doctor Frank
Harrison.</p>

<p>On May the ninth a single rail's length separated the Union and
the Central, and a polished mahogany Last Tie and a golden Last
Spike waited in the Central's headquarters safe for the final
ceremony, All the wires were humming with the news of the great
ones of the East and West on their way for the morrow's
celebration. Huntington and Stanford of the Central were already
here; and Vice-president Durant's car rested on the siding. This
night General Dodge used it to give his staff a dinner.</p>

<p>Sitting at the table, Peace saw an these hearty, forthright men
with a silent affection and with a regret that lay like a hurt in
him. They had all been through a good deal, with the wild, hard
years of the road's building&mdash;binding them together by bands
that were difficult to break. It was what he felt, and what they
felt as well&mdash;for the gentleness of that reflection softened
their talk.</p>

<p>Peace saw Dodge rise to make a speech&mdash;and stand quite a
little while silent. When he did speak it was slowly and
briefly.</p>

<p>"When we stood at Fremont a little less than two years ago, and
saw Jack Casement drop the command that started the rails west, I
doubt if any of us knew how much lay ahead. I do not know of any
period in my life that has been more satisfactory to me. Money
couldn't buy the loyalty you gentlemen have given me; and money
couldn't buy my feelings toward you. Some of you I'll see again,
which is a happy thought&mdash;for most of us here will be building
roads till we die. Some of you I'll not see again. I wish I could
tell you how I regret that."</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at his plate, and lifted his face to show
them a heavy earnestness, "I want to tell you something. Some men
talk and some men do. Back East the talkers are going to lay
scandal at our door. They'll say we wasted money, they'll say we
cheated the government, they'll take up all our mistakes, and tell
us how we might have avoided them. Gentlemen, you nave nothing to
be ashamed of. We had to build a road across a thousand miles of
desert and mountains. We had to make our own way, we had to fight
our own fights. We built the road. Remember that. We built
it&mdash;and in building it we joined our country together and gave
a value to land that had no value before. Let them talk and let
them argue. Our monument is a thousand miles of steel stretching
from here to Omaha."</p>

<p>He quit that subject abruptly and lifted his glass. "Gentlemen,
here's to those who should be sitting here and are not&mdash;to
those great, gallant souls we'll meet someday in a better
world."</p>

<p>They rose and drank on that; and the meeting broke into little
groups moving aimlessly around. Peace looked at his hands, thinking
of big Ed Tarrant, of Phil Morgan, of Archie Millard. His own
problems seemed just then to be deepening around him, and yet he
had a feeling of utter uselessness; Blood ran through him idly, his
muscles were without work to do, and his mind had no point. It was
a strange sensation; it was like living under the roar of wind for
two years and afterward coming into a vast silence. The silence was
hard to bear. Dodge walked down the car and stopped before him.</p>

<p>"I'll expect to see you in Omaha June fifteenth, Frank," he
said, and went on.</p>

<p>Peace caught Overmile's eyes; and they left the coach standing
by the depot. A gusty spring rain swept over the desert; across the
wide street Promontory's evil, lurid row of shacks and tents echoed
up a last violent spasm of sound. End of track had reached a final
ending, its last reincarnation bolder and more brazen intentioned
than before. Casement's Irish were filling the
street&mdash;restless, empty-handed, eager for trouble.</p>

<p>Peace filled his pipe. He stared through the flare of the match,
seeing the street clearly. "It doesn't seem two years. A man
remembers a lot of things so damned distinctly." His voice dropped
to a falsely casual tone. "What'll you be doin', Leach?"</p>

<p>"Me," said Overmile. "I'm going back to Laramie Plains. I got a
spot picked out for a ranch."</p>

<p>"A lot of things," repeated Peace in a very soft tone,
"distinctly."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Ab Kein wheeled across the street. He grinned a little, making a
round gesture in the night air with his hands. "So the fun's about
over."</p>

<p>"I guess," considered Overmile, "you've filled your basket."</p>

<p>Ab Kein looked at Overmile and laughed in a sudden, astonishing
way. It bent him over and brought tears to his eyes. "Listen," he
said. "From Fremont to Benton I made plenty. The world is full of
suckers. At Corinne I said, 'Ab, you're going to be rich.'" He had
to stop here because the thought of this enormous joke broke his
voice again. Peace and Overmile waited with a deep curiosity.</p>

<p>"A thousand times I've talked money out of men's pockets. I'm
slick. In Corinne there's other men, talkin' like I talked. Smart
men from San Francisco. Would you believe Ab Kein would ever bite
his own hook? I did. Those San Francisco men made me the sucker.
Me, Ab Kein. I own half of Corinne and I ain't got a dime. And
Corinne will be a field of dust, like Benton, thirty days from
now."</p>

<p>"Trimmed?" said Overmile incredulously.</p>

<p>Kein wiped his eyes and blew his nose. "Don't worry. I've had
fun&mdash;and the world's still full of suckers bigger than me." He
went back across Promontory's street, his feet plodding gingerly
through the mud.</p>

<p>A work train's bell began to ring below the depot, ready to pull
out for Corinne. "I guess we've all had some fun," murmured
Overmile, and shrugged his high shoulders. "You goin' to bring
Eileen up here tomorrow for the ceremonies?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peace. Both of them walked over to the train and
swung aboard.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Jack Cordray turned off the main street and walked back along the
edge of Campeaux's huge tent wall to where Al Brett waited. He
said, "Campeaux's comin' in."</p>

<p>Brett opened the rear door of Campeaux's office. Cordray
followed him in, closing the door and leaning against it. But Brett
pointed to another corner of the office, that gesture sending
Cordray over there. Brett's grin licked a thin line across his lips
and his eyes began to burn. He looked like that; when Campeaux
pushed through from the saloon.</p>

<p>Campeaux saw that grin, He stopped and his fingers gave the door
a little shove, closing it quickly. He looked carefully at Brett,
and shot one short glance oyer to the corner where Cordray stood.
He saw what was in their minds; he saw Brett's yellowing stare and
the savagery pulsing and pulling at the corners of Cordray's
tubercular lips. He brought his vast shoulders together, facing
them with a massive contempt.</p>

<p>"Move out of here."</p>

<p>"We'll take that money, Sid," murmured Brett.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Campeaux, "I better show you boys how to
mind."</p>

<p>He moved straight at Brett. It put his broad back toward Cordray
who, waiting for such an opportunity, sprang catlike out of his
corner. Cordray snatched at his gun and lifted it, not to fire but
to smash its barrel at Campeaux's head. The huge saloonman felt
that threat and pulled up a shoulder, taking the blow there.
Huge-bulked as he was, he wheeled faster than Cordray could draw
back, and his great arms circled Cordray and squeezed the man
inward. Cordray's wind came sighing out of him under that pressure;
he tried to trip Campeaux, ramming his legs up and down. Campeaux
laughed. He held Cordray like that, crushing the man's thin
muscles, springing the man's thin bones, presenting him at Brett
like a shield.</p>

<p>"Al," said Campeaux, "I can do this to you."</p>

<p>Brett looked on with a pale, composed interest. Not speaking,
not stirring. Cordray cried, "Al&mdash;come in here!"</p>

<p>And then he screamed and fell loose in Campeaux's arms, sagging
downward to expose Campeaux's barrel chest. Campeaux started to
pull him back up. It was then that Brett, hauling his own gun from
its holster with the indrawn coolness of a target marksman, sighted
the nugget charm on the chain crossing Campeaux's vest and drove a
bullet at it, directly above Cordray's lolling head.</p>

<p>Down the barrel of the gun he still held in that cocked attitude
Al Brett noted rage and shock pull the man's jowls together.
Campeaux let Cordray drop and afterward fell atop the man. He
landed on his knees and elbows. He crawled across Cordray, reaching
out for Brett's legs. Brett kicked at Campeaux's face and stepped
aside. But Campeaux was driven by a terrible, inhuman patience; he
pulled himself around and crawled at Brett again. Brett lost his
coolness.</p>

<p>He yelled, "Why in damnation don't you die!" And shot Campeaux
through the head. Campeaux dropped down, issuing no sound.</p>

<p>There were men beyond the saloon doorway; he heard them talking,
he heard them brush against the wall. He put his sights on the
doorway, waiting&mdash;turned cool again. Cordray groaned and
rolled and got up. There was little left in him.</p>

<p>He whispered, "You were mighty slow, Al. He broke my ribs."</p>

<p>Brett said: "We're through here, Jack. Come on."</p>

<p>Cordray struggled to his feet. He put both hands against the
wall, sick and shaken and half dead. "What?" he sighed.</p>

<p>"One more chore," said Brett. "One more&mdash;and we're all
finished. Go back to Corinne and wait for me."</p>

<p>Cordray shook his head. "I'll never last to see Bucko dead."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will," said Brett. "Yes, you will."</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">
A HIGH wind whipped up the bunting of the special trains
gathered at Promontory; the rain had stopped and the sun was out,
lifting the fresh, raw smell of the earth. Peace took Eileen's arm
and pushed a way through the crowd until he found standing room
near the ceremony. Photographers were lugging their unwieldy
cameras around, hunting better locations.</p>

<p>A picked group of track layers had placed a last pair of rails
in position, and across this narrow space the straight-stacked
Rogers of the Union faced the Central's Jupiter, whose bell-shaped
funnel rolled out a heavy smoke. Fifteen hundred spectators of all
degrees crowded around&mdash;Irishmen, Chinese, Mexicans, tourists,
Promontory's sports, and the officials of both lines. Four
companies of the Twenty-first Infantry from Camp Douglas were drawn
up before the rails, and the Fourth Ward band from Salt Lake stood
ready to play. A telegrapher's rig had been set up by the track,
hooked to a waiting world; and the operator stood nervously by,
watching the Central's president, Leland Stanford, awkwardly poise
the sledge over the golden spike. Durant and Huntington and
Dodge&mdash;and twenty other high officials stood here, looking
gravely on.</p>

<p>Stanford swung the sledge down on the spike. The telegrapher's
nervous fingers tapped "Done!" out along three thousand miles to an
expectant America. Stanford handed the sledge to Durant, and the
band broke into the "Star-Spangled Banner," and the soldiers
snapped stiff. Eileen's hand tightened against Peace's hand. She
looked up at him, her lips framing a single word: "Over!" Peace
looked at his watch. This was two forty-seven in the afternoon of
May 10, 1869, and two years of his life closed, definitely with
that sledge's tap. Like a door slamming shut. All the crowd was
yelling and the officials were shaking hands, and the band,
finished with the anthem, burst into a quick-step tune: "Hard Times
Come Again No More." The Jupiter and the Rogers, jetting out steam,
slowly moved forward till their pilots touched. Irishmen swarmed up
on the engines, champagne bottles broke in foaming streams over the
engines and the cheering grew louder.</p>

<p>Stanford handed this message to the telegrapher:</p>

<p class="telegram">promontory summit, utah, may 10, 1869<br>
to president ulysses grant:<br>
the last rail has been laid, the last spike driven. the pacific railway is
completed. the point of junction is 1086 miles west of the missouri river and
690 miles east of sacramento city.<br>
leland stanford, central pacific<br>
t. c. durant<br>
sidney dillon<br>
john duff, union pacific.</p>

<p>The crowd milled and surged without direction. More men were
taking turns at tapping the spike. All the engine whistles were
rending the Windy afternoon and the band kept crashing out its
tunes, Peace took Eileen back through the crowd, following other
people hurrying toward the Corinne train. Gunfire rose up from
Promontory's street in rowdy bursts.</p>

<p>Eileen said with a slow, gentle voice: "How final it is. I have
lived in the middle of fury for so long. Tomorrow it will seem like
living in an empty house. Isn't it a little hard to say good-by,
Frank?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Another thought brought her glance back to him.
"Campeaux&mdash;is he really dead?"</p>

<p>"Brett and Cordray killed him last night."</p>

<p>"I saw Brett in the crowd&mdash;just now, Frank&mdash;what will
he do?"</p>

<p>"I think he's through."</p>

<p>"Don't trust him&mdash;don't ever," she said vehemently.</p>

<p>They came to their car and to the group waiting at the steps.
More people came along and the group thickened&mdash;and then
Peace, turning half around, came face to face with Bill Wallen. And
with Nan.</p>

<p>Wallen said, "How are you, Frank?"</p>

<p>Peace nodded, not answering. To him at that moment Wallen was a
dim figure in one corner of his vision, and he forgot for that
little while that Eileen clung to his arm. Nan's eyes met his
glance with a steadiness that ran an old shock through him again,
waking the hunger he had so painfully put away. She stood before
him, so quiet and so fair and so much a woman; and her eyes
betrayed her, showing him a quick tenderness. He looked down and
stepped back, letting them go by. But Wallen turned to have another
word.</p>

<p>"Nan and I are leaving here tonight on the San Francisco train.
I'd like to say good-by to you and wish you luck." He shook Peace's
band, poorly hiding his emotion, and caught up with Nan. Peace had
no way of stopping his glance from following. He watched the
graceful swing of her shoulders, until she was absorbed by the
crowd boiling down Promontory's street.</p>

<p>He brought his head about with an effort. Eileen's face was
pale, it was strained. She wheeled abruptly so that he might not
see her expression and went up the steps into the car. Overmile
trotted across the street and joined Peace, and the three of them
found a place in the coach.</p>

<p>Overmile said cheerfully: "Never saw so much good liquor busted
in my life. Them engines has been well christened."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peace. The Corinne train started with a sudden jerk
of coupling and clattered across Promontory's switch points. Eileen
was a small, huddled shape in the seat. She wouldn't look at him
and she had nothing to say. Peace bent forward, rubbing his palms
together in an endless circle. It was, he understood, always going
to be like this. She would remember Nan and her lips would go pale
as they were now, and her eyes would grow wholly dark. Memory would
never let her alone.</p>

<p>They came into Corinne an uncomfortable hour later and got off.
They stood here a little while, the other passengers crowding by
them and going down the short street leading to the heart of town.
Overmile's quick eyes roved around, keenly alive to all that
happened.</p>

<p>Peace said to Eileen: "I'll take you home."</p>

<p>Eileen said, "Never mind," and went rapidly away. Peace stood
still, embarrassed from knowing Overmile's glance touched him, He
watched her turn into Main Street and disappear.</p>

<p>Overmile drawled, "I guess I'll go roll up my extra pair of
socks. There's a Cheyenne train out of here pretty soon." He left
Peace abruptly, going around the depot.</p>

<p>The commissary building, where Peace's quarters were, lay
farther along the track, reached by a short cut through one of
Corinne's back streets. Peace took that street, hands plunged
deeply mto his pockets, his shoulders swung down. Half the shacks
and tents and flimsy frame buildings of Corinne were already
deserted; and on this street, a semi-emptiness oppressed him. For a
little while the queen city had boomed, lifted to giddy heights, by
the full-blooded tide of the railroad builders. And now that tide,
rolling higher and higher all the way from Fremont, had reached its
crest on a barren Utah summit and had burst with a last roar.
Leaving silence behind. Leaving hollowness behind.</p>

<p>A special train whistled down from Promontory and went by in the
direction of Ogden. Faro Evans' two-story house stood gaunt and
unlovely ahead of him. A woman came from a tent. She said, "Hello
there, Mr. Peace."</p>

<p>He tramped stolidly on, not answering. Long Tom, junk dealer,
came from another house and threw a mattress on his wagon standing
by, and climbed up to the seat. Peace noted the sorry condition of
Long Tom's horses and then was deep in his own thoughts again.
There was a sense women possessed he didn't understand. Their eyes
saw things a man concealed in the deepest corners of his mind. He
had buried a memory of Nan.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bucko."</p>

<p>It was a voice that crashed through his thinking like a bullet.
It stopped him that quickly. Before his lifting eyes had reached
their mark he knew whose voice it was and knew what it meant; and
then his eyes reached a second-story window of Faro Evans' and met
the round, cold muzzle of a rifle. Behind it lay Al Brett's
grinning face.</p>

<p>He stood rooted, every thought and every instinct in him
thinning down to a wild, bitter hope of survival. Placed as he was
in the middle of the street; with no possibility of making a sudden
rush into a doorway and with no chance of escaping that gun's fatal
aim, he realized he was utterly trapped. He had his hands in his
pockets. He let them remain there. He stood with one foot advanced
and held that position. Al Brett's acid smiling never changed.</p>

<p>"Can't you think of anything, Bucko?" he jeered. "You're on your
feet and you carry a gun. That's the way I said I'd take you."</p>

<p>Beyond the left-hand line of houses another special rolled down
from Promontory, eastward bound. Peace listened to that noise fade
out in the direction of Ogden. Then he heard a wagon groaning up
from behind him&mdash;Long Tom's wagon pulled by those two gaunt
horses.</p>

<p>Brett said: "I wouldn't leave you behind me in a thousand years.
Remember the tongue lashin' you gave me at Bryan? Think of that,
Bucko, when I send you to Hell. That's the thing I'm killin' you
for." He quit talking to Peace. The muzzle of the gun waggled and
he sent a curt order to the approaching Long Tom. "Turn that thing
around."</p>

<p>Long Tom, Peace guessed, was ten feet behind him; and the man
seemed not to hear Brett, whose voice snapped like a whiplash.
"Turn around."</p>

<p>Peace said: "Who's there with you, Al?"</p>

<p>Brett's attention slid back to Peace Instantly, his shoulders
moved and he started to speak, and didn't. The wagon kept moving.
Listening with an attention that squeezed him dry. and flattened
his muscles he estimated the team with less than two paces to his
rear and bound to pass him on the slide that would mask Brett's
aim. Long Tom hadn't heard&mdash;and never would hear. The man was
stone deaf. Peace observed Brett's chin lift from the gunstock. The
muzzle swung off again&mdash;aimed at Long Tom; and at that instant
Peace, throwing his life in the strength of his guess, wheeled and
saw the near horse of the team coming up. He took one step against
the horse. Brett's rifle roared out, the off horse grunted and
dropped to his knees and Long Tom, emitting a whining cry, fell
from the seat in a long dive.</p>

<p>The far horse was down, threshing in its harness; the near horse
stood still. Peace threw himself straight at the doorway of Faro
Evans' house. Brett was pumping a new shell into his gun; he beard
Brett yell, "Cordray&mdash;Cordray," and a revolver's solid slug
smashed the doorway casing as he reached that aperture and ran
inside.</p>

<p>Cordray, stationed in some opposite building, kept throwing his
shots in; they were wide of Peace, who now rushed along a narrow
flight of stairs toward the upper landing. Brett's boots stamped
across the floor up there. A door slammed, and after that another
gun began to join Cordray's firing out in the street.</p>

<p>Peace reached the hall, to face a row of closed doors. The
furthest one led into the room overlooking the street, where Brett
was. That much he knew. He jerked himself down the hall, lifting
his gun and driving a pair of bullets at the door's lock. He
shattered it and stepped aside, and struck it with his extended
foot, throwing it back. There was no more sound in the street.</p>

<p>Brett faced him across the threshold of the room&mdash;thin and
pale, yellow fury ablaze in his eyes. He had dropped his rifle; he
held a revolver half risen in his arm.</p>

<p>"Bucko," he said in as wicked a tone as a man could utter, "you
got the devil's luck," and snapped his gun up for a shot.</p>

<p>Peace's bullet caught him like that, driving all the life out of
him. He was dead before he fell, his lips white and wide and still
unmerciful. He buckled at the knees and at the shoulders, and
dropped with a force that ran a dismal echo all through the
house.</p>

<p>Overmile's voice was in the stairway. "Peace!"</p>

<p>Peace said softly, "All right, Leach, all right," and turned to
see his partner swing at the landing and come on. Overmile's breath
whistled out of him. He looked in at the room, at the dead Al
Brett. And an expression wholly and abysmally savage slowly faded
from his face. He turned to catch Peace's eye.</p>

<p>"Sure," he muttered, "I heard the shootin' start. That was
Cordray across the street. He emptied his gun. I never fired at
him. He just died. His heart just quit. Good God, Frank!"</p>

<p>"I guess," said Peace, "that closes the book," and went back
down the stairs. Out in the street he had a look at one dead horse
and a driver with a broken arm.</p>

<p>Long Tom stared down at his sleeve. He said, "Hell," and walked
unsteadily off.</p>

<p>Peace unhitched the remaining horse from the wagon and let it
go. He bent his head back and forth to ease the strange stiffness
in it. He patted all his pockets automatically, searching for his
pipe. A train, coming down from Promontory, whistled for
Corinne.</p>

<p>"That's my train," said Overmile.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Overmile cleared his throart. "I guess this is one of the things
I won't forget. Bein' here, I mean, to see Brett dead and Cordray
dead. It's my idea of a good end. I recall what Phil Morgan once
said. He wanted to see you win out. Well, I'm seein' it. It'll be
damned good to remember."</p>

<p>"Leach," grunted Peace, "it's tough."</p>

<p>"Damn you, Frank&mdash;you're a hard man to forget!"</p>

<p>"I'll be in Texas," said Peace. "If you ever get tired of
Laramie Plains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Overmile quietly. "We've had our fun, kid, It
wouldn't come again for us. These things happen just once in a
man's life. My time's come to settle down and recollect the old
times that was. I couldn't live in another end of track town
without recallin' a lot of people I was pretty fond of."</p>

<p>He put out his hand, smiling in a way that was crooked and dim
and impermanent. Peace took it; and they stared at each other a
long moment, having no words to say. Overmile pulled suddenly back
and whirled; and traveled down the street at a charging gait. The
train was ringing into Corinne. At a far corner, just before he
swung out of sight; he stopped and looked behind him and threw up
his long arm&mdash;and then vanished.</p>

<p>Peace went on toward the commissary building, walking with his
feet wide apart. His head wasn't clear and strange sounds and
impressions kept superimposing themselves one upon another. Of
Brett falling, of the kickback of the gun in his own fist, of the
fragile Rose's faint and sad smile, of Overmile's deeply felt
words&mdash;of all these and many more. They made a pattern of two
years of his life&mdash;without form, and without significance. He
came to his own small room in the commissary building and entered
it.</p>

<p>Eileen Oliver stood there, waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said. "Frank."</p>

<p>He was still a little stupid, his mind alternately bright and
dark. He said, "What?"</p>

<p>She had been crying; and her face now was pointed and starved.
She held her shoulders back.</p>

<p>"I don't want half of a man's heart, Frank. I saw how you looked
at Nan Normandy this afternoon. You couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"Eileen," he said, "let's forget that."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I knew all this back at Bear Town. But I
thought you had made up your mind. And I thought I could be happy
with whatever I got from you. But when you looked at her today I
saw how it would be with us. No matter how you might hide it it
would always be there. And both of us would have that ghost between
us. We would die slowly."</p>

<p>She pulled her head up and came to him, a remote glow in her
eyes bteaking the terrible shadows across her face. She held his
hands down; and she kissed him, "I would rather have just this
much. I think I can remember it without too much crying. Good-by,
my dear!"</p>

<p>He stood humbly by. He heard her walk along the side of the
commissary and then run. Afterward he sat down in a chair head bent
over, rubbing his big hands together.</p>

<p>Sometime later he jerked himself upright. A train whistled
across the town, and he looked at his watch and found it to be five
o'clock. He rose, making a complete circle of the
room&mdash;thinking of things that never had seemed possible, The
clanging of the train's bell came through the walls of the
commissary building&mdash;and suddenly he went out of the room.
When he reached the track he found a Promontory-bound work train
rolling, slowly away from the station. He made the caboose handrail
after a hard run.</p>

<p>It was six o'clock in Promontory, with a gustier wind stirring
off the festival bunting of the few remaining specials. A huge
party was in progress in Durant's private coach, all the car lights
shining out upon the platform when Peace passed by. Promontory's
street was quiet; and a crew of Irishmen were sledging down a few
last sections of track for through traffic. The California train
was on the main line, waiting to go. He swung aboard it and walked
through all the coaches, and get off at the head end. Twilight
dropped down, gray and gusty. He went around the corner of the
depot&mdash;and saw Nan sitting on a bench beside the building.</p>

<p>She heard his steps and looked up; and a quick breath came out
of her as she rose. She swayed against the station wall, and she
put her hands behind her&mdash;which was a gesture that took him
all the way back to the night in Benton, in her room.</p>

<p>He said: "Nan, I am free to ask you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She brought her hands forward. She looked at him with a long,
straining attention. She murmured, "I know&mdash;I know," and
lifted her face, showing him eyes bright with unshed tears.</p>

<p>He brought her to him with a quick sweep of his arms.</p>

<p>When he kissed her and felt the desperate hunger of her lips a
feeling raced through him like fire, tremendously shaking his mind.
She had this power over him, this way of lifting him to a wild, far
height, to touch him with the vague hints of a glory a man and a
woman might know. He had a strange, humble side thought then of
Eileen's dark cheeks turned hopeless and of the gentleness she had
touched his life with. It was a memory, he thought soberly, that
would never leave.</p>

<p>Nan murmured, "My dear, I thought I had lost life."</p>

<p>And that soft phrase brought him back to the fragrance and
gallantry of this woman. All that his dreams had fashioned was
here; she was all he could desire.</p>

<p>Bill Wallen, stumbling through the falling darkness, saw them.
He stood a moment, watching; and the moment turned him old. Finally
he swung away as quietly as he could.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he murmured, "I was asking for more than I had a
right to expect."</p>

<p>The California train's bell began to ring, and at last chugged
out of the station. Peace and Nan watched it go. Night swung down
on Promontory and the desert lay wild and empty.</p>
