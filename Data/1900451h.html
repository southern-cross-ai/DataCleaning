<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<p class="first">"ANTHONY!" Vivian Young made a laughing
surprised clutch at a tall figure stalking ahead of her down the
station platform.</p>

<p>The man turned sharply. At the sight of his fiancée he smiled
pleasantly, though a sharp observer would have said that there
was something in his eyes that suggested a man about to make the
best of a position not entirely to his liking.</p>

<p>"My dear girl!" he ejaculated warmly, "what brings you to
Macon? Did you get into the wrong train, or out of the right one,
or what?"</p>

<p>"I'm on my way to Cluny. Buried, neglected Cluny. The town
where the lace is made, and, less interesting to me, I guess, the
town where there are some ruins that must be seen in order to be
forgotten. I mean the ruins of that wonderful abbey about which
the Frenchman raved at dinner last night. You started him off by
asking him if he knew the place. But you didn't speak of coming
on here yourself."</p>

<p>"Nor you!" Sir Anthony Cross spoke easily, yet the very
swiftness of his reply suggested a hidden irritation.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I'm only marking time at Enghien with a sister!
You're supposed to be rushing back to London to summon board
meetings, and dismiss the president, I mean the prime minister,
and generally make very important things hum. Is this the way you
usually go back to England?"</p>

<p>"You can reach it <i>via</i> Macon," he said as lightly as
she.</p>

<p>Vivian was smiling up into his face. She was a very pretty
young woman, in spite of the fact that she looked clever.</p>

<p>"Sure. Just as you could round by Constantinople," she agreed
sweetly.</p>

<p>Again Anthony Cross smiled at her. Yet again there was that
faint hint in his face of a man not entirely pleased with
things.</p>

<p>"As with you," he began easily, "one might think that French
professor has fired me up to look at his town. I'm keen on
architecture, you know, and I ought to feel quite ashamed of
myself that I've never been to the place. But the idea of your
going there! Somehow one doesn't connect you with ruins."</p>

<p>"Why not? We all come to them some day," she spoke with the
gaiety of under twenty-five. "Besides, as an American, I dote on
anything we don't have over at home. If you're off for the same
place, why, we shall have the whole long day to ourselves. You
look charmed at the notion, Anthony, yet somehow I don't believe
you really like it."</p>

<p>She never called him Tony. One could not easily imagine any
one calling the man to whom she was speaking, to whom she was
engaged, by a nickname. For, though young looking, there was so
little of youth's softness in his face, that one suspected him of
being much older than he showed. He had, in fact, crossed the
forty line. Hard was the mouth, stubborn the jaw, obstinate the
nose, and his fine eyes could at times cleave like a flash of
lightning. He looked what he was, a man of high position, social
and mental. But for an indefinable air of being a man of affairs,
one would have guessed him a barrister.</p>

<p>"If so," he said rather slowly, "it's because I shan't be able
to see much of you, or of the remains of the great abbey either."
He looked at her meditatively before he went on:</p>

<p>"I suppose you're going back to Enghien tomorrow?"</p>

<p>It was at that little resort so near Paris that he and Vivian
had just got engaged. There in the hotel where her brother-in-law
and his wife had been staying, Anthony Cross and Vivian had
renewed an acquaintanceship made earlier on shipboard. She
nodded. "You too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No. I may be delayed some days. There's history to be read in
the stones of Cluny, I fancy&mdash;since it was made there once
upon a time." He spoke as one turning some other thought over in
his mind. Now he looked quickly down at her, as though he had
decided on his course of action.</p>

<p>"You know the real reason why I'm back in Europe just now," he
said in a low voice.</p>

<p>She nodded. She knew from him that there was a constant
leakage from the parcels of diamonds sent to Amsterdam by the
Diamond Combine in South Africa, of which Anthony Cross was one
of the directors. That great firm's detectives had been trying to
locate the leakage for months. They had decided that the master
mind was not in Amsterdam, nor in Holland, but probably in
France. Possibly in Paris. She knew, too, that Cross had left
Capetown to make further, and personal, inquiries in the
matter.</p>

<p>"Then, in confidence, I believe that in Cluny I may possibly
pick up a certain piece of information which I very much want to
get. Or rather, that something that I may learn from a man whom I
expect to meet there may settle definitely a point that ought to
be settled."</p>

<p>His jaw shut very tightly as he said this last. "And that's
the reason, dear, why I may not have been as delighted at the
thought of your coming to Cluny just now as I should otherwise
be. In reality, but again in strict confidence, mine is entirely
and simply a business visit. At which hotel have you engaged
rooms?"</p>

<p>She told him.</p>

<p>"I think, on the whole, it would be better if we do not meet.
I should in any case, of course, go to another hotel, but I'll
let you take this coming train out there alone, and go on later.
Sorry, Vivian, it's a rotten way to spend what might have been a
most delightful time together, but there's no help for it."</p>

<p>She did not in the least see the reason, or the need, for so
much mystery. But men have their own funny ways of doing
business, she decided.</p>

<p>"If I run across you in the street, I'll ask you the way to
the abbey in French," she promised gaily.</p>

<p>He smiled at that, genuinely this time.</p>

<p>"At any rate, our engagement has nothing to do with what takes
me to Cluny. And I want it kept free of it. It's too beautiful a
thing to drag into anything sordid."</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes with passion. It was a look that
showed him to be possessed of a side not to be guessed even from
a careful scrutiny of his very handsome but rather cold face.
"And that being so, it means, as I said, that we'd better not
meet at all. Cluny's a tiny place. Only some four thousand souls,
and I may have to be there for some time."</p>

<p>The explanation explained nothing to Vivian. But if men were
odd when it came to business, they were still odder when it came
to sentiment. And, therefore, when both were mixed, they were
oddest of all.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps I'll put off going there for a couple of days," he
said ruminatingly. "Yes, I rather think I will&mdash;" He stood a
moment in silence.</p>

<p>"You yourself are in no danger?" she asked suddenly. After
all, detecting diamond-stealers was dangerous work.</p>

<p>"Not in the least! Here's your train."</p>

<p>He helped her in. The engine pulled out. He looked very grave,
very little the lover as he stood there, hat in hand, and yet she
felt certain that he was deeply stirred, and trying to conceal
the fact.</p>

<p>By what? He was very hard to stir, very hard even to know. And
on that came the reflection that he would have had to own a
singularly easy character for her to have plumbed it already.</p>

<p>It was only two months since their first meeting. Only a
fortnight since their second. True, they had seen a great deal of
each other during the passage out from Capetown. Terrific storms
had kept the other passengers in their bunks. Officers and the
doctor were too busy to have a moment to spare. Anthony had saved
her from a rough-and-tumble with a wave when she first came out
on deck, tight-reefed in oilskins borrowed from a stewardess.
Neither had the faintest idea of who the other was. She had taken
him at sight for a much younger man, and had treated him, as
Vivian did treat young men, very cavalierly. He had responded in
kind. They had quarreled. But they were literally flung together
half a dozen times a day. And, in spite of themselves, they grew
first to tolerate, then to like, each other. When he told her his
name, perhaps half-unconsciously expecting that it would impress
her, she treated him as carelessly as ever. And Sir Anthony was
considered one of the really great catches of the matrimonial
market. It was genuine carelessness too, he saw. Not assumed to
lead him on. Whether he were led on, or off, mattered very little
to Vivian. When he grasped that fact, he was attracted still more
strongly. Her prettiness, of course, had a great deal to do with
it, but it was not everything. Then came the night of the all-but
wreck in the hurricane. The ship was carrying a full load of
steerage passengers. There were many gallant souls on board, but
among them all, Anthony Cross stood out by his coolness and his
organizing power. He held the frightened steerage quiet, not at
the point of his automatic&mdash;though he had one in his
pocket&mdash;but by his own calm personality, and Vivian worked
among the women and babies as cheerful, as undismayed, as he.
Save for the suffering it caused, she seemed to positively enjoy
the danger, and Cross suddenly felt that his life would be
incomplete without her. There was something wild and free in the
girl that roused the hunter in him. If they lived, he told
himself, he would capture her.</p>

<p>He followed her to France, to Enghien-les-bains, and found her
in a moment of great depression. An unusual place for Vivian
Young to be. She was a journalist by profession and by real
preference.</p>

<p>She loved to watch the world with those pretty eyes of hers
that were so unexpectedly shrewd, and she loved to shape what she
had seen into words. To create an image of her thoughts, see it
grow, and watch it stand itself, upright and whole. But she was
not making enough to do more than support herself, and at Enghien
she learnt from a sister, who prided herself on speaking the
truth, that in the past, she had been dependent on her brother-in-law, not, as she had imagined, living on the money left by
their parents. Her brother-in-law was an American doctor
practicing in Paris, and none too well off. Vivian felt that she
must pay him back as soon and as fast as she could.</p>

<p>That evening Anthony Cross proposed. Vivian did not
consciously take him as a means of paying what she felt to be a
debt of honor. She was much more impressed by him than she let
him guess. By him, himself, not by his position, or his name.
There was something great in the man as she knew. And she divined
also, with that sure instinct of hers, that under his calm, even
cold exterior there was flame.</p>

<p>There was flame in her too. That night he all but won her. She
believed that he had. But ever since then, she had felt more and
more certain that he had not, which meant that he never would.
For one thing, he was too old for her. For another&mdash;but what
was the use. She had promised to marry him. Still, an engagement
is but a trial run of the car, as it were. It's very purpose is
to find out how one likes it.</p>

<p>At the first station beyond Macon, a young woman, also an
American by the look of her, hurried towards the train where she
sat. The newcomer was making for another compartment, but Vivian,
at sight of her, flung the door open.</p>

<p>"Edith! Edith! Come in here!" she called.</p>

<p>The newcomer swung herself in and the two kissed
affectionately.</p>

<p>"My dearest Vi! Why, what brings you to this part of
Europe...and just when we're off for Switzerland...I do call that
real mean of things. We only started this morning. Adolphe left
some papers behind him at Clermain that he must have. Adolphe's
my husband, you know."</p>

<p>She threw in the explanation as though referring to the
cat.</p>

<p>"We have a villa there all among the vineyards. But how just
too frightfully maddening that you should be so close to us now.
The house is shut up, or I should insist on carrying you off.
Where are you making for?"</p>

<p>"Cluny." It was the first word that Vivian had been able to
slip in. That had always been the way with Edith Metcalf as she
had been in the convent at Paris, where they both had been sent
to learn French. Edith de Montdore as she was now. Vivian
remembered hearing that she had married a French wine-grower and
that the couple lived near Dijon.</p>

<p>"Cluny? Don't tell me, Vivian Young, that you know the
vamp?"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my dear girl, I've never heard of her. I'm on
the way to Cluny for the purpose of self-education. Early
Christian churches&mdash;wonderful abbey&mdash;marvelous abbot's
palace and so on...But this sounds much more in my line. Who is
the woman? Does she vamp at Cluny? Or where you live?"</p>

<p>"At Cluny. I bet I should move if she came to Clermain,"
laughed Edith. "She's staying with her husband at a house there
owned by a man we know. A Frenchman. But an awfully nice
fellow."</p>

<p>"Staying with her husband? Where's the vamping then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's a subconscious one, child. She looks as meek as
Moses, and as quiet as Lazarus before he was raised from the
dead. But all the men rave about her. Oh, Adolphe too! One of the
reasons I decided on going away for a bit. I loathe Switzerland
in a motor. So many roads you can't go over. But anything's
better than the vamp. She's lips like a darkey's, and hair like
one too, though it's red, and she's no complexion whatever. Yet
Adolphe says she's a Rossetti, and a wonderful type. Don't let
your Anthony have a look at her. The best of wishes to you both
on your engagement, by the way. I did write them, but allow me to
embrace you, as they say here."</p>

<p>Edith Montdore did so, without a pause in her chatter.</p>

<p>"Say, you have done well for yourself! And what a
splendiferous ring!"</p>

<p>Vivian was carrying her left-hand glove, a fancy of the
moment. On her third finger was a great clouded sapphire, a Cross
heirloom. Though not otherwise particularly superstitious, Vivian
had a dislike to that fault in that particular gem. She said as
much.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I agree with you. Though the setting's
perfectly lovely. I told Mrs. Brownlow&mdash;that's the vamp's
name, by the way&mdash;about clouded sapphires meaning a death in
one's circle&mdash;or rather, only I told her that it meant a
loss, for she has some wonderful stones, but two are a bit dark.
And within the month after I told her, she lost sapphires and
all. I believe the thief got about five thousand dollars worth of
jewels off her altogether. I still reckon in dollars, you see,
the exchange bobs about too much. My, she was mad! She was taking
them to Paris to have them re-set. That sort of makes it doubly
annoying. They were only insured for about half their value, it
seems. That was her husband's doing."</p>

<p>"What's he like?" Vivian asked. She was quite willing to be
chattered to.</p>

<p>"I always thought him a brainless, boneless, sort of creature,
until I met a woman the other day who knew them years ago out in
China&mdash;he's something to do with silk. And this woman told
me a story that makes me wonder if he's such a weasel as he
looks. It seems that out there all the men fell for Mrs.
Brownlow, same as they do here. And one young fellow in
particular went wild over her. So wild that Mr. Brownlow turned
him out of the house one evening. And next morning the boy was
found drowned in the river!"</p>

<p>"But what has that to do with the husband&mdash;I mean, I
don't see&mdash;" Vivian wrinkled her smooth forehead.</p>

<p>"Oh, but the young man had a brother who wrote to the British
Consul that Mr. Brownlow must have shoved him in, Mr. Brownlow
was all but prosecuted&mdash;so this woman said. Only there
wasn't enough evidence. She herself firmly believed that he had
done it. So did most of the people out there. That's why the
Brownlows left finally. Thrilling, isn't it! I tell you that
story made all the difference as to how I look at Mr. Brownlow
now!" Apparently it had greatly increased her respect for the
man. And Vivian burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"But surely they're not staying at Cluny year out, year in?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Pretty nearly," Edith Montdore said gloomily. "That's why
we're off now. We weren't going for another month. But that woman
gets on my nerves. Clermain is only some six miles from Cluny,
and we're always meeting, and she makes me look, and feel, like a
picture on a cigarette box. Frankly I'm in flight. You see, this
Monsieur Pichegru&mdash;that's the name of the man they're
staying with&mdash;runs his house, Villa Porte Bonheur, as a sort
of paying-guest house. I believe he lost his money for a
time&mdash;something went wrong with his vineyards&mdash;so he
started this, and keeps it up because he likes it. He belongs to
an awfully good family and knows every one for miles around. He's
a duck, but the only thing is, he won't take maids or valets with
people. He says that he hasn't the rooms to spare for them, and
that they upset his own servants."</p>

<p>"I should be lost without a maid!" Vivian said in mock
distress.</p>

<p>"You'll have to have one as Lady Cross!"</p>

<p>Vivian nodded. The prospect did not allure her in the least.
There was a short pause, then Edith Montdore babbled on:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Pichegru is unmarried, and at his age that means he
isn't going to marry. By the way, he's giving a costume dance,
masked too, this Saturday. Every one is going. I was, of course,
only my frock turned out to be a ghastly failure. Lovely in
itself but, my! I looked so homely in it when it came home, that
I promptly developed a heat rash. Suppressed. It seems you can
have a suppressed rash. So I have it. The doctor has told my
husband that it would only get better with change of air. It
has&mdash;already." She chuckled gleefully. "Still, when Adolphe
left those papers behind him, I insisted on being the one to
fetch them. Oh, I'm only joking, but really that woman is the
sort you read of." She meant "that you see on the films." Edith
Montdore never opened a book&mdash;not even a novel. "You know,
the kind that set all the men raving with one look."</p>

<p>The ticket collector came in. Mrs. Montdore had no ticket. She
was sure that she had dropped it in the corridor. There was not
room for more than two of them to hunt. Vivian sat on in the
compartment. She was thinking. Vaguely at first, now with
certitude came the idea that she had heard the name of Brownlow
before. And recently. Quite recently. At the dinner last night
when she had first heard of the existence of Cluny. Quickly, with
that speed of thought which can flash a whole series of sights
and sounds on the screen of memory at once, she seemed to be
hearing Anthony Cross ask the French professor of archeology, who
was one of the guests at her sister's table, "Is Cluny worth a
visit, do you think?"</p>

<p>That had led to an account of the little town, and of what can
still be seen there. A glowing account. Vivian, in swift
retrospect, remembered now wondering a little that Cross, though
quite an antiquarian himself, had not asked one question except
about the state of the roads, the lie of the houses. And
afterwards she had heard him step up to the other again, and say,
even more quietly than usual, "You know Cluny well?"</p>

<p>"Very well. My brother is the <i>directeur</i> of its school
of arts and crafts. I have just come away from the town."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Did you by any chance meet an Englishman there of the
name of Brownlow?"</p>

<p>Yes, Vivian was certain that that had been the name murmured
so softly by Anthony last night.</p>

<p>The Frenchman had not, and the talk was at once changed. Funny
the way one rarely hears a new name without hearing it a second
time very soon afterwards! Vivian thought. But the entrance of
her friend and the ticket, properly found and clipped, brought
her back to the present.</p>

<p>"Say, Vi, I wish you could have a look at the vamp," Edith
said, reseating herself and taking up the conversation where she
had left off, as though it were a piece of knitting. "You're such
a wonderful judge of character from one look at a face. Or you
used to be. I sure would like to know where that woman
belongs&mdash;with us hens, or out among the hawks. I know what!
Go to Villa Porte Bonheur for a few days. Monsieur Pichegru won't
take ordinary passing tourists, but he'll take any friend of
ours."</p>

<p>"His house may be full," Vivian objected.</p>

<p>"It never is. He only has enough people nowadays to keep him
from feeling lonely."</p>

<p>"But I'm intending to stay in Cluny for merely the one night,"
Vivian pointed out.</p>

<p>"But, why?" her friend asked. "Cluny really is charming. Why
not stay for the dance on Saturday? This is Thursday."</p>

<p>"And go in my dressing-gown as 'A lady surprised by a fire?'"
Vivian asked. "I'm a traveler, my child, not a bride with all her
trousseau to choose from."</p>

<p>"Wear my new dress!" Edith pleaded. "I'll send it on to you.
And we're very much the same figure. Besides it's the sort of
frock that would fit any one. And though it doesn't suit me, it's
a dream of cream and gold. Just your colors. 'Lady into Fox' is
what it's supposed to represent. Adolphe designed it himself from
some funny book or other. You would look a duck in it!"</p>

<p>"You mean a fox, surely!"</p>

<p>"Now, don't keep on joking!" Edith Montdore was really in
earnest. "I want you to promise me to have a good look at the
vamp, and give me your opinion. It'll be unbiased, you see. And
mine can't be. And yet I really do want to hear what you think of
her. Oh, Vi, why not? Monsieur Pichegru charges no more than the
hotels do. You told me that Sir Anthony is going back to England,
and that, until you joined him in September, you were just going
to keep on staying at Enghien. That's a fortnight off. Why not
put in two or three days down here instead? I'll get the frock
when I go for the papers&mdash;it's still in its box&mdash;and
send it off to you, to wait at the railway station until you have
it fetched. And I'll telephone Monsieur Pichegru as soon as I get
home&mdash;we're one station short of Cluny&mdash;you will, won't
you?"</p>

<p>Once more Vivian laughed. How like Edith all this rush was!
But she promised to think over the idea. It would depend on
whether she liked the look of Cluny or not. When she saw, lying
among the green Cevennes hills, a little gray town with spires
and towers rising against the trees in a charming picture, she
fell in love with the quiet nook. There were vineyards, and
meadows, and a splashing stream rushing down the valley.</p>

<p>Clear of the station, she asked her way to the Villa Porte
Bonheur. The name had stuck. Was it not tempting fate to give a
house a name like that?</p>

<p>The villa, painted ivory, was one of the prettiest in the
place. And the garden was a vision of pink roses and blue
delphiniums. It was the garden that did it. At first. But the
real reason that made her press the front door bell was a face,
of which she caught a glimpse as she walked the winding drive
towards the house. It was a woman's face, bending over an
embroidery-stand under a tree. For a second Vivian stared, then
she turned off down a little side path. That face! She knew quite
well where she had seen a photograph of it. It was a very unusual
face. Adolphe Montdore was right. It was the true Rossetti type.
Inert to everything except the call of the senses, though for
that very reason beauty-loving. And the photograph of it that she
had seen, had been in the fingers of Anthony Cross only some
three days ago. She had come on him suddenly standing staring at
it. Lost to the world. At her touch he would have pocketed it,
but she had caught his hand.</p>

<p>"Not on your life, young man! It's a picture of your mother,
isn't it?" He had laughed, yet in the half-unwilling fashion of
one who is annoyed by a sense of humor obtruding on what is not
really funny in the least.</p>

<p>"No. She's a problem&mdash;a problem that belongs to the
past." He now spoke very gravely. "Please don't ask me to tell
you about her."</p>

<p>"Because I won't," his eye had said.</p>

<p>Vivian had changed the subject, biting back a retort that the
problem out of the past had a most modern frock on. And now here
was the original of that portrait&mdash;and of that dress. This
must be the vamp of Edith Montdore's outpourings. There could not
be two women with faces like that in Cluny&mdash;in Villa Porte
Bonheur. Something stirred in Vivian. It was anger. Anthony Cross
had told her frankly the evening when he asked her to marry him,
or apparently frankly, that there had been one woman in his life,
in his heart, who had owned it completely for many years. Even
though she had been married, and had sent him away from her, his
passion had gone so deep that it had been beyond his power to
uproot for many a year. But that now it was a thing of the past.
Had been of the past for some time.</p>

<p>But this woman, sitting looking down at her embroidery with a
slow, faint, oddly waiting look, a look that somehow stirred the
imagination, was not of the past. She was of the present. And
suddenly Vivian made up her mind to stay at Porte Bonheur if
there were room for her. To stay and see whether Anthony Cross's
visit were in any way connected with that face instead of missing
diamonds. True, he had only asked the Frenchman about the
husband&mdash;for Vivian was certain that here, close to her, sat
Mrs. Brownlow&mdash;and Anthony had spoken to herself just now,
as though only duty were taking him to the little town. But,
Vivian remembered suddenly a lightly flung quip of his on board
ship. "Oh, yes, it is always necessary to tell the <i>truth</i>.
But it isn't always necessary to <i>tell</i> the truth."</p>

<p>It would indeed be an odd conjunction if it were mere chance
that his inquiries into the stolen diamonds and the woman of his
past&mdash;"the problem"&mdash;problem, very likely, because she
had preferred her husband to him. Vivian thought cynically and
irately&mdash;both met here in tiny Cluny. Vivian was not fond of
coincidences in a novel and she did not believe in them in real
life. And, then, that insistence that he should be left entirely
to himself, like any other unattached man...</p>

<p>It was with a very determined step that Vivian swung round,
walked up to the front door, and rang the bell. She sent in a
card of Edith Montdore's, on which that young woman had scribbled
an introduction.</p>

<p>Monsieur Pichegru came down at once into the cold gray
drawing-room&mdash;one of those typically French drawing-rooms
that look chilly even on the hottest day. He was a pleasant-faced, elderly man with the alert, vigorous look of so many of
his race. Edith had duly telephoned, and he pressed Vivian to
stay at the villa for at least one night, and as many more as she
could manage. The terms were very moderate for the comfort
provided. He explained, as he showed her around, that he had
injured his shoulder a little while ago while shooting rabbits,
thanks to a young gun-bearer's brilliant idea of resting the gun
that he was reloading on the wet clay ground, with the result
that the barrel was blocked and the gun exploded. Monsieur
Pichegru rightly thought himself very lucky to have got off with
only a bruised shoulder and neck tendons. He usually, at this
time of the year, had his house full of people who wanted a day
at the birds, but now, with one exception, the villa only held
some quiet people who, like herself, were interested in the ruins
to be found in Cluny.</p>

<p>Vivian finally chose a charming bedroom looking over the old
abbey gardens. At dinner she met the rest of the guests. They
appeared to be very usual.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow showed on closer acquaintance to be a very soft-spoken graceful Frenchwoman of approximately thirty-five. Unlike
Edith Montdore, Vivian thought her very beautiful, and very
finished. Though it was a type that repelled as well as attracted
her. But Mrs. Brownlow seemed very gentle and kind. As for the
husband, he appeared to be a silent, quiet, obliging little man.
Remembering the tale passed on her, she smiled. It would have to
be a very Eastern imagination indeed, she thought, that could
picture him drowning his wife's admirer. Vivian thought that he
was distinctly proud of her. And they seemed devoted to each
other. So much for gossip, she reflected.</p>

<p>There were three young men in the house. Two friends called
respectively, Smith and Lascelles. They seemed to Vivian rather
superior beings, at least in their own estimation. Smith was in a
crack cavalry regiment and was rather fussy over the fact that
just now his host could not accompany him shooting, and that two
friends of Monsieur Pichegru's, big bankers from Lyons, to whom
he had been promised introductions, had not yet come to their
country houses near by. Lascelles, Vivian learned, was a master
in a smart preparatory school. He had the Cambridge manner to
excess, and his account of the geological finds that dot what he
called the Burgundian Passage, which once linked the Channel and
the Mediterranean, was quite beyond her.</p>

<p>The two young men seemed only mildly interested in Mrs.
Brownlow. Unlike the third young fellow, the possessor of ears
like jug handles and great red hands and the name of Tibbitts,
who was clearly her abject slave.</p>

<p>After dinner, Vivian sent down to the station for the box left
for her by train. It was there. And with its arrival, she felt
that she had definitely committed herself to at least a stay of
over the week-end.</p>

<p>As to what Anthony would think of it&mdash;she did not greatly
care. She would, of course, strictly keep to her promise if they
met. But would they meet? That was the interesting point. If he
really were coming because of those thefts...</p>

<p>She felt a growing uncertainty as to what Anthony would do,
and even as to what she herself might do, in the next few days.
It struck her that possibly Edith Montdore might not obtain as
unbiased an opinion of Mrs. Brownlow as she expected.</p>

<p>Had Vivian loved the man, the position would have been
intolerable. But as it was, she confessed with some malice that
not for a long time had she looked forward to anything more than
she did to his arrival in Cluny.</p>

<p>Altogether, her stay in Villa Porte Bonheur promised to be
most interesting. But she decided that it would be as well to
start an article or two for her old paper. Very probably the next
week would see her once more with nothing in front of her but her
own earnings. And a very pleasant prospect too, she thought it.
Even the "desolate freedom of the wild ass," has its points. At
least it is freedom, and if you are a wild ass, that alone, not
the warmed stable, nor the fenced field, calls to you.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the afternoon after Vivian Young's
arrival. The garden of Villa Porte Bonheur lay drowsing in the
August heat which was robbing even the flowers of perfume and
color. The very hills seemed to fling the light back into the
valley, as though it were molten metal too hot to hold. Closed
were the windows, empty the summer-house, deserted the tennis
courts.</p>

<p>A man pushed open the iron gate, shut it, and looked about
him. When he was near the house itself, he studied it
attentively. He seemed to be registering the position of all the
doors and windows, even of the chimneys, with his cool, light
eyes. Then he walked up to the door and knocked. Could he see Mr.
Smith?</p>

<p>He spoke in very fair French, but with an accent that
bewildered the butler, who answered with a sleepy:</p>

<p><i>"Monsieur désire?"</i></p>

<p>"To see Mr. Smith," the visitor repeated clearly. He handed in
a card. "Take that to the gentleman, and say that I've come to
make some further inquiries about the money that Mr. Davidson
lost in the express up to Paris a fortnight ago."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The butler became all interest. He showed the caller
into a room.</p>

<p>"I'm right, am I not?" asked the young man in a friendly way.
"A couple of Monsieur Pichegru's guests lost their belongings two
weeks ago in the <i>train de luxe</i> between Macon and Paris,
did they not? A Mrs. Brownlow lost some valuable jewels. And a
Mr. Davidson lost a thousand pounds in money? While Mr. Smith and
Mr. Tibbitts, who went by the same train, lost nothing?"</p>

<p>"Correct, monsieur. The losses nowadays in sleepers are enough
to make one thankful that one travels third class! Monsieur is
connected with the inquiry?"</p>

<p>There was a certain alertness about the visitor's face and
carriage and a shabbiness about his clothes that made the butler
take him for a newspaper man.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a reporter. Mr. Davidson is connected with my
paper. He has entrusted me with the task of clearing up how the
money was taken." He seated himself in an arm-chair, which seemed
chosen instantly and at random, but which was the most
comfortable one in the room.</p>

<p>The butler went in search of Mr. Smith. That young man was
taking a siesta, and looked at the pastboard with great
disfavor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackay. <i>Aberdeen Mail</i>." The last was written in
one corner, with the words, "Called for an interview about Mr.
Davidson's loss in the Paris train."</p>

<p>"Tell him I know nothing whatever about the affair." Mr.
Smith's French was exceedingly good. "Any inquiries he has to
make should be put to the police. They have all the information
and are handling the case. In other words, Honoré, as far as I am
concerned&mdash;throw him out! I don't intend to be bothered with
reporters."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith relapsed sleepily on to his pillows again.</p>

<p>Tea was at five&mdash;a true summer tea, with iced drinks and
sugary cakes and salad sandwiches.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow superintended with the grace that seemed native
to her. As the only woman&mdash;up till now&mdash;in the villa,
she naturally played hostess for Monsieur Pichegru. Everyone
appeared to like the Brownlows, Vivian thought. And, indeed, they
seemed to belong to the pleasant, unassuming type of people whom
one so often meets, never saying anything worth remembering, and
yet who are themselves remembered when brilliant wits are
forgotten.</p>

<p>After tea came tennis. Some French neighbors drifted in, but
Vivian and Mr. Tibbitts very wisely withdrew and played by
themselves.</p>

<p>"Game!" she called finally, with the snap of victory in her
voice; "and set!"</p>

<p>Tibbitts seemed to take his beating philosophically. He was a
tall, weedy youth who yet conveyed a suggestion of hidden
strength in the set of his sloping, narrow shoulders and the hang
of his long arms. He had a weak face, and dressed in the very
height of French fashion. Even here in Cluny, Tibbitts alone
seemed to have no old clothes, no hats or shoes that only long
affection saved from being discarded. His very flannels shrieked
of their first month's wear. Vivian had met his type before, she
thought; the sons of the newly-rich, with all the blemishes, but
none of the brains and pluck, that had given father his rise in
the world.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm no good at games," Tibbitts said now in his
Cockney voice.</p>

<p>"Sure," Vivian agreed heartily; "I am bad, but thou art worse,
brother. I guess Mademoiselle Lenglen would wonder what the game
was, if she watched us. But there are still two balls missing.
And new ones too."</p>

<p>"It's about time to change, isn't it?" the young man asked
doubtfully. "I thought I heard the bell, I mean the gong, go some
time ago. Whereabouts do you think the balls are?"</p>

<p>"One, your's, was apparently off on a non-stop flight to my
home town in Texas. Try over there, while I hunt here in these
bushes."</p>

<p>She stepped back swiftly. As she did so, she felt beneath her
heel, not yielding earth, but the very firm toe of a very stout
shoe. Instead of a scream, she made a swift and amazingly sure
lunge. She caught at a man's tightly-buttoned coat, felt her hand
struck off with a jerk, and then the branches around her swished
and eddied. She had seen nothing. Standing listening, she heard
the swishing pass to the other side, then silence. No one was
visible as she ran out on to the grass and looked about her.</p>

<p>For fully two minutes Vivian stood staring, then she walked
slowly back to the house. The average woman would have run, but
this one walked almost reluctantly away, as though guided by
prudence, as though impulse would have sent her after that
unexplained figure.</p>

<p>From an open window came a contralto voice singing:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Let us get all the blue overhead,<br>

Let us soar like birds in their flight,<br>

For it's while we are here that the roses are red,<br>

It's after we're gone they are white.</p>

<br>

<p>Vivian had heard the song before, but not the voice. It was
evidently Mrs. Brownlow. There was something caressing and
passionate in it. The voice of a siren. It went well with Mrs.
Brownlow's face, while her manner&mdash;quiet but
indifferent&mdash;her way of speaking&mdash;cool though
kind&mdash;went with neither. So thought Vivian as she ran on to
her own room. She was in time for dinner. Most girls would have
been late, especially if, like herself, they had no maid with
them. But Vivian could hustle. One toss, and her tennis frock lay
on the floor. Another toss, a plunge, a splash or two, a rub
down, some more tosses, and she stood ready to go downstairs, her
curly hair still damp around the nape of her white neck.</p>

<p>They all went in to dinner in a cheery, unconventional group.
The two women first, the men following. Miss Young's seat faced
the window, and she looked out of it a good deal, and very
attentively.</p>

<p>"How have you been getting on with your history of Cluny, Mr.
Murgatroyd?" Mrs. Brownlow asked of the only elderly member of
the party. Mr. Murgatroyd sighed a little. He was a stout, short
man with a ludicrous resemblance to Pickwick.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I haven't done well today," he said
apologetically; "the sunshine was too much for me. And the
country-side too inviting."</p>

<p>"You have to be bored to work, don't you find it so?" Vivian
asked.</p>

<p>"You mean you've got to work to be bored," Tibbitts corrected
with a guffaw of startling loudness. Tibbitts was at his worst
seen indoors. He was the kind of young man who gets hats and
coats handed to him in the evening and is asked to call the car,
with subsequent abject apologies for the mistake. His voice, too,
fitted the nameless look about him of being a rank outsider.</p>

<p>"Ever tried it?" Smith asked with a supercilious yet measuring
stare.</p>

<p>For some reason or other Tibbitts seemed startled.</p>

<p>"N-no. I mean to say&mdash;I was speaking airily." And very
red in the face, he turned to Mrs. Brownlow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Murgatroyd was talking to Vivian. She had made
some remark about architecture, and then continued to watch the
gardens. Was that a shadow, or a man, far away facing her? When
she had finally decided that it was the shadow of a thick branch,
Mr. Murgatroyd appeared to be finishing a short lecture.</p>

<p>The professor was evidently nothing if not thorough. He did
his best to ensure that Miss Young should be able to recognize
the Cluny offshoot of Burgundian architecture whenever she should
meet it in later life. Advanced Romanesque it was, but he warned
her that, in his humble opinion, she would be making a great
mistake to call it pre-Gothic, though if she chose to refer to it
as Early Pointed&mdash;with the careful stipulation that she was
referring to Early Pointed on the continent&mdash;she would be
quite safe, he thought.</p>

<p>"It was inevitable that the Cluny Benedictines would evolve
their own peculiar architecture," he murmured finally, "since
their thoughts were peculiar. Their own. Original."</p>

<p>"You think thoughts can influence buildings?" their host asked
with a hearty laugh. His English was slow and labored. "The
architect's thoughts&mdash;yes&mdash;and the
brickmason's&mdash;oh, yes! But otherwise?"</p>

<p>"Buildings"&mdash;Mr. Murgatroyd looked across at
him&mdash;"are made of brick or stone or wood. Are they not? Of
thought manifestations, that is to say. And can, therefore, be
influenced by thought."</p>

<p>"Then, let's have a week of high thinking," Smith said
urgently; "and raise this ceiling for Monsieur Pichegru; he finds
it far too low."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd chuckled. But he maintained his position.</p>

<p>"Every thought creates," he repeated, "in us and around us.
And it creates in its own image. It draws to itself other
thoughts of like kind, therefore other manifestations of like
kind."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," broke in Tibbitts with the air of an
exhausted swimmer at last touching bottom with his toes. "I know
what you mean, Mr. Murgatroyd. Misfortunes never come singly. And
so on..."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd nodded a little curtly. Tibbitts was not a favorite
with him.</p>

<p>"Whatever causes one misfortune would be bound to cause
another would be a better way of stating it," he murmured. "Take
a criminal&mdash;I think that at the back of all our prison
systems is the unacknowledged certainty that an evil mind should
not be allowed at large to attract other evil minds. We hang a
murderer because he must, not he may, cause other murders. The
mind of a murderer will murder, in other words."</p>

<p>"It really comes to this," Monsieur Pichegru cut in, in his
careful English, and in the tone of a man who dislikes the
mysterious, "that talents for good or evil will draw to
themselves their own opportunities. I think we can all agree on
that?" Monsieur Pichegru had all the Frenchman's love of a
discussion at the dinner table. Not at lunch. The midday meal was
for the passing of light items of news or gossip, but with the
evening, the French spirit seems to expand and rejoice in
exercise.</p>

<p>"What do <i>I</i> draw to myself, professor?" Vivian asked
gaily, catching Murgatroyd's eye as he entirely agreed with their
host's condensed version of his idea.</p>

<p>"Opportunities for using your very remarkable quickness of
observation, I should say," was his reply. It surprised her. Here
was some one else who was quick too. "I should think you would
make a very successful newspaper correspondent, because by that
law of which we're talking, events of interest would be bound to
come your way, rather than the way of some duller person."</p>

<p>Vivian smiled a little as at a quaint phantasy, but on that
came the startling reflection that here <i>was</i> the problem
from Anthony Cross's past sitting beside Smith. Here, to the
town, if not to the villa where she was staying, Anthony Cross
was coming, perhaps on some errand of his own, perhaps really
brought here by the hunt for the diamond-stealers of which he had
spoken.</p>

<p>Here, where just before dinner she had herself had the
incident of the boot in the bushes on which she had stepped. And,
why&mdash;yes, she herself&mdash;why was she here? Not as an
ordinary tourist...</p>

<p>"Law?" Tibbitts bit off a chunk of peach and talked through
it. "You called it that before. I never heard of any such law.
Where is it?"</p>

<p>"It's the law by which, unless we ourselves deliberately bury
them, our gifts will surely get the chance to be used to their
best advantage. It's a law we do not yet understand. But then,
what do we understand?" The professor sighed.</p>

<p>"Nothing of what's been talked about just now," Tibbitts said
bluntly.</p>

<p>Every one laughed. He flushed a little and thrust out his weak
chin.</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Young, I've mended your bracelet for you." He
spoke loudly, in the tone of one who intended to show the rest
that there were some things he could do better perhaps than
they.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" Vivian's bracelet, one of the heavy kind
fashionable just now, had come undone during tennis, and had
refused to stay fastened. Tibbitts had volunteered to put it
right.</p>

<p>He now took it out of his pocket and held it out to her on the
palm of his large, red hand&mdash;the hand of a laboring man in
spite of its obvious acquaintance with soap and water.</p>

<p>It fastened perfectly. Thanking him, she snapped it shut.</p>

<p>"Talents, and opportunities to use them," Smith murmured
lazily, with that undertone of careless contempt in which he
always spoke to Tibbitts. "I didn't know you were a handy man,
Tibbitts. There should be plenty of work for you if your tastes
lie in that direction."</p>

<p>"I used to do metal work when I was a boy." Tibbitts looked
uncomfortable. "Arts-and-crafts classes, you know. No end fond of
it I was. That's where I got these weals on my palms."</p>

<p>"Just the lad for the garden roller," Smith said firmly.
"Monsieur Pichegru, get him to have a heart-to-heart talk with it
this evening."</p>

<p>Smith disliked Tibbitts, that much Vivian knew already.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow protested that Tibbitts and she were going to
feed some carp in the Abbotts' Pond. She said it gently enough,
yet Vivian was certain that she was not pleased with something.
Was it possible that she did not care for her fag to slave for
other people? If so, here was the first glimpse of one of the
vamp's characteristics that Vivian had seen.</p>

<p>"No, no," Monsieur Pichegru said promptly; "I use Mr. Tibbitts
for something better. Adrien, the chauffeur, thinks him a marvel.
He thinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who was that chap, a red-haired chap, who called here this
afternoon," Brownlow asked the table in general, apparently not
noticing that his host was speaking. "We met just outside the
gate?"</p>

<p>"A reporter. He wanted to see me about Davidson's lost money,"
Smith answered in his drawl that struck Vivian as so
affected.</p>

<p>"About my lost jewels, I hope, too," Mrs. Brownlow said
urgently.</p>

<p>"He only wrote on his card that he came about Davidson's
loss," Smith explained. "I didn't see him&mdash;why should I? I
told him to go to the police. They have all the facts. I loathe
reporters."</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't he tell about my jewels too in his paper?"
Mrs. Brownlow asked pathetically. She spoke perfect English, but
with a very pretty French regularity of accent. "The same thief
took both."</p>

<p>"The insurance company in London is investigating, you may be
sure," her husband reminded her. "They won't thank us to insert
articles in newspapers."</p>

<p>"But the things were only insured for half their value," she
said accusingly. "All your fault too. And, of course, no company
could be as keen on getting them back as I am. Do see if he won't
write up a description of my jewels too. Who did you say the man
was, Mr. Smith?"</p>

<p>"Name of Mackay. Scot evidently. Works on some Aberdeen
paper."</p>

<p>"Then you may be quite sure he won't work for nothing,"
Brownlow pointed out to his wife.</p>

<p>Vivian was listening intently. This talk of theft...And it was
on account of thefts that Anthony had said he was coming to
Cluny...Was it, after all, really business that was bringing him?
She had forgotten Edith Montdore's words about "the vamp's" lost
sapphires.</p>

<p>Monsieur Pichegru explained, in answer to her inquiry, that a
couple of weeks ago Mrs. Brownlow, another guest called Davidson
who had now left, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Tibbitts, had all four gone
up to Paris, taking the night Pullman at Macon. Mrs. Brownlow to
join her husband in the capital, and at the same time have some
jewelery re-set. Davidson to put some money into a tourist
agency. Smith to have a couple of merry days with some friend,
and Tibbitts to escort Mrs. Brownlow apparently; at least, so
Monsieur Pichegru said with a twinkle in his bright, dark
eyes.</p>

<p>In the morning, on their arrival at Paris, Mrs. Brownlow was
minus her jewelery and Davidson had lost his wallet containing a
thousand pounds in bonds&mdash;international bearer bonds
unfortunately. Neither Smith nor Tibbitts had lost anything.
Except Mr. Smith, all the travelers had been
chloroformed&mdash;by sprays inserted in holes pierced in the
doors, the police thought. They had been the only occupants of
the carriage, which had been put on at Macon. The porter seemed
to have been drugged. There was nothing about the affair to
distinguish it from other similar railway thefts, so Smith
claimed when Monsieur Pichegru had finished.</p>

<p>"They tried to bore a hole through the panel of my door, but
it was a new one. And teak!" he explained.</p>

<p>"These thefts on the French lines are getting as numerous as
their accidents," Lascelles murmured under his breath to Mrs.
Brownlow. He had only arrived yesterday morning, and was leaving
at the end of the week.</p>

<p>After dinner some French neighbors dropped in again, this time
for bridge. Smith, a remarkably good player, and his friend
Lascelles excused themselves after a rubber, and sat out in the
gardens close to a bed of rhododendrons.</p>

<p>In the thick undergrowth behind them there was from time to
time a slight, noiseless ripple&mdash;a ripple that seemed to be
steadily nearing the two figures. It had begun on the outer edge
of the little thicket&mdash;then it showed towards the
middle&mdash;then past the middle&mdash;now it was close to the
edge nearest the backs of the two talkers.</p>

<p>It was on that movement in the bushes that Miss Young's gaze
was fixed as she sat by her bedroom window watching the grounds
through a very good glass, waiting for the first sign of the
return of the man on whose boot she had stepped in the bushes. He
was sure to come again she thought. She had looked for him all
through dinner and ever since. Now she was certain that her glass
was on him, though she saw nothing of any figure.</p>

<p>"I guess a Red Indian couldn't move better," she murmured,
putting on a dark cloak, and slipping into her crepe tennis
shoes. She made for a clump of bushes behind the two chatting men
by a little detour, lingering until at last they got up and
passed into the house again. Then she sprang forward into the
thicket. The figure should be about here...</p>

<p>It was her own shoulder that a hand grasped.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened! Don't holler! It's quite all right!" The
figure in the darkness was that of a man, the voice just now was
low and very urgent.</p>

<p>Most young women would have needed some further reassurance,
but Vivian Young did not try to pull herself away. She put her
free hand instead into her pocket. Instantly a hand, that felt
like steel, gripped it too, not hard, but very firmly.</p>

<p>"It's a torch, not a gun," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Worse yet," came the swift whisper.</p>

<p>"You're an American, aren't you?" she asked. "I'm from God's
country too."</p>

<p>"Has he only one?" came the tart question. "I'm frae Aberdeen,
and&mdash;but whaur can we talk wi'oot being overheard?"</p>

<p>"Come with me." Vivian had made up her mind as to her course.
"There's a summer-house not far off..."</p>

<p>"Mind these laurel bushes!" he cautioned her. "They rustle
unco' loudly."</p>

<p>She took his hand and led him swiftly, considering all things,
to a dark outline not far off. There she paused, felt for a
moment, opened the door, pulled her companion in, shut the door,
and only then switched on the light.</p>

<p>They were in a pleasant, pine-walled, pine-ceilinged room,
with a rug or two on the floor. Osier chairs in Mandarin blue
with cretonne cushions on them, an osier settee and a small table
by the fireplace gave the summer-house a homely look.</p>

<p>Seen in the bright electric light, her companion showed as a
short, stocky figure with thick hair of a handsome auburn; a
shrewd, freckled face lit by a pair of alert, cool gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked, though she guessed.</p>

<p>"Suppose I were to tell ye that I'm just the new under-gairdener wi' a taste for listenin' in?" he asked in his marked
Scottish accent.</p>

<p>"I should know you for a liar," she replied promptly. "I'm
from Texas. We use our wits out there. You're no gardener."</p>

<p>"And wherefore no?"</p>

<p>"Your hands&mdash;your fingers&mdash;and you called those
rhododendrons 'laurels' just now."</p>

<p>He scratched his jutting chin and showed a very fine set of
teeth. "Nane sae bad," he conceded fairly. His eyes swept her and
studied her. "You yourself are?"</p>

<p>"A visitor to Porte Bonheur." She sat down. So did he. There
was a pause.</p>

<p>"I'll e'en tak' a chance," the man said finally, after he had
watched her intently for another moment; "I'll e'en trust ye. I'm
a repairter on a paper in Aberdeen."</p>

<p>"Where's that?" she asked.</p>

<p>His reply was a look of boundless pity.</p>

<p>"It's the maist important toon in Grreat Britain," he
explained modestly. "Well, I'm a repairter there, and yon affair
of the robbery in the train of an Aberdonian, a Mr. Davidson,
interested me. I've an idea aboot that theft. At least I had," he
said, with rather a sheepish grin. "I've been sent by ma editor
to speir oot hoo it a' happened. It's ma ain idea," he went on.
"If I fail ma paper winna back me. You tak' ma meaning? If I'm
caught oot, I'm just&mdash;well, whatever I maun hae to be. A
trespasser or maybe even a burglar. But the pay promised if I
succeed is grrand. And the credit too. I'd be a made man in ma
profession. I'd like fine to succeed," he added in a tone whose
sincerity there was no mistaking.</p>

<p>"I've got an idea that might be of use to you," she said
brightly, and scribbled something on a magazine lying on the
table. Tearing off the page, she handed the scrap to the man.</p>

<p>"That may help you in your search," she repeated
pleasantly.</p>

<p>He looked at what she had given him, and a dull red surged up
in his lean face till his cheeks glowed like his hair. Then he
turned and gave her rather a helpless look.</p>

<p>"You can read shorthand of course," she went on, "since you're
a reporter."</p>

<p>For a second he stood biting his thin lips, looking at the
little white tag. Then he raised his head and laughed a trifle
grimly.</p>

<p>"You're a wonder! But you're richt. I'm nae repairter. But I
thocht it wad be easier to gain access to the hoose, and your
help too, maybe, if ye thocht I was a man belonging to a
recognized newspaper. I wanted ye to have confidence in me," he
wound up.</p>

<p>"I have confidence in myself," Vivian said placidly; "quite
enough to risk associating with you, Mr. Mackay, or even helping
you."</p>

<p>"She kens ma name! She kens everything!" he said in half-assumed, half-real admiration. "Well, I am a private detective,
Miss Young. Here are my credentials."</p>

<p>He passed a thick note-case over to her. She studied its
contents quickly&mdash;but quite carefully.</p>

<p>"You're one of the heads of the firm?" she asked, handing it
back.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> the firm. A' there is to it." He spoke the last
sentence soberly enough. His glance swept his thread-bare
clothes, his shabby shoes, his ancient felt hat, with a meaning
look. "It's make or break with me, Miss Young, this job."</p>

<p>Had he tried for a month he could have found no surer way to
interest Vivian Young. "Make or break"&mdash;that was real life,
she thought, with the feeling of a man who comes back after a
long absence to familiar landmarks.</p>

<p>"As good as that?" she breathed eagerly. "My, there's nothing
like just air behind one for helping to put pep into things. And
putting pep into things is all there is to life," she finished
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"As guid as that," Mackay repeated her words too, as though he
liked them. "'Make or break' is guid, eh?" He seemed to consider
the thought. "Well, I ca'd masel' a repairter as less alarming
than a private detective," he explained after a pause. "I thocht
I would hae a better chance for a crack wi' Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"He seems to disapprove of reporters," she told him. "I must
keep it dark that I'm one if I want to fascinate him."</p>

<p>"You're a reporter?"</p>

<p>"On the <i>Texas Whirlwind</i>," she said proudly.</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> land a kelt when I talked of being a newspaper
man to you!" he said with fervor.</p>

<p>Miss Young did not know what fish he meant, but she grasped
the meaning.</p>

<p>"Sure did!" she assented blithely. She did not add that it was
because of her descriptions of the scene, her work of rescue
during a terrific fire, that her paper had sent her on a year's
tour around the world. Nine months of the year were already gone.
It was her great chance, she knew. And to think that so far it
had only brought her the post of Anthony Cross's future wife. The
thought flashed across her now with quite ludicrous
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brownlow, the woman who lost her jewels at the same time
as Mr. Davidson did his money, wants you to work for her too, Mr.
Mackay. Her husband rather turned the notion down, but I guess
she gets her own way with him."</p>

<p>Mackay shook his head.</p>

<p>"By the terms o' ma contract wi' Davidson, I'm pledged not to
undertake ony other worrk till his job is dune. Or given up. And
mind you, it's going to be a deefficult job," Mackay confided
suddenly; "for every reason. Lack o' money. And on ma parrt lack
o' training too. I'm but a beginner, ye ken. I bought the
business wi' ma last poond-note and I've no succeeded as I hoped.
So I come cheap. Which was why Mr. Davidson took me on. The
prices o' a French detective made his hair fall oot. Forrby that
he canna speak the language, and hasna any confidence in men that
kiss each other."</p>

<p>"It's a great chance for you!" she said warmly.</p>

<p>"It's one that I'll niver get again if I slip up on't." His
face looked suddenly very young and troubled. She saw the over-sharp modeling of jaw and high cheekbone. Mackay could do with
more food than he had been having lately, she thought.</p>

<p>"As far as determination is concerned I'll no slip. But it's
ma brains, I doot, ma reasoning powers. And what you want in
detecting, Miss Young, is logic."</p>

<p>"I'm only here over the week-end, but I'll help you find out
anything I can," she said impulsively.</p>

<p>"What? Join forces wi' an unmasked gairdener and reporter?" he
asked with a swift smile.</p>

<p>"I guess I can call most people's bluff," she said, smiling
too. The pleasant smile facing her came off promptly.</p>

<p>"But if it isna bluff in yon hoose? And it may not be, Miss
Young. Detecting isna a game for a leddy. Though I winna say but
that there micht be bits of information and&mdash;well, just bits
like, where an insider could help a lot."</p>

<p>She rose.</p>

<p>"Well, I must go now. But I'll keep my ears and eyes open, and
if I can think of anything brilliant I'll let you know. And if
anything humble enough to entrust me with comes along you'll be
so kind and condescending as to mention it, I hope."</p>

<p>He thanked her warmly.</p>

<p>"Ye're a plucky lassie," he murmured gratefully. "I kennt that
weel the moment I felt your hand on ma coat. Not a tremble. Not a
fumble, and not a soond. But is this summer-hoose safe for a
crack?"</p>

<p>"It's stoutly built," she assured him. "I noticed this morning
that you can't hear voices outside. Unless, of course, you were
to put your ear against the cracks. But why not come to the
villa? Call on me, if you like."</p>

<p>"I canna come ben," he said firmly. "Mr. Smith doesna like
repairters, ye said yoursel'. And I've sent in ma name as a
repairter. But there's an old gentleman staying in yon villa; I
saw him fishing this evening. He and I passed a word together.
Maist interresting talk on the ruins we had."</p>

<p>"Professor Murgatroyd, yes?"</p>

<p>"I'll watch for him, and mok' friends wi' him. He may know
summat that'll help. I feel a bit like a wee laddie oot in his
big brither's breeks," he confided whimsically.</p>

<p>"Your great chance will be the fancy-dress ball. Oh, say, Mr.
Mackay, it's masked! Until supper at one. Why don't you come and
go over to the bedrooms carefully, if you suspect any one in the
house. <i>Do</i> you suspect any one in the house?" she asked.
She meant, did he suspect Smith or Tibbitts.</p>

<p>He could not, or would not, tell her.</p>

<p>"I'm not a guid detective," he said at once, "and never shall
be, but at least I dinna blab a' my thochts. But the
ball&mdash;that's a fine idea&mdash;I'll think that
over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sakes alive, Mr. Mackay, you don't want to think things over!
You want to grab at them! Jump and land them!"</p>

<p>"Na, na!" he expostulated in a deeply shocked tone, "one
should aye act according to the light o' reason, Miss Young.
After long and careful deliberation."</p>

<p>She gave him a derisive glance.</p>

<p>"You're young enough to learn better, fortunately. My father
was a Texas Ranger. One of the best. And his motto was 'Leap
before you look.'"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" Mackay clucked, shaking his head in open
horror.</p>

<p>"It's a good one," she said promptly. "None better."</p>

<p>"In Texas, verra likely," he said politely; "but in oor parrt
o' the globe, Miss Young, the licht o' reason is what we maun go
by."</p>

<p>"Shucks!" was Miss Young's reception of that bit of wisdom,
after which she arranged the hour of their next meeting and said
good-night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class="first">NEXT morning, Vivian, Mrs. Brownlow, and Mrs.
Brownlow's faithful slave, Tibbitts, went out with Mr. Murgatroyd
to an old fortress close beside the villa, from whose ancient
battlements they had a good view.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day. Vivian shook off all fancies and
riddles, and enjoyed it to the full. The meadows were one blaze
of buttercups, the hawthorns white with blossom.</p>

<p>Behind them lay the wooded slopes of Fouettin and Saint
Mayeul. A lane of lime trees, centuries old, still in full
flower, led to the little town on their right. The smell of its
blossoms, surely one of the sweetest smells in the world, rose
all about them. Girls with big baskets on their arms were cutting
off the thick clusters for the famous <i>tilleul tisane</i>. To
one side the Grosne, crystal clear, glittered past meadows where
maize was tossing its great golden plumes. There was a hint of
ripening grapes in the air from the vineyards all around.</p>

<p>There is magic in Cluny by night or by day. A spell woven by
man, and the mind of man. A spell from out the great days
when:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">En tout pays où le vent vente<br>

L'Abbé de Cluny a rente.</p>

<br>

<p>The days when this little town was an asylum for kings, when
its abbey led the world of Christian thought, and led it well;
when Cardinals of Guise, and Richelieu, and Mazarin, and princes
of the blood royal were content to be its "abbot of abbots;" when
four Popes came from its grand old walls; when its library, and
its learning, and its high standards; were only equaled by its
power and its wealth.</p>

<p>Vivian leaned over the coping and studied the scene. For a
while the historian let them idle, then he set to work. He had
promised them a glimpse of the Cluny that he knew. A very
different place from the sleepy <i>ville</i> that they saw.</p>

<p>Of the great Basilica, that monumental work of the eleventh
century, the noblest church in Christendom of its time, he could
only speak of as of a lost treasure, save for two towers of the
narthex still left standing.</p>

<p>But he built it up again for them. In its green setting, with
its triple roofs, its soaring steeples, its innumerable
buttresses.</p>

<p>Then he showed them where the abbey ran, a world in itself,
with its gardens, and its immense cloisters, its buildings,
towers and ramparts.</p>

<p>Vivian was not greatly interested in architecture, but she
liked hearing any man talk on what he knew well. Also, she had
sent home a delicious little vignette of "The Professor at the
Dinner-table," and she wanted another. Even if he had read them,
Mr. Murgatroyd would only have been flattered, for she drew him
with a very friendly pen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow seemed interested. But there was so little else
doing at Cluny that Vivian suspected her of gracefully making the
best of a dull day. Tibbitts shifted heavily from one big foot to
the other and breathed hard. When he could, he leaned over the
battlements and betted with Vivian on the various depths. He had
a quite unexpectedly accurate eye, she found.</p>

<p>"And now"&mdash;Mr. Murgatroyd beamed at them like a father
promising his youngsters a treat&mdash;"now we will go and have
another look at the beautiful double-arched entrance gate of the
old abbey. We won't go on to the museum. I don't doubt you, too,
know that by heart."</p>

<p>"Bet your life!" Tibbitts agreed, adding in an aside, "I don't
think!"</p>

<p>They walked to the school of arts and crafts, now housed in
the old abbey, or part of it. Mrs. Brownlow said that she knew
the gate well with its charming view. Why, Vivian asked herself,
was she always so interested in Mrs. Brownlow? It was not only
because of that odd incident of her picture in Anthony Cross's
hands. It was something in the woman herself. Some charm that
emanated from her, as perfume from a damask rose. Whether she
were a vamp or no, Vivian could well imagine her to be a spell-binder.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd leading, they passed into the building. It was then
that Vivian missed Tibbitts.</p>

<p>She believed that they would find him at some café outside, in
front of an aperitif, but, to her surprise, looking over her
shoulder, she saw him standing still on the handsome broad
staircase, the original staircase, and bending down to examine
the wrought iron banister.</p>

<p>"Gosh! I never saw finer work!" he muttered. "Old iron this,"
he went on touching it as Vivian had never thought that his thick
fingers could touch anything. "Very old. Yuss," he bent down and
studied it intently. Then he straightened up and grinned
sheepishly at her before shooting a swift, rather nervous glance
at Mrs. Brownlow's slender back.</p>

<p>"Don't often find things in museums and old places that
interest me," he murmured apologetically; "first time I ever
remember to've cared a damn for any of the rot they show
you."</p>

<p>They walked on, Tibbitts sinking again into the dull young man
with the efforts at heavy pleasantry that they knew at the
villa.</p>

<p>It was when they were in the cloisters that he seemed to come
to life again. He suddenly left them, turned at right angles and
was lost to view. His action had something so definite, so
purposeful in it, that the others followed.</p>

<p>"I told you the boy was only joking when he said that he had
never been here before," Mrs. Brownlow murmured.</p>

<p>They found Tibbitts on his knees by a funny little excrescence
in the wall.</p>

<p>"Here is the spot!" he called exultantly. "They've built this
doorway half over it, but here was the 'earth where that iron was
puddled, bet your life, and drawn and hammered, and worked up,
that we saw just now on that staircase."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>"You think you've located the blasting furnace of Brother
Placidus?" His voice shook with excitement. "We've been hunting
for that for years. I was certain that it was under some part of
this later addition."</p>

<p>"Where else could it be?" Tibbitts asked contemptuously;
"seeing the way the valley faces, it would 'ave to be 'ere,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>His voice was the voice of a laboring man.</p>

<p>"Then you think this blackened wall&mdash;" Murgatroyd's tone
was quite humble.</p>

<p>"I don't think! I know! You can see for yourself that part of
the old sandstone 'earth is still 'ere. It would be lined with
charcoal dust, you know. The pile of ore would go there. The
'earth would be filled up this-a-way with charcoal, and blanketed
down with a muck of wet dust and small ore. Then you'd start the
blast going, and keep adding more blanketing until you got a good
heat, then you'd let the blast rip, and bit by bit the whole'ld
turn to bloom."</p>

<p>"What's 'bloom'?" Mr. Murgatroyd was always interested in
anything even distantly connected with his work. "What's 'bloom,'
Mr. Tibbitts?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow watched the scene with a faint line between her
rather thick, very long and low brows.</p>

<p>"Why, your puddled iron o' course. The stuff wot ye draws out
and hammers and rolls. The stuff wot some bloke worked into those
banisters we saw in the house back there, and that r'iling to the
balcony just over our heads." He pointed up with one of his big
red hands. "And I'll tell you one thing, the bloke wot designed
them knew iron, knew wot it will do, and wot it won't. Beaten it
with his bare fists in his time he must 'ave."</p>

<p>"Well done!" Murgatroyd was enchanted. "Well done! They are
indeed both by the same master hand. Both by Brother Placidus.
But that you should have detected as much at a mere
glance&mdash;you are indeed a master craftsman, not merely the
dilettante which in your modesty you claimed! Metal work was a
genuine hobby with you evidently."</p>

<p>"Metal work, yuss." Tibbitts seemed to give a little start,
and again he shot a rather timid glance at Mrs. Brownlow, who
only turned and began to admire the flowers.</p>

<p>On the way out, Murgatroyd motioned them to follow him to a
little room. He pointed to a painting in a corner representing a
monk with a rugged, but intellectual head.</p>

<p>"That's Brother Placidus. Looks like a pilgrim with that staff
in his hand, doesn't he? Well, he was one. We all are."</p>

<p>"Staff? That's a rabble, that is!" Tibbitts was staring
intently into the dull, dim picture.</p>

<p>"And what, pray, is a rabble?" asked Mrs. Brownlow. Her voice
was bored and indifferent.</p>

<p>"Why, what you rabbles with, silly!" was the unexpected reply.
There followed a second of appalled silence. Then Mrs. Brownlow
gave a forced laugh. There was nothing forced about Vivian's. She
had to laugh or burst. The absolute stupefaction on Mrs.
Brownlow's features was too marked and too sudden for her self-control. Even Mr. Murgatroyd was betrayed into one reluctant
cackle.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Tibbitts," Mrs. Brownlow spoke with an effort at
gaiety, "you are rather overwhelming as a tutor!"</p>

<p>Tibbitts turned scarlet.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Mrs. Brownlow, I spoke too quick," he mumbled; "I was
thinking of that bloke there."</p>

<p>"You haven't told us yet what you rabble, and why you rabble,"
Vivian reminded him, with another burst of hilarity.</p>

<p>"A rabble is the long bar wot you rouses the boiling with," he
said suddenly, and walked off whistling between his teeth. And
with that, as far as Tibbitts was concerned, the interest of the
morning seemed to be over. But on their saunter back to the
villa, a saunter in which Mrs. Brownlow very quietly, but very
firmly chose Mr. Murgatroyd as her companion, Tibbitts said
suddenly to Vivian:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother Placidus, eh? That's the same as Placid I suppose?"
Vivian said she supposed so too.</p>

<p>"Placidus"&mdash;Tibbitts swung his ornate cane to and
fro&mdash;"'e worked like 'is name. Placid. Nothing hurried about
his work. No need to." Again there was a silence, and then he
said half to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Must be wonderful to do work like that back there. Work you
'ave a right to be proud of. Work you'd never need to brag about.
It speaks for itself, it does. I used to think when I was a
nipper that I'd do something like that bloke's wrought iron work
some day. You couldn't do nothink finer if you was to try all
your life! Yuss, I used to think in those days that once you was
grown-up&mdash;why, you could do as you liked. Work to please
yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped again. Something in his brown eyes reminded Vivian
of a homeless mongrel staring in through a window.</p>

<p>"I believe," she said encouragingly, "that wealth is just as
much of a handicap as is poverty."</p>

<p>Tibbitts nodded, but he said nothing more. Mr. Murgatroyd
stopped them a second later to point out a Merovingian wooden
house. Suddenly Mrs. Brownlow gave a startled little
exclamation.</p>

<p>"Ah!" beamed Murgatroyd; "you've noticed that added arch? It
is indeed a dissonance. That must have been done when&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Brownlow had turned and was hurrying down into the
rue de la Poste without one glance at the anachronism which
Murgatroyd fondly thought had surprised and shocked an informed
eye.</p>

<p>Miss Young, as they walked on up the road that climbed to the
villa, saw her hasten on towards a tall figure that was
sauntering along with a leisurely,</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">All that I see,<br>

Belongs to me!</p>

<p>air as she called it. It was Anthony Cross. Vivian saw him
stop at a word from Mrs. Brownlow and take off his hat. Mrs.
Brownlow drew him to one side, and together he and she, after a
few minutes animated conversation, walked back towards the center
of the town.</p>

<p>Mr. Murgatroyd, since this was a matter unconnected with
sticks and stones or past ages, had noticed nothing. He burbled
on. Tibbitts melted away into a café. Vivian Young threw the
historian a word now and then, but she was thinking hard.</p>

<p>Anthony and the problem from his past! Apparently he had just
arrived. He was carrying a small bag. She had noticed that at
Macon there was no word or sign of his valet. She would do
nothing to deliberately put herself in his path, she had decided.
That should be left to Fate. Besides, always at the back of her
mind was the knowledge that Anthony really was engaged in a most
important search, one which, though he had denied its presence
here at Cluny, was not unconnected with danger.</p>

<p>She wondered whether he would learn that she was staying at
the Villa Porte Bonheur. She wondered, whether, and if so, when
and how they two would meet.</p>

<p>At dinner that night, Mrs. Brownlow spoke of Cross.</p>

<p>"I met an old friend of ours unexpectedly this morning, Tom,"
she murmured. "It's Anthony Cross. Fancy meeting him again and of
all places here! I asked him to drop in for a chat after
dinner."</p>

<p>"Anthony Cross?" Tom Brownlow repeated rather vacantly. "Oh,
yes, of course! Coming in this evening, is he? Good!"</p>

<p>Surely this was overdoing it, Vivian thought. Surely a couple
who had spent the whole afternoon together would have talked over
a friend's arrival. Why then this public announcement and this
apparent difficulty on the husband's part to "place" the
friend?</p>

<p>"What brings Cross to Cluny?" Brownlow went on.</p>

<p>"The abbey remains. I suggested his asking you for a room,
Monsieur Pichegru. Perhaps he will. If he stays on at all for any
length of time. Apparently he has only made up his mind
definitely to one night, and took a room at the hotel near the
station. If you hadn't happened to be taking us on that
historical tour of the town, Mr. Murgatroyd, he might have come
and gone without either of us knowing of it. He was so surprised
to see me walking towards him." This last to her husband, who
nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>"Are you talking of <i>the</i> Sir Anthony Cross?" Smith asked
with interest "One of the directors of the South African Diamond
Combine?"</p>

<p>The Brownlows said that that was the man.</p>

<p>"He's on his way back to London on some matter connected with
the syndicate, so he told me," the wife added.</p>

<p>Vivian saw Smith flash a quick, inquiring glance at his
friend, Mr. Lascelles, who returned it blandly. Catching Vivian's
gaze on them, both men dropped their eyes with a haste that
looked positively guilty, and began to crumble their bread.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can persuade him to let me put him up, though but
for one night," suggested Monsieur Pichegru, and again a message
of the eyes passed between Smith and his friend. "Any friend of
yours, Brownlow, can always count on a room here. And a rest in
this quiet spot might do such a busy man as Sir Anthony
good."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to seem discourteous," Mr. Murgatroyd said in his
clear voice; "but if Sir Anthony Cross were to become an inmate
of Villa Porte Bonheur, I should be constrained to go to one of
the hotels. Under ordinary circumstances that would be no matter,
but half-way through my book it would entail, I confess, a
certain amount of adjusting of impediments..."</p>

<p>"You know Anthony Cross?" Brownlow asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I have never met him," explained the professor; "but some
years ago my brother was very anxious to establish a leper colony
not far from one of the mines owned by his company. He had just
been appointed a director, I remember, and it was owing to his
active and passive resistance that all efforts fell through. I
feel that the abandoning of a project of bringing help to a class
of human beings who certainly needed it sorely was due entirely
and solely to him. And feeling that, I very strongly object to
meeting him. His standpoint was&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Murgatroyd pulled himself up, but his eyes flashed. He
looked very different from the placid scholar of the morning.</p>

<p>He shook his head at himself. "The French are right; to be
angry and to make bad blood is one and the same thing. Sir
Anthony must have brought down on himself enough ill will without
my adding to it."</p>

<p>"It does not seem to have harmed him, so far," Mrs. Brownlow
put in, with, for once, a touch of sarcasm in her voice.</p>

<p>"So far," Murgatroyd repeated. "Remember the words of the wise
Solon: 'Account a prosperous man happy only when he ends his life
as he began it.' Sir Anthony is still a comparatively young man,
as age goes nowadays."</p>

<p>It seemed to Vivian that the rest of the dinner was unusually
quiet.</p>

<p>Smith, his friend and Mr. Murgatroyd all seemed lost in
thought. Only the Brownlows, Monsieur Pichegru and she kept up a
desultory chat, with clumsy contributions from Tibbitts.</p>

<p>After dinner, Vivian took a walk by herself through the
gardens. For the present she had decided to act exactly as though
Anthony Cross were not in the town. She finally strolled back to
the summer-house to which she had taken Mackay. It was the hour
at which they had agreed to meet.</p>

<p>As she shut the door, some one rose in the dusk inside. It was
the detective.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's verra kind of ye, Miss Young," he said, with
evident pleasure. "Naething to report, I tak' it? I hope to find
some clue when I tak' a luik at the hoose tomorrow nicht. The
nicht o' the dance. For I shall come to it. I've met a mon who's
a director of a great diamond combine for which I did a bit o'
warrk a couple of years back. He's doon to tak' a luik at the
ruins, and is putting up at the same hotel as I am.</p>

<p>"I've had a crack wi' him. I tellt him what brings me
here&mdash;in strict confidence, o' course, and I spoke aboot the
ball tomorrow. Balls are a bit oot o' ma line. But he thinks,
like you, that I must na miss seeing the inside o' a' the rooms
when the parties are engaged below. It seems he kens the leddy
who lost her jewels&mdash;yon Mrs. Brownlow&mdash;and through her
he'll meet Monsieur Pichegru, and will ask him for twa
invitations for Saturday nicht. Ane for himself, though he doesna
expect to be here to use it, and ane for a friend. That's me!
Certes, I shall use mine."</p>

<p>"You mean Sir Anthony Cross? Mrs. Brownlow spoke at dinner of
having met him in the town. If you've worked for Sir Anthony,
perhaps he can put you in the way of some really good job."
Vivian was thinking of the diamond thefts.</p>

<p>"A doot that," Mackay said with his self-deprecatory smile.
"I'm no the class o' detective that Sir Anthony Cross wad employ.
What I did for his combine was nobbut looking up some clerk's
Edinburgh guarantor. And that class o' warrk is a' I'm guid for,
I fear me. Ye see, detecting differs. I've always worked on
business questions. Tracing checks, asking aboot characters, and
the like. But private warrk&mdash;like Mr. Davidson's&mdash;it
pays the best, o' coorse, but it's the sort I'm no cut oot for,
and that's a fact. However, I shall just use ma een tomorrow
nicht, and if I find naething after all, I'll awa' to Paris, and
try to work at the bogle frae that end. For when a's said and
dune, 'tis by the light o' reason alane problems are solved."</p>

<p>"Father solved his with his gun&mdash;alone," Vivian said
dryly, and Mackay laughed. A laugh that suddenly spoke of youth
and a sense of humor, however repressed.</p>

<p>"What are you coming to the dance as?" she asked next. "We
ought to be able to recognize each other."</p>

<p>"I thocht o' a ghaist," he said tentatively. "I canna spend
ony money on it. And for a ghaist a' I'd need wad be but a sheet
and a pillow case&mdash;over and abune ma other claes," he added
hastily. It was Vivian's turn to laugh. Suddenly an impish idea
struck her. She would have dearly like to suggest that Mackay
should go as "The Ghost of a Young Man Drowned in Shanghai," but
she bit back the speech. After all, though the tale linking his
death with Mr. Brownlow might be false enough, the young man had
probably really died. And besides that, Vivian was no spreader of
idle gossip.</p>

<p>"White's rather a poor color for snooping," she said
instead.</p>

<p>"True." He thought a moment. "Forbye giving some servant lass
the fright of her life. Hoo aboot a collector then? That micht
do. Just ma Sunday blacks&mdash;ma frock-coats gey shiny at the
seams, and I'll rip it a bit here and a bit there&mdash;and ma
top-hat has seen better days&mdash;and wi' ma small black bag in
ma hand, I'd do fine, and widna be seen a mile off. Aye. It'll be
as a collector I'll come. A debt-collector, ye ken. And you, Miss
Young?"</p>

<p>"I'm 'Lady-into-Fox.' Chiefly a woman, but turning back into
the fox that I once was. With a fox's head on my hair. But about
what brings you to Cluny&mdash;I came here simply bursting with
something that happened this afternoon, and yet which seems too
monstrous."</p>

<p>She stopped as though she really meant the adjective.</p>

<p>He looked hard at her. His bright, alert, gray eyes were
trying to read what she had to tell him before she spoke. His
resolute, freckled, rather plain face was alight with interest.
Was he to hear something that would help him?</p>

<p>"If only you were hunting for Mrs. Brownlow's jewels instead
of, or as well as, Mr. Davidson's money, it might help you
tremendously," she said slowly; "though, as I say, I can't
believe&mdash;no, I can't!" She stopped again.</p>

<p>"I cann't warrk but for Davidson the noo, but I'm as keen on
knowing what happened to Mrs. Brownlow's jewels as she can be,"
he said eagerly. "The twa thefts were the warrk o' the ane thief.
There's na doot aboot that. It's not entirely the money I'm
working for, Miss Young," he added, as she still did not speak,
"though I canna deny that a bit o' siller wad be useful. But it's
the thocht o' mebbe beating a criminal at his ain game. I'd like
fine to do that!"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Well, this afternoon, while I was practicing
'some serves, I happened to look towards the house just as a gust
of wind blew back the curtains in one of the first floor rooms.
You'd call it ground floor. And there stood Mr. Tibbitts by the
window with a string of black pearls in his hands. He nearly
dropped them, and looked ready to drop himself when the curtain
billowed around him and he saw me on the grass.</p>

<p>"He sounded me when he came out as to whether I had noticed
some beads he'd bought in the village as a present for his sister
at home. Now, of course, that's quite possibly all the scene
meant. But&mdash;it's funny! It sure is! He looked appalled when
that curtain blew out like a sail and left the window free. Yet I
can't think that Mr. Tibbitts is a thief! He is supposed to be a
rich young man! But it was a string of black pearls that Mrs.
Brownlow lost along with some sapphires, and those in Tibbitts's
hand were just the length of hers&mdash;long enough to go around
the neck&mdash;a choker string. And I never saw a lovelier sheen.
They looked like black grapes. And Tibbitts was on the car the
night they were stolen from Mrs.
Brownlow&mdash;altogether&mdash;" she shook her head with its
bright waves of light-brown hair&mdash;hair that matched her eyes
in color.</p>

<p>"Which window was it?" Mackay asked at once.</p>

<p>"A long window in a room they call the cedar room. It's a sort
of extra room. Hardly ever used."</p>

<p>"Not the room where the safe is?" Mackay asked. She shook her
head.</p>

<p>"That's in Monsieur Pichegru's study. I know, because he
wanted to lock away any jewelery or money of mine I might have
with me. But about Mr. Tibbitts&mdash;" she looked inquiringly at
Mackay, who only stood thoughtful and silent.</p>

<p>"Sakes alive, why don't you say something?" she said
laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking," he replied gravely.</p>

<p>"But I want to know what you think about what I've just told
you&mdash;about Tibbitts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It takes time to think," Mackay said judicially; "to think
wi' any degree of usefulness, that is. But I'll admit that it's
queer," he conceded with one of those boyish smiles that lit up
his lean face.</p>

<p>"So are many little things about the house," she said in
answer to that. "Tonight at dinner, for instance, when Sir
Anthony's name came up. Mr. Smith and a friend of his, a Mr.
Lascelles&mdash;the two you were watching when we
met"&mdash;Vivian's eyes twinkled like brown diamonds at the
recollection&mdash;"he's leaving tomorrow morning, by the
way&mdash;looked so oddly at each other. A long, meaning look,
especially when Monsieur Pichegru said he would put Sir Anthony
up."</p>

<p>"Is he going to?" Mackay wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brownlow thought Sir Anthony wouldn't be staying long
enough to make it worth his while changing over from the hotel.
Besides dear old Mr. Murgatroyd got quite mad at the mere notion.
I thought Mr. Smith, and Mr. Lascelles, too, both looked very
disappointed. Certainly they were very silent for the rest of the
meal. Say, Mr. Mackay, it all sounds so silly, gossiping like
this. But I like talking to you. Partly because I sure am glad to
have some one to speak to who reminds me of home. You look like
the kind of men I'm used to. Though, heaven knows, they'd beat
you when it comes to grabbing on to things! But also you never
know what bit of idle chatter might not help a detective."</p>

<p>"Not this detective! Not me!" Mackay said gloomily. "I'm plum
oot o' ma depth. But I'll dae ma best!" he finished sturdily.</p>

<p>She laughed. "My grandmother used to say:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Do your best<br>

And leave the rest,<br>

Angels can't do better.</p>

<br>

<p>"But the trouble is it isna angels I'm up against," was his
only comment on grandmamma's philosophy. "I've been trying to
think things oot. But even if I had ma suspicions, hoo can I
prove them?"</p>

<p>There was a short silence, then she told him of the morning at
the abbey.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tibbitts was too funny. He grew just like a workman.
Dropping his aitches and speaking like what we call a Bowery
tough. And the way he turned on Mrs. Brownlow, when she was fed
up with his talk about a rabble and asked him what it was. Asked
him in the tone that says you don't care a cuss what it
is&mdash;you know the tone." Vivian laughed again. "It sure was
funny!"</p>

<p>"Do you think she likes Tibbitts?" Mackay wondered.</p>

<p>"She treats him very nicely. In a sort of elder-sister way
that's quite charming. But, then, she is charming in everything
she does."</p>

<p>"And her husband&mdash;Mr. Brownlow?"</p>

<p>"He speaks to him always in a very civil tone. More I can't
say. Mrs. Brownlow told me that they met Tibbitts at Monte Carlo
simply flinging his money away right and left. He was a mill
hand. She thinks&mdash;she doesn't know&mdash;and his father
emigrated and made a fortune suddenly and then died. She
explained to me that they wanted Tibbitts to stay a while at the
villa with them and learn to pick up a few things-"</p>

<p>"Such as Mr. Davidson's thousand pounds, and her jewelery?"
asked Mackay grimly, and they both rocked in unseemly mirth.</p>

<p>"How mean we are to talk like this! Say, she fascinates me,
Mr. Mackay. She's a wonderful woman."</p>

<p>"She's a face that doesna attract me," he said rather
shortly.</p>

<p>"But she's so graceful!"</p>

<p>"Aye. She has a nice walk," he agreed. "I've heerd that
Isadora Duncan walked that gait."</p>

<p>"I should like to know her better," Vivian went on, half to
herself. "I'm sure she'd be interesting to know. Yet I can't
think why I'm not sure."</p>

<p>She rose to go. But she had one question to put.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackay why did you ask me where Monsieur Pichegru's safe
is?"</p>

<p>"I've known of a missing paper once being a' the time in the
man's own safe," he said darkly. "That's why, Miss Young."</p>

<p>Vivian thought this over on the way back to the house. And the
more she thought it over, the less she understood exactly what
the private detective meant. Did he know himself? But her
thoughts now were really on Anthony Cross. Had he arrived? Would
he and she meet? Tonight?</p>

<p>She heard her name called, and found Mr. Smith behind her on
the path.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard voices in the summer-house. Have you left
poor Tibbitts locked in?" he asked languidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she spoke as casually as he. "I was talking to an
acquaintance of mine who didn't know where Monsieur Pichegru's
boundary runs. A man who's putting up at the Hotel de Bourgogne.
By the way, he's an acquaintance of this Sir Anthony Cross's
too."</p>

<p>"Why don't you bring him up to the house," Smith suggested in
what sounded a sociable tone; "do you know if he's any good at
squash racquets?"</p>

<p>"Let's ask him," she suggested.</p>

<p>They found the house, as she knew they would, empty. It had a
window that looked on to the opposite side of the path, and she
had talked to Smith as they walked towards it. Unless he wished
to be found then, Mackay would be out over the sill and through
the bushes, like a young salmon over a rapid; of that she was
quite sure.</p>

<p>Smith murmured some vague word of regret about the squash
racquets and strolled back, while Vivian took a turn through the
orchard, enjoying the beauty around her.</p>

<p>Coming back to the villa once more, she saw ahead of her, in a
corner of the thickly-wooded drive that made a little bay here,
two people standing talking. One was Anthony Cross. He was
speaking very earnestly to an over-dressed, over-painted woman.
Or rather the woman was talking earnestly to Anthony Cross. She
was a remarkably handsome woman too. Vivian thought that she must
have been a singularly lovely girl. Standing still in the shadow
of some trees she looked at them. By Anthony's expression she saw
that he was trying to escape. But the woman would not let him go.
There was something absolutely desperate in the very bend of her
neck as she seemed to be pouring out a string of entreaties.
Twice he tried to leave her, but she only stepped after him and
continued to talk. Finally Anthony's face flushed at something
said, and with a little twitch of his shoulders very familiar to
Vivian&mdash;it had reminded her the first time she saw it of a
Roman senator adjusting his toga&mdash;he almost pulled his arm
from her hand and turned away. An exclamation from the woman
stopped him. Even to Vivian's far-off ears it had had a tragic
sound. He looked ashamed of himself, she thought, and turning, he
stood patiently for another moment or two. But by the set of his
jaw, when he replied, Vivian could guess that he was not giving
way. Indeed it looked to her as though he were delivering some
sort of an ultimatum, or even warning the woman not to continue
her argument, her pleading, her&mdash;whatever it was. And when
he had done speaking, he turned away in a manner that brooked no
further stopping. Resolutely he walked towards the house, out of
sight.</p>

<p>The woman stood where he had left her, in the middle now of
the path. She stared after him. Her face was towards Vivian. It
was pale, and there was a sort of desperate hatred in it, a sort
of unable to believe that all was lost expression on it that kept
Vivian rooted to the spot. She shivered. What could make a woman
look like that at a man? Tragic and almost frightening in their
wild fixity, there was a passion of hatred in her magnificent
eyes that had to be seen to be believed.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like any one to look after me like that!" thought
Vivian. She wondered what it meant. She was far too experienced,
knew too much of the world, to think the worst, as a nicely
brought up young woman of the mid-Victorian period would have
done. But still&mdash;it was an odd look...It did not admit of
many interpretations...Vivian went on. The woman, hearing the
steps on the gravel, turned, gave her one glance and then walked
away swiftly towards the gate. Vivian was half-minded to catch
her up and chance some excuse. After all, she was Anthony Cross's
fiancée. Or was she? No, to be honest, she didn't care a rap how
many old flames, or new ones either, Anthony had. She was quite
sure that she never had cared, and never would care. And on that
thought, she slowed up, turned and walked away. At the first
possible moment she intended to take her freedom back.</p>

<p>That wild night on the ship, something big about the man had
imposed itself on her and blinded her to many smaller
facts&mdash;their different upbringing&mdash;their different
walks in life. A girl, of course, can marry a man of quite
another world, but she must want to become a member of that
world. Vivian didn't. She was a born fighter. She loved a
struggle. And there would be no fighting, no struggling, as Lady
Cross. Anthony was not a self-made man. He had shown her some
photographs of his family place that had much impressed her. It
must be a dream of a house, of a park. But even at that moment of
semi-awe, Vivian had known in her heart of hearts that it was no
home for her. You couldn't add anything to Quarry Court. You
could only keep it up. And keeping up what others had had the fun
of making did not appeal to Miss Young.</p>

<p>Arrived at the villa, she went to her room. By the reflection
on some ilex bushes below her window, she could see that the
lights were on in the cedar room&mdash;the room where she had
seen Tibbitts standing with the beads&mdash;or could it possibly
be the pearls&mdash;in his hand.</p>

<p>Leaning out, she could even catch a voice, Anthony's voice,
speaking quietly as ever. In fact, speaking a good deal more
quietly than usual, she thought. Then came a laugh. Mrs.
Brownlow's throaty gurgle. And another! Her husband's this time.
Anthony did not seem to join in, and he had a very hearty guffaw
when he was amused. Next she heard his low tones making what
seemed quite a long speech. Evidently the Brownlows had carried
their friend off from the drawing-room to this quieter spot.
There was only one other room in the wing. A sudden wonder struck
her as to whether the Brownlows already knew of Anthony Cross's
engagement to her. It would hardly be possible for him to be
talking so long without telling old friends of the most important
step that can befall man or woman. If so, would he learn of her
arrival here? Here in the villa? Would he think it a coincidence
if he did? He might. But she knew the quickness of his
perception, of his reasoning. He was not a man whom you could
easily hoodwink. He had an uncanny&mdash;at least she thought it
uncanny&mdash;way of putting just the one question that you did
not want him to put, the one and only query whose answer would
inevitably give him the kernel of the matter. She decided that if
Anthony heard of her arrival, it would be no use pretending that
it was not linked with the sight of that photograph, with her
overhearing his question about a man called Brownlow.</p>

<p>And on that came the thought to go downstairs now, it was only
a little past nine, and leave it to him to meet her as a
stranger, or present her as his fiancée. Which would he do? What
a delightful, awkward position for him. Vivian was a bit of a
minx. The idea appealed to her immensely. She was down the stairs
within the minute. She was almost at the door of the cedar room
when came the reflection&mdash;was it fair to Anthony, supposing
the very unlikely case that he did not know of her presence in
the house at all; would it be fair to him to spring a meeting on
him in circumstances of which he had had no idea when he had
asked her to meet him as a stranger? That halted her. Then came
the thought that, apart from fairness or not to Anthony, she was
sure that he could be very stubborn. In which case the jest might
be a rather awkward one in the end. Suppose he let himself be
introduced to her as to a stranger, and suppose her vague feeling
of thin ice, of undertows, was all wrong, and these people at the
villa were all that they seemed, how could she ever explain away
the facts when they learned them? And since the Brownlows were
"all right" and friends of Anthony's, they were sure to learn of
them, unless&mdash;</p>

<p>Could she save his pride if not his heart? Could she perhaps
prevent him telling others of that engagement which she firmly
intended to break. She decided to step into a room near the one
from where the voices came&mdash;it was fitted up rather in an
hotel fashion with several little writing-tables&mdash;and wait
there for his departure, which could not now be long delayed. She
would slip out through one of the long windows when he should
pass the door and meet him outside the villa gate. She would be
frank with him, she would tell him that she had acted on impulse
when she had accepted him. That his personal magnetism had swept
her judgment off its usually firm set. As to more sordid motives,
Vivian refused to acknowledge them, even to herself. They were
not really part of her. In that she was right. She was no
parasite.</p>

<p>Vivian settled herself in an arm-chair. She did not switch up
the light which was back by the door.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before a sound roused her from her
thoughts. It was the faint fall of footsteps outside, or rather
beside, the room. They died away. Then they came again. Again
they died away. Some one was lightly, all but noiselessly,
walking up and down a carpeted side-passage which ran between the
room where she sat waiting and the room where Sir Anthony sat
talking, presumably alone with the Brownlows.</p>

<p>Vivian waited until the steps passed once more, then she
noiselessly opened her door and looked out. To her surprise the
passage, too, showed no light. Whoever was there was in the
darkness. And must have switched off the row of lights that had
been shining like pink pearls a minute ago.</p>

<p>She hesitated. For after all, she, too, was waiting in the
dark. That other person out there might be equally justified in
hoping for a word with Anthony Cross. And for an equally good
reason prefer, too, not to be seen waiting.</p>

<p>On that, however, came a sudden realization that Anthony Cross
claimed to be in Cluny on a mission both secret and important. A
mission connected with a theft that ran into many figures. He had
laughed at the idea of danger, but the danger might be here just
the same.</p>

<p>She knew now that she was not in the least in love with him,
but she would always be his friend. Was that figure, doing so
soft a sentry-go outside the cedar room, a friend?</p>

<p>She was just on the point of slipping out and switching up the
lights, when the door of the cedar room itself opened and shut
swiftly, as some one&mdash;a man&mdash;stepped out. She heard a
"Sorry! I had no idea there was any one here!" in Brownlow's
voice. He had evidently collided with some unseen person.</p>

<p>She heard an answering, "I can't find the switches. I want the
room where Monsieur Pichegru told me that I should find plenty of
writing paper."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Lascelles! Quiet Mr. Lascelles, then, who had been
taking that promenade up and down the dark passage. Vivian was
surprised. The next instant she jumped to her feet. For Brownlow,
still speaking very pleasantly, said:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the other side of us. This way&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were coming in here, and she, Vivian, would be found
sitting in the dark and apparently waiting&mdash;for whom? For
what? It was an impossibly ridiculous situation since she could
give no explanation. There was no time to switch up the light, as
the men had already turned the corner and would see the streak
under the door and hear the click.</p>

<p>Intensely vexed at the whole affair, she stepped behind the
long curtains over the windows. The glass doors themselves had
patent fasteners, which were too noisy to dare to open&mdash;for
the moment&mdash;or she would have slipped out now, at once, into
the garden. She was delighted when she heard Lascelles say rather
nervously:</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks! Thanks so much. I only&mdash;eh&mdash;wanted some
paper to take to my room with me. This will do nicely.
Thanks."</p>

<p>"Sure there's nothing else?" Brownlow asked. And was it
Vivian's fancy or was there something mocking in the question so
solicitously put. "Nothing, thanks," was the reply, and a minute
later she heard the two men pass on together down the passage to
the main hall.</p>

<p>She waited where she was. One of them might come back, and the
villa's carpets were frightfully thick. A moment later she heard
some one actually in the room. Some one who now closed the door.
Vivian had noticed that her curtains by no means covered the
whole of the window recess. She had not dared to touch them for
fear of a fold continuing to quiver. Now peeping out, she saw
that it was Mr. Brownlow who was back again in the room. But a
Brownlow quite incredibly changed. Hands in his pockets, his
shoulders hunched, his heard thrust forward, he stood staring at
a table beside him with unseeing eyes. And as he stared, his face
grew more and more malignant.</p>

<p>The forehead, never lofty, seemed to flatten as she watched.
The little eyes to move closer together. His jaw thrust forward
till the yellow lower teeth jutted out a good eighth of an inch
beyond the upper ones. It gave him a horrible resemblance to a
wolf. Vivian had seen many seamy sides of life in her newspaper
work, but she had never looked into a more criminal face than
this man's was&mdash;now&mdash;seen like this, off his guard.</p>

<p>The story her friend Edith Montdore had told her in the train
came back to her. For the first time she thought that the gossip
linking the husband with the lover's disappearance might well be
true. She could easily imagine this man in front of her, this
hitherto unseen, unguessed-at man, jumping on another in the
dark, holding his head down under water until the heaving and the
struggles should cease...She kept very, very still. Vivian was
frightened.</p>

<p>For a full minute she had the benefit of Brownlow's horrid and
ferocious look, then, with a sudden gesture as though he had made
up his mind, he opened the door again, stood a second, apparently
listening, switched off the light, and passed noiselessly out of
sight.</p>

<p>She was after him in a flash. That was no face to let roam a
house where a man on a dangerous mission might be sitting all
unsuspecting.</p>

<p>She flattened herself against the wall, even though he
switched out each light as he came to it, so that the corridor
leading to the cedar room was quite dark, as dark as the one
which Mr. Lascelles had been patrolling. Had he gone back to his
post? she wondered. Apparently this idea struck Brownlow, too,
for at the corner he turned and gave the side-passage a long
scrutiny. From the sound of his steps, she thought that he even
tried a door at the farther end which led into the garden. Then
he came back, and again he switched off each light. All was in
darkness now, except that some leaded panes at the other end shed
a sort of blurred luminosity all along the corridor.</p>

<p>By it Vivian saw Brownlow tiptoe to the door of the cedar
room, and bending down, press his ear to the keyhole.</p>

<p>In the stillness she heard Anthony's voice talking, apparently
pleasantly, and a moment later came another peal of laugher from
Mrs. Brownlow. Vivian had never heard her laugh much before. Then
came a sentence or two in her voice, but said with great
animation.</p>

<p>Evidently it was not sober business that was going on behind
that door. The man outside it stayed as he was for several
minutes, then he straightened up, and, as Vivian backed into the
room where she had been, he passed her walking swiftly on into
the main part of the house. She followed cautiously until she saw
him enter the billiard-room with some word that she did not
catch, in a pleasant, ordinary voice.</p>

<p>She moved away, took up a book, and sat down in a corner of
the lounge close to the room where she now heard the click of
balls.</p>

<p>She had plenty to think of. First of all, she considered Mr.
Lascelles's silent pacing of that dark passage. Mr.
Lascelles&mdash;was he here by some arrangement with Anthony? Was
he the man whom Anthony expected to meet? That might be possible.
And that long, quiet interchange of glances between himself and
Smith at dinner, when Anthony's name had first come up, could her
idea explain that too? It must, if it were the right one. She saw
the look again. Not stealthy exactly, yet not open. But then came
the thought that Anthony's mission, or quest, was he here by some
arrangement with Anthony? Was he the cause of it? Of course, that
might include Mr. Lascelles. But it obviously did not include
Smith. For Mr. Smith had not been acting, she felt sure, when he
had inquired whether Mrs. Brownlow's chance-met friend were
<i>the</i> Anthony Cross. But Mr. Lascelles might have had
something he wanted to ask of Anthony&mdash;some favor. That
might explain his acts tonight, and that look between the two
friends...</p>

<p>Her thoughts passed on to Brownlow. The man was madly jealous.
Of that she felt certain. Most dangerously jealous, too. That
sent her mind racing back to the photograph of Mrs. Brownlow, to
the "problem" in Anthony Cross's past, to the vamp of Mrs.
Montdore. The last term she thought, but the fears of a wife with
a slightly uncertain husband. But the photograph, Anthony, and
that awful look on the husband's face...</p>

<p>She made up her mind to see Anthony as early as possible
tomorrow morning and warn him of what she had seen. It was too
late tonight for the talk that she had hoped to have with him
outside. And in the villa, he would be accompanied to the door
for certain by some member of the household.</p>

<p>She told herself that she ought to leave Porte Bonheur if
there was any idea of resurrecting Anthony's past. But she found
herself very reluctant to cut herself off from any chance of
knowing what happened after she left. The clicking of balls
beside her stopped.</p>

<p>"By Jove," came in Brownlow's voice; "my wife and Anthony
Cross seem to have a lot to say to each other." How jocosely he
said it, and now, as he stepped out of the room, how pleasantly
he smiled at her as he passed her chair.</p>

<p>After a moment Smith came out too, and, also after a moment,
went on down the same way.</p>

<p>Vivian closed her book and decided that it was her turn to get
some note-paper from the writing-room.</p>

<p>Neither man was to be seen. But she heard Brownlow's voice.
Evidently he had joined his wife. She looked at her watch. The
talk in the cedar room was certainly a long one. Yet, as a rule,
Anthony was a man of few words. She went to her room. It was not
till nearly one o'clock that the light ceased to shine on the
bushes in front of the cedar room, and only then did Vivian,
fearing she did not know what, leave her window, and go to
bed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">NEXT morning, Vivian was out early. She intended
to stay out until she met Anthony, even though it was the day of
the dance, and the frock made for Edith Montdore needed a few
adjustments. Pins would have to do, if necessary. The point was
to see Anthony and warn him not to trust to any specious
appearance of friendliness on Mr. Brownlow's part, but to realize
that the man was a menace, or could be. Vivian had seen that evil
face of his in her dreams. She had been glad when it was time to
get up.</p>

<p>She was used to a hotter, fiercer land, but this temperate
country-side seemed to her very lovely this morning. The Grosne
is a true angler's stream; today it was clear as the air above
it, the speckled trout casting dark shadows on the pebbly bottom
as they lazily fanned themselves with a moving fin, or opened and
shut their mouths in that foolish, contented way that causes a
fisherman to see red. The swallows and martins glanced like blue
arrow-heads above them. The water plants were alive with the
shimmer of dragon-flies' wings. She watched a little water vole
sitting up and munching a spray of marsh-wort in two tiny hands.
Near her a cuckoo was calling the one "true" interval of bird
song&mdash;that mysterious, alluring call. A dipper caught her
eye, and paused on a shallow stone to curtsy politely before he
started off to take one of his strolls along the bottom.</p>

<p>From a turn in the road, she saw two men fishing. One was
Anthony. One was Mackay. Just now, they were apparently comparing
their tins of bait. Anthony went off to another swim of the
river. She came on him again by the Pont de la Levee. Mackay was
out of sight around a bend.</p>

<p>"Anthony!"</p>

<p>He turned, glanced all around them, and shook his head, not
very indignantly, at her. They were quite alone.</p>

<p>"Woman, indiscretion is thy name!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't joke! I've something to say to you. First of all,
I'm staying at the Villa Porte Bonheur."</p>

<p>He looked at her impassively. She felt that he was angry, very
angry, but he made no remark.</p>

<p>"I met a friend in the train who knows Monsieur Pichegru," she
hurried on. "She recommended me to try his villa. And
besides&mdash;but never mind about that. The point is this. Last
night, while you were talking so long to Mrs. Brownlow, I came
downstairs in order to meet you in the garden on your way out.
Well, I heard some one walking up and down in a dark passage
quite close beside the room where you were."</p>

<p>She described what happened. She described also the fiendish
expression on the face of Brownlow when standing in the room
which he thought was empty.</p>

<p>"Now, don't misunderstand me," she finished. "My only concern
is that you should know that the man is dangerous. Wildly
jealous. He looked capable of anything last night. And I heard a
very dreadful story, if true, about him in the train from my
friend. A story she had heard from one who knew them out in
Shanghai."</p>

<p>She told it. Anthony Cross listened to it, too, without a
change of his face. Certainly he did not look at all
grateful.</p>

<p>"Do you really think, my dear girl," he asked coldly when she
was silent again, "that I am so little capable of managing my own
affairs"&mdash;there was the faintest emphasis on the possessive
pronoun&mdash;"as to need to be guarded and shepherded, however
charmingly?"</p>

<p>She knew by his tone that he was, if possible, even angrier
than at first.</p>

<p>"I expressly asked you to keep clear of me during my stay down
here," Anthony went on. "Did you by any chance overhear me ask
Monsieur Bonvy if he knew a man called Brownlow in Cluny?" He
spoke in a very level voice.</p>

<p>"I did," she replied promptly. "And also, when I saw Mrs.
Brownlow, I recognized the woman whose portrait I had seen you
looking at, and remembered what you had told me about the one
woman you had loved. Any other questions?" Vivian too was angry.
To think that she had given up a much-needed nap this morning in
order to be up and out and warn this ungrateful brute.</p>

<p>"And so you deliberately went to Porte Bonheur? In order to
keep watch on me?" he asked with deadly politeness of tone.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Did you speak to the Brownlows of me at all?" she asked as
quietly as he. "Did you mention, I mean, that you were
engaged?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he said almost sharply.</p>

<p>She drew off his ring, and held it out.</p>

<p>"Then I can give you this back now. Thank you for the loan of
it, Anthony." Her face was gentle again. "But it was only a loan.
I guess we both knew that in our hearts. It really belongs
to&mdash;some one whom you haven't met yet."</p>

<p>"Just as you like." He spoke as carelessly as though she were
returning an umbrella that he had lent her.</p>

<p>Vivian was relieved and amused and pained all in one.</p>

<p>At that moment Mackay appeared around a bend. Both she and
Cross seemed to welcome the sight of a third person.</p>

<p>"Good-morning!" she called out first. Then as he drew nearer,
she went on, "You and Sir Anthony are fishing together, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>"More or less. We're putting up at the same hotel. How did the
fishing go?" he asked, turning to the other man. "Caught
anything?"</p>

<p>Mackay had not.</p>

<p>"Like me. And to think that scientists would have us believe
that fishes can't hear. I believe that they have all our five
senses, and another five of their own as well." Raising his hat
to Vivian, Anthony moved off.</p>

<p>"For ma ain part," Mackay said sadly; "I've come to the
conclusion that to catch roach you maun think like a roach. I
micht do better if the river wasna a strange one."</p>

<p>"I guess you mean if you knew French better, so as to catch up
with the thoughts of the French roach," Vivian said laughing. She
felt strangely happy. The thing that she had funked&mdash;oh,
yes, indeed she had&mdash;was over. She was free. What a glorious
morning it was. How the shadows of yesterday seemed to have
passed away. Back at the house she felt the same lightness of
heart. It was as if some fairy had changed her eyes. Everything
now resumed the usual aspect that things wore in the usual lives
of usual people. Such as she was. Such as, she felt sure today,
were those of the people around her.</p>

<p>True, Mr. Brownlow had looked like a fiend last night. She did
not weaken on that. But he might have had "a tooth-ache in his
temper." Evidently he had got over it today. For he was in high
spirits.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she wrote a little on her article. But there
was too much noise for her thoughts to come easily. And, though
she had a good style, it was not yet good enough to do without
the support of some thinking.</p>

<p>The house was invaded by a chattering mob of gardeners, and
cooks, and furniture movers, and florists' assistants. She found
herself at a loose end. Mrs. Brownlow was invisible. Her husband
seemed to be spending his time trying to see if his sitting-room
chimney smoked. At least, so he explained to Vivian, when,
alarmed at a thick puff of smoke rolling down their mutual
corridor, she had run along to find its cause.</p>

<p>He was beating a flaming paper to pieces on the hearth.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Miss Young, I'm trying the chimney with a
newspaper. We haven't had a fire in it since we've been here. But
my wife wants one for tonight. One feels chilly after a dance,
don't you think?" Vivian agreed. Ever helpful, she would have
flown to his assistance, but something in the small eyes fixed on
her&mdash;something about the whole mild, smiling face made her
alter her mind. She left him to get the better of the smoke by
himself.</p>

<p>"My!" she said to herself, "his tooth must be aching again. He
looked as though he would have bitten me if I had come one step
nearer. And that wasn't a newspaper he was burning either."</p>

<p>It was at lunch that she heard that Anthony was coming to the
dance.</p>

<p>"He has telephoned to Lyons to send him a pierrot dress, if
there's still one to be had," Mrs. Brownlow said, "though I don't
suppose he'll do more than look in at us frivolous folk."</p>

<p>Vivian felt like saying that on shipboard there had been few
better dancers than Anthony. But she kept silence, though there
was, for the first time, a rather aggravating air of
proprietorship about Mrs. Brownlow's way of speaking of Anthony.
It irritated her, and suggested an incipient toothache of her
own.</p>

<p>"Will you let him have a room for the night, monsieur?" The
soft voice went on, "You offered it so kindly last night, and as
he's leaving early in the morning, I think it would be more
convenient if he could change here, than if he had to walk back
to the inn?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Pichegru at once made for the telephone to ask
Anthony Cross to send his things over to the villa, and stay
there for whatever time he intended to remain in Cluny. In a few
minutes he came back.</p>

<p>"He'll send his things over later on. I'll tell Honoré to put
them in the red room. And as he spoke of letters which must get
off tomorrow, and which he may have to finish tonight, I've put
the cedar room at his disposal, since none of the empty bedrooms
has a sitting-room attached to it. We must be sure and leave a
couple of chairs for him. And a writing-table can be moved in
from the next room. He won't mind the fact that everything else
is cleared out for the dancers."</p>

<p>"What with writing and dancing all night, and traveling all
day, the strenuous lives rich men lead make me thankful, Tom,
that you aren't a millionaire," Mrs. Brownlow said lightly.</p>

<p>"He has asked for two cards for a couple of hotel
acquaintances," Monsieur Pichegru went on, going to a side table
and rummaging in a drawer.</p>

<p>"Men?" Mrs. Brownlow asked; "and good dancers?"</p>

<p>"One's a lady. A Mrs. Eastby. I will call on her this
afternoon. The other card I'll hand to Sir Anthony when he gets
here." And the conversation drifted away from Anthony Cross.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby&mdash;could that be the name of the woman in the
garden, Vivian wondered. But if so, had Anthony asked for an
invitation for her? But then, why the whole scene?</p>

<p>That afternoon, Monsieur Pichegru was wanted urgently on the
telephone. Monsieur was trying on his fancy dress&mdash;the good
man was going as Saint Urban, patron saint of vineyards&mdash;and
rustled in his robes and miter to the instrument. After which he
flung his sacerdotal garments wildly off, called for his car to
be sent around at once, got into his ordinary clothes, and tore
his hair all in a few brief seconds.</p>

<p>His bonded warehouse in Dijon had caught fire. His Chablis,
his Mussigny, his Pommard, his Chambertin, his Beaune and his
Mercury, not to speak of&mdash;as he did promptly and
wildly&mdash;his Saint Georges and his Montrachet, were in
danger. And French laws as to salvage are very trying to
proprietors. He was insured, naturally, he called over his
shoulder, in answer to sympathetic inquiries from his guests. It
was not a money loss but a loss to the world of wines and good
cheer that was threatened.</p>

<p>He begged his house party to continue just as though he were
present tonight. He might indeed be able to return and join in
the dancing, but that was very problematical. In the meantime he
delegated the Brownlows as his representatives. But Brownlow
refused the honor. "I'm no good as the convivial host," he
maintained, laughing.</p>

<p>"The British shyness!" scoffed Monsieur Pichegru; "then you,
Monsieur Smith, must represent me. I will take no excuses from
you! Oh, that reminds me: the card for the lady friend of Sir
Anthony Cross, and the recipe for my iced claret-cup which has no
equal from the Channel to the Mediterranean&mdash;like the little
stories dear to your friend who has just left us."</p>

<p>Smith and he walked off, the one receiving, the other giving
directions. When at last night fell, the weather was perfect.
Mrs. Brownlow was greatly relieved, for she had suggested that
the many windows of the music-room, which was being turned into a
ball-room, should be taken out and plants and sham plaster
pillars be arranged so as to hide the wall-spaces between. The
effect was good. Room and garden seemed to merge into one
blossoming whole. The lawn had been brought up to the edge of the
parquet flooring and level with it.</p>

<p>All the invitable part of the neighborhood was at the dance.
Some of the dresses were gorgeous affairs from Paris or Lyons
ateliers. Many were simple, and others were humorous.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow wore an ordinary, but very lovely, evening dress
of soft silver brocade and lace, over which, from shoulder to
hem, front and back, ran a bright blue half moon. On her head was
a diadem of wired crystal beads that spelled the word "ONCE."</p>

<p>"Once in a blue moon" was her obvious meaning, and her mask
was another blue half moon. It was but decorative. She made no
attempt to disguise her identity.</p>

<p>Her husband was "a bottle of Macon"&mdash;a shiny roll of
black cardboard, duly labeled, and wearing a cork hat.</p>

<p>Vivian looked quite charming in her creamy frock with its gold
lace cap and fox's mask a-top of that. Across her face stretched
tawny velvet with a deep gold fringe. Edith Montdore had not
intended to be easily recognized.</p>

<p>The guests were only announced by character. Mackay came
early. With Dundreary whiskers made from horse hair, clad all in
shabby black, with his shabby little bag, he was a good figure.
Taken for "the gas-meter man," he was much applauded.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Sir Anthony?" she asked as he stepped to her
side. He replied Scots fashion by another question.</p>

<p>"Why should I have?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no reason. Only he's late."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he isna coming at a'. He's too sensible a mon to care
for this sort o' thing."</p>

<p>"You talk like your own grandfather half the time!" Vivian
scoffed.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you give the whole of it for just quiet under the
stars?" he asked suddenly. "I wud. There's an awfu' lot of wishy-washy talked aboot dances. A nicht spent in the open, the sicht
o' the sun coming up in the morning, or sinking in the west;
yon's worth while. But this&mdash;it's just mak'-believe!" He
spoke contemptuously. "I canna thole mak'-believe," he added,
quite unnecessarily.</p>

<p>"But it's not make-believe." She spoke with certainty; she had
only half-heard what he had said. "I've a feeling, 'a pricking in
my thumbs,' that something's stirring tonight in the Villa Porte
Bonheur, Mr. Mackay. It may not concern either of us, neither you
nor I may ever learn what it is, but I tell you I feel it. Mr.
Murgatroyd said people like me attracted things to their
neighborhood. That if they were going to happen, they'd happen
near them. I wonder if he was right. And I wonder, too, if so,
what's going to happen here."</p>

<p>"Well, it's no great happening, but for ane thing I'm awa' to
search the upper rooms. I've been over yon Tibbitts's. I found
naething. If he still has a string of black pearls, then a' I can
say is that he wears them."</p>

<p>There were several pierrots, most of whom wore a round, pale,
cardboard pierrot-face as a mask. Anthony Cross was one of these,
but he was easily recognizable by his great height. He made no
attempt to find Vivian. On the contrary, he avoided her, choosing
Mrs. Brownlow's vicinity with marked preference. Brownlow did not
seem to mind; at least he immediately stopped for a genial word
with him.</p>

<p>Vivian had not yet seen the woman to whom Anthony had spoken
last night in the garden. But after a little while "an Egyptian
lady" was ushered in, with a white <i>yashmak</i> up to her kohl-darkened eyes. Her dress, to Vivian's scrutiny, was made up
chiefly of shawls and yards of black tulle from the local
shop&mdash;a traveling dress evidently. A question of Smith, who
was "Le Grand Chef" in white cap and apron, told her that her
guess was right.</p>

<p>"But don't say that I gave her away. She happened to speak of
rigging up something Eastern. I called on her this afternoon, you
know; her husband's a colonel in a camel corps. Did you ever see
such eyes?"...He broke off to watch the latest arrival. Evidently
Smith was struck with Mrs. Eastby's looks. And no wonder, Vivian
thought.</p>

<p>"She's here having a look at the ruins," Smith went on. "Met
Sir Anthony, who's an old friend of her husband's, it seems,
coming down in the train. Funny world! He's over from South
Africa, she from God knows what oasis back of beyond, and they
meet in a branch line running from Macon to dead-alive little
Cluny." He tucked his cardboard pate more firmly under his arm,
and waving a farewell with his soup ladle hurried away to claim
his partner. Smith was positively human tonight, Vivian
thought.</p>

<p>She watched the veiled figure move towards the tallest
pierrot, who was not dancing at the moment. Vivian drifted in
that direction too.</p>

<p>"How is my dress, pierrot? Not so bad, considering that it
consists of a couple of shawls and window curtains?" The
"Egyptian spoke coquettishly.</p>

<p>"It seems all right to me," Anthony's voice answered
indifferently. "Well, I hope you'll enjoy yourself, but frankly,
I&mdash;well, I was surprised that you cared to come." There was
something like suspicion in his tone. And in his eyes, too, as
they looked out of his cardboard face.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like being with people who are having a happy time,"
she said, with a little catch of her breath.</p>

<p>Anthony nodded agreement as he moved away to talk again to
Mrs. Brownlow, who had now left her post by the door. Sugar slide
was the dance of the moment. Mrs. Brownlow said that she would
show him the steps and took him to a quiet corner of the lounge,
so shut off by palms that it made a little room to itself. Vivian
could not follow there. Nor did she want to. There was only too
little mystery about their mutual infatuation, she thought. They
were not even pretending an interest in steps. Heads close
together, they were sitting and talking. A moment later and they
got up and passed into the larger room. Anthony looked as though
he were immensely pleased with something, Vivian thought. He had
a triumphant air. And at that look a pang stabbed her. Not for
his lost affection&mdash;not entirely. But for himself. That he
should be content to solve the problem in this way. It was not a
problem any more, Vivian thought; the solution was only too
simple, too easy to guess.</p>

<p>She was dancing with Mr. Brownlow. They were doing a sort of
in-and-out around some rose bushes when, turning to look at him,
she caught a glimpse, just a flash of the face that she had
seen&mdash;herself hidden&mdash;in the writing-room last night.
The expression passed in a second. He had been staring over her
shoulder. When next she faced that way, she saw that Anthony and
Mrs. Brownlow were again together&mdash;again talking. Mrs.
Brownlow seemed to be yielding to some suggestion of his, but
yielding unwillingly.</p>

<p>Finally they turned and went indoors, at an almost peremptory
gesture of his.</p>

<p>Brownlow laughed. A very forced laugh, Vivian thought it.</p>

<p>"Dear me! I shall have to call out Sir Anthony before
breakfast tomorrow morning, if this goes on. 'Pistols for two,
and coffee for one.'"</p>

<p>"He's leaving very early," Vivian said lightly. Though she did
not feel like taking the situation lightly.</p>

<p>"He'd better!" Brownlow said under his breath in a tone of
such fury that she drew away. She of all people did not intend to
be dragged into any quarrel between Mr. Brownlow and Anthony and
Alys Brownlow. Let the husband look after his wife better.
Certainly tonight for the first time she had met the vamp. Mrs.
Brownlow was consciously trying to attract, and, of course,
succeeding. The very turn of her head over her shoulder as she
passed into the house in front of Anthony was alluring,
mysterious, provocative.</p>

<p>Brownlow made some excuse and practically left Vivian
<i>planté là</i>, as she called it. But some one else came
towards her with the unmistakable step of one who at last sees
that for which he has been hunting.</p>

<p>It was a man's figure, wearing a long robe, the hood drawn
over the head, with slits in it for eyes.</p>

<p>"Just in time!" he murmured; "not yet a fox, lady, are you? Do
let me have one dance before you change completely."</p>

<p>Vivian studied him. It was Mr. Lascelles, she felt sure. But
Mr. Lascelles had left that morning, so she had been told.</p>

<p>"What is a member of the Ku-Klux-Klan doing here?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He gave a protesting shudder. "I am a Florentine!" he
expostulated. "A Brother of the Misericordia," he gave his hood a
tug. "If you are struck down with plague this night, I would bear
you to a hospital. On the other hand, should you intend to murder
any person or persons with whom you are annoyed, here I stand,
ready to help give them Christian sepulchre."</p>

<p>"I had no idea you were useful," she murmured.</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>"I felt sure that you did not guess my worth," he murmured.
"But where is it, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Where is what?" she parried. Jane! Then he did not know her.
Jane... Vivian looked about her as she danced off with him. The
only woman of her height and build was the Egyptian lady. She was
old enough to be Vivian's mother, the girl thought, a little
piqued, but, of course, under such a mask as hers, and with
lappets of gold lace fastened under her chin as well. She had
thought when first she saw him that Mr. Lascelles looked as
though he could dance well. Now she found that he could indeed.
He had a jockey's sense of balance. She enjoyed herself in
silence for some minutes. When they were resting, he asked her
again urgently: "Well, Jane, how about it? I've come for it."</p>

<p>"For what?" she piped in the treble squeak that she had
adopted tonight.</p>

<p>"The portrait you promised me," he replied on the instant. But
she noticed that her next partner was already at her elbow. Would
his reply have been different had they been alone?</p>

<p>Mr. Lascelles had looked a most cautious man to her. How he
watched her tonight! He, who had barely glanced at her yesterday.
Always, wherever she went, she saw that figure in the long robe.
He seemed to dance with no one else. To have eyes for no one
else.</p>

<p>She had no dances to spare. But twice he passed her with a
murmur of, "I've come on purpose, Jane." She only laughed.</p>

<p>Shortly after his second inquiry, Vivian noticed that Anthony
was in the ball-room, looking keenly towards the main door, as
though he were expecting some one. She saw him standing there
again a few minutes later, as she swung past, and again looking
as though he were waiting for some one, or for something. He had
avoided her with great care all the evening. As she had him. But
now she felt a sudden impulse to go up to him. He was leaving
next morning. She did not want them to part like this. But just
then Smith claimed her for the dance.</p>

<p>"Does one good to get back to this sort of thing," he said, as
he improvised some new steps with the skill of an expert.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lascelles, too, evidently couldn't stay away," she said
after a moment.</p>

<p>"Lascelles?" he started. "Have you seen Lascelles here?
Tonight?" His tone sounded genuinely amazed.</p>

<p>She pointed out the tall <i>frater.</i> Smith eyed him keenly,
then he shook his head.</p>

<p>"That's not Lascelles! That's&mdash;I forget who, some friend
of some one's, but it's not Lascelles."</p>

<p>Vivian did not believe him. Was he honestly deceived, she
wondered, or merely trying to mislead her.</p>

<p>"You'll see at supper-time that it isn't Lascelles," he said
positively. "But what's that? The gong? Then it's close on
midnight, and time for Pichegru's iced claret-cup.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Bring forth, he said, the mazers four<br>

My noble fathers loved of yore."</p>

<br>

<p>The doors of the ball-room opened, and in came a file of four
chefs in white, each with his attendant scullion. The chefs
carried silver trays from which artificial icicles hung, piled
with what looked like snow, in which was embedded the local and
enlarged equivalent of a mazer bowl. The scullions carried
smaller trays wreathed with flowers on which rested small silver
boxes.</p>

<p>Smith struck the foremost bowl twelve times as the clock in
the lounge chimed midnight.</p>

<p>"The drink of obligatory!" He called in French, "I, <i>le
grand chef</i>, present to you, in Monsieur Pichegru's most
regretted absence, his especial <i>Coupe de Bourgogne á la mode
de Cluny</i>, invented by him in honor of this occasion."</p>

<p>A bottle of local wine was emptied into the well-filled bowls.
Then Smith took the silver boxes up one by one.</p>

<p>"Herbs of immortality and health, plucked in the meadows,
according to the secret rites handed down in the Pichegru
family," he explained.</p>

<p>The contents, woodruff, and raspberry leaves, and lemon and
cucumber slices, and various flavoring herbs, were tipped into
the drink. Smith gave four stirs with his huge spoon that set the
ice clinking, then the claret-cup was ladled out.</p>

<p>No one needed a second command, the drink was exceedingly
good, very mild, and ice-cold.</p>

<p>Vivian saw Brownlow pledge Anthony with mock formality. Both
men seemed on the best of terms with each other. She thought that
Mrs. Brownlow, standing a little behind them, eyed them very
closely. The <i>frater</i> was nowhere to be seen. Nor the
Egyptian lady. Bar these two, all the dancers that interested
Vivian were present.</p>

<p>When she had finished her own glass, Anthony had disappeared.
After the next dance she decided to look him up. She remembered
their host's words about the letters that Sir Anthony might have
to write. Hurrying down the passage towards the cedar room, she
saw, to her surprise, that the Egyptian lady was ahead of her,
walking very softly and yet with purpose in her swift glide. She
stopped in front of a mirror to powder afresh. The <i>yashmak</i>
dropped. She was the woman of the garden, and the expression that
stared into the mirror was not unlike the one which her face had
worn yesterday. It was the look of an utterly desperate woman.
She did not see Vivian, the latter was sure of that. Her lips
were moving swiftly, hurriedly, as though she were saying
something over and over to herself. It occurred to Vivian that as
she herself was going to see Anthony Cross for what might well be
the very last time, it could do no harm if she were to freshen
herself up too. After all, though she did not own magnificent
eyes, nor was a Rossetti type, there was no real need for her to
look her worst.</p>

<p>She spent some little time in her room. Finally, she slipped
down again and into the same passage. The villa was built,
roughly speaking, like a Z, the main body running north and
south, the two projections east and west. At the end of one was
the ball-room, at the end of the other this cedar room. Before
she reached its door, she passed the room where she had waited in
the darkness last night. It opened now, and out bounded Mr.
Murgatroyd, looking like a man beside himself with indignation or
burning wrath. Now the professor had spoken of possibly watching
the revelry for a while from the first floor landing. But this
was not the first floor landing. And the way in which he had
burst from the room suggested a very different man from the
gentle lecturer who was deep in the life of the Benedictines. He
had shown some of this violence last night, however, at the mere
mention of Anthony's name, as she now recollected.</p>

<p>At sight of her now, he jumped back into the room as suddenly
as he had leaped forth, and closed the door. She felt sure that,
had she tried it, she would find that he was holding it shut. It
almost seemed to her that she could hear his quick, excited
breathing from the other side. She was quite sure that she caught
a "Not now! Some one's passing!" in a tone of extreme
warning.</p>

<p>Vivian stood quite still. What was astir all around her? She
walked on into the cedar room. Anthony was alone in it. His
pierrot overalls, his pierrot cardboard face were off. He was in
gray tweeds, standing with bent head staring at the floor. He
swung around as she entered with the expression of a man who says
"Here you are at last!" Yet the underlying look on his face, the
look that Vivian felt sure had been there before she touched the
door handle, was of a cold fury. Both looks, the underlying one
and the sudden flash that crossed the other as two beams of light
might cross each other, left his features when he saw that it was
Vivian. Yet she felt that the anger was still there, if anger it
should be called, for she had a feeling that it was deeper,
larger than mere anger.</p>

<p>He took a step towards her.</p>

<p>"Not now, Vivian," he said quietly. "I haven't a moment to
spare now&mdash;not even for you."</p>

<p>And taking her gently, but firmly, by the shoulders, he turned
her round with a very masterful touch. As always with him, or
nearly always, he impressed his will on hers. He dominated. She
murmured some word of apology, and like a timid schoolgirl left
him.</p>

<p>What in the world made him look at once so fierce and so icy?
And what had made Mr. Murgatroyd look as he did? She decided that
as there was bitter trouble brewing between Anthony and Mr.
Brownlow, Mr. Murgatroyd had been called in to arbitrate or to
smooth matters over. Vivian thought that the look on his face
must have been caused by indignation at the whole affair. That
probably Mrs. Brownlow was in that room of which he had held the
door shut, and that he had been trying in vain to reason with
her. At any rate, Vivian was sure that husband and old friend
were quarreling over the wife.</p>

<p>For once she accepted defeat. It was not a case in which she
could interfere. She would leave in the morning. Or no, she must
know how events shaped themselves. When Anthony left early next
morning, would he leave alone? One thing she had decided on. She
would not watch him, nor Mrs. Brownlow. She had tried tonight to
say some parting word to the man with whom, for a couple of short
weeks, she had been on terms of such intimacy. But he had no time
for her. Yet Vivian had a feeling that he had not parted in
anger. Rather there had been a quick tenderness, not very
profound, of course, but still there, in his voice and his touch.
Poor Anthony, she thought, caught loitering too near to danger,
overtaken by the lava stream of what he thought was an extinct
volcano and about to be swept away by it. As she stepped out of
the door again into the passage, she caught sight of a now
familiar figure at its end.</p>

<p>"Dash it all!" she thought fretfully; "there's that Lascelles
again!"</p>

<p>She dived into the side passage. A couple of curtains were
looped at its entrance. She unfastened them swiftly. The corridor
was very poorly lit tonight. All available lamps had been carried
off for the dancing wing. Lascelles, she imagined, thought that
she had stepped back into the room out of which he saw her come,
for he hurried forward.</p>

<p>"Jane," he said in a cautious voice, "are you there?"</p>

<p>And on that appeared from nowhere the woman whom Vivian felt
sure answered to that name, "the Egyptian lady." Vivian had not
seen her come, but then her range of vision was limited to the
end of the passage beside her. She saw the hooded figure put his
hand on the knob of the cedar room door, she saw the woman snatch
the hand away with a low, but almost frantic:</p>

<p>"No, no, Reggie! Remember your promise!" The voice of the
woman whom Vivian now called Jane was very determined. She stood
on tiptoe and whispered something swiftly into her companion's
ear. Then both turned away, and, obedient to the woman's urging,
passed together down the corridor.</p>

<p>Vivian waited some minutes, then she cautiously slipped across
and around to the ball-room by a different way.</p>

<p>"My, but masked dances can be queer, especially in this
house!" she ruminated.</p>

<p>On the floor, she saw Mrs. Brownlow and her husband dancing
together, and apparently in a most friendly fashion. That seemed
to her to be queerer still.</p>

<p>At supper-time a telegram was read from Monsieur Pichegru. He
sent excuses and good wishes to all his guests. He could not hope
to be back in Cluny for another day at least, but all was going
well. The fire had been got under, and everything had been
salvaged.</p>

<p>Masks were now taken off. Mrs. Eastby dropped her yashmak as
well. Vivian stared at her. She looked ten, nearly twenty, years
younger than the distraught figure out on the gravel path
pleading with Anthony last night, or than she had done just now,
desperately powdering her face and mouthing some words over and
over to herself.</p>

<p>No woman in the room could touch her, either for looks, or for
a certain magnetic warmth that she seemed to spread about her.
Mrs. Brownlow, more painted than Vivian had ever seen her, was
but a shadow beside her. Though she tried to take the ascendancy
that she usually had in any company at Cluny, the other woman
out-shone her beyond all comparison.</p>

<p>Vivian looked around at the people, most of whom were
strangers to her. At no table did she see the Brother of the
Misericordia. She leaned across to Mrs. Eastby, who was having
supper with an utterly fascinated Smith.</p>

<p>"Where's your friend, the Ku-Klux-Klan man as I called him?"
Mrs. Eastby looked at her. For a second her eyes wavered,
then:</p>

<p>"I don't know whom you mean," she said lightly enough. "What
clan did you say?"</p>

<p>Smith explained.</p>

<p>"I saw you and he talking together, or rather I heard you,
outside the cedar room," Vivian went on pleasantly. She saw no
reason why she should not try to get at least a little daylight
on some of the puzzles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby's eyes did not falter, but some champagne was
jerked from the glass around whose stem her fingers were
curled.</p>

<p>"Did you give him what he came to fetch?" Vivian persisted
lightly, but with a keen glance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby did not seem to hear. She said something to Smith,
at which the man laughed immensely. In another moment the woman's
eyes rested on Vivian's. The glance was triumphant. Almost
sarcastic, though a little too shining and radiant for that ugly
word. Certainly there was nothing either guilty or nervous in it.
Vivian told herself, and with real relief, that she was making
mountains out of molehills. And on that she, too, turned her
attention to her companion, a young French officer, eager for a
flirtation with an American girl.</p>

<p>When the last dance was over, and the last laughing guest had
driven, or walked off, Smith looked about him. Vivian and Mrs.
Brownlow were the only ones to be seen of the house party.</p>

<p>"How about tea and another rasher of bacon apiece before we
part?" the deputy host asked. Yes, Smith had certainly changed
into quite a pleasant person, Vivian reflected. He evidently was
one of those young men who need amusement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow shook her head. The early morning light was
anything but flattering to her. She looked very fagged.</p>

<p>"I'm going to bed," she said sensibly. "How well it all went
off!"</p>

<p>"Thanks to you!" Smith said warmly. "You were simply
splendid!"</p>

<p>"I can't think where Tom is hiding," Mrs. Brownlow spoke with
considerable irritation. "He must know I'm dead for sleep, and
don't want to be waked up hours from now."</p>

<p>"I'll root him up and send him along," Smith promised. "Don't
wait down for him."</p>

<p>He went off down the corridor calling "Brownlow! I say,
Brownlow! Your wife wants you. Show's over. No need to hide
now."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Brownlow ran down the stairs and past him. She swept
along the halls, calling her husband's name as she hurried to
each room and looked in.</p>

<p>Vivian would have followed, but Smith stopped her.</p>

<p>"This is where little girls get sent to bed," he pointed out.
"It's clear what Mrs. Brownlow thinks has happened, and she
doubtless knows her good man," he finished in a low whisper.</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, she evidently suspects that 'dear Tom' has looked too
long upon the wine when it was red, or the whisky when it wasn't.
Beastly bore if it's so. Don't know what the people around will
think of two Englishmen not knowing when to stop."</p>

<p>"Two?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Tibbitts had to be assisted up to bed long ago.
Funnily enough, Brownlow was the one who helped the butler guide
that winsome boy's feet up the stairs. He never could have
climbed them unaided. And still funnier is the fact that Brownlow
professed to be positively furious at the whole business. I say,
can't you stop her calling so loudly and banging on the doors?"
he asked with a pained frown. "The noise she's making is
positively shattering."</p>

<p>"Where's Sir Anthony?" she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"He left long ago. Oh, well, if you insist-" He stepped aside
with a look of thinly-veiled disgust at her insistence. Vivian
hurried after the other woman. Something, some wave of emotion
sent out by Mrs. Brownlow was reaching Vivian and acting on her
oddly.</p>

<p>They were now close to the cedar room.</p>

<p>"It's locked!" Mrs. Brownlow said, wheeling.</p>

<p>Smith nodded as he peered into it.</p>

<p>"From the inside. Key's sticking in the lock. That's
why&mdash;" he finished a trifle curtly.</p>

<p>Her only comment was to beat with a small clenched hand on the
panel.</p>

<p>"Tom! Tom!" Her voice was hysterical.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Brownlow," remonstrated Smith, "the last thing you
want to do is to make a fuss&mdash;collect the servants&mdash;and
so on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Mr. Smith! Tom could drink the ocean dry and
not feel it."</p>

<p>"Probably," was the laconic comment with a more than usually
bored look at her distraught face. "Monsieur Pichegru doesn't
bottle the ocean."</p>

<p>"Something's happened to him!" Her hand went to her throat.
Her eyes grew terrible. She seemed to Vivian to be struggling not
to scream aloud.</p>

<p>"Something's happened to him!" she said again in a sort of
terrified whimper. "He isn't anywhere else! And the door's
locked!" Her voice now came as though half strangled. "He
<i>must</i> be in there!"</p>

<p>"Now, look here"&mdash;Smith spoke firmly, with a fair amount
of kindness and a great deal of impatience in his
tone&mdash;"this won't do. Positively. You and Miss Young go on
up to bed, and let me grapple with the situation."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow turned on him. Vivian had a wild notion that she
was going to strike his rather supercilious face.</p>

<p>"Tom's ill. Or else&mdash;something has happened to him!" She
was shaking violently. Vivian laid a hand on her arm. A
comforting hand. But Mrs. Brownlow flung it off almost
savagely.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">VIVIAN moved away from her and joined Smith,
who, preceded by the butler, went around to the windows of the
cedar room by the outside garden path. Fortunately the steel
shutters had not been let down, though the thick draw-curtains
prevented any view into the room.</p>

<p>"Got a knife, Honoré?" Smith asked. The butler produced an
instrument which seemed fitted for every emergency, from putting
up a tent to shoeing horses. With a great deal of difficulty, he
finally raised the catch on one window and got it open. Smith
stuck his head in through the overlapping hangings.</p>

<p>"Let me see! No, Mr. Smith, let <i>me</i> see!" Mrs. Brownlow
had come up behind them. Her voice brooked no denial. In a
second, reaching over Smith's shoulder, she pulled wide the
curtain. Then she went down as though pole-axed. Vivian caught
her and helped Smith to lay her down on the grass, then she
stepped after him into the room and stooped over a figure close
to the window.</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow was dead. Shot through the heart. From a
marksman's point of view, it was a very good shot. He was in
evening clothes&mdash;his cardboard bottle-dress stood in another
part of the room. Facing where the men were staring, Vivian saw,
in the opposite corner, a second figure. Also lying motionless.
Here, with an exclamation of horror and pain, she touched an
outflung hand from which the revolver lying beside it; had
apparently dropped. The hand was icy. Anthony Cross, too, was
dead, and must have been dead some hours. Well, Vivian thought
grimly, he had sent his antagonist to his account. For she came
from a part of the world that has until recently had to police
itself, around which still lie wild districts where lead settles
quarrels, if they are only bitter enough. She did not lose her
head now. Neither did the butler nor Smith. It was the former who
took command in his master's absence.</p>

<p>"A duel!" he muttered. "We must send for the police all the
same. Though under the circumstances, they will only do the most
necessary."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow staggered in through the window.</p>

<p>"He isn't dead! He can't be dead!" she cried in French, and in
a tone of anguished incredulity. Then she flung herself on her
knees by her husband's side. "He's only fainted. I'll get my
smelling-salts. They're in my handbag&mdash;" She babbled on and
hurried out and up the stairs, to rush down them a moment later,
a little bag in her hand.</p>

<p>Vivian, for her part, went to the telephone as soon as the
butler had finished calling up the police. She got the Hotel de
Bourgogne and asked that Monsieur Mackay be summoned. It was
urgent. She heard him answer almost at once.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackay, please come back to the villa immediately. I
can't say more over the telephone. But please come immediately;
it's most urgent." And with that she hurried back to the cedar
room. Here she found that Smith was almost forcibly lifting Mrs.
Brownlow away from her husband's dead body.</p>

<p>"I'm most frightfully sorry," he was saying, and as though he
meant it, "but you mustn't alter his position. Not until the
police have seen him. He's quite dead. I swear to you that both
men are dead. There's nothing we can do for them. Here! One of
you women help her up to her room and stay with her. Don't step
on that revolver!"</p>

<p>Vivian returned to the hall. There were plenty of women
servants. She was not needed.</p>

<p>Was Mackay never coming? She wanted him. He might not be much
use as a detective, she suspected, but she liked him as a man.
She felt sure of him, and these last few minutes that had come to
mean something.</p>

<p>She finally heard steps coming up to the front door, which
stood wide open, with the butler as a sort of distracted sentinel
every now and then stepping through it to see if no one was in
sight yet.</p>

<p>It was the private inquiry agent. He was followed by a police
sergeant and two of his men. They tried to stop Mackay from
entering ahead of them. He got past by a very dexterous sort of
sideway duck.</p>

<p>He jumped over the mat and made for Vivian, while they, led by
the butler, turned off towards the cedar room.</p>

<p>Mackay listened to Vivian with a look of absolute stupefaction
on his face.</p>

<p>"A duel?" he muttered in an incredulous tone; "but that's
clean impossible! Did you say a <i>duel</i>?" He spoke as though
she had told him that the room in question contained a
dinotherium.</p>

<p>"Sure thing," she replied confidently. "Each has his gun
beside him. Apparently Mr. Brownlow beat Anthony Cross to the
draw, but Sir Anthony got his man." There was a friend's pride in
good work done in Miss Young's tone. "Got him dead. His was the
better shot."</p>

<p>"Losh!" muttered Mackay feebly, and said nothing more for a
moment. Then he asked, "Whaur's the wife?"</p>

<p>"In her room. She's half crazy. But only on her husband's
account. Oh, I hope she's satisfied now with her work!" Vivian
felt a sudden surge of anger race through her. "But I shouldn't
say that! She's sorry enough now it's done."</p>

<p>"Do you think she had any idea there was trouble on?" he asked
after another pause, during which, by his face, he seemed trying
to get his bearings, and not succeeding over well.</p>

<p>"I think when her husband didn't turn up, she pretty well
knew. Oh, yes, she guessed then what must have taken place. As
who wouldn't? Still I don't want to talk as though she was the
sinner and they just sheep led astray by her. They were all three
equally to blame. If there's any blame due anywhere. After all,
one must live one's own life. No one else is going to live it for
you. And when a man's dead, it seems to square up accounts
somehow."</p>

<p>The telephone bell whirred. The sergeant strode to it.
Followed a series of those grunts which only a perfect sense of
intonation preserve from sounding like the language of pigs.</p>

<p>Finally he replaced the receiver and turned to Smith, who had
drawn near.</p>

<p>"Our commissaire is attending an international Conference at
Macon, presided over by the <i>chef de police</i> of the
department. But, by good luck, a high officer from the <i>Sûreté
de</i> Scotland is attending the conference too, and he is
accompanying our commissaire down here. A great compliment to us,
that! He will be a witness to the fact that it was a duel between
two English gentlemen, and that none of us was to blame. That the
deaths were not due to any negligence on the part of the police
of France. <i>Enfin</i>, that our licenses are not to be
endorsed&mdash;on this occasion."</p>

<p>"I tak' it the mon means Scotland Yarrd?" Mackay asked.</p>

<p>Smith nodded loftily as he turned away towards the stairs. He
had assumed an air of ostentatiously dissociating himself from
the villa and all that therein was.</p>

<p>A little later he and Murgatroyd came down the stairs
together.</p>

<p>"Brownlow!" Vivian could hear the stress of utter incredulity
on the name of the dead man, "did you say, <i>Brownlow</i>?"</p>

<p>Vivian could not hear Smith's reply. But finally she heard the
other saying in shocked tones of profound horror: "Terrible!
Terrible! And utterly incomprehensible. To me, at least. What
could have caused those two men&mdash;" again she lost the rest.
But a moment later the historian came into view, making for the
cedar room itself.</p>

<p>He was not admitted. Even though, like Mr. Smith, he was known
to be an acquaintance of the commissaire. This was Mr.
Murgatroyd's first visit to Villa Porte Bonheur, but it was by no
means his first stay in Cluny. Year after year his rotund little
form had been seen paddling backwards and forwards between the
museum and his hotel.</p>

<p>Finding he got scant attention and even less information from
the police, the professor made his way back to the lounge, where
Smith was buried in a time-table.</p>

<p>"Poor Mrs. Brownlow!" he said once more; "I wish I could stay
and offer her my poor attempts at consolation. But the affair is
too terrible...</p>

<p>"Horrible!" said Smith. "Positively shattering!"</p>

<p>"And she has her own priest to help her. That being so, I am
afraid I cannot put off my departure even because of this
terrible event, as I shall explain to Monsieur Pichegru when he
arrives, as, of course, he must, at once."</p>

<p>Now Murgatroyd last evening had not spoken as though he
intended leaving the villa for another fortnight at least.</p>

<p>Vivian drew Mackay into the little lobby and murmured as
much.</p>

<p>"I sure do think it funny of him to fly off like that!" she
finished.</p>

<p>But Mackay thought it only natural.</p>

<p>"And natural that he should repeat Mr. Brownlow's name in a
tone of such amazement when he heard that he was dead?" Vivian
continued. "He didn't exclaim over Anthony Cross's!"</p>

<p>Mackay made no reply to that.</p>

<p>"He evidently expected Brownlow might go for Anthony Cross,
but he didn't seem prepared to hear that Anthony Cross had held
his end up, and that sure seems strange. He couldn't
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vivian stopped herself. She was about to say "known Anthony
Cross well."</p>

<p>"Mr. Murgatroyd hasna anything to do wi' their deaths," Mackay
began heavily.</p>

<p>"I know that!" Vivian agreed hastily. There was a little
pause.</p>

<p>"Why, say, that's just the sort of thing Mr. Murgatroyd spoke
of," she murmured; "that if things had to happen, I should be in
the midst of them&mdash;because I like being in the midst of
things. Not that I like being in the midst of this thing!" She
shivered a little.</p>

<p>Now that the sheer excitement of the terrible discovery was
wearing off, her heart began to make itself felt. To have lost a
friend, any friend in such a way! Let alone one who for two weeks
had been very near and dear to her indeed. Perhaps not that
last&mdash;no, in all honesty, not that last&mdash;but a friend
certainly. It was emphatically all his fault. She had warned him.
It was as though he had been bewitched. Had he been bewitched?
He, with those standards of right and wrong which were otherwise
so unbendable that they were one of the things in him which made
her uncomfortable! Vivian always liked exceptions to be
made&mdash;for herself, for those she loved&mdash;but Anthony
never made any. Not even for himself. In those days. A fortnight
ago. And now&mdash;dead on the field of dishonor...The thought
stung. She jumped up again. Could she be mistaken? A duel, yes,
but for another, some other reason? Then she shook her sensible
little head. No. All that lead up to it had been too clear. He
had deliberately put himself into the path of temptation again.
He had disregarded all warnings in his blind infatuation. He had
provoked a jealous man past all bearing...Neither Mr. nor Mrs.
Brownlow were people who had, or who could have, any connection
with his company. Their meeting&mdash;the whole fact that it was
to the wife not to the husband that Anthony had devoted himself
so utterly, all went to prove it. And what had it brought him?
Death. A tarnished memory. And not even the love of the woman for
which he had paid so dear. Mrs. Brownlow had not so much as
glanced at Anthony Cross's dead body. Suddenly, that seemed to
Vivian a very pathetic fact. For it was a fact. She had staggered
to her husband, she had fallen on her knees by his side, Smith
had had almost to tear her from him, but she had not even looked
towards Anthony Cross's dark corner. It was quite clear where her
love really belonged. But Anthony must have had good reason for
thinking otherwise.</p>

<p>Vivian remembered Edith Montdore's belief that the woman was a
vamp. Certainly she had tried by every wile known to a clever
woman to lead him on, as Vivian herself had noticed, this last
night. And it was all a mistake, or play, or self-deception?</p>

<p><br> <br> Now Cluny is but fourteen miles or so from Macon,
the capital of its department, Saone-et-Loire, and there, as the
sergeant told Smith later, a big international conference was
being held while the dance at Villa Porte Bonheur was but
beginning. It was the closing night of the conference. Monsieur
Cambier, the commissaire of the Saone-et-Loire police, was its
vice-president. He gave the closing address, and wound up with
the words:</p>

<p>"...and above all, my dear colleagues, let us beware of the
clever, the tortuous, as opposed to the simple explanation of any
crime. It is so easy to be unexpected and so tempting."</p>

<p>Monsieur Cambier sat down amid applause.</p>

<p>The president nodded his head approvingly, and turning to a
young man on his right, asked in tolerable English, "You, I know,
Chief Inspector, agree with me, our <i>confrère?</i> The English
character of itself answers that, with its love of the plain, its
well founded distrust of the complex."</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Pointer of New Scotland Yard made some
noncommittal reply. He was pre-eminently a man who could keep his
opinions to himself. His pleasant, but inscrutable, glance said
as much. So did the quiet dignity of his manner, an unconscious
dignity that suggested unusual force of character.</p>

<p>With the formal closing address, the circle of men sitting
around the table shifted more comfortably in their chairs and
started fresh cigars. No one was in a hurry. Tales such as you
could hear tonight would not come any one's way for another
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>When it was over, Pointer walked back to his hotel. He wished
most heartily, as he went to bed, that English mattress-makers
would turn detectives and find out the secret of French beds. But
he was a man who, by nature and training, could do with very
little sleep, so that, in spite of springy ease, he was up early
next morning. There is nothing in dull little Macon to take a man
into the streets before the rest of the world is astir. Like most
French towns, it has, to English eyes, a peculiar desolation and
grubbiness, due in part to the lack of flowers, gardens and
trees.</p>

<p>True, Macon has a past. It was a Roman camp. It had a
cathedral. Lamertine was foolish enough to be born there. Macon
also has a present&mdash;its innumerable factories. While the
view of Mont Blanc from the bridge which links past and present,
is, like its wine, of no great interest.</p>

<p>Pointer decided to stay where he was and listen to Sir Walter
Scott instead. He turned to the <i>Journal</i>, a traveling
companion old and tried, and was losing himself in a page, when
the night porter, after the quickest and lightest of taps,
slipped into his room. Pointer was wanted immediately at the
police station. A car was waiting for him below. A message was
being wirelessed for him from London, which the police thought
that he would prefer to receive in person.</p>

<p>Pointer was soon listening in. It was New Scotland Yard that
was speaking, and in its own often-changed code. Worked out it
came to this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two Englishmen had been found dead at Cluny, quite close to
where the chief inspector was. The French police were still a
little on edge over the remarks made about their handling of the
recent case of a drowned English-woman in Paris. The Home Office
wanted to pay them a marked and soothing compliment, and had
asked Scotland Yard to let Chief Inspector Pointer proceed to
Cluny, to act as the British official observer for whom the
French police had just asked.</p>

<p>The assistant commissioner, who was speaking, added that since
Pointer's leg had not yet recovered from the injury that it had
received in his last case, he would on no account be allowed to
go on active service again for another couple of weeks. Pointer
grunted at that, but finally sent back the equivalent for "I hear
and obey" which was expected of him.</p>

<p>The commissaire, Monsieur Cambier, came in as he was
finishing.</p>

<p>Pointer explained the request that he had received, and his
own acceptance.</p>

<p>"Like myself, the <i>chef de police</i> of our district will
be overcome by the honor done us." Cambier bowed deeply. "It is
indeed a most unlooked-for favor that an officer of your position
should be willing to watch a simple little local case. But, on
the other hand, as the two gentlemen concerned appear to belong
to your 'high life,' your mere presence will be a guarantee of
the complete impartiality of the investigation, and will,
therefore, be of immense comfort to the English nation." Monsieur
Cambier made a superb gesture and proceeded to thank Pointer on
behalf of himself, of his colleagues, of the <i>chef de
police</i>, of the prefect of the department, and was apparently
working his way along to the president of the republic when some
one brought in hot milk and coffee, which was poured, in the
dexterous French way, in two simultaneous streams into a couple
of cups.</p>

<p>"Cluny," Pointer repeated; "any connection with the Hotel de
Cluny?"</p>

<p>In Paris there runs a legend which recognizes three kinds of
French. The French of the <i>Académie</i>, the French of the man
in the street, and the French spoken by the English and
Americans. But Pointer spoke the tongue well. His consonants
popped, or came with the crisp patter of pebbles on metal. His
sentences turned up their tails.</p>

<p>"You mean the museum? It used to be the Paris house of the
abbotts who lived, <i>et ma foi</i>, ruled, in Cluny. The town is
small. Lace- and pottery-making are its chief claims to
notice&mdash;bar its ruins, of course."</p>

<p>They stuffed their <i>croissants</i> and rolls into their
pockets and hurried down to the car below.</p>

<p>In it was a bright-eyed, dark-haired young man who sat writing
fast in a pocket-book. As they opened the door, the breeze caught
a loose end of paper and whirled it into the air.</p>

<p>Pointer did not seem to make any movement, but his fingers
closed on it and he held it out to the young man who jumped
up.</p>

<p>"Parbleu, I should like to meet you with a foil, monsieur!"
Cambier introduced him.</p>

<p>"This is Rondeau, my aid. He thinks himself a detective, but
he is young." In Cambier's tone was an affected discontent. In
his eyes great friendliness. "He is a <i>revolutionaire</i>. In
detective theories only, I can vouch for that. Also, he is a
writer of detective stories. And detective stories, monsieur,
should be forbidden by law. They are poison to the
intelligence."</p>

<p>"I follow Poe and his Dupin," Rondeau said cheerfully. "I
build with humble bricks an altar to intelligence, to the Goddess
of Reason. Monsieur Cambier, my <i>chef</i> here, would make her
a slave, chained to the heels of old boots, coming after blobs of
candle grease&mdash;an old <i>chiffonière</i>, a rag-picker."</p>

<p>"Detection is a science," Cambier said sternly.</p>

<p>"It is an art," Rondeau maintained; "all the groveling after
clues in the world is not worth one pinch of fl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say the word <i>flair</i>, and you fly out of this door!"
thundered Cambier; "the detective's flair is the criminal's
mascot."</p>

<p>All three laughed.</p>

<p>"Detective stories discourage crime," Rondeau pointed out.</p>

<p>"Not yours, my friend. <i>Your</i> detectives are calculated
to increase the number of murders a hundredfold. But what did you
learn on the telephone while I was upstairs? Anything of
importance?"</p>

<p>"The men who are killed are a Baron Cross and a Monsieur
Brownlow." They looked inquiringly at Pointer, who tried to place
a Lord Cross&mdash;and failed.</p>

<p>"I know the house where this lamentable thing has happened,"
Cambier explained to Pointer. "I know the owner of Villa Porte
Bonheur. He is a Monsieur Pichegru&mdash;a gentleman of the
utmost respectability, an owner of some small, but good,
vineyards. A couple of years ago his entire crops of grapes
failed, and he took into his house what you call 'paying guests.'
It was a revolutionary idea! But it saved our good Pichegru. And
since then he has continued to have some foreigners always with
him. In case the crops failed again! His villa is well run. It is
well staffed with local servants, who say that it, and the people
staying in it are always, in every way, of the most correct."
Cambier ran over the names of the inmates as known to him.</p>

<p>"I have met one of the dead men&mdash;Monsieur
Brownlow&mdash;once or twice. He played a good game of tennis,
and was a fair shot, besides seeming a most agreeable companion.
Unfortunately his wife is young and beautiful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her age is given on her <i>permit de séjour</i> as thirty-two," cut in Rondeau. "But I agree that she is very interesting-looking, though I ask myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You agree! Interesting-looking!" scoffed Cambier; "ah, the
presumption of youth! How old is Baron Cross; did you learn
that?"</p>

<p>Rondeau said that he had. The baron was between forty and
fifty apparently.</p>

<p>"Present at the fancy-dress dance which was given at the villa
last night were&mdash;" Rondeau enumerated the names of the
guests as telephoned to him.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" murmured Cambier, who was looking out of the
window. "Here, at what was once the hub of the world. Here, in
this deserted nook, where prelate and prince came to have their
disputes settled, where sovereigns make a pilgrimage. The Abbot's
Palace is now the <i>Hôtel de ville,</i> with which you,
monsieur, will doubtless become well acquainted before the
formalities are over. I do not expect that it will be a long
business&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One never knows&mdash;" began Rondeau hopefully.</p>

<p>"But one learns!" retorted Cambier. "You, <i>monsieur
l'inspecteur-en-chef"&mdash;</i>he turned to Pointer&mdash;"have
naturally an absolutely free hand. In every way, in every
respect. Any observations with which you honor us will be
carefully treasured and at once embodied in the official reports.
Ah, here is the villa gate!"</p>

<p>A moment more, and the three were out on the gravel. Another
moment, and they were met by the police sergeant on guard, who
described the finding of the "duelers," first by the inmates of
the villa, then by the police.</p>

<p>"This way, <i>mon chef</i>." He took them to the cedar room.
All but one set of curtains were still drawn. The commissaire
snapped on the electric light as well.</p>

<p>"They fought in the dark," murmured the sergeant, standing
bare-headed by Sir Anthony's body. "Here is a switch most
convenient to turn out the light."</p>

<p>The police bent over the bodies in turn. The doctor was
waiting for them to be handed over to him, but he showed how
Baron Cross, as he called him, though mortally wounded in the
side, had had time to fire and kill his adversary with one fatal
shot. Death in Brownlow's case had been instantaneous. By each
man's side lay the revolver which had presumably been used. Both
jobs were what the doctor called neat. Bleeding had been chiefly
internal.</p>

<p>"The facts seem clear enough. I regret deeply"&mdash;Cambier
turned to Pointer&mdash;"that there is nothing here to show you
what we can do. Husband&mdash;wife&mdash;husband's friend. The
door locked on the inside. The key in the keyhole. Bah, it
explains itself&mdash;so far. Not even a detective of Rondeau's
could miss the truth. Not even in the first chapter. I do not
suppose that you know either of the dead men's faces,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not.</p>

<p>The sergeant reported the servants' gossip, which was to the
effect that "milord Cross" had devoted himself entirely to Madam
Brownlow last night. Evidently monsieur had either misunderstood,
or understood&mdash;according to one's point of view.</p>

<p>The sergeant had been making inquiries over the wire. No one
of the guests to whom he had telephoned&mdash;very
guardedly&mdash;had any idea, as far as he could judge, that
there had been anything in the way of an accident at the villa
last night.</p>

<p>"Just so," nodded Cambier. "It was a duel to the
death&mdash;in the dark&mdash;between these two, of which every
one else was in ignorance probably. Except, perhaps, madam. We
shall come to her by and by for that point to be cleared up.
Though what could the poor woman do? Having done all the
mischief, she would now have had to stand on one side and let the
consequences work themselves out."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I ask myself&mdash;" began Rondeau. His chief cut
him short.</p>

<p>"Do not embroider, do not twist, Rondeau! Do not, I beg, be
subtle! Here we have two men and a beautiful woman. Some incident
heats their anger to fury. Each fetches his revolver. They stand
in corners opposite to each other the length of the room apart,
turn out the light, and <i>voilà!</i>&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>"I have an idea that it is not so simple!" insisted
Rondeau.</p>

<p>"An idea!" scoffed Cambier. "Have you a fact? Let us see what
we can find?" He looked about him keenly. "Here is a tiny pin on
the inkstand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Such as is used to pin together bank-notes, eh, <i>mon
chef</i>?" Rondeau asked excitedly, drawing in his breath, as he
bent over the first find, as though the air were laden with some
wonderful perfume, the perfume of a pin.</p>

<p>"And other things, my lad! You always forget the other things,
the every day other things." Cambier continued to go over the
room, inch by inch.</p>

<p>He examined the disguise worn by Brownlow&mdash;the cardboard
bottle of Macon. It showed no marks of a tussle.</p>

<p>"It has many straps inside. None of them are strained. He took
it off quite calmly, without haste." Cambier passed on.</p>

<p>"There are no finger-prints on either pistol," Rondeau
murmured.</p>

<p>"<i>Tien</i>, and I thought the thinker despised clues! But as
we both know, more often than not, with people whose hands are
clean, and cool, no prints are left." Cambier got up and dusted
his knees. "I think we can leave this room now. Locked up, of
course. The photographs have been taken and are being
developed?"</p>

<p>The sergeant said that was so.</p>

<p>"And how about the room of milord?" Cambier next asked.</p>

<p>He was told that it had yielded nothing significant.</p>

<p>"Then I think we will interview that poor lady, Madam
Brownlow. She has my most profound sympathy. After all, it was
God, and not herself, who gave her her strange, troubling beauty
and a charm that mounts to the head like our own rich wine.
Rondeau, you can finish your report in the next room. Hand it to
my secretary, who will be here shortly. But, as railway freights
have again risen, and it will eventually have to be sent to
Macon, may I suggest a little more compression than last time? As
for Monsieur Pointaire and me, we will now go up to the room of
Madame."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class="first">A GENDARME approached the commissaire. After a
few minutes' talk, Cambier turned again to Pointer.</p>

<p>"It appears that there is an English private detective already
on the spot. He is investigating the loss by a gentleman who was
staying at Villa Porte Bonheur of a considerable sum of money in
the Paris <i>rapide</i> some days ago. He speaks a French which
can be understood&mdash;with a little trouble&mdash;and he can
understand whatever is said to him, which is all that really
matters. Fortunately this private inquiry agent has met the dead
milord, and can, therefore, positively identify him as Baron
Anthony Cross."</p>

<p>Anthony Cross. Pointer at last placed the dead man. One of the
directors of the big South African Diamond Combine. He decided
mentally that Rondeau would certainly start asking himself
questions when he heard of that fact. Even he, Pointer, wondered
whether...</p>

<p>"The sergeant rightly did not care to allow him the run of the
room until we should <i>viser</i> his papers," went on Cambier.
"Would you be so kind as to do that for us? Since we have the
inestimable benefit of your presence." Cambier spoke to one of
his men. A minute later and Mackay entered. One glance and he
stepped up to Pointer.</p>

<p>"You'll be yon chief inspector frae Scotland Yard they are
talking of outside as having arrived. Here are my credentials."
He handed the same wad to Pointer that he had shown to Vivian
Young. Pointer also went through the contents carefully.</p>

<p>"And here's a letter frae Mr. Davidson, who's my employer for
the time being, referring to some question I asked him. And
here's a line frae the dead mon, Sir Anthony Cross, enclosing me
an invitation for last nicht's dancing. I did some warrk for his
firm not long ago. Looking up a doubtful reference in Edinburgh.
I hadna met Sir Anthony till I chanced on him here." Pointer
handed him back the papers, and introduced him to the
commissaire, who shook hands.</p>

<p>"It seems a clear case of a duel," Cambier repeated
thoughtfully. "Is there anything known to you that explains the
ill-feeling between the two gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't be of the smallest use to you, except by
saying that one of the dead bodies is certainly that of Sir
Anthony Cross," Mackay explained, in his fairly correct, but very
weirdly-accented French.</p>

<p>"Pity. We were on our way to question Madam Brownlow," Cambier
continued. "You, too, monsieur, are welcome to hear what she has
to say."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow was very pale, very haggard even, yet not the
distraught figure that might have been expected. She was in a
short, black dress of some shimmery silken stuff that outlined
her really lovely figure in a way which would have caused a
sensation before the war.</p>

<p>All the men thought that she was made up. But made up to hide,
not to accentuate the marks of grief and shock.</p>

<p>The whole terrible affair had come as a complete thunderbolt
on her, she said in the soft murmur of a well-bred Frenchwoman.
She knew, she had always known, that her husband was jealous
almost to the point of madness. That was really why she was
thankful to stay on here in Cluny. She and Sir Anthony had
flirted a little tonight. But it was only a flirtation, a game.
Only a pose. Her husband must have known as much. True, he had
once before objected to her acquaintanceship with Sir Anthony,
and that was why he and she had not seen anything of each other
for so long.</p>

<p>"Was your husband a violent-tempered man in private?" the
commissaire asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow wiped her brimming eyes. "It took a tremendous
lot of feeling to break through the restraint habitual to him. He
rarely lost his temper, but when he did, he lost it
completely."</p>

<p>Coming to last night, she said that he had seemed vexed with
her for having sat out a good many dances with Sir Anthony. But
the dead man and she had naturally a good deal to talk about. Her
husband had scolded her, and she had been very indignant with
him. Then, later, he had apologized, and they had made it up. But
evidently the feeling had remained behind&mdash;and this was the
result!</p>

<p>"Madam," Cambier said gently, "come, now, be frank with us. It
will go no further. You were planning to elope last night with
Sir Cross, were you not? It was for that that he had come
here?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow's head sank lower yet. She did not reply until
the question&mdash;a guess&mdash;was repeated, still more
gently.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered all but inaudibly. The Frenchman looked
very sympathetic.</p>

<p>"I am so desolated, madam, to have to press the point, but we
must, you know. You and Sir Cross intended then to go away
together? And your husband learned of the plan?"</p>

<p>"I think he must have," she murmured brokenly.</p>

<p>"And when did you decide on it?"</p>

<p>"Last night. Before the supper. I did not notice the time.
I&mdash;oh," she broke down apparently, but there were no ravages
visible on her tinted cheeks when she raised her head again,
though she was very pale and looked very unhappy. She looked very
lovely too. Hers was a type of face that needs emotion to kindle
it.</p>

<p>"And you knew nothing of this duel?" pressed Cambier.</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing." She spoke very earnestly. "I am willing
to swear that on the crucifix."</p>

<p>"I believe you, madam," the commissaire said gently. He
questioned her as to when she had last seen each of the two men.
Mrs. Brownlow could not be sure. She had no idea of the exact
hour, but in Sir Anthony's case it had been before supper; and in
her husband's case it had been some little time after supper.
Perhaps half an hour, but perhaps less or more.</p>

<p>Pointer and Mackay listened attentively. Cambier now turned to
them. "Is there anything you would like to ask madam,
messieurs?"</p>

<p>Mackay fidgeted a moment on his seat, then he burst out:</p>

<p>"I canna get the affair properly into ma head," he said at
last. "There's nae logic intilt. To kill a mon&mdash;it takes a
lot o' feeling to gae that far. I canna hear that Mr. Brownlow
showed any sign of jealousy before. The general opinion, on the
contrary, is that he was anything but of a jealous temper." He
looked at Mrs. Brownlow questioningly.</p>

<p>"But you see he was," she said sadly. Speaking in English
too.</p>

<p>"He never betrayed himself before," Mackay went on
obstinately; "for a mon o' oor race to kill anither&mdash;na, na,
ma'm, I canna think ye're richt! I feel siccer there was mair nor
that behind these deaths&mdash;this fecht. Ye maun forgi'e me,
Mrs. Brownlow, but ye see I ha'e met your guid man, though but at
this dance. He didna strike me as in a tooring passion at ony
time last nicht. Na, na! It wasn't jealousy! Judging accordin' to
the licht o' reason, I canna think it that. I canna! There maun
be some other cause." Mackay spoke very firmly.</p>

<p>"But you see, Sir Anthony and I were going to run away
together," she said, hanging her head with its top-heavy mass of
thick, rather coarse, dusky red hair. "And somehow he must have
learned of it&mdash;and Sir Anthony has a quick temper&mdash;so
that, between them, they quite lost all sense of proportion."</p>

<p>Still Mackay shook his head. Still he looked absolutely
unconvinced.</p>

<p>"Tisn't logical, ma'm. To suddenly fecht a duel&mdash;he's a
law-abidin' mon a' his days. 'Tis too sudden. There maun be some
other cause."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't the first time!" she replied in French, her
voice marking acute pain. "I&mdash;I ought to have been on my
guard. I am so terribly to blame!" She buried her face in her
slender, long, beautiful hands for a moment, and shuddered. The
commissaire looked sympathetically at her.</p>

<p>"There was another time," she went on in a little, hushed
voice barely audible, and still in her native language. "It was
years ago. In China. A young man used to come to our house a good
deal there. He was such a nice boy, and so homesick. And so frank
and friendly. I was so dreadfully sorry for him. I never guessed,
until the last evening, that&mdash;well, that he didn't look on
me as a sort of temporary sister, as I thought.</p>

<p>"That last evening&mdash;" she paused. "Mr. Brownlow came in
and found him saying good-bye to me. My husband wouldn't listen
to any explanations. And next morning poor young Jackson, that
was the boy's name, was found drowned in the river near our
house. And some people said"&mdash;she bit her trembling lip; she
was genuinely shaken by the old story&mdash;"some people said
that Tom had drowned him." Her voice was a mere whisper of
horror.</p>

<p>"Had he?" the commissaire asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"I was never sure." Alys Brownlow shivered. "I was never sure,
but"&mdash;she lifted her head and looked at the three intently
listening men&mdash;"I think that he did. I think there was a
quarrel over me by the river, and Tom flung young Jackson into it
without caring, at the moment, whether he could swim or not."</p>

<p>"Was the affair never cleared up?" Cambier asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow shook her head.</p>

<p>"It never came to a trial. There was no evidence. But many
people, as I say, thought that he had. You see, Mr. Mackay, many
people guessed what you can't seem to believe, that Tom Brownlow
was a very hot tempered and very jealous man in his heart."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"Thank you ma'm, for explaining," Mackay said finally. "You've
pit the logic intilt that it lacked before. There's nae doot in
ma mind the noo but that you were richt, and that Mr. Brownlow
was a maist dangerous man."</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. Finally Cambier turned to the chief
inspector.</p>

<p>"If there are no questions you would like to ask madam, I have
no further queries to put for the moment."</p>

<p>On Pointer and Mackay both murmuring a negative, the
commissaire rose, said a few words of respectful sympathy, and
led the way downstairs. It was understood that Mrs. Brownlow
would remain in the villa for the present, though they hoped not
to have to disturb her again.</p>

<p>When the newly-made widow was alone, she rang and asked if
Miss Young would speak to her for a moment.</p>

<p>Vivian came with great inward reluctance. She was angry and
very disappointed in herself that this should be so. Mrs.
Brownlow had taken nothing from her worth keeping, or that had
ever been really her's. She knew that it was only wounded pride
that made her wish never to see the woman again.</p>

<p>But after a little delay she came. She found the other
stretched out on a chaise-longue. Vivian thought she had been
lying with her face buried in the cushions. More, it looked to
her swift glance as though a corner of the cushions had been
bitten by sharp, small teeth.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vivian&mdash;may I call you that&mdash;please stop with
me!" Mrs. Brownlow laid a hand on the girl's shoulder and drew
her down closer. "I couldn't tell those men, they wouldn't
understand it&mdash;but, oh...Don't shrink from me"&mdash;Vivian
had made her back stiff&mdash;"you can't blame me as much as I
do! But oh, I'm punished! For you see"&mdash;she gulped down a
sob&mdash;"you see, it was my husband I loved! Not the other man
at all. Now it's too late&mdash;I know that. Now it's too late!"
There was desolation in the tone. There was desolation in the
large but narrow eyes, in the whole sunken face.</p>

<p>Vivian's kind heart melted.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry for you, Mrs. Brownlow," she said, and meant
it.</p>

<p>"Stay with me!" pleaded the other; "I can't leave here
immediately. I don't feel able even to think. Tom decided
everything for me for so many years. Tom&mdash;" Her eyes
overflowed, her lips quivered, and snatching her hand away she
burst into passionate sobbing.</p>

<p><br> <br> Downstairs, Mr. Murgatroyd had asked if he could
speak to the commissaire for a moment. He explained that he did
not want to be detained at Cluny. That he very much wanted to
catch the next Paris express at Macon.</p>

<p>Now, as has been said, Monsieur Cambier knew the professor.
For the latter had special access and permits to what remained of
the old abbey library, where he often worked for days at a time.
Mr. Murgatroyd went on to explain that he had no faintest notion
of anything that could throw any light on why Mr. Brownlow should
have shot Sir Anthony Cross, nor why Sir Anthony should have
wanted to shoot Mr. Brownlow. He had not met either of the men
until he came here to Cluny this last time. And on that, and
leaving his address, Mr. Murgatroyd was assured that since he
said that he must leave at once for Paris, no objections would be
raised, though he was asked to remain in France until he heard
from the commissaire. That official did not add, what he did
later to his superior, the <i>chef de police</i>, that seeing
that all the guests who had attended the dance had dispersed, one
more, and that one who had not been present, might be allowed to
go on too.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Murgatroyd had left them, Monsieur Pichegru
arrived from Dijon. He was in a state of mind that, had the
matter not been so serious, would have been funny.</p>

<p>Added to his shocked horror as to what had happened to the two
dead men, was an intensely human curiosity as to why it had
happened, and what Mrs. Brownlow would do. Also how it would
affect the name of the villa itself, which, as he explained, he
advertised as a quiet retreat, a perfect nerve cure.</p>

<p>The Brownlows had been the first people of the party now
staying in the villa to answer the advertisement.</p>

<p>"I looked up their references, which were in every way
satisfactory," Pichegru went into details. He now furnished the
information that had been given him. Brownlow was a member of
three good London clubs, and was engaged in silk importation.
Apparently he was a man of considerable means. His wife had some
unusually fine jewels, a part of which, as the commissaire knew,
had been stolen lately. They were so fine that Pichegru would
only allow them in the villa on the understanding that they
should be locked up every night in his safe.</p>

<p>As to Sir Anthony Cross&mdash;he explained how slight was his
knowledge of that gentleman.</p>

<p>"And now, monsieur, or rather messieurs, what ought I to do? I
am really needed in Dijon, and badly. The warehouse is but a
riddled sieve of a building. You know what happens if good wine
is carelessly handled&mdash;on the other hand, I would not for
the world appear wanting in respect&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was called to the telephone. A question had arisen which
only he could solve, and only he on the spot. Monsieur Pichegru
was distracted. Cambier finally advised him to go to Dijon, and
from there keep in touch with the villa over the telephone. He
could be summoned at any moment. He would be so summoned should
his presence in Cluny be of the slightest help. Meantime his
household staff would carry on, the butler in particular, as
Monsieur Pichegru pointed out, enjoyed his entire confidence. So
finally, half-relieved, half-apologetic, the owner of the villa
jumped into his car and made off once more for Dijon and his
hogsheads and his bottles.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was asked to come into the room. He shook hands with
the commissaire. They had faced each other on the hard courts
many a time. He ran over the finding of the two dead bodies,
explaining that he had first thought that Brownlow must have
fallen asleep, then that he had had a glass too much, when he
failed to reply to the calls for him.</p>

<p>As to when he had last seen either man, Smith was very vague.
Around one o'clock, he fancied, in each case. But Cambier's
closer questioning made him say that time at a dance was not, as
far as he was concerned. Simply was not. He had one curious
little incident to relate, however.</p>

<p>"Sir Anthony came out of the cedar room as I was passing,
shortly before midnight. Or shortly after it. He was without his
pierrot mask and dress, and asked me if I would act as co-witness
with Mr. Murgatroyd to his signature. It was a financial paper
that was to be signed, he explained, and he said that he
regretted that he could not let me see the contents. I followed
him into the room, and found that he had folded the paper so that
his signature, when he wrote it, was the only thing visible.
Below it Cross had written the words 'Witnesses to my signature,'
with a bracket within which we signed, Murgatroyd and I."</p>

<p>Smith added that, seeing the position of Sir Anthony, he had
not given the matter a second thought. He had found, and he had
left, Murgatroyd in the room with the baronet. Now he thought it
highly probable that Sir Anthony had in reality been asking him
to witness his will, but, for fear of arousing comment, had
preferred not to state the truth. Though why he should have told
a lie about the matter, would, Smith thought, need some one who
knew him to understand.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony had proceeded to say good-bye to Smith as the
latter left the room.</p>

<p>"You say 'seeing the position of the dead man,' monsieur,"
Cambier next asked, looking up from his notes. "What exactly did
you mean by that? His social position?"</p>

<p>"His position as a director of the South African Diamond
Combine."</p>

<p>The commissaire blinked. Rondeau gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Diamond Combine?" both asked together.</p>

<p>Smith explained that Sir Anthony had been a director, and a
most energetic one, of that great cartel for many years.</p>

<p>Smith left with them <i>Who's Who</i>. Pointer opened it at
the dead man's name. He was put down as the only son of the Right
Honorable Sir Henry Wykham Cross, seventh baronet of Riston.
Educated at Winchester and New College. Called to the Bar by the
Inner Temple. Went the South Eastern Circuit. Two years later
went out to the Consular Court at Shanghai. Shortly afterwards
followed his uncle, Mr. Herbert Cross, as a director of the South
African Diamond Combine, and his father as eighth baronet.</p>

<p>Pointer translated line by line. Rondeau made copious
notes.</p>

<p>"And he was apparently making his will last night&mdash;before
that duel to the death&mdash;nothing more natural..." Cambier
mused.</p>

<p>"Though I ask myself whether his many interests might not be
for something in this mystery," Rondeau struck in.</p>

<p>"Do not use the word 'mystery' so lightly, my dear fellow,"
corrected Cambier. "As far as I can see, <i>l'apropos manque</i>.
But I would like a word with the professor. He might know
definitely whether that paper was a will or not. He was in the
room, Monsieur Smith says, when the latter entered, and he left
him still in the room."</p>

<p>Inquiry for Mr. Murgatroyd showed that the historian had
already left in a car, for which he had telephoned very urgently
to the one local garage.</p>

<p>"I have the name of his hotel in Paris," Cambier said
placidly. "I will write and ask him the question I intended to
put personally. The answers mean but little. The paper signed
might have either been a will, as we think, or concerned some
money affair which Sir Cross wished settled before he died. Madam
Brownlow believed, as you know, that he has no relatives living.
We will, of course, communicate at once with the London office of
his firm. What is it, Chevron?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Smith again. Mr. Smith wished to be allowed to go
on to Vichy, where he expected to take a cure. He had been going
later on, in any case, and now, very naturally, preferred to
leave at once. The commissaire jotted down the name of the
doctor&mdash;it was one known to him, for Vichy is fairly near to
Cluny&mdash;and said that, provided Mr. Smith would hold himself
in readiness to give any evidence which he, the commissaire,
frankly did not think would be needed, there was no objection to
his proceeding to the spa at once. And Smith, looking quite
grateful, left the room hurriedly to make his arrangements.</p>

<p>The commissaire now turned his attention to the servants.
Rondeau was told off to have a look at Sir Cross's bedroom.
Pointer and Mackay followed him. Sir Anthony had sent on his
suit-case to Paris from the hotel yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>"There are only two bags of his here." The sergeant showed
them to Rondeau. In the one were the dead man's night things, the
other was empty except for two novels.</p>

<p>"There are no letters in either, nor on him," murmured Rondeau
thoughtfully; "like that witnessed paper, he must have, himself,
posted anything that he wrote, I suppose." He looked troubled.
But after a moment he suggested rejoining the commissaire
downstairs. The latter was finishing his questions. None of the
servants had anything new to tell him apparently. One of the
footmen had tried the door of the cedar room somewhere between
half-past one and two o'clock, found it locked and passed on. He
had been in search of a chair. Now he had a fancy that he had
heard steps inside the room, or at least a sound as of some one
stirring; but as he was very young and very much excited at the
two deaths, Cambier placed a big question mark beside his
impressions. All of the servants, now that the event had
happened, were sure that they had noticed that Mr. Brownlow was
very jealous of Sir Anthony, and that the latter was absolutely
indifferent as to who noticed, or who did not notice, his
flirtation with Mrs. Brownlow. Apart from her, the baron, as the
servants called the baronet, had, as far as was known, spoken to
no one else while in the ball-room, except that the butler had
seen him once talking to an English lady staying at the Hotel de
Bourgogne, a Madam Eastby, a friend of Sir Cross's, he believed.
He had heard, he explained, that when his master was summoned to
Dijon, Mr. Smith had called on her in his stead with an
invitation extended to her at Sir Anthony's request, made over
the telephone yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Proceedings were now halted long enough for some one to
telephone to the hotel in question. Madam Eastby had left. She
had returned to the hotel around two o'clock, changed, and had
driven off in a car that seemed to be waiting for her. A sleepy
night porter was not very exact. The lady had left no address.
She had only come for a couple of days to study the historical
remains of the place, so she had said on arriving. When had she
come? By the same train as Sir Cross, though apparently they were
only slightly acquainted. The hotel had only seen them exchange a
few words once or twice in all.</p>

<p>"Probably train acquaintances," murmured Cambier when the
telephone information was passed on to him.</p>

<p>"She is said to have been very handsome," Rondeau added. It
was he who had telephoned.</p>

<p>"Just so. That's why train acquaintances," snapped his chief.
"The points&mdash;the only points of interest to us&mdash;are
that she apparently did not know Mr. Brownlow, and that Sir
Cross's behavior towards her was not one to arouse any jealousy
in any onlooker. This is a duel, remember. Kindly let that fact
clip a little off your imagination's wings."</p>

<p>Rondeau subsided. His last effort had "explained" a man
injured by a mule's kick into a violent attempt at highway
robbery on the part of four armed apaches.</p>

<p>"We will see what the two others guests staying in the house
can tell us." Cambier had the butler once more summoned. He
learned from him that Monsieur Tibbitts, who had been helped up
to bed by Brownlow and the servant last night, had gone out for a
spin to cool his brain at some early hour in the morning.</p>

<p>"If a man&mdash;a foreigner not accustomed to wines&mdash;will
prefer Burgundy to our light claret&mdash;" the butler shrugged
his shoulders. He was a <i>Clunyois</i>, well known to Cambier
and the police as a most respectable character.</p>

<p>Questioned as to the hour of Tibbitt's retirement from the
hall, he gave it as around half-past twelve. Early this morning,
one of the temporary footmen, who was a waiter at a nearby inn,
had happened to see Mr. Tibbitts driving alone in a little sports
car. The car belonged to Monsieur Brownlow, the butler added,
though Monsieur Tibbitts often used it. As to his early drive, he
had done this once or twice before after a bottle too many, and
might be expected to return before lunch very much the better for
his outing.</p>

<p>"Meantime, the young lady is available," he suggested.</p>

<p>Vivian was requested to speak to the commissaire for a moment.
The questions put to her were purely formal. Neither of the
Frenchmen asked her if she had met Sir Anthony Cross, nor yet Mr.
Brownlow, before arriving at the villa, for, knowing from the
butler's account of Sir Anthony's first visit that she had not
met him then, and aware of the fact that she was an American on a
tour of the world, it was taken for granted that the one was a
total, and the other a comparative, stranger. She added nothing
to Cambier's knowledge of what had happened, merely corroborating
the butler's and Smith's accounts of how the bodies had first
been found.</p>

<p>The doctor's preliminary report was handed in before Cambier
had finished this dull but necessary part of the inquiry. A
fuller one would follow later. This first one merely established
the fact that, as had been thought, the bullet that caused each
man's death fitted the weapon found beside the other man, and had
been fired from the front in Mr. Brownlow's case, and sideways in
Sir Anthony's case, but at a distance that precluded any singeing
of cloth or powder marks.</p>

<p>In Mr. Brownlow's case death had been instantaneous, while in
Sir Anthony's, the wounded man had, as they all knew, had time to
kill the other before himself expiring.</p>

<p>"Just so," Cambier nodded in agreement with the medical
finding. "Verdict, so far, is death in both cases as the result
of a duel. Fought without seconds. Because of the intention of
killing. The press can have the news now, Rondeau."</p>

<p>"Though I still ask myself&mdash;" his aide began.</p>

<p>"Ta-ta-ta!" snattered Cambier like a cross gander; "do not ask
yourself anything! Tell yourself, on the contrary, that
everything here goes to <i>constater</i> a duel. Nothing to
suggest a crime."</p>

<p>And on that the conference broke up. The two Frenchmen began
to collect their notes; the chief inspector drifted out into the
corridor. He was only an observer, it was true, but he had
observed one thing as he passed down it. The four pewter plaques
on its walls that represented the four seasons were not in their
correct order.</p>

<p>They ran Spring, Summer and Winter on the long wall, and on
the end, opposite to the door of the cedar room, hung Autumn. It
was this one that Pointer now looked at. The plaques hung by
stout chains and plate-hooks from the picture rail. This plate
had recently been shifted on its hooks, as two similar bright
marks, the same distance apart, but a little to one side, showed.
Nor did the name hang true now. Pointer turned his attention to
Winter on the long wall. It, too, showed two bright marks on its
edge, just a thought farther to the right than the hooks that now
held it.</p>

<p>So both the third and the fourth in the series showed signs of
a recent interchange. Why? He had another look at Winter. It was
very much ornamented with lumpy work. A close inspection showed
something that looked like a sun in the midst of a haystack,
supposedly snow-covered, that bulged to one side. Pointer looked
at the door of the cedar room. Had this plaque hung fourth in
order, on the little end wall, it would have been exactly
opposite the door. There was no one about. He jumped on a chair.
The "sun" in the haystack was a small bullet, such a bullet as an
automatic might have fired. It had not gone through the thick
metal, but had embedded itself very deeply in it.</p>

<p>He turned around as the door of the cedar room opened. The two
French officials were going to have a general inspection of the
gardens. Pointer joined them.</p>

<p>"Nothing amiss," Cambier said finally; "as was to be expected.
You agree with me, messieurs, do you not, that the gardens tell
nothing?" He addressed Pointer and the private inquiry agent.
Mackay nodded. Chief Inspector Pointer said nothing.</p>

<p>"It tells you something?" Rondeau said instantly, all
alertness.</p>

<p>"You mean?" Cambier was no less interested.</p>

<p>"I think some one has searched the garden already," Pointer
said finally.</p>

<p>"None of our men. The sergeant did not trouble, seeing that
the deaths&mdash;so far&mdash;look like a duel. You think some
one has searched here&mdash;this morning? May I permit myself to
ask why you think that, monsieur?" Cambier asked.</p>

<p>Pointer showed them some leaves here and there which, he
thought&mdash;and he was a country boy&mdash;had been either
disturbed or turned over. The morning dew, thick and heavy, was
what he went by.</p>

<p>"But there are no footprints&mdash;" Cambier was examining the
ground very closely. "A dog, perhaps; some animal?"</p>

<p>Pointer thought not. He thought that the marks showed that
some intelligent person had been looking for something and had
had an idea of where to look.</p>

<p>"I think it was some one who had lost or dropped something on
the way between the front door and the gate and retraced his
steps looking for it."</p>

<p>"Losh!" muttered Mackay. "Mechty me!" he added after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" breathed Rondeau, with that eager intake of his breath
that suggested a dog trying for a scent. "Ah-h!"</p>

<p>"But what makes you think the same person searched as lost?"
Mackay wanted to know. "Why wasna it some one searching for what
some other person had dropped?"</p>

<p>Pointer thought that the searcher was both too vague and too
precise for that. He had, so he believed, turned over or prodded
some leaves from every bush on the right-hand
side&mdash;supposing he were walking away from the house that
touched or bordered the winding main drive.</p>

<p>"You think the leaves and plants that have been disturbed are
only in that direction," murmured Cambier. "We will see." But he
could not agree with the man from Scotland Yard. There were many
signs to Pointer's eyes that the other missed, perhaps because he
did not believe that they held any message bearing on the
case.</p>

<p>"No footprints, messieur, no mark of a hand in the ground," he
finally pointed out. Pointer quite agreed with him.</p>

<p>"What object would you think it was?" Rondeau wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"Something small and flat," Pointer thought; "small enough and
flat enough to be hidden under those primula leaves, for
instance, back there. Something that he was carrying in his
right-hand pocket, or in his right hand on leaving the house.</p>

<p>"A love-letter," breathed Rondeau with kindling eyes.</p>

<p>"A bank-note!" retorted Cambier with a laugh at him. "Do not
embroider, Rondeau! Anything else you can tell us, monsieur? You
think it was in his right hand?"</p>

<p>"Assuming that he lost it on his way from the house. And, as
we have learned of nothing missing, it looks as though that were
the case. Besides, he does not look for it at night. Or we should
have heard of a lantern or electric torch being asked for."</p>

<p>"Ah, here is a mark!" Cambier bent down low; "fingers of a
hand or glove have swirled those leaves over.
<i>Voyons&mdash;voyons</i>&mdash;" he pulled at his lower lip.
"Monsieur Smith walked down this drive, did he not?" He spoke to
his sergeant.</p>

<p>"Waiting for messieurs to arrive," the man agreed. "He did.
And as he walked, he slashed at the plants with his motoring
gloves. He was carrying them in his right hand. He waited for you
quite a while by the front gate."</p>

<p>"There is our mark explained." The commissaire turned to
Pointer with a smile. "It is a habit of Monsieur Smith to cut at
things idly with whatever he holds in his hand. I have noticed it
on more than one occasion. But many thanks for pointing out what
might have been of the greatest importance."</p>

<p>Cambier turned away, and with his <i>aide</i> made for the
Hotel de ville. Mackay hunted on.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to recover Davidson's money, ye ken. I'd like to
find what was flung awa'. Ye never can tell what may help in a
search&mdash;that's logic. I dinna ken whether your guess was
richt, or yon Frenchie's, but I'll luik a bit longer." He did.
But finally he gave it up.</p>

<p>"Yon's a terrible thing to have happened," he said half to
himself as he straightened up. "But what's the use!"</p>

<p>"The use of what?"</p>

<p>"Of arguing according to reason in this affair. Ah, here comes
Miss Young. We maun stop, for she's seen us. And if she wants to
speir oot hoo things stand, she wull."</p>

<p>Mackay's tone of resignation made Pointer smile.</p>

<p>But Miss Young was only told what the papers would soon know,
and what she knew already: that a duel to the death had taken
place at the villa last night, and that both the men who fought
it were dead. Vivian nodded sadly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad that there's to be no long drawn out
investigation. And so will Mrs. Brownlow be."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">MACKAY was very flattered by an invitation from
the chief inspector to join him at a second breakfast of rolls
and coffee&mdash;the badly-made coffee of your provincial French
towns. They were both putting up at the hotel nearest to the
station, and were discussing some of its discomforts, when
Rondeau came hurrying in.</p>

<p>"Losh, he's been asking himself something again, by the look
o' him!" Mackay muttered.</p>

<p>But it was the commissaire himself this time who requested
that the two gentlemen would return at once to the villa.
Monsieur Cambier had had a telephone message, Rondeau explained,
as the three hurried up the winding, shady Promenade de
Fouettin&mdash;on to which the villa gardens opened&mdash;a
telephone message from some one in Enghien-les-Bains. Rondeau
would not say more, but he was fairly bursting with
excitement.</p>

<p>The commissaire, too, though a quiet man, and, like most of
his race very sparing of gesture, seemed stirred, Mackay thought,
as they all three stepped into the writing-room&mdash;the room
earmarked for the police investigation.</p>

<p>He repeated that he had just had a telephone message from
Enghien-les-Bains.</p>

<p>"A Madam Gatwick there wished to speak to the official in
charge of the inquiry into the death of Sir Cross. I asked her
how she had heard of the death. She told me that the valet of the
dead man had just telephoned to the hotel in Cluny, asking to
speak to his master, and had learned that he was dead.</p>

<p>"Incidentally, of course, the hotel asked the man-servant for
his own address, and I have had him summoned here at once. But to
return to this lady&mdash;she tells me that Sir Cross has been
staying at Enghien-les-Bains with her and her husband and her
sister. Was it true, as the valet had been told, that he was
supposed to have met his death in a duel over some lady down
here? She evidently intended to receive a reply. I said that we
thought so. The voice of this Madam Gatwick then replied that
that was absolutely impossible, and went on, in her truly
distressing French, to say that her sister was Sir Cross's
fiancée, and that that gentleman had certainly not fought a duel
over her sister. Wait, <i>mon ami</i>"&mdash;he silenced
Rondeau&mdash;"do not give vent to those suppositions that I can
almost see thronging to your lips! Stranger things are yet to
come. I inquired&mdash;tactfully, I trust&mdash;when the
engagement had taken place. And <i>ma foi</i>, it is odd!"
Cambier made a grimace. "Just now! A fortnight ago! I asked her
where her sister was. I expected to learn that she was on her
bed, dissolved in tears, or even under medical treatment, but I
confess I did not expect the answer that I received."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"The answer!" implored Rondeau breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The answer was that Mademoiselle Young&mdash;that is the
lady's name&mdash;is here in Cluny. More, is here in the Villa
Porte Bonheur itself."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Young!" gasped Rondeau, and actually seemed too
surprised to ask himself anything at all. Mackay jumped in his
seat.</p>

<p>"Now," insisted Cambier, "this piece of news is very
interesting, and very dramatic. And perhaps it changes much. And
perhaps it changes nothing. An engagement may be entered into for
reasons of, shall we say, good sense? An affair of the heart
might persist in spite of it. You young men are not the only
romantics. Unfortunately. And now we will again question Miss
Young. This so very reserved young lady."</p>

<p>"Reserved!" Rondeau threw up his head. "It is more than
reserve that we have here, <i>mon chef</i>. I ask
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Softly! Softly!" cautioned the older man; "remember the
facts! A young lady suspects her fiancé of an entanglement with
an old flame, a married woman. She comes down on the quiet,
though without changing her name, to investigate. She knows who
the woman in the case is, for she goes at once to the house where
that woman is staying. She keeps out of sight of Sir Cross, for
the first evening at any rate. Until she is sure. Then&mdash;now
Rondeau, you are fond of guessing, what then?" Rondeau refused to
rise to the bait.</p>

<p>"Then, I think, she has an interview with Sir Cross next day,"
Cambier continued. "She would have done much better to have
placed the affair in the hands of her brother, the head of her
family. But apparently she did not even consult him. Young ladies
nowadays are of an independence! But is the world any the better?
The safer? It is not. On the contrary!"</p>

<p>"Why do you think she had a meeting with her fiancé?" Rondeau
asked.</p>

<p>"Because she makes no move to interfere the night of the
ball&mdash;last night. She lets things take their course. I think
that means that she had had an interview with this baron, and
herself breaks off the engagement in fact, which he had already
broken in spirit. Not reflecting that in these days, since the
devastations of the war, good husbands are easier lost than won.
Carried away by his passion for Madam Brownlow, he accepts his
freedom. Then comes this duel. He is killed. The young lady sees
no reason to relate a very sad little episode&mdash;a very
humiliating one for her...Cambier went over with characteristic
French penetration to suggest the feelings that might have
prompted Vivian to keep silence.</p>

<p><i>"Enfin,"</i> he wound up; "that is what I believe to have
happened. And that is why I say this new development, which seems
such a <i>boulversement</i> in reality, may alter nothing."</p>

<p>Even Rondeau was of this opinion after an interview&mdash;a
long one this time&mdash;with Miss Young. She seemed perfectly
candid throughout. But Pointer noticed, so did Mackay, that she
waited always for Cambier's lead.</p>

<p>She acknowledged that she had been engaged to Sir Anthony, but
said that she had broken off that engagement yesterday morning.
She had come to Cluny really to see its interesting architectural
remains. But on her arrival, recommended to the Villa Porte
Bonheur by a friend, Madam Montdore, she had recognized Madam
Brownlow as a lady whose photograph she had seen a few days
before in Sir Anthony's hands. The rest ran very much as Cambier
had outlined it. She did not speak of the reason for his visit to
Cluny that Anthony had given her, because she did not believe it
to be true since the evidence of the duel.</p>

<p>It was very painful to all of them, this showing up of the
dead man, this forcing the girl to tell of what was after all a
humiliation, though Vivian refused to consider it as such. But
she asked for absolute silence about it. And the commissaire
promised her, that the facts should not be made known by the
police, if it were possible to keep them quiet.</p>

<p>When it was over, she turned to Mackay, who walked away with
her into the gardens and up to the old fortress beside them.</p>

<p>Both were silent at first.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" he said in a low voice. That was all, but she
felt strangely comforted.</p>

<p>"So'm I!" she said quietly. "I'll be frank with you. I didn't
love him. But I respected him tremendously. Oh, tremendously!"
she repeated. "But as far as myself, my own feelings went&mdash;I
wouldn't say that in that room; it seemed unfair to Anthony
somehow&mdash;but I wanted to break off the engagement
anyway."</p>

<p>"You did?" Mackay was relieved to hear that. He had feared a
broken-hearted girl.</p>

<p>"Say, do you think I would have let Mrs. Brownlow have a
walkover if I had loved the man?" Vivian demanded indignantly.
"Not on your life, Mr. Mackay! My father was a Texas ranger. He
never sat with his tail between his legs while people went off
with what belonged to him. No more would I! I let Mrs. Brownlow
try her hardest because I didn't care. And mind you, she's right
in saying the tragedy is her fault. She did try. By leading
Anthony Cross on. Of course, though"&mdash;Vivian corrected
herself&mdash;"I must remember that he was very hard to read. My,
yes! Too hard. I like franker people. I wouldn't say that to any
one else, but it's the truth. I felt more and more that I might
live a hundred years beside him and never know what he was
feeling deep down&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly she broke off in that way that means that an opposite
thought had just struck home.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked with interest.</p>

<p>"I saw him really moved just at the end," she spoke in a
gentler tone. "I mustn't forget that. He must have cared
tremendously for Mrs. Brownlow to have looked like that. He was
all out to win. Say, when he turned at my entrance into the cedar
room, I could fairly hear the swish of steel in the air. I
wouldn't have guessed he had it in him. He was on the warpath,
sure enough. Oh, he was out for Brownlow's scalp. Perhaps it was
only that I didn't really stir him, just as he didn't me, that
made me think him so cold and calm and self-controlled. You see
we met under exceptional circumstances..." She told Mackay of the
storm at sea, of that wild and yet wonderful night when each had
found in the other a courage, high and serene, that neither waves
nor wind could touch.</p>

<p>"If Anthony had kept on being the man of that all but wrecked
ship, and I reckon that if I'd kept on being the girl of the
same, we wouldn't have drifted away from each other so quickly.
But even on board I never saw him look really roused. Not like
last night! It took the woman he loved to do that. Every one
could see how things were shaping all evening. Every one but
himself and her, I suppose. But I guess he didn't think there was
any risk. He and I once practiced at a floating target, and my!
he sure was a crack shot, and swift as lightning on the
draw."</p>

<p>"Aye," Mackay said dully, and fell into his reverie again.</p>

<p>"Talking clears the mind, you know," she said
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"What a clear-minded world we ought to live in," he said with
his swiftly appearing, and as swiftly disappearing, flash of
even, strong teeth. "It dosena clear mine. It addles it. Now,
thinking on the other hand&mdash;meditating according to the
light o' reason on the facts as known&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> can that!" she begged. Opening her heart just
now was a relief to her. "Or at any rate let me give you
something to meditate on.</p>

<p>"Why did Mr. Lascelles come back on the quiet last night? What
did he want from me, when he thought I was 'Jane?' Apparently he
and the woman Anthony Cross wouldn't talk to were in some plan
together. And she surely looked as though it had gone off well at
supper. Oh, yes, I know that Anthony's and Mr. Brownlow's was a
duel fair and square, but apart from that, there sure were
strange things on foot here in the villa last night."</p>

<p>"I doot but the explaining o' the strange things is far beyant
ma powers. There's nae logic here. And wi'oot logic, I'm a
helpless mon." Mackay looked very tired. And in the sharp morning
light he looked shabbier than ever. Vivian, who had watched, not
once but many times, the turn of the card that might have meant
absolute poverty for herself, looked at him sympathetically. He
was not likely to make much out of his present job.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Murgatroyd explain what he was doing in that writing-room last night?" she asked next.</p>

<p>"He never mentioned it," Mackay said, still with his thoughts
somewhere else. "He said he had nae suspicion that onything was
wrang between Brownlow and Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"My!" Vivian looked shocked. "Say, he can tell them when he
wants to, can't he! Like the rest of us, I guess. But I suppose
he didn't like to talk over whatever it was Mrs. Brownlow had
said to him. He sure was in a difficult place. For surely to
goodness <i>he's</i> what he seems? But apart from him, there's
all the rest of things I can't understand. There's-"</p>

<p>"Aye!" cut in Mackay in the tone of one who doesn't want to
talk. "There's a' that. A' things for which I'm nae guid.</p>

<p>"Ye see," he went on after a pause, "in stories it's
invariably the private detective that wipes the eye o' the
police. He's ca'ed just in time to prevent a terrible miscarriage
o' justice, and in the last vairse the police officer is shaking
his hand, and saying, wi'tears in his een: 'Whaur should we be
but for you, Mr. Knowell?' Aye, it's like that in buiks. But in
real life?" He shook his head. "Tak' ma job&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish I could!" she said with spirit. "Say, <i>I'd</i> make
things hum!"</p>

<p>"How?" he asked pertinently. She thought awhile, and then
agreed that there might be a few difficulties about getting under
way...</p>

<p>"I searched the rooms overhead last night and found naething,"
he pointed out. "Naething at a'. But, of course, I canna search
them as a policeman wud. Pulling this and tearing up that. I have
nae richts at a'. I havena an army of helpers dotted o'er the
land." He spoke bitterly. Vivian studied him. She was not
particularly fond of people who failed. Nor over lenient in
judging them. She herself had never failed. But somehow&mdash;she
was sure sorry for Mackay, as she expressed it to herself. The
young man's face, voice, carriage, spoke for him as a man who
would do his best&mdash;who had done his best honestly.</p>

<p>"You're all right," she said encouragingly, "all you want is a
bit more drive. More hustle and less logic." At the sight of his
face she broke off in her exhortation to exclaim in horror,
"You're not going to quit?"</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>"But you <i>can't</i> leave now!" She was in open dismay.
"Say, Mr. Mackay, you simply <i>can't</i> leave now!"</p>

<p>He made no promise except that he must, of course, stay until
the inquiry, short though it apparently would be, was over.
Vivian lost patience with him for his willingness to accept
defeat.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can leave, but I wouldn't. Not for anything! I must
know just how things happened. Of course, I know how they
happened&mdash;but I want it proved. Besides, I've promised Mrs.
Brownlow to wait here until&mdash;well, I guess, until she can
get away. Oh, I know it's a funny situation. But it's less
painful for both of us not to rail at each other. Besides there's
Mamie, my sister, Mrs. Gatwick. She's on the way down here
already. Worse luck. Say, I do hate being cried over."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gatwick did not look as though she had come for that
damp purpose as she hugged and kissed her sister in the latter's
bedroom a few hours later.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, you can't stay in this house! We'll go back by
the afternoon train. What a horrible little place this is. I
didn't see a single decent store as I came up the street. And
dust! Now, you get to your packing, or are you through
already?"</p>

<p>Vivian disentangled the arms around her.</p>

<p>"Mamie," she said resolutely, "I'm staying right here until
Mrs. Brownlow is able to get away. She's waiting to take her
husband's body home with her. And I think it looks better for us
to be friends. There's no reason why we shouldn't be."</p>

<p>"Waiting for Mrs. Brownlow!" echoed her sister shrilly and
indignantly. "Mrs. Brownlow!"</p>

<p>"She asked me to stay with her."</p>

<p>"She sure has a nerve!" was the sister's indignant comment. "I
don't know what's come over you, Vivian. To be taken in by that
sort of creature. Mrs. Brownlow, indeed!" The married sister
sniffed.</p>

<p>"Now, Mamie," Vivian said as patiently as she could. Which was
not anything wonderful in that line. "I know how you feel, and
why you feel like that, just on my account. But you needn't. I
had broken off my engagement with Anthony yesterday morning. He
was free. He wasn't running away from me," she finished a little
proudly.</p>

<p>"Why did you give him up? Because of this woman?" Her sister
continued hotly, "Vi, I'm surprised at you! Anthony Cross loved
you, and you alone. I don't care what she says. He loved
<i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>Vivian put up a hand to stay her. Mamie's cheeks were flaming.
She could be a terribly red-hot partisan, as her sister knew.</p>

<p>"Don't, Mamie, dear! It's not fair to any of us to weigh which
of the two women he loved the better. <i>I</i> know. And so does
Mrs. Brownlow&mdash;and I don't mind. No, no!" in answer to her
sister's opening mouth, "don't Mamie! I know how you mean
it&mdash;just out of championship for me&mdash;but the sympathy's
not necessary. Not for me, and&mdash;what you say isn't
true."</p>

<p>"Vivian Young! Why, how you talk! Of course it's true!"</p>

<p>Vivian shook her head.</p>

<p>"Anthony told me himself about her," she said finally. "He
told me that it was over and done with. I know he thought so."
She shut her eyes to the doubts about that.</p>

<p>"Vivian," Mrs. Gatwick spoke more quietly now. The two were
sitting on the couch at the end of the bed. "There's something
wrong about all this. I don't believe it was a duel at all. I
believe that woman is lying out of whole cloth when she says that
she was going to run away with your Anthony. What have you got to
go on but her word? I didn't tell you, but Anthony Cross talked
to me the day before he asked you to marry him. He thought he was
too old for you. And too&mdash;well, too conventional for your
fancy. He spoke of his love for you. I wish I could repeat his
words, and above all, his tone. He loved you, dear heart. Loved
you really and truly. Nothing, no lies, no police theories,
<i>nothing</i> would make me think that the man who spoke of you
like that could, within a month, be trying to run off with
another man's wife. Not a man of Anthony Cross's character. I was
ever so pleased when you took him. That was why I told you about
George helping you out as he did. It seemed brutal, but I thought
you might not take him otherwise. And about this old love affair
of his, he told me, as apparently he did you, that it was
absolutely done with. I guess he would find it easier to talk to
me about her than to you. He said he's seen her quite lately, and
found that not a spark of his old feeling remained. That even if
she were free, he wouldn't marry her. He added, it's true, that
she still wasn't free, but he assured me that he hadn't the
slightest trace of love for her left. And you think, after that,
that he would run away with her?"</p>

<p>"No," Vivian said, feeling exhausted with this flood of
argument which did not stir her; "no, Mamie, but I think he was
talking like that to you because he wanted it to be like that.
And perhaps he really thought it."</p>

<p>"I don't believe anything of what they say here. Anthony Cross
wasn't the sort of man to have duels," Mrs. Gatwick said
vehemently.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the dead man's valet, who was speaking to the
police just then, was saying very much this same thing as the
last sentence of Mamie Gatwick.</p>

<p>He was a typically quiet-spoken, quiet-eyed man. Starling had
been with Sir Anthony Cross only a little over a year but he felt
quite certain of his employer's characters, though Sir Anthony
was a man who never, under any circumstances, took him into his
confidence in any way.</p>

<p>"Or any one else, as far as I know, sir," he added laconically
to Chief Inspector Pointer.</p>

<p>As to the engagement to Miss Young, Starling had heard of
that. He had ventured to congratulate Sir Anthony, who had
replied that he considered himself a very lucky man. He, the
valet, knew of nothing whatever that would explain a duel between
his master and Mr. Brownlow, a name he now heard for the first
time.</p>

<p>"But is it the sort of thing that surprises you?" Mackay
asked. "I mean, was your employer the kind of man to fight
another man easily?"</p>

<p>"The very last man in the world, I should say," Starling
replied decidedly. "If it hadn't happened, I should say it was
the sort of thing that couldn't happen. I never knew Sir Anthony
lose his temper. And, if I may presume to say so, that was the
character I had from his late valet when I took the place."</p>

<p>The list of articles found on Sir Anthony and in the bags was
handed to him. As far as he could tell, nothing was missing, but
Sir Anthony had packed his smaller bag himself. Starling knew
nothing of its contents, which must have included the revolver
that he now identified as a revolver which his late master
generally carried while traveling. The smaller bag was one
exclusively used, as far as he knew, for important papers and
such like. Papers which Sir Anthony had probably dealt with by
now.</p>

<p>"About coming to Cluny, do you know if it had long been in Sir
Anthony's mind?" Cambier next asked, through Pointer.</p>

<p>The valet thought it a sudden decision. "We were staying at
Enghien-les-Bains with some friends of Sir Anthony's. Yes, Mr.
and Mrs. Gatwick and Miss Young. Sir Anthony was going back to
London tomorrow; Mrs. Gatwick and Miss Young were to join him in
August at his place in Yorkshire. It was three days ago that my
master told me suddenly that I was to pack a bag for
him&mdash;that he was going away for several days and would not
want me till his return to Paris tomorrow. He told me to put a
dress suit in, and gave me my instructions as to reserving seats
and a cabin for our journey back to England. That evening he
dined with Mr. and Mrs. Gatwick, and afterwards he gave me some
final directions. Sir Anthony spoke of looking over the monuments
down here for two, at most, three days."</p>

<p>"Was he interested in such things?"</p>

<p>"Very much so."</p>

<p>"There was nothing out of the way, nothing that now strikes
you as odd, about his coming down here?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he often go without you?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes he would, sir. When it was a case of any business
he would often be good enough to dispense with my services."</p>

<p>As to who was the person of Sir Anthony's family to summon to
Cluny to take charge of the body, Starling said that he has
already cabled the dreadful news to Mr. Maitland, a great friend
of his master's. Mr. Maitland, therefore, might be expected to
arrive, or at least, cable some instructions, any moment.</p>

<p>"Was your master a good shot?" Rondeau wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Was he fond of dancing?"</p>

<p>"Uncommonly fond of it," was the answer, and with that he was
dismissed.</p>

<p>"Yet Sir Cross did not dance last night," Rondeau remarked
when they were alone. Like his chief, he considered that the use
of the Christian name implied familiarity or affection.</p>

<p>"He was possibly carrying a loaded revolver on him," Cambier
pointed out dryly. "Well, messieurs, I see no reason to change my
verdict. A duel. Not a crime. The bodies of the two men will be
free when the doctor's final report is made, and can then be
coffined and taken away in due course." He stopped. The door was
jerked open and Mrs. Gatwick bounded in. No other word describes
her energy or her action.</p>

<p>"Say, chief, I want Mrs. Brownlow arrested for the murder of
my sister's fiancé, Sir Anthony Cross," she began. "I told you
about the engagement&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very clearly indeed," murmured Cambier hurriedly. "Well, I've
just had an interview with that woman," Mrs. Gatwick went on, in
her fluent but faulty French; "and there's not a word of truth in
her story. I believe she shot poor Sir Anthony because he
wouldn't run away with her, and then killed her husband to
prevent his giving her in charge. And what are you going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>Evidently order the French equivalent of Black Maria was the
least that the lady expected. Mrs. Gatwick resembled one of those
electric eels put into fish tanks on long journeys to insure that
the fish caught will keep in good condition, for only by great
agility and an uncommon turn of speed can they escape. Yet to
look at, Mrs. Gatwick was a small and pretty blonde, with rather
gentle, wistful, blue eyes.</p>

<p>The house was in a turmoil within five minutes. It took the
whole of her hour's stay in Cluny to induce her to allow matters
to continue as they were. But occasionally folly, or what seems
like it, is justified of her children too. This was such a case,
for half an hour after Mrs. Gatwick's very disgruntled return to
Paris and her children&mdash;her husband was in bed with a
chill&mdash;came a piece of news that made her accusation against
Mrs. Brownlow no less wild, but at least less preposterous.</p>

<p>The fully-completed autopsy brought a staggering fact to
light. There was no possibility of doubting the proofs adduced,
and they altered everything.</p>

<p>As was known, both men had drunk of Monsieur Pichegru's
claret-cup at the same time. In it had been woodruff, and the
stages of the absorption of that herb into the system is as
accurate as a clock.</p>

<p>Medical examination showed that Sir Anthony had been killed
about an hour after the drink. Whereas Brownlow could not have
received his bullet until nearer an hour and a half had gone by.
In other words, there was an interval of around thirty minutes
between the two deaths, and it was Anthony Cross, the injured
man, who had died first. Probably a couple of minutes after the
infliction of the wound in his side.</p>

<p>What had been taken for a duel, now stood out as a crime, or
two crimes, very cunningly camouflaged by the criminal or
criminals.</p>

<p><i>"Mon dieu!"</i> Cambier stood for a moment as though the
doctor's final bulletin had been a spell depriving him of the
power of moving. Then he came to life with a bound. Orders
rattled swiftly.</p>

<p>He turned to Pointer.</p>

<p>"The case is from now on, of course, in the hands of the
<i>juge d'instruction</i>, or I should at once question Madam
Brownlow again, but he will be here immediately. Until his
arrival I have enjoined absolute silence in the matter on all my
men."</p>

<p>The <i>juge d'instruction</i> is an official whose powers and
duties might be loosely compared to those of an American coroner.
Or one of our own coroners; sitting, however, without a jury, and
on an inquest which continues until, in his opinion, the case is
sufficiently clear for him to have an arrest made, and decide
whether the arrested person shall be sent up to stand his trial
or is to be released. He has most formidable powers of loosing
and binding.</p>

<p>"But what about Monsieur Smith off in Vichy?" asked Rondeau
under his breath.</p>

<p>"He will be safe enough there. Nor is there any question of
Monsieur Smith&mdash;as yet."</p>

<p>"And Monsieur Murgatroyd in Paris! And what about Monsieur
Tibbitts, still at large," Rondeau went on.</p>

<p>"What about all the guests at large!" snapped Cambier; "we
must take the case as it is, not as we would have it. We are not
writing a novel, we! Besides, remember, whoever staged this
little tableau in the cedar room here thinks that he&mdash;or
she&mdash;has hoodwinked us. Let them continue to think so. As
for Tibbitts, he will return. Whether innocent or guilty, he will
soon return. Why should he not? But let me see the key of the
cedar room again." He hurried to the room in question. "Yes, yes!
Here are marks that might have been made by ring-nippers such as
hotel thieves use, such as we detectives use, to turn a
key&mdash;left in a keyhole&mdash;from the other side of the
door." Cambier frowned down at the scratches in question. "But
this means that a professional, a trained criminal, has been at
work here. <i>Sapristi!</i>" He turned to Rondeau with a wry
smile, "Well, for once I acknowledge that the simple explanation
was too simple. <i>Eh bien</i>, we must build another. We
know&mdash;what do we know? That Brownlow could have killed Sir
Cross, and that a bullet from his automatic probably caused Sir
Cross's death&mdash;though the make is very usual. And we know
that a bullet from Sir Cross's automatic killed Brownlow later
on, for his revolver is not usual, but that Sir Cross could not
have fired the shot himself.</p>

<p>"I think these odd facts mean that both men were shot by some
third party who had possessed himself, or herself, of their
revolvers, and, after inveigling them one after the other into
the cedar room, shot each with the other's revolver, knowing of
the jealousy between them. Knowing perhaps of the contemplated
elopement of Madam Brownlow. Anything else would mean a
combination of chances so strange that they would verge on the
improbable. To suppose, for instance, that Brownlow killed Sir
Cross, and then, some half-hour later, was himself slain by
another hand." Cambier shook his head. "That is highly fantastic.
For that presupposes two murderers&mdash;two motives&mdash;"</p>

<p>For once Rondeau made no reply. He was thinking too hard over
the absolute reversal by the final medical bulletin of all that
had been taken for granted. Then he broke out:</p>

<p>"But I ask myself, what if Monsieur Tibbitts does not return?
He went off very early. He should have been back by
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget, <i>mon cher</i>, that this is supposed to be a
duel!" Cambier reminded him dryly; "there is no reason why all
the world should not come and go, therefore. As for Tibbitts, he
has probably had a breakdown, or, since he was in the state
suggested by the butler, a smash-up somewhere is delaying him. In
any case, since he is using that particular car, we need not
worry, for&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment the sergeant came in. One of the police had
found a small, round-barreled, slotted key in the garden. He had
found it by chance as he stooped to retrieve a dropped cigar. It
was lying in a cut of the turf, quite hidden from view, though
apparently not buried in any way.</p>

<p>The commissaire had the finder and the object found brought
in. He eyed the key closely.</p>

<p>"Not well finished...Very good metal...No number on it...Where
exactly did you find it?"</p>

<p>The man took him to the exact spot. Rondeau followed like a
terrier. The key had lain close to the gate, under some leaves,
and on the right-hand side of the drive going away from the
house. The cut in the turf into which it had fallen, or had been
thrown, or hidden, was very close to the path, a bare inch from
it, though completely out of sight.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon chef</i>," Rondeau said as the two walked back
together; "you always beg me not to embroider. Very well, this
time I do nothing. I content myself with admiring the pattern
presented by the facts."</p>

<p>"Just as well," Cambier thought. "For one of the guests may
have dropped it&mdash;though it has all the look to me of a
handmade key. There is something in the barrel&mdash;we will have
it analyzed at once. But first I will ask Monsieur Pichegru and
Madame Brownlow if either has ever seen it. Just to make
sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I asked myself at the time if the officer from Scotland Yard
was not right in thinking that something had been hunted
for&mdash;on that side of the path," Rondeau muttered half
aloud.</p>

<p>"And why should not an English official be
right&mdash;sometimes?" Cambier spoke with conscious generosity
as he reached for the telephone.</p>

<p>A little later Pichegru rushed up in his car, gasped at the
latest news, stamped about the floor, and raved at the
impossibility of being in two places at once. He seemed genuinely
distraught at the conjunction of a murder at his villa and a fire
at his warehouse.</p>

<p>As to the key, he disclaimed all knowledge of it. There was a
safe in his study, but its key was quite different. He now handed
over all his house keys to the police, insisting on their
examining everything.</p>

<p>"Search anywhere you like," he begged; "but you will not find
why those two mad Englishmen decided to shoot each
other&mdash;ah, I forget, it is not a duel! But in any case, what
can I do? I am not of the police. But I must&mdash;I must
superintend the re-racking of my Chambertin!"</p>

<p>The commissaire was all sympathy. He told him to wait for the
arrival of the <i>juge d'instruction</i>, a personal friend of
Monsieur Pichegru's.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame Brownlow was shown the key. She said that she
was sure that she had never seen it before, and that it could
not, therefore, belong to her husband. All his keys were
accounted for. As to whether it belonged to Sir Anthony Cross,
she could not, of course, say.</p>

<p>But the valet was positive that he had never seen it before.
Though that might not mean much. Vivian Young, though that meant
even less, was equally sure that she had never seen it in Anthony
Cross's possession.</p>

<p>The guests of last night were asked over the telephone whether
any of them had lost a key. The same inquiry was passed around
the shop assistants and other helpers. Though a great many could
not be reached, all those to whom the question could be put
replied in the negative.</p>

<p>The analysis of the dark matter found in the shaft proved to
be dried blood, and dried in such a way that it must have lain in
a little pool of it, and not been used since.</p>

<p>Now, the only pool of blood was in the clothing&mdash;over the
heart&mdash;of Brownlow. The key contained nothing else, no fluff
of any kind, and no dust, which rather suggested that it had been
used immediately prior to the shooting. A hint of oil bore this
out. The police analyst thought it was a key that had been fairly
frequently used, that it was of amateur make, and that, as the
commissaire suggested, it was possibly the key of a safe.</p>

<p>Pointer looked it over carefully too. Mackay stared at it
hard.</p>

<p>"It's not unlike one Mr. Davidson had in that pocket-book he
lost," he said finally. "I'm na sure o' course. He just said twa
keys, and described them. Now, wud it be possible to send this to
Mr. Davidson?"</p>

<p>The commissaire explained that that would be quite impossible.
If Mr. Mackay really thought the key tallied with that lost by
his employer, a subpoena would be at once issued, and Mr.
Davidson would have to appear in person. The key could not be
allowed to leave the Hotel de ville, where it would be deposited
within the hour.</p>

<p>Mackay scratched his chin.</p>

<p>"He wud be pleased!" he murmured to Pointer. "He's just
stairted in on a maist important job. If he was ca'd off doon
here, whether it was his key or no, he'd shoot me for having
brought him awa frae Paris just the noo. I'll na risk it."</p>

<p>He looked at the key again. "The mair I study it, the less
resemblance I find to Mr. Davidson's," he said finally; "and
that's true enough. Not just said to avoid being shot by
Davidson."</p>

<p>"Probably it belonged to Sir Cross," Cambier said, taking it
back and carefully locking it in his steel box. "We knew that it
was not Monsieur Brownlow's. Or at least we have cause to think
so. Ladies are as a rule only too eager to get hold of the keys
of their husband's safes&mdash;their contents are not subject to
death duties with us, you know. But as to who dropped it by that
gate&mdash;why it was flung away... Cambier stood looking down at
his locked box as though it were a crystal.</p>

<p>"I ask myself if it was not some one who thought himself
suspected," Rondeau burst out. "I might wonder, for instance, if
the some one who had taken it had not taken something more
valuable, say the pocket-book which contained this key, and that
he did not want the key, and flung it away as being only an
additional danger if found on him. Flung it from a motor car,
say&mdash;in other words I ask myself if Tibbitts was not the
loser. The man who left so very very early and has not
returned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tranquilize yourself," murmured Cambier; "even should he not
intend to return&mdash;which would be absurd with that nice
little duel set in the cedar room as I have told you
before&mdash;still, should he not return, thanks to Detective
Good-luck we should not have the slightest difficulty in tracing
his car. I will ease your mind by telling you that that is being
done now. At this minute."</p>

<p>Turning to Pointer the commissaire explained that a car of
similar make, and with an all but similar number, had been wanted
for a long time for vine-stealing on a large scale from the
vineyards around. It was a French make, bought in Lyons.</p>

<p>"We said nothing about it to Monsieur Brownlow, but twice his
has been stopped by over-zealous gendarmes because he was driving
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I ask myself why he did not resent those stoppages
and questionings," Rondeau said, in the tone of one who intends
this time to finish his sentence, come what may.</p>

<p>"Now Rondeau, I beg you!" his chief threw in, but in vain.</p>

<p>"I have been talking with one of the <i>agents</i> who did the
stopping, and I ask myself why a man should be polite when he had
a right to be angry. Why Monsieur Brownlow was always polite to
the police&mdash;almost deprecating. As though he wished, at all
costs, to avoid any trouble with them. And that makes me proceed
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To superintend the search in the gardens, my lad. From end to
end," finished Cambier. "You are younger than I am, so that a
couple of years spent in probing into the reasons for Monsieur
Brownlow's ordinary civility means nothing to you, but at my age
time is more valuable. <i>Allez, travailler!</i> Here comes the
<i>juge</i>. Once he gets indoors, of course, all hopes of
keeping it to ourselves that there is a crime to investigate will
be gone," He gave his orders to the sergeant. From now on every
one coming to and going from the villa, unless well-known
tradesmen or the men investigating the case, were to be followed.
All telephone messages were to be taken down. All letters handed
to him, Cambier, to distribute.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">MONSIEUR GRANDPOINT, the <i>juge</i> in
question, was at the villa before Cambier had finished speaking.
He was a severe-looking man, with a narrow forehead and bleak
eyes. In manner he was distant but very patient, with a patience
that was inexorable rather than gentle. He could be a formidable
cross-examiner, unhurried and persistent. But he absolutely
agreed with Monsieur Pichegru that the latter could be of no more
help to the police in Cluny than in Dijon, and of infinitely
greater use to himself in the latter place. Monsieur Pichegru's
alibi had been tested. There was not a moment of last night when
he had not been accounted for.</p>

<p>On being asked to tell them all he could about Tibbitts,
before he left, he said at once that he knew very little about
that young man. As a rule, he was exceedingly careful who his
guests were. He felt that he owed this to his neighbors, he
added, with a bow to the <i>juge</i> who bowed in return. But
unfortunately in the case of Tibbitts&mdash;Pichegru explained
that the young man was the Brownlows' protegé, who had come upon
him at Monte Carlo making ducks and drakes of his money and
getting into a most undesirable set. When Brownlow, came to Cluny
to recuperate, Tibbitts had accompanied the pair. He, Pichegru,
had not cared for his presence in the house, but Mrs. Brownlow
had been so sorry for the oaf that he had not liked to press the
point. They were all three leaving shortly to return to
England.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow had told him that she had an idea that Tibbitts
had been a clerk in a drapery shop when he came into a big
fortune. Mr. Murgatroyd had happened to mention to him, only last
night, that undoubtedly the young man had been a metal worker of
some kind, that his knowledge of foundry work was first-hand and
thorough. Pichegru had no further information apparently to give
on the subject of the young man. Questioned as to Tibbitts's
infatuation for Mrs. Brownlow, an infatuation which the
<i>juge</i> had noticed when he had dined at the villa, Pichegru,
with a faint smile, said that it was Tibbitts's one redeeming
trait. Certainly Brownlow had not seemed to mind it. Not in the
least. Monsieur Pichegru was quite certain on this point.</p>

<p>"About that journey to Paris a fortnight ago, in the
<i>rapide</i>, when two of your guests lost, the one a large sum
of money, the other some very valuable, and insufficiently
insured jewels, monsieur," put in the commissaire; "Tibbitts was
one of the party, was he not?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Pichegru agreed that Tibbitts had been there, as had
Monsieur Smith.</p>

<p>Now Smith was still considered by the police as definitely out
of the possible suspects&mdash;like Monsieur Pichegru himself.
Not only was he a subaltern in a crack regiment, a cavalry
regiment, but last night he had been in the public eye
practically all the time.</p>

<p>True, it only takes one second to fire a shot that kills a
man, and only two, therefore, to kill two men; but in Smith's
case there really seemed no motive to raise any suspicion of his
having played a part in the tragedy.</p>

<p>Monsieur Pichegru was asked a few more questions and then
dismissed to his car with the official blessing, as it were. And
the <i>juge</i> turned his attention to the real members of the
circle. He proposed an interview with Mrs. Brownlow first of
all.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> had dined at the villa only a fortnight ago
and had talked to the Brownlows a good deal. More to Mrs.
Brownlow than to her husband, but then, all men did that. And she
was his compatriot by birth.</p>

<p>The four of them were shown into her sitting-room now. She was
seated in front of a writing-table, apparently reading old
letters. Very evidently she had been crying.</p>

<p>At the sight of the <i>juge</i> she rose to greet him with a
gasp of surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, how glad I am to see you!" she said prettily.</p>

<p>"Madam, prepare yourself for a shock," the <i>juge</i> said
gently; "the doctors have just handed in their final report. And
everything is changed. Monsieur Brownlow died about half an hour
after Sir Anthony Cross. You understand? There was no duel. It
could not have been Sir Anthony Cross who killed your husband.
The revolvers lying beside each man were blinds. False evidence.
Yet we still think that a bullet from the revolver of Monsieur
Brownlow killed Sir Anthony Cross. And your husband could have
fired it, madam. You comprehend?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow looked too stunned to understand anything. She
covered her face with her hands for a long moment. They were
trembling violently.</p>

<p>"I understand your emotion, madam," the <i>juge</i> said, with
a touch of real feeling. "Would that I could respect it and leave
you to your thoughts&mdash;your memories. But I must continue. It
is quite possible that both men were shot down by a third person,
for we have just been told that Sir Anthony Cross was the head of
a large diamond syndicate. The South African Diamond
Combine."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow lowered her hands to her lap very slowly. Over
her face came the look of a wanderer who, lost in the dark, at
last catches sight of a light.</p>

<p>"So <i>that</i> was why!" she breathed. "Not on my account.
Thank heaven! But because he was helping Sir Anthony Cross in
some deal, my husband was shot down!"</p>

<p>"Helping Sir Cross in a deal?" repeated Cambier; "you said no
word of that before, madam!"</p>

<p>"I never thought of it till now. I thought that it was
I&mdash;that it was over me&mdash;" She drew a deep breath. "But,
as a matter of fact, Mr. Brownlow was acting for the time-being
as a sort of secret go-between for Sir Anthony, either for the
purchase of, or the sale of, some big stone or stones. I think
that was why he went to Paris a couple of weeks ago. The time
when I lost my jewels in the <i>rapide</i> on joining him."</p>

<p>"But this is very interesting!" said the <i>juge</i>. Every
one nodded. "But I thought there was ill will between your
husband and Sir Anthony?"</p>

<p>"Not until this visit down here. But when I was told that a
duel had been fought, it seemed that it must have been over me.
For"&mdash;she looked at Cambier&mdash;"as I told the
commissaire, Sir Anthony and I were thinking of going away
together. It was madness on my part&mdash;a passing madness. But
I feared that my husband must have learned of our intention. I
never even gave a thought to the possibility of murder!"</p>

<p>"And this business between the two? Can you be more explicit,
madam?"</p>

<p>"About a month, or six weeks ago, I happened to notice my
husband reading a letter in Sir Anthony Cross's hand-writing. I
saw him tear it up very carefully into tiny scraps. I asked him
how he came to be hearing from our&mdash;old friend he had once
been very jealous of him and me&mdash;and why he said nothing
about the letter to me. He told me that Sir Anthony wanted him to
undertake 'a rather delicate bit of business'"&mdash;she gave the
last words in English&mdash;"that the terms were so tempting that
he intended to accept, but that the business in question was a
close secret between himself and Sir Anthony. That he would not
have spoken of it even to me yet, but for my noticing the
writing. He went into no details. And I may even be wrong in
thinking that the visit to Paris was connected with the receipt
of that letter. But I think it was. Or he would have taken me
with him. When I ran across Sir Anthony down here in Cluny, I
thought, of course, that he had come to see Tom. But neither man
would acknowledge as much. At least, Tom refused to say one way
or another, only he told me to be sure and refer to the meeting
at the table so as to give him a chance of speaking of Sir
Anthony before the others. When I did so, he himself spoke as
though it were years since he had heard from Sir Anthony. Sir
Anthony was coming in after dinner for a chat, so he had said,
when I met him. My husband told me to have everything look like a
mere chance meeting of old friends. He was most insistent on this
point. So insistent"&mdash;she passed a hand across her
eyes&mdash;"that now I realize that he believed there was danger
in anything else. But whom did he dread? Who was there at the
table with us who had to be misled?"</p>

<p>She stared at the men with fear-distended eyes.</p>

<p>"The man who took the revolvers and locked that cedar room
door from the outside&mdash;but with the key on the inside,"
Cambier said gravely. "And, now can you tell us whether the
murderer might have obtained possession of your husband's pistol
fairly easily?"</p>

<p>"Very easily indeed. My husband kept his automatic in that
little locked cabinet on the wall, there where you see the
crossed foils. The key was always in the copper vase standing on
the top of the cabinet."</p>

<p>"It does not seem to have called for a vast amount of scheming
to obtain possession of the weapon," Cambier murmured dryly; "but
who would know of the place where it was kept?"</p>

<p>She thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I think all the other guests must have seen him take it out
or put it back. The shooting gallery is on this floor, you
know&mdash;the picture gallery which Monsieur Pichegru uses for
that purpose. And on dull afternoons my husband used to practice
with our host, and with Mr. Tibbitts, too, a good deal."</p>

<p>"Ah, with Monsieur Tibbitts," nodded Cambier. "With no one
else?"</p>

<p>"With Mr. Smith, of course. And yesterday with Miss
Young."</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured the <i>juge</i>; "Mademoiselle Young&mdash;she
can shoot then?"</p>

<p>"Very well indeed. She beat Monsieur Pichegru, and he is as
good as my husband was."</p>

<p>"And Monsieur Tibbitts, was he good?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. But, really, I don't know."</p>

<p>There was a short pause. Cambier broke it. "So then, if Sir
Cross was equally easygoing as to the place, probably his bag,
where he kept his revolver last night, it, too, could have been
obtained quite easily..."</p>

<p>"However it was managed about the revolvers," Mrs. Brownlow
spoke as though that part of it were of small importance; "at
least their deaths have nothing to do with me! I shall not have
to drag out my days under a feeling of guilt almost too heavy to
be borne."</p>

<p>"...And the revolvers were changed afterwards&mdash;changed to
put us off the track," Cambier murmured slowly.</p>

<p>"By the man who shot my husband," she finished. "Unless, of
course, they might have been changed by accident. Monsieur Smith,
and Mademoiselle Young, and the butler, were all in the room
before you came. So was I, of course. How easy to take up the
weapons to look at and get them mixed in putting them down again.
But of one thing I feel sure. My husband either disturbed the
murderer of Sir Anthony, or, equally with Sir Anthony, was in the
murderer's way. And because of that, both men were killed."</p>

<p>"And then the scene was set for a duel..." Cambier nodded.</p>

<p>"How about your husband's papers?" asked the <i>juge</i>; "we
must look through them, madam."</p>

<p>"Certainly. But he kept few notes. He prided himself on his
memory. As to business papers, they would, I expect, be in his
London safe. In the city. His partner is a Mr. Tenby," she gave
the address; "but he would know nothing of any business between
my husband and Sir Anthony. He was not at all in Mr. Brownlow's
confidence, except as regards the actual business of the
firm."</p>

<p>She sank back as though exhausted, and certainly looked
it.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor head!" she gasped. "Please send for Dr. Bourelly;
I feel so faint. Perhaps Miss Young would come to me?"</p>

<p>"We will see to it that she is asked to come, though first I
want to have a little talk with her. But, madam, for the moment,
not a word to any one of what has been discovered by the doctors.
Not a word. Not to any one!" the <i>juge</i> repeated
impressively.</p>

<p>On that they left her. Half-way down the stairs the sergeant
met them.</p>

<p>"We have news of Monsieur Tibbitts. He was last seen driving
very fast away from Autun."</p>

<p>"From Autun? That means he's making for Paris!" ejaculated
Rondeau. "And as a rule&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I permit myself to suggest that, before giving us that rule,
you thoroughly investigate Monsieur Tibbitts's rooms at once,"
his chief threw in with ominous politeness. Rondeau leaped up the
stairs again and whizzed round the corner like a skater.</p>

<p>"He is as good at finding truffles as any pig in the land,"
Cambier said tolerantly; "only he lacks experience when it comes
to cooking them. But he will make a good detective in time. Oh,
much, much time&mdash;when he ceases to ask himself so many
questions." He rapidly explained to the <i>juge</i> as they
passed downstairs how Tibbitts came to be making for Autun, or
Paris, in Brownlow's fast car.</p>

<p>A moment later there came a theatrical whisper of <i>"Mon
chef!"</i> down the stairs. Rondeau was beckoning excitedly.</p>

<p>"Shall we see what he has found?" Cambier asked Pointer.</p>

<p>Mackay attached himself to them, and the three joined the
commissaire's <i>aide</i> in the large room that had been
assigned to Tibbitts on his arrival with the Brownlows. It was
rather a bare-looking place, but a couple of folding double
doors, now locked, connected with the Brownlow's rooms.</p>

<p>Rondeau was holding out a pair of dancing pumps. On the glass-smooth soles were smears of reddish brown.</p>

<p>Cambier took them from him and touched the stains with
something from a bottle that he had put in his pocket early that
morning. They were bloodstains. The commissaire whipped off his
own footwear and looked at the soles closely.</p>

<p>"No there are no marks on mine."</p>

<p>Nor were there on the shoes of Chief Inspector Pointer or
Mackay.</p>

<p>"These shoes of Monsieur Tibbitts&mdash;if they are really
his&mdash;walked over that carpet downstairs in the cedar room
when the bloodstains there were quite fresh."</p>

<p>Now, though he did not need to recall it to the minds of any
of them, the only stains on the carpet were around Sir Anthony
Cross. That unfortunate man had fallen sideways. Certain marks
made it look as though he had raised himself on his elbow and
shifted his position before he died, though they now knew that he
had not, as had been at first thought, then fired the shot that
killed Brownlow outright.</p>

<p>"So Monsieur Tibbitts was in this cedar room, apparently. And
probably he could have possessed himself without any great
difficulty of the revolvers of both Sir Cross and Mr. Brownlow.
Also, he must have been aware of the jealousy between the two
men, and might have known of madam's intention of leaving her
husband with the other man. Monsieur Tibbitts is supposed to have
been helped to bed in a state&mdash;well, verging on
intoxication. That might be a clever ruse. A very clever
one."</p>

<p>"Then it wasna Tibbitts's," Mackay said contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Ah, do not be too sure!" Cambier retorted meaningly; "these
stupid young men can be very clever sometimes. Remember that one
of the men murdered was one of those who helped him up to
bed&mdash;would be convinced, therefore, of his helplessness.
That would lull any suspicions to rest&mdash;supposing even
Brownlow had them. And yet would leave the butler to report the
occurrence to us. A very useful alibi is helpless
drunkenness."</p>

<p>Cambier and Rondeau both searched the room from end to end but
they found nothing more. Of any such pliers, or nippers, as would
have been necessary to lock the cedar room door as it had been
locked, they found no sign.</p>

<p>What they did find was a strange mixture of wear. Tibbitts's
underclothes varied from silken splendor, bought, judging by its
little tag, in Monte Carlo, to cotton, very much in need of
mending, or the dustbin.</p>

<p>Cambier, leading the way, then locked the door, and rejoined
the <i>juge</i> in the writing-room, where he sat reading over
the notes.</p>

<p>Cambier showed him the shoes.</p>

<p>"He forgot these," he said laconically. "Some day there'll be
a criminal with a really good memory. But, so far, there is
not."</p>

<p>"And this young man was very infatuated with Madam Brownlow,
as I myself noticed," the <i>juge</i> mused. "We will see about
identifying the shoes."</p>

<p>This was done within ten minutes. They were undoubtedly
Tibbitts's.</p>

<p>The commissaire turned to Mackay.</p>

<p>"You must have had your suspicions of this Tibbitts, monsieur,
or you would not have been staying down here. You, who are on the
hunt for the stolen money."</p>

<p>Hitherto the private investigator had been only tolerated as
far as the police went, now he moved up into the position of an
ally.</p>

<p>Mackay was answering with caution. A caution that impressed
the commissaire. This man had brains. Only a man with brains, in
the commissaire's opinion, held his tongue. Cambier finally drew
out of Mackay the confession that he believed it possible that
Tibbitts had stolen the sum of money lost by Mr. Davidson.</p>

<p>"Did Monsieur Davidson suspect his fellow guest and fellow
traveler of having stolen his money?" the <i>juge</i> asked
Mackay. The private inquiry agent nodded.</p>

<p>"Aye, he suspects him strongly, as is logical. But we have nae
proof. Nor am I sure in ma ain mind that it was he who took money
or jewels."</p>

<p>"Monsieur thinks?" queried the <i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>"I have a notion that it was Brownlow," Mackay said, after a
moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>"Brownlow!" All the men stared at the private inquiry agent in
surprise. "But the drugging&mdash;" Cambier protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tibbitts was an accomplice, no doubt. But I have na heard
anything that proves that the money and the jewels werna stolen
before the train started. Brownlow was at the station to see his
wife off. He claimed&mdash;and would have got the insurance put
on them. A low enough insurance, but five hundred is a useful bit
o' siller. In ma opeenion," Mackay said finally, "the jewels were
too peculiar to have been stolen by a clever thief. Broken up,
they would not have been of any great value. None of the stones
was of remarkable size as far as I can learn."</p>

<p>"But Brownlow is a wealthy man!" protested Cambier.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Mackay asked sceptically. "If he's in Chinese
silks, then he's in troubled waters these years."</p>

<p>"That might explain why he was so willing to take on the offer
of Sir Cross," mused Cambier.</p>

<p>"Supposing that it was ever made," Mackay said to Pointer.</p>

<p><i>"Quoi?"</i> asked the <i>juge</i>, catching the tone.</p>

<p>Mackay repeated his remark in his Scottish-French.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> raised his very arched eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You think Madam Brownlow was lying?"</p>

<p>Mackay refused to commit himself to that, but she had not
convinced him that she was telling the truth, he said. Not at any
time throughout the interview.</p>

<p>"So far, I see no reason to doubt her statement," the
<i>juge</i> said coldly. "She is a lady for whom all we who know
her have the greatest respect. As for her husband&mdash;my only
impression of him was of a well-traveled, well-educated man. A
man of the world."</p>

<p>But coming back to Mackay's doubts of the lady's statement,
the <i>juge</i> wanted to know what caused them.</p>

<p>"Sir Anthony wasna a seller or buyer of diamonds," Mackay went
on; "and he wad hae mony a mon to his hand if he wanted some
particular stane. It doesna stand to reason that he wad hae
written to a mon he hadna had any dealings wi' for years just to
dae a thing like yon for him. Brownlow was in silk&mdash;not
gems."</p>

<p>"Still, in the case of some particular stone or gem wanted,
that would not matter," the <i>juge</i> said slowly. "The
Brownlows had just come from Monte Carlo, where the most amazing
jewels can be seen at times. I can imagine that Sir Anthony had
noticed the Brownlows' name as present at some dinner or
entertainment given by the person whose jewels he hoped to buy.
Oh, at Monte Carlo dinners are given with no other reason at
times! No, Monsieur Mackay, I think you are prejudiced in your
suspicions of Brownlow. But pray, proceed. Do I understand that
you doubt madam's account of the letter that she claims her
husband received from <i>le fou baron</i>?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was over hasty in saying what I have," Mackay now
confessed. "I go a bit carried awa', and that's the truth.</p>

<p>"For myself," Cambier said decidedly; "for myself, the
criminal, so far, seems Tibbitts. We know that the key on the
inside of the door has been turned with very up-to-date ring
nippers. By an expert. Who would be more skillful in their use
than the metal worker Tibbitts? I believe&mdash;I
myself&mdash;that this young man tacked himself on to the
Brownlows because of Monsieur Brownlow's intention of joining a
big banking concern in Lyons, the Banque Agricole et Commerciale.
He was considering, so we have been informed for some time, the
opening of a branch in London, after he had become a partner. In
spite of your suspicions, Monsieur Mackay, I can assure you that
your dead compatriot was considered in banking circles in Lyons
as a man of considerable, though tied-up means. Yes," Cambier
repeated thoughtfully, "it looks to me as though this Tibbitts
had thrown himself in the way of the future banker at Monte Carlo
and played both at being a fool, and a rich fool. It is only an
idea, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it fits!" echoed Rondeau enthusiastically. "I asked
myself more than once why a young man should bury himself here in
Cluny. Even the fine eyes of madam would hardly compensate for
the lack of other things to look at."</p>

<p>They were back at the villa, and the <i>juge</i> proposed to
question Mrs. Brownlow once more, this time with a view to
further information about Tibbitts. But Mrs. Brownlow was no help
whatever. She had not the faintest idea, she said, who Tibbitts
was, nor whence he came. All she knew was that at Monte Carlo he
was so obviously a sheep waiting for the shearers that first her
husband, and then she herself, had been interested in the young
man.</p>

<p>"Why in him especially?" Mackay wanted to know. "If it was
just that the sprockle flung his sillar aboot daft like." Mrs.
Brownlow looked a trifle impatient.</p>

<p>"How can one say why one is sorry for one person and not for
another?" she asked in the tone of one putting an unanswerable
question. "Perhaps it was because he seemed to like us so much.
My husband doesn't often care for young men of his type, but he
asked me to do what I could to get him away from the set with
whom he was mixing. I did. And the result was that Mr. Tibbitts
followed us here, or perhaps that's too strong a word, but when
he asked if he could come too, as he was at a loose end for a
fortnight, neither Tom nor I minded. Personally, I was glad. The
poor boy at least was grateful for what we had done and were
trying to do for him."</p>

<p>There was a pause. The <i>juge</i> broke it.</p>

<p>"Well, he may come back to the house any moment. He may have
had a breakdown, and this absence that looks so doubtful be
explained, but it looks odd. Very odd."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow gave a sort of strangled cry.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you suspect Mr. Tibbitts of&mdash;" she
stopped, as though too appalled to finish the sentence. The idea
seemed to stun her.</p>

<p>"There are several things about him that have an odd
appearance," the <i>juge</i> said quietly. "And there is another
point. I am sorry to grieve you, madam, but I must refer to
something that you told us. Do you think that this Monsieur
Tibbitts knew that you were about to run away with Sir Anthony
Cross?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownlow's eyes widened. Evidently this was a new
idea.</p>

<p>"You mean that he&mdash;that because&mdash;" she broke off,
trembling a little.</p>

<p>"It might explain the murder of Sir Anthony. It might explain
the murder of your husband," the <i>juge</i> said slowly. "Mind,
I do not say that it does. Or that it will. All I say is 'it
might.' But there is this, madam; we have here a young man of
whom nothing seems to be known to his credit who could possibly
have, or think he had, a motive to kill either or both of the men
we have found dead. That connection between their deaths may not
be the business bond which for the moment linked your husband and
his old friend, but it may be in this young man's evil mind.
Jealous of the friend&mdash;jealous of the husband."</p>

<p>She seemed thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;you must have something to go on," she said
finally.</p>

<p>He did not reply.</p>

<p>"It may have been no affair of the heart," Cambier now put in;
"but a much baser motive. Going back to that time, a fortnight
ago, when you lost your jewels on the <i>rapide</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>He questioned her very closely as to the movements of each
member of the party. So did Mackay. The upshot was that Tibbitts
was by no means cleared of the possibility of being the thief of
both money and jewels lost on that occasion. Each of the four had
had a compartment to themselves. The whole carriage had been
empty but for them. Three of them next morning claimed to have
been drugged. But Tibbitts had insisted on the doctor attending
to him last of all. At the time, Mrs. Brownlow now said, she had
put it down to unselfishness. Now it transpired that when
Tibbitts's turn came he had been able to stagger up and go for a
walk in the air, and that, therefore, he received no medical
attention whatever.</p>

<p>Cambier raised his eyebrows. But he made no comment.</p>

<p>Further questioned, she agreed that Tibbitts had shown a
remarkable knowledge of metal work while with herself, Miss
Young, and Mr. Murgatroyd. Up till then she had thought that he
had been a clerk in a little haberdashery shop somewhere in the
Midlands.</p>

<p>She had not seen Tibbitts since just before, or after, supper
last night. She forgot which. Her husband had told her, in answer
to some casual inquiry on her part, that he had helped him to his
room.</p>

<p>"You think," she asked, her hand held to her head, "that
Tibbitts had got on the track of whatever it was that my husband
was doing for Sir Anthony Cross? And that that was why he seemed
so devoted to us? That he didn't care really for either my
husband or me?"</p>

<p>The silence of the men told her that that was exactly what
they did think. The <i>juge</i> began some questionings about the
letters from Sir Anthony.</p>

<p>Pointer meanwhile moved quietly around the room towards the
book-shelves. Taken unawares, and a violent death nearly always
takes a man unawares, much can be learned of his character from
what he reads. More than from the companions he keeps. For the
latter may be chosen for reasons of diplomacy or business, and
not from liking. There were several rows of light reading,
probably sent up by Monsieur Pichegru for the use of Mrs.
Brownlow as well as of her husband. Suddenly his glance stopped
and went back to a preceding row. Yes, he was right. There was a
French as well as an English translation here of Assomoff's
<i>Along the Old Trade Routes of Kublai Khan</i>. The English
book looked quite new, the French was very old and neglected, yet
apparently its leaves had only just been cut, for the top edges
showed like curly antennae. He took out the English translation,
which was from a later edition, and had come from a shop in
Paris. Brownlow's initials were inside the cover. Only three
pages had been cut, he saw, and they were in the middle of the
book. Pointer wondered what subject had so interested
Brownlow&mdash;one of the dead men&mdash;that he had apparently
had a dip into both books, his own and Pichegru's, for the French
copy was not likely to be in the room, unless Brownlow himself
had taken it upstairs.</p>

<p>Standing back of the lady, who was utterly engrossed in her
talk with the police, Pointer turned the three pages. One he held
level with his eyes. A mark had been put to a sentence, and then
rubbed out, and very carefully smoothed down. It was this last
that interested him most. The sentence in question merely spoke
of a road that here joined another road, the first one leading to
Krasny, with its nomad herdsmen, and of the writer seeing a
camel-caravan bound for the town. That was all.</p>

<p>A little French brochure stood beside it. A French translation
of Sven Hedin's comments on the Russian work. Here again a mark
had been rubbed out. The marked passage concerned the course of
the Uluh Kema river, which, the great explorer pointed out, ran
in a different direction to that assigned it by Assomoff, with
the remark that the town of Krasny would have to be moved some
hundred miles farther towards the Gobi Desert to be able to stand
on the bank of the river as the latter was sketched in <i>Along
the Old Trade Routes</i>.</p>

<p>Pointer put English translation and French brochure back and
picked up the next book. It was a French treatise on <i>The
Territories of the Soviet Union</i>. It was of the current year.
Here again, only part of the pages had been cut. This was the
section dealing with the Turco-Mongolian races.</p>

<p>The writer was fond of flowery phrases and disliked precision.
Pointer gleaned much unsought-for information of a vague kind,
but finally he came on one familiar word. The name of a town. And
again that town was Krasny. Mr. Brownlow seemed to have a genuine
interest in the place.</p>

<p>He carefully looked at each of the other serious works. They
had not been even handled, for every volume, as he lifted it,
showed a little scollop of fine dust on the shelf where it stood.
Evidently the feather whisk of the maid had only given the
shelves a flick, and evidently Mr. Brownlow was a man of narrow
tastes. But when he reached the last volume, a fat book on
<i>Chess Openings</i>, he found a glossy surface below it. Yet
the book was some thirty years old, and could hardly interest a
man able to obtain up-to-date works on chess. Pointer's interest,
therefore, was in what might lie behind it. From this dark nook
he drew out a little Turkish-English grammar with a sheet of
paper in it. The writing on the paper was the same as that on the
letters in Mrs. Brownlow's lap at the moment. Brownlow had
evidently been working out an exercise. Now Pointer's hobby was
the learning of languages. He knew nothing that so rested the
mind wearied with heavy thinking. At the very moment he was
learning Persian, working just as Brownlow evidently had been
doing. But Farsi is the same, beautiful, elegant, flexible for
the traveler as for Hafiz. But no one ever learned Turkish
because of its literature. It has none. Surely it was not for the
purpose of reading the speeches of Mustapha Kemal Pasha in the
original, that Brownlow was working out the Osmanlee equivalent
for "The miller's daughter has the cat"? Besides, Turkish, such
as this little grammar taught, was only for traveling purposes.
It is not the Turkish spoken by the upper classes. It is really
Tartar, the <i>lingua franca</i> far and wide in Asia.</p>

<p>So Brownlow was preparing himself to travel somewhere where
this language would carry him...To Krasny? Turco-Mongolian
Krasny? Pointer replaced the grammar and the fat book on chess
and turned away. The others were preparing to leave Mrs. Brownlow
alone again. He followed them down into the writing-room, used by
the <i>juge</i> for the moment as the consulting room. Cambier
asked the chief inspector if he would find out through Scotland
Yard if anything were known about&mdash;which meant
against&mdash;Tibbitts. Pichegru had left them a snap-shot cut
from a group that Murgatroyd had taken. And they also had what it
was reasonable to assume were the young man's finger-prints on
many objects in his bedroom.</p>

<p>"As I say, in his case, Detective Good-luck will be our best
assistant," Cambier said with an anticipatory smile. "Even now my
<i>agent</i> is tracking that car, village by village, on its
route. Luckily no remark was ever allowed to leak out as to its
number. Therefore no comment could ever have reached Tibbitts to
show him how much attention it roused in every policeman whom he
passed."</p>

<p>A <i>portrait parlé</i> was at once drawn up of the missing
man. That is to say, a catalogue of his features classified with
a truly French minuteness of detail. By these "portraits" of
their's they claim that their detectives can pierce through any
disguise to the anatomical features of the face sought for. In
practice Pointer knew that the French lose far more criminals
than we do, just as he was aware of the vast number,
comparatively speaking, of wrongly-condemned persons languishing
in their terrible prisons. As to disguise, nothing can pierce a
really excellently done one, seen hurriedly, or in a place that
is out of keeping with the criminal's position in life.</p>

<p>Though there was a long list of "wanted" men in France, who,
like Landru, did not even trouble to disguise themselves, did not
give up one of their usual habits; merely changed their address,
and ignored detection, <i>portrait parlé</i> and all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rondeau was told by telephone that the car of
Brownlow's which interested the police had been located at
several more places along the <i>route nationale</i> leading to
Paris, but was not yet caught up with. Probably the end would
come in Paris itself.</p>

<p>"His arrest is only a matter of hours," Cambier said with
evident relish.</p>

<p>"Just so. And in the meantime, we will question the other lady
in the house." The <i>juge</i> pushed away the pile of notebooks.
"There are odd circumstances connected with Mademoiselle Young. I
do not mind saying that I find her behavior throughout very
strange. I will leave it at that, gentlemen. But we will now
confront the silent fiancée of the dead baron and hear what she
has to say about the changed situation&mdash;about the murder of
two men, and not about any supposed duel between them."</p>

<p>Vivian was already downstairs in the lounge. The news of the
arrival of the <i>juge d'instruction</i> at the house had spread
among the servants. The upper housemaid had whispered to her that
something fresh must have turned up&mdash;something most
important.</p>

<p>"The <i>juge</i> is in the sitting-room of Madam Brownlow,"
finished the maid in a confidential whisper; "he is well advised
to turn to her!" She pulled herself up on that and would not
explain her meaning.</p>

<p>Apart from her words, Vivian felt something stirring around
her. And when she went downstairs, the perturbed faces of the
servants, whose look of decorous shock for the fatal duel was now
replaced by a very personal disquietude, would have told her that
something quite new was on hand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class="first">VIVIAN stared at the stony look on all four
faces turned to her. On Mackay's features such an expression
meant a warning, she felt sure. A warning that something
important was afoot, and that she should be careful. The eyes of
the <i>juge</i> were like icicle points. She took an instant
dislike to Monsieur Grandpoint. One of those dislikes that are
always mutual.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he began sternly, after the preliminary
introduction; "why did you not tell us that Sir Anthony Cross,
your fiancé, was down here to meet Mr. Brownlow on business."</p>

<p>Vivian was more amazed by the question than she had been since
the discovery of the two dead bodies. But she was a reporter. A
very good one. Trained to keep her face under control. She did
not show any signs of the surprise that she felt.</p>

<p>"Because I did not know it," she replied coolly. "Is it a
fact?"</p>

<p>"You had no idea that Sir Anthony was down here in Cluny
except to run away with Madam Brownlow?" he asked
sarcastically.</p>

<p>Vivian caught her breath.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," she said after a second. "I guess
there's something new happened that I haven't heard of."</p>

<p>Still she spoke in a calm tone that made the <i>juge</i>
privately believe that she knew all this already.</p>

<p>"We have learned that there was no duel," he said very coldly.
And proceeded to tell her what he had just told Mrs.
Brownlow.</p>

<p>Vivian only opened her eyes a little at the end. She glanced
once during the recital at Mackay who nodded imperceptibly. As
for Pointer, he only watched her with his pleasant gaze that gave
sharp-witted Vivian the feeling that she was made of glass.</p>

<p>"No, there was no duel," the <i>juge</i> repeated again; "but
there are two murders. Two crimes. Possibly connected with this
visit of Sir Anthony to our quiet little town. Possibly not
connected with that visit at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it was too!" Vivian spoke, as she had to listen
partly, through Pointer. A proper interpreter was on his way from
Lyons, but for the moment the chief inspector filled the
post.</p>

<p>"My! Yes, it was!" she repeated Anthony Cross's words to her
of expecting to get some information down here in Cluny from a
man whom he was going to meet. The <i>juge</i> listened
attentively. Vivian, after a second's hesitation, went on to
speak of the constant thefts from parcels of diamonds sent to and
from Amsterdam which had brought Sir Anthony to France in the
first place.</p>

<p>"And you said nothing of this 'mission' of Sir Anthony's up
till now? Not when he was found shot?" the <i>juge</i> asked very
quietly.</p>

<p>"I thought, like every one else, that it was a duel. I guess I
thought that more than any one else," she said firmly. "And that
being so, Sir Anthony had asked me to consider everything he told
me about the losses to his company as absolutely confidential."
She went on to say that she understood from him that inquiries
were on foot which any talk or publicity might quite frustrate.
She, personally, knew nothing about these inquiries, except the
fact of their existence. Sir Anthony had only referred to them in
general terms, as explaining what had brought him to Europe just
now.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> thought a moment. Adjusting his gold-rimmed
glasses, he sat for another moment reading through a page, of
notes.</p>

<p>"You say Sir Anthony knew that you were coming down to Cluny,
and yet he, who was also coming down here, did not accompany
you?" There was something like disbelief in the cold eyes on her.
"And you made no effort to see him here? To meet him?"</p>

<p>She explained that he had wished it so.</p>

<p>"You had not quarreled with him about his coming down here?"
The <i>juge</i> spoke as though he doubted all that she had told
him.</p>

<p>Vivian again repeated what she had said. "Sir Anthony was
coming down to Cluny on business, so he told me," she finished.
"And for that reason we did not come together. I doubted whether
the reason that was bringing him down was really business when I
recognized Mrs. Brownlow from a picture I had seen him looking at
not long before. And because of that doubt of mine, I came here
to the villa. But it was due to his own wish that we should not
be seen together, that we met, as we did, outside the house."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brownlow's portrait&mdash;" Cambier pulled at his
moustache.</p>

<p>"And yet," the inexorable voice of the <i>juge</i> went on;
"yet, mademoiselle, knowing what he had told you of what brought
him to Cluny, you did not connect the two deaths with this errand
of his, this so secret errand?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Because I was told it was a duel, and because
I had seen for myself that Mr. Brownlow was jealous of him. I
guess motives were a bit twisted up all around. Also, I sure
didn't reflect that a man can be doing business with another and
yet have a private grudge against him."</p>

<p>"M-m-m," hemmed the <i>juge</i>. Again there was a silence.
Strictly speaking only the <i>juge</i>, when he was present,
could question a witness. Some leaves in a note-book turned by
him was all that broke the rather tense stillness of the
room.</p>

<p>"Apparently, mademoiselle, you were the last person to see Sir
Anthony Cross alive?" There was something ominous in his stare.
The words came with harsh emphasis.</p>

<p>"I guess the man who shot him was the real last," she said
composedly. It was a composure that did not please Monsieur
Grandpoint. He thought Vivian hard. And truth compels one to
admit that not even her best friend could call her soft. Just
now, however, all personal grief had been dynamited away by the
startling news that Anthony Cross's death was a crime. And a most
puzzling riddle.</p>

<p>Vivian's very eagerness to understand, to solve the riddle,
took the whole fact of the death away, as far as she was
concerned, from the heart&mdash;the warm realm of
feeling&mdash;into the mind, that cool place where problems
dwell.</p>

<p>"But, putting the moment of his murder on one side," the
<i>juge</i> resumed; "you, I say, mademoiselle, are the last
person of whom we have any record who spoke to the dead man. Now
that is a very important point."</p>

<p>He said this last very meaningly. Pointer translated. Vivian's
French was a little clouded by her anxiety not to understand it
wrongly.</p>

<p>"Say, don't let him forget that they learned that point from
me!" she said with her usual spirit.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite so!" agreed the <i>juge</i>; "told us, however,
while his death seemed to be due to a duel. But to pass that by
for the time being, kindly tell us, once more, exactly what Sir
Anthony was doing when you saw him in the cedar room."</p>

<p>Vivian went into every detail that she could remember. The
<i>juge</i> worried her. Her own very anxiety tripped her up
sometimes. And every fresh detail, or trifle, that she mentioned,
would be met by the harsh remark of, "You did not mention that
before, I think." Vivian would reply that she had not remembered
it till now, or not thought it worth noticing. It was a true
French scene. Utterly hopeless from the point of view of helping
an innocent person who really was trying to aid the law, though
well calculated to confuse a guilty man or woman. Pointer had met
it before. He knew the French theory that when a witness adds
anything to their first testimony, this addition is to be
considered as most suspect. As either unconscious self-deception,
or conscious effort to "embroider" the plain facts, as Cambier
put it.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> finally rose.</p>

<p>"Now, mademoiselle, kindly accompany us into the next room and
show us how, and where, each of the bodies was lying. You were
the first to reach both."</p>

<p>Vivian hesitated for a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>"It's not fair," Mackay began hotly in an undertone to
Pointer; "they didn't ask that of the wife. Then why of the
lassie?"</p>

<p>"You forget Mrs. Brownlow's a Frenchwoman by birth," Pointer
said dryly.</p>

<p>Vivian quickly overcame her shrinking from the thought of
again stepping into that room where but a few hours before she
had seen so horrible a sight. Leading the way in now, she
explained very carefully what she had seen.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> studied the photographs which he held.</p>

<p>"And you say that you passed over to Sir Anthony, stepping
just beside Mr. Brownlow's out-flung right hand?" Vivian
nodded.</p>

<p>"It must have been a narrow passage way between that hand, and
that table leg there."</p>

<p>"It was," she agreed; "but I don't take up yards of room."</p>

<p>"No. And the revolver, where was it?"</p>

<p>Vivian looked at him for a second, a long, intent look. Then
she stared at the part of the floor of which they were
talking.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten the revolver?" the <i>juge</i> asked
icily. "You have describe very closely many trifles, but you have
forgotten to mention stepping over it?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't there," Vivian said finally.</p>

<p>"That means to say?" he asked, raising his eyebrows. "That it
certainly wasn't there&mdash;then. Oh, I know it's on that
photograph probably. Now I come to think of it, it was lying
close beside that table leg when I came back into the room, but
some one must have moved it out a little&mdash;" she stopped
herself.</p>

<p>"You said that you lifted his, Mr. Brownlow's, right arm to
see if he were really dead."</p>

<p>"Yes, I lifted the hand, which lifted the arm."</p>

<p>"And you did not see the revolver underneath the arm
either?"</p>

<p>"No." She spoke rather curtly. "No, judge, I didn't."</p>

<p>"Yet Monsieur Smith and Madam Brownlow and the butler all saw
it lying out right where you claim to have stepped."</p>

<p>She made no reply. "It got moved out," she said again after a
pause. The <i>juge</i> pursed his lips and made a note. He
pointed out to her, quite dispassionately, that the leg of the
table in question was one of those thick, solid, ormolu-mounted
affairs which, dividing at the base into three equally solid
branches supporting the table top, quite negatived the idea of
the revolver having slipped farther away from the body before it
had been inadvertently moved in closer.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure that you yourself did not move the
revolver?" he asked finally. "You are quite sure that you did not
change them in some way? For changed, of course, they
were&mdash;by some one."</p>

<p>Vivian began an indignant protest. He raised a white, thin
hand.</p>

<p><i>"Doucement, mademoiselle, plus doucement!"</i> he said,
drawing himself up. "I am here to ascertain the truth. Not to
please you by my sympathetic remarks."</p>

<p>"I guess I don't care what you're here for, I didn't touch
those revolvers!" she said indignantly as before, and from that
stand she refused to be browbeaten. Finally, she was dismissed
with a curt request to hold herself in readiness to answer
further questions if necessary.</p>

<p>Vivian made a tart reply, which Pointer, for the once,
softened in translation. She went up to her bedroom as in a
dream. Not a duel&mdash;murder! Anthony had been murdered! And so
had Mr. Brownlow!</p>

<p>Then that revolver had been "planted" so as to have the two
dead men look as though they had fallen in what, in France, is
still considered fair, if not lawful combat&mdash;a duel.</p>

<p>The bullet that had killed Anthony fitted the weapon that had
been found lying beside Brownlow's outstretched right hand. Of
that there was no question. But how had that weapon got there? Or
rather, when? For Vivian was certain that there had been no
revolver in sight when she had first bent in shocked surprise
over Brownlow's body. She had done more than lift a hand or an
arm. She was very strong. She had half-raised the body to be sure
that life was really extinct. There had been no revolver lying
hidden beneath the dead man. But if not there then, how had it
materialized later close to his hand? By whom, and when, and
above all, why?</p>

<p>She, and Mrs. Brownlow, Mr. Smith, and the butler...They four
were known to have been in the room between the time she moved
the body, without seeing any weapon, and the time when the weapon
lay there for all to see. Also, possibly a maid had stepped in to
help Mrs. Brownlow up to her room. But Vivian dismissed the
servants. It was not as though either man had been killed in his
own house. Here could be no question of feudal loyalty, she told
herself grimly. But was there a gang at work? And like a flash
came the thought of Mr. Lascelles&mdash;of the "Egyptian Lady,"
Jane Eastby, and of her evident fright lest Lascelles should open
that cedar room door. What would he have seen? What would any one
have seen? A dead man? There had been that in the woman's tone
which made the terrible question ask itself now in Vivian's
groping mind.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Eastby had tried to hide the urgency of her fear.
Vivian saw again the forced and frightened smile with which she
had pulled his hand away from the knob. And such a woman as
Vivian had seen staring after Anthony Cross that first evening,
the evening before the dance, would be capable of almost
anything. Mrs. Eastby could not have produced that revolver, but
what about an accomplice of hers?</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby, Lascelles, Smith...Was that the way the wheel
turned? But Smith had not left the room this morning early until
after she herself had returned from telephoning. Had he the
revolver already on him? She mentally ran her eye over his trim
chef's dress of white linen. It had fitted beautifully. But an
automatic takes up little room. And if not Smith, then there only
remained Mrs. Brownlow. Was it possible that it was she? Vivian
remembered the smelling salts and the velvet handbag that Mrs.
Brownlow had clutched as she ran past the telephone in the lounge
where Vivian was trying to get Mackay. That handbag...Now, in
retrospect, Vivian seemed to notice how stiff and rigid it hung.
Had it been heavy? Revolver heavy?</p>

<p>She tapped her even little teeth. She realized now that few
are the crimes, and very simple, that are capable of being solved
<i>en bloc</i>.</p>

<p>She went downstairs and found Mackay looking at the pewter
plates that had so interested the chief inspector.</p>

<p>"They're too fussy for my taste," Vivian said, drawing him
away. "Say, Mr. Mackay, that judge has a grouch against me.</p>

<p>"Na, na!" he protested. "Only you were a bit short wi' him.
And in a republic, as you should ken weel, Miss Young, you mustna
be short wi' officials. It's only in a monarchy that ye daur be
rude to a mon in office."</p>

<p>"Instead of freezing me, if he'd only concentrated on that
revolver that wasn't there when we first broke into that room
this morning, he might give the case a shove forward. He didn't
even see the point. That Englishman did though. I caught his
eye."</p>

<p>Mackay's own eyes were on her now, waiting.</p>

<p>"As far as I can see," she went on in a low voice; "Smith
could have produced the gun if he had had it on him. But Mrs.
Brownlow could have fetched it, or its mate." She told him of the
bag, the "smelling salts."</p>

<p>"Mr. Brownlow may easily have had a brace of automatics."</p>

<p>Vivian knew of many men who had always carried a pair. Such as
her own revered father, for instance. Men who, like him, had to
go into wild places. Such places as China was nowadays. Yes, Mr.
Brownlow, once of Shanghai, might well have owned a pair of
automatics. Or his wife might have had the mate to the one which
he usually carried.</p>

<p>"There's nae logic in the supposition that the wife had any
hand whatever in the deaths," Mackay began, in the didactic
fashion that made Vivian want to laugh and want to pinch him at
the same time.</p>

<p>"I'm not saying that she had," she retorted swiftly; "all I
claim is that she muddled up the trails. And mind you, Mr.
Mackay, she must have known at once what make of bullet had
killed Anthony Cross. The bullet hadn't been extricated by then.
She knew it so all-fired surely that she did on the instant the
one thing that made it look like a duel. If she knew so much, did
she know more?"</p>

<p>Vivian could not help it, but the wild words of her sister
flashed through her mind.</p>

<p>"Aye, that's the point," Mackay conceded; "did she know, or
didn't she?"</p>

<p>"But if Mrs. Brownlow mixed things up so as to start that duel
idea," she went on in a still lower voice; "then she cared more
than that should be thought, than that the murderer of her
husband should be discovered. For she confused the trail
hopelessly, as she thought. That looks&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Hoo does it luik?" he asked slowly.</p>

<p>"As though she were protecting the man who killed him."
Vivian's face was horrified at her own words.</p>

<p>"Na, na!" Mackay was positive on the point. "She couldna hae
known o' her husband's death or she wud hae put the automatic
doon then. That's logic. Besides, her whole manner tells that.
She just grasped at the first straw that came to hand to save his
reputation. And her own."</p>

<p>"Na, na!" Vivian imitated him. "She sacrificed her reputation.
And now that we know it was no duel I can't for the life of me
help wondering whether&mdash;well, whether things were as she
represented them between Anthony and herself. She may have made
more of that than really existed&mdash;supposing she knew that
her husband shot Anthony Cross. She may have wanted every one to
think he sure had cause for the shooting. You do get into some
awful muddles if you don't stick to the truth," Vivian continued,
with what an unkind observer might have called a reminiscent air.
"And if she helped stage that duel idea by putting a revolver by
her husband's side, she sure has made a muddle. But one can't
blame the poor soul for trying to make things look their best for
her husband. Any woman would do that."</p>

<p>Mackay felt that Vivian certainly would. She left him on that
and went to the telephone. There was no question now of her
leaving the villa. The <i>juge</i> had intimated as much in no
uncertain way.</p>

<p>Her telephone conversation over, she waylaid Chief Inspector
Pointer when he came out of the conference room, as the room
beside the cedar room was now called.</p>

<p>"Could I have a word with you, alone?" she begged.</p>

<p>He followed her into an empty room.</p>

<p>"Chief, will you find out for me who murdered those two men?
Or at any rate who murdered Sir Anthony Cross. Though I guess
they're linked. The man who got the one, got the other too."</p>

<p>But Pointer explained that he was only an observer in this
case. That he had no standing other than that. Nor could have.
The <i>juge</i> begged him to help him out with a piece of
English at that moment, and Pointer left, with another word of
regret to the girl.</p>

<p>"Too bad," Vivian said in considerable vexation to Mackay when
she met him a little later and recounted her failure. "I wanted
you and him to work together."</p>

<p>"But I'm pledged to Davidson&mdash;" began Mackay.</p>

<p>"I telephoned to him," Vivian said triumphantly; "the butler
here has his address, and I asked him if I couldn't get you to
help me in this inquiry. He was most frightfully sorry to hear of
Mr. Brownlow's death, and said that of course you could take it
on. He seemed surprised that I asked him, and not you! But I
didn't intend to speak to you about it before knowing that you
could say yes&mdash;if you wanted to. And, of course, you do want
to!"</p>

<p>Apparently Mackay did not.</p>

<p>"Davidson or no Davidson, I'm nae guid. I canna see ma hand
before ma een," he said despondently. "There's nae light o'
reason here to guide my deductions."</p>

<p>"But you can't refuse!" she protested. "My, I simply can't
look on and see a man kick his chance down the stairs and out the
front door! Sakes alive, man, don't you know a chance when you
see one? When I caught sight of Mrs. Brownlow," she went on; "and
recognized her from the photograph I'd seen in Anthony's hands, I
jumped to the conclusion that he had been telling me an untruth.
Even otherwise truthful men don't always think it necessary to
tell the truth to women. But now I know that he was murdered,
shot down from the side before he could draw his gun perhaps;
why, remembering what he told me, I begin to have a different
idea of things. And"&mdash;her face softened&mdash;"and now I
understand his manner when I gave him back his ring, and when he
told me last that he had no time for me. He seemed so casual
because he had no idea that it was the last time. He sure thought
there would be many meetings later on when we could thrash things
out. He was all hot on some trail. Mrs. Brownlow says her husband
was helping him in some deal. Whether she's right or
wrong&mdash;I can't make up my mind about her&mdash;here's your
chance, Mr. Mackay, your great chance!"</p>

<p>"Too great for me," he insisted quietly.</p>

<p>She stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"I <i>won't</i> let you talk like that of yourself! I know you
can catch murderers if you only give your mind to it. And they
must be caught. I was engaged to Anthony Cross. I liked him
immensely. I'm going to find out who killed him and who killed
Mr. Brownlow. You and I are going to work this together, Mr.
Mackay."</p>

<p>She looked very capable as she spoke, with her chin in the
air. But Mackay did not seem impressed.</p>

<p>"It's nae work for a wumman. Forbye a young one."</p>

<p>"I'm a good reporter," she said hotly; "and a good reporter is
a good sleuth."</p>

<p>"That soonds gey fine," was his only rejoinder; "but there's
nae private investigator to touch the police."</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Mackay, your grandfather must have been a wonder,"
she said dreamily.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You must be his image. I guess you forget at times that
you're not ninety-nine&mdash;yet. Well, good-bye; though it's one
more disappointment. For you sure have brains, though you don't
know how to use them. And I had another piece of news to discuss
with you." She flung this over her shoulder as she moved towards
the stairs.</p>

<p>It was not in human nature not to prick up its ears. Vivian
was generous.</p>

<p>"It's this. Mrs. Brownlow hasn't an idea who Mr. Murgatroyd
was talking to down here in the waiting-room last night. So she
says, and I believe her&mdash;there. Then who was it? Why was Mr.
Murgatroyd there at all at that hour? And looking as mad as mad
could be."</p>

<p>"Mad?" queried Mackay, but with a grin.</p>

<p>"Angry. Vexed. That sort of mad. And why did he skip off
before any one could question him? Of course, while we all
thought it was a duel, and while I believed he had been having a
heart-to-heart talk with Mrs. Brownlow, it was different. But
now! I think he knows something! Only that, of course. I guess
even I don't connect a well-known lecturer and a crime. Though I
don't know...He might have been just acting a part. I'm beginning
to think he was too good to be a real, and that mortal man
couldn't be honestly as keen on history and stones as he was. But
I'll tell the world he really knew a lot. My, he really did!"</p>

<p>"Sure did!" Mackay agreed; "but whaur do I come in?"</p>

<p>"In finding out more about Mrs. Eastby," she said promptly. "I
saw her trying to detain Anthony, you know, and him trying to
shake her off. It was the face of an absolutely desperate woman,
Mr. Mackay."</p>

<p>"He sent her an invitation to the dance!" Mackay said
disbelievingly; "and arguing by that..." he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Then there's Mr. Murgatroyd's odd behavior that night. I
think now that he was talking to her&mdash;to the 'Egyptian
Lady.'"</p>

<p>"There's nae wumman nor yet a professor in last nicht's
terrible events," Mackay said firmly. "It wad be against a'
reason."</p>

<p>"That's to find out," Vivian countered smartly.</p>

<p>"Aye, find oot," scoffed Mackay. "Ye'd better apply to
Monsieur Rondeau, that bright-eyed French laddie o' the police.
He writes detective mysteries, and like you he's amazing good at
asking questions."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;like me&mdash;no good at solving them?" Vivian was
piqued.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;he temporized before the sparkle in her
eyes&mdash;"hoo wud ye find oot aboot Mrs. Eastby, for
instance."</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;I'd&mdash;" she thought hard.</p>

<p>"She hasna left an address. The police cud trace her, but I
canna," Mackay went on. "Whaur I score wad be in reasoning, in
mature deliberation&mdash;but there's no chance for that in this
case."</p>

<p>He paused to let that said fact sink in.</p>

<p>"Haven't you any idea yourself about the link between those
two murders?" she asked finally.</p>

<p>"Aye. But it's nobbut an idea. Ye canna arrest a mon even in
France, I'm thinkin', on an opinion. There's ower mony o'
Sherlock Holmes's case wudna haud water in court."</p>

<p>"But you have an idea!" She was all agog. "Oh, my! Mr. Mackay
won't you give me an inkling of it&mdash;of who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A' I can say at present is that I dinna think a wumman did
either. Let alone baith," was his cautious reply.</p>

<p>She chuckled impatiently.</p>

<p>"You sure are the lightning calculator of your year! But I'll
drop one more pearl before I go. Find out whether the link
between Mrs. Eastby and Mr. Lascelles isn't Mr. Smith. Or what
about Mr. Tibbitts? It seems to me every one's forgotten him. He
hasn't come back yet, you know."</p>

<p>Mackay did not tell her that the police were quite cognizant
of that young man's existence&mdash;and of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>"You're always talking of reasoning, of deliberation&mdash;"
she began swiftly.</p>

<p>"It soonds like a gey varied conversationalist," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"But why not meditate on Mr. Tibbitts? Here's a man who's
prepared an alibi beforehand, as it were, and yet one that would
take him away from the ball-room for the rest of the night. Say,
Mr. Mackay, I think you ought to concentrate on Tibbitts as a
murderer as well as a thief."</p>

<p>"Na, na!" he said firmly. "He hasna the kind o' mind that a
murderer maun have." And with that Mackay left her.</p>

<p>Vivian was not so sure. Tibbitts might well represent the link
between the deaths of the two men, she thought. She was certain
that the deaths were closely connected. She did not for a moment
believe that in the same quiet old town, in the same villa, on
the same night, two murders, separate and distinct, could have
been planned and carried out. On the whole now, thinking over the
various people who could have had a hand in the tragedy, Vivian's
darting suspicions joined up with those of the commissaire, and
hovered rather persistently around the head of Mathew
Tibbitts.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class="first">THE <i>juge</i> wanted the chief inspector to go
over a letter that had just arrived, sent by air mail from
Geneva. It was from Mrs. Eastby, who apparently lived at
Winchelsea when in England. Mrs. Eastby claimed the French
equivalent of three hundred pounds from the effects of the late
Sir Anthony Cross. She wrote that the sum in question had been
handed by her to Sir Anthony on the night he met his death. The
receipt, which was made out for her, had gone on with her luggage
to Como, but it had been witnessed by a professor staying at
Villa Porte Bonheur and by another guest, Mr. Smith. The money
had been handed in notes of a thousand francs to Sir Anthony in
order that it might be at once invested by him in a particular
company and under special circumstances, and was almost too late
to be so used. She could not give the number of the notes, as the
numbers of French notes are never taken, but all but six of them
were thousand franc notes, and as she had pulled out the bank pin
to count out one of the packages to Sir Anthony, in the cedar
room, she had torn the top note across, and had mended it with a
strip off the flap of an envelope from the rack on the writing-table. The lady wrote that the matter was extremely urgent. She
hoped that as she had the receipt signed by two men, who were
doubtless still present at the villa, there would be no delay
made in finding the sum and returning it to her&mdash;without the
necessity for legal intervention.</p>

<p>There was a hint in the last line that such intervention would
quickly follow any effort to withhold the money.</p>

<p>"So it wasn't a will Monsieur Smith signed, as he thought. It
was evidently this receipt of which the letter speaks." The
<i>juge</i> looked at the sum in francs and pursed his lips.
"Here is an interesting piece of news! There is no trace of any
such sum. None whatever. Sir Anthony has only some loose notes,
amounting to a thousand francs in all, on him."</p>

<p>"That pin found on the ink-stand!" Rondeau almost
whispered.</p>

<p>Cambier nodded. "That pin!" he agreed. "But there is another
interesting piece of news. Rondeau has found out that a
Mademoiselle Fumier&mdash;she is the daughter of a doctor who
lives in a little village near us"&mdash;he explained to the
chief inspector and Mackay&mdash;"overhead a conversation while
sitting out with a partner not far from the open window of the
cedar room. She understands English and speaks it well. I have
just questioned her. She could not hear much of what was said,
but the conversation was of the nature of a quarrel. It took
place before supper, and between Sir Cross, whom she could see
now and then coming towards the window&mdash;he was apparently
walking up and down the room&mdash;and some other man. Englishman
probably, as the conversation, the quarrel rather, was in
English. As to this other man, she could only hear a low-pitched
man's voice speaking very quietly in between Sir Cross's
indignant outbreaks. She thinks this other man was urging some
course on Sir Cross which the latter was indignantly refusing to
take. But that, of course, is only her interpretation of the
affair.</p>

<p>"Once, when Sir Cross stood looking out into the garden for a
moment, she heard him say as he turned away, in a very
threatening tone, 'It's a case for a criminal prosecution.' That
was the only sentence&mdash;complete sentence, which she heard.
But in the beginning she had caught a very significant word. That
was the word 'thief!' Spoken in a tone of positive fury. Later
she heard the word 'money' many times. So many times that she was
sure the disagreement concerned that common source of friction.
She, of course, was under the idea that the talk concerned some
third party. Some political discussion even. We can make a better
guess. 'Thief'&mdash;'money'&mdash;it was Tibbitts's, we may be
sure&mdash;that quiet voice speaking so softly. The honest man is
not concerned with the open window, with the possibility of a
listener. But a dishonest man, a thief&mdash;ah, he is not
forgetful of eavesdroppers. Never!"</p>

<p>Cambier went on to explain that Mademoiselle Fumier had not
spoken sooner because, though she had heard of the duel almost at
once, her father had objected to her concerning herself in what
seemed a straightforward, but unpleasant affair&mdash;until the
report reached him that it was no question of a duel any longer,
but of murder. Nor did she think, at first&mdash;that which she
had overheard was of any importance.</p>

<p>All the Frenchmen evidently knew the young girl, and equally
evidently were tremendously impressed by what she had to say.</p>

<p>"The money she heard spoken of was very likely this money of
which this letter speaks," the <i>juge</i> murmured. Cambier
nodded.</p>

<p>"But in that case one asks oneself why Tibbitts was concerned
with it&mdash;" Rondeau ventured. And this time Cambier allowed
his query to stand, even nodded agreement to it.</p>

<p>Meantime, the car that Tibbitts was believed to be driving had
just been traced to an hotel in Paris in the Latin quarter. The
<i>Sûreté</i> was taking the matter up. And evidently both
expeditiously and well, for within half an hour came the
telephoned news that Tibbitts had been arrested in a room of the
small hotel in question. On him had been found several wads of
thousand franc notes, one of which had a top note that had been
torn across and mended, apparently with a strip from a gray linen
envelope, on which the beginning of a "V" was legible, an
envelope from Villa Porte Bonheur.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, as soon as she heard of the arrest, which was
early next morning, Vivian began to have doubts of Tibbitts's
guilt. She knew nothing of the letter of Mrs. Eastby, nor of the
torn bank-note found on the young man.</p>

<p>"He fits all right&mdash;bits of the puzzle&mdash;but I cant
think it was that poor simp!" she confided to Mackay, whom she
met walking towards the villa after a hasty breakfast.</p>

<p>"Brownlow murdered Sir Anthony, Miss Young," he said suddenly.
"I'm as certain o' that as though I had seen him do it. And it
was because I was sae sure that I wadna tak' on the job when you
asked me yesterday. His wife has suffered eno' by the husband's
death. I wadna be the one to add to her grief."</p>

<p>"But, surely to goodness, you thought it a duel at first like
all of us!" she protested, amazed and a little indignant.</p>

<p>He shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"Never. Not once. But it isna ma case. I'm engaged to get back
Mr. Davidson's money&mdash;if I can. As for the twa
deaths&mdash;" he hesitated. "Miss Young," he said suddenly and
very earnestly; "I havena been able to say a worrd o' ma inner-maist thochts for fear o' being laughed at. For a man should
reason&mdash;and reason according to the rules of logic. But I
ha'e the gift. The hielan' gift. Some ca' it 'second sicht.' Ma
faither was the seventh son o' a seventh son and baith he and his
faither were born on a Sunday. I can aye see bluid on the hand o'
a murderer. Believe me or no. When I first lookit at Brownlow, I
said to myself 'There goes a murderer!' For, though he had gloves
on, to me his palms were red and gory."</p>

<p>Mackay's voice suddenly rang out. There was that in his tone
and eyes that spelled conviction, however fantastic his words
might be.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" Miss Young breathed in amazement. She had never
thought of connecting this steady-eyed, red-haired young man with
anything occult.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that you can see further into these murders
than the police?" she asked finally.</p>

<p>"Aye and no. The gift comes and gaes. And, as I say, I'm
working on ma ain case. But of this I feel certain, Tibbitts is
nae murderer."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Hoo's Mrs. Brownlow takin' a' this talk aboot Tibbitts the
noo?" he asked next.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard? She's so ill that they've installed a
nurse. The doctor talks of inflammation of the brain. Poor thing!
And yet&mdash;I wish I could quite place her in all this..."</p>

<p>"So do I!" Mackay agreed fervently. "I canna read Mrs.
Brownlow. Neither by the light o' reason, nor by any gift I
possess!"</p>

<p>He hurried off at that, and Vivian took a turn through the
orchard, thinking over what he had just said and what she knew of
the affair.</p>

<p>She was not a believer in things occult, but it was possible
that Mackay had a sensitiveness to the thoughts around him that
often goes by that name. At any rate, he evidently thought that
he was endowed with some special powers. They had not seemed to
lead far, but one never knew...This was a most perplexing
problem. The morning paper, <i>Le Petit Clunyois</i>, had been
full of it. The paper mentioned that Maître Lenormand, the great
Paris <i>avocat,</i> had been briefed to assist Tibbitts, and
would arrive in the evening. This was very unusual. Lenormand's
fees were on a scale that usually precluded his being called in
so early in a case. Evidently Tibbitts, or some one behind
Tibbitts, had money to spend on his behalf.</p>

<p>The villa became the center of a whirlpool of activities.
Reports in inconceivable number were drawn up by the doctors, by
the detectives, by the police, and by reporters for their papers.
Every one who had been present at the dance and could be reached
was interviewed. The stationery shops of Cluny did a roaring
trade, and were cleared out of sealing wax.</p>

<p>For an hour before he questioned Tibbitts the magistrate
busied himself in reading over the reports tabulated for him by
his chief clerk. Then he sat and thought over the whole very
carefully. Now and again he paced the well-worn strip of carpet
in the bare room of the Hotel de ville, whose beautiful
proportions and noble ceiling had once been part of the palace.
But its present use was suggested in the ink-stained green baize
cover over the long table in the center, in the dusty chairs with
their once leather seats, and in the files that ranged the
walls.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Pointer and Mackay were both present at the
interview.</p>

<p>As it progressed, a formidable total was built up against
Tibbitts.</p>

<p>The servants one and all claimed to have noticed that he was
madly in love with madam, though she, apparently, treated him
like an indulgent elder sister. There was only one witness, the
woman who acted as Mrs. Brownlow's maid when wanted, who did not
agree with this at all. She maintained that Madam Brownlow on
many occasions did her best to turn Tibbitts's head. But the
woman disliked the newly-made widow, and by her own dislike
spoiled the credibility of her evidence. Miss Young was called,
and did her best for both the accused and Mrs. Brownlow. She
considered Tibbitts's attachment rather of the knightly adoration
type than of the passionate apache kind necessary for such a
double crime. But here again, her evident wish to help harmed her
testimony. Then came the facts of the journey to Paris, when the
thousand pounds in money and the jewelry worth more than another
thousand had disappeared. The Pullman attendants and the doctor
who had been summoned to attend Davidson and Mrs. Brownlow and
Smith&mdash;of whose unconsciousness there was no
question&mdash;remembered many little trifles, which, put
together, seemed definitely to prove that Tibbitts could not have
been drugged as he said.</p>

<p>Tibbitts himself made a very poor impression on every one.
Pale, hunted-looking, he faced the <i>juge</i>, his guard behind
him. Unshaven, and apparently unwashed, his whole appearance
spoke of guilt and shrinking dread. He put up such a lathe-and-plaster defence that, had the occasion been less terrible, it
would have been ludicrous. He himself seemed made of putty. And
was in some state of secret terror which, like a frightened
driver, made him swerve into the very things he wanted to
avoid.</p>

<p>Within half an hour the <i>juge</i> wrung from him the
acknowledgment that his tale of the drugging was false. But he
protested that it had only been told with some silly idea of not
seeming luckier than his companions. A confused jumble of an
explanation that did not explain, least of all to the magistrate
with his chill eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the <i>juge</i> produced the key found in the garden
near the gate.</p>

<p>"And now about this&mdash;" he said in dramatic accents.</p>

<p>One thing was evident about it. It froze Tibbitts. His face
went livid, and yet there came a gleam into his green-gray,
watery eyes that made them flash like a cat's at night. He looked
as though he could have made a leap for the little piece of metal
lying on the <i>juge's</i> table. Then he stammered out that he
had never seen it before. And this with such abject terror that
his denials only strengthened the idea that he connected that key
very definitely and very terribly with one at least of the dead
men.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i>, after he had adjourned for lunch, gave the
commissaire instructions for the reconstruction of the double
murder, which he intended to carry out at midnight. Tibbitts was
to be confronted with the room as it had looked the night before
last, the night of the dance. At the writing-table would sit a
figure very like that of Sir Anthony Cross. Into the room, later
on, would come another <i>agent</i> made up as like Brownlow as
possible. The <i>juge</i> hoped to get the truth before dawn.</p>

<p>Which meant, so the commissaire thought, a confession from
Tibbitts. The magistrate neither agreed nor disagreed with this.
He only looked very thoughtful, and pursing his thin lips,
plunged into the reports again. Cambier was expecting every
minute further information from Lyons as to Brownlow's plans
there. Plans that now looked as though they might link up with
Sir Anthony Cross, for Brownlow, it seemed, had spoken of a very
wealthy backer who might be coming in with him. No name had been
mentioned, but it might be ferreted out, and the name might be
Anthony Cross.</p>

<p>Mackay was very silent at lunch&mdash;a lunch which he hardly
tasted.</p>

<p>"It's awful!" he said at last, giving up the pretense of a
meal, "seeing a man ye believe innocent being caught up and
hurried into God knows what. I'm as certain that Tibbitts didna
kill either of yon dead men as though I were the recording angel
and knew it a'. D'you think they'll send him to the block?"</p>

<p>Pointer thought that they would. His bloodstained shoes, not
in the least explained by his assertion that his nose had bled,
an assertion proved to be false by a dozen trifles as soon as put
forward; his knowledge of where the revolver was kept; his
probable jealousy of the husband as well as of the lover, unless
the crime could be proved to be connected&mdash;as Cambier hoped
so to prove it&mdash;with money concerns alone&mdash;all tended
to fasten the guilt on Tibbitts. "If you think him innocent,"
Pointer finished; "how do you account for his evident feeling of
guilt? He doesn't consider himself innocent."</p>

<p>"I can only explain it logically by wonderin' if some joke
wasna played on him. Some ghastly hoax. Convinced as I am that
Brownlow murdered the other, I think he then got hold of thus
puir fule and made him think that Mrs. Brownlow had done it. To
save her, I think, Tibbitts is taking the blame."</p>

<p>Pointer did not agree. He, too, had been told of Mackay's
gift, but he felt sure that Tibbitts really believed himself
guilty.</p>

<p>"Weel, then," Mackay said suddenly; "Brownlow may have told
him that he was drunk at the time, and that he killed Sir Anthony
while drunk. That's a possibility that's quite in accordance with
good reasoning. You could make Tibbitts think black was bright
silver if you only worked hard enough. He's but a puir working
lad, who by some chance has been pitchforked into, for him, great
society. He eats wi' his knife when he isna thinking."</p>

<p>"A poor working lad..." Pointer shook his head. "I've just
passed on a report sent over by air from the Yard. Tibbitts's
finger-prints have been identified as those of an extremely able
safe-breaker, who started as a thief, proved himself quite a
wonder as a lad at breaking into shops and tills, was sent to
Borstal, ran away, and went in for regular safe-cracking. He
never was caught. Oddly enough, for he's not clever. It's thought
that his accomplices themselves protected him. He's such a wonder
at his work. I take it, his arts and crafts classes were rather
of the nature of self-help and self-tuition. Though doubtless
night classes all right."</p>

<p>Mackay asked more details.</p>

<p>"There's na doot he took the siller and possibly the jewels on
the <i>rapide</i>," he said when he had heard them. "That's ma
only reason for mixing in the affair. I promised Davidson I wad
get his money back. And I mean to get it&mdash;somehow."</p>

<p>Pointer agreed that Tibbitts had probably had something to do
with the missing valuables.</p>

<p>"He was very fond of working in the garage here, we have just
been told, and of doing little repairs to the car, which he
practically alone used. The repairs may have included key-making.
Some of that dust in the garage is powdered cuttlefish, or I'm
mistaken. Than which there's nothing better for taking
impressions. He recognized that key. I shouldn't be surprised if
he had made it."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"Yet," Mackay said at last, "there was anither man, a third
man, in yon death room. It wasna Tibbitts." He shook his head.
"Tibbitts a thief, aye. A safe-breaker possibly. But nae
murderer."</p>

<p>The chief inspector rose.</p>

<p>"Well, Cambier and the <i>juge</i> think we shall know
tonight. The commissaire is convinced of Tibbitts's guilt."</p>

<p>"But the <i>juge</i> isn't?" Mackay asked.</p>

<p>"I think he doubts it," Pointer gave Mackay a faint smile;
"but I think it's only because he rather believes that Miss Young
is mixed up in the affair in some way."</p>

<p>"Yon great lawyer is coming by the evening train; he may see
some way oot," Mackay murmured.</p>

<p>"Unless the way is out of the room where Tibbitts is safely
locked-up, I don't see how he can be of any help. But his coming
shows that Tibbitts has some friends concerned for him. He looked
a very astonished man when he heard of Lenormand's expected
arrival and partisanship."</p>

<p>"I thocht that put on," Mackay said, rising in his turn.
"Weel, I'm more than ever glad that ma pairt is just the
money&mdash;the siller. This life and death business sickens me.
I felt like a lad watching a rabbit chased by stoats this
morning. And tonight will be waur. For that puir fule hasna the
wit to help himself."</p>

<p>But there was no reconstruction of the crime that night. At
seven Maître Lenormand arrived from Paris. He dined in his room
at the inn and about eight-thirty, after a careful reading of
copies of all the reports, sallied out to interview his client.
The client was not there. Tibbitts had escaped. An escape that is
still talked of in Cluny. A quick investigation by a furious
Cambier brought out the truth.</p>

<p>This was not the maître's second visit, but his first. Yet at
half-past seven some one wearing his big black hat and black
cloak, both well-known garments of his, on which even the morning
paper had commented, had arrived at the wing of the Hotel de
ville where Tibbitts was housed on the first floor, with no exit
except through a guardroom, or at least a room always occupied by
at least two busy policemen writing their reports.</p>

<p>The great <i>avocat</i> arrived, handed in his card, and was
at once shown into Tibbitts's room. He mentioned that he would
have to go back to the hotel almost at once for an important
paper which he had forgotten. He had a largish bag with him. In
about five minutes he passed out again, at least the police
thought it was he. This time he made no remark, but was in a
great hurry, as was natural. Nearly half an hour later the men in
the outer room went off duty. While they were still talking to
the men who were to take their place, handing over the reports
and discussing the items of the day, the man they took to be
Lenormand, still in hat and cloak, came out again from Tibbitts's
room.</p>

<p>"This time I am really off for the night," he remarked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"We did not see you come back," the <i>agent</i> nearest him
said quickly.</p>

<p>"No! I will report myself at the table each time after this,"
the so-called Lenormand said very civilly, offering the man a
couple of cigars and wishing them all good-night.</p>

<p>That was all. But it was enough to make Cambier nearly break a
blood-vessel when confronted with the <i>maître's</i> denial of
any such previous visit, and the abundant proofs that he had not
left the hotel since his arrival at seven until now, half-past
eight.</p>

<p>"It was some accomplice of Tibbitts's," Rondeau murmured;
"some apache friend. French, apparently&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly," rectified Cambier. "His accent was that of a
Frenchman. And besides&mdash;the neatness of the whole
plan&mdash;its admirable simplicity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It must have been some one who knew that our police are
changed at just that hour," Rondeau thought; "that looks like a
local man. It sounds bizarre, but have you reflected, <i>mon
chef</i>, that Monsieur Pichegru is just the height and build of
Maître Lenormand? It sounds bizarre, as I say, yet I ask myself
whether&mdash;" he left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Pichegru?" almost yelled Cambier; "what an idea! And
the motive? And how did he escape recognition?"</p>

<p>Rondeau was silent for once.</p>

<p>"My lad, whoever released Tibbitts was himself the murderer,"
Cambier said firmly. "Do you not agree with me?" he asked the
chief inspector and Mackay.</p>

<p>Pointer said that he did. Mackay said that he would have to
think it over before deciding.</p>

<p>"Whoever it was," Rondeau said aloud, "was evidently provided
with a double set of the great Paris <i>avocat's</i> well-known
cloak and broad-brimmed black hat. One he wore, one he carried in
his bag."</p>

<p>Cambier nodded. Rondeau went on:</p>

<p>"He put those in the bag on Tibbitts, who walked out swiftly,
without saying a word&mdash;ostensibly to fetch the paper that
had been forgotten&mdash;down on to the street, around a corner,
and into a car waiting for him. The other waits nearly half an
hour in the empty room&mdash;he has a nerve that one&mdash;and
then, still impersonating Lenormand, comes out at a moment when
he knows that there is always a good deal of bustle and
confusion, when no one can be certain whether he came back before
or not...Besides, who would suspect the great Lenormand of
conniving at the prisoner's escape? And as you say, <i>mon
chef</i>, who would run such a risk unless it were vital that
Tibbitts should not be questioned further. Tibbitts must have
known the secret. Tibbitts must have been about to betray
something absolutely vital. I even ask myself if Tibbitts-"</p>

<p>"It is unendurable!" Cambier fairly shook with bottled fury.
"As to what the <i>juge</i> will say, the devil only knows!" But
the <i>juge</i>, though scandalized that such an escape could
have happened in a case that Scotland Yard was watching, was not
greatly perturbed. He did not think that Tibbitts was guilty of
the murder, he now said. Though he had hoped by reconstructing
the crime, as they believed it to have happened to wring from him
some important, perhaps vital, clue to the baffling problem.</p>

<p>As for Monsieur Pichegru, though that gentleman was unable to
furnish an alibi during the hour Tibbitts escaped, Monsieur
Grandpoint agreed with the commissaire that the idea of his being
either criminal or accomplice was ludicrous.</p>

<p>"His son is in the income-tax department," Monsieur Grandpoint
said severely to Rondeau, who murmured that he had only asked
himself the question.</p>

<p>"A far more likely guess would be Monsieur Smith," Cambier
said suddenly, who had been thinking hard. "He, too, was of the
same height and figure and would not be too well known to the
policemen. Quick! the telephone!"</p>

<p>Over it Cambier learned that Monsieur Smith, who was staying
in one of the best hotels of Vichy, had been out all afternoon
and evening in a car&mdash;yes, driving it himself&mdash;he had
not yet returned. He had spoken of running up to Mont Dore...</p>

<p>Cambier wished to be told the instant that he returned. He
next spoke to the Vichy police, asking them to see when Monsieur
Smith got back, whether the car tires suggested Mont Dore dust or
Cluny's softer loam. Then he had a talk with Maître
Lenormand.</p>

<p>The great <i>avocat</i> was only a little less curious than
was the commissaire at the trick that had been played. But he
wished silence on the affair. He was leaving at once. Returning
to Paris, he said, in a tone that suggested a man flying back to
civilization. The police agreed with him that no word should leak
out as to Tibbitts's escape. Only those actually concerned in the
inquiry were to be aware of the fact that that young man was not
locked up <i>au secret</i>.</p>

<p>Then came the report of Smith's arrival back in Vichy, after a
lapse of time that might have meant an excursion to Mont Dore or
to Cluny. The tires refused to say which. Smith himself said that
he had just run around the country generally, not stopping
anywhere, merely trying the car with an idea to buying her. The
police, who searched the little tonneau, found a piece of a torn
envelope with a Swiss stamp; the postmark was Geneva, though the
date was very blurred.</p>

<p>"Geneva!" repeated Rondeau; "where Madame Eastby wrote
from&mdash;where she is staying! <i>Sapristi</i>, but I ask
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was bundled from the room.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> next morning left Tibbitts on one side and
concentrated on a fact that interested him greatly, which he had
discovered late yesterday afternoon. That was, that there was one
of the guests at the dance who had only been seen masked.</p>

<p>Who must, therefore, have left before the one o'clock
unmasking and supper. It was the footman who had first given the
<i>juge</i> the clue in some answer of his, but the butler, too,
when his attention was called to some of the facts, bore out his
fellow servant's idea. Both men now recollected that the tall
figure, wearing a long robe with a hood pulled over its head, had
only been seen by them near Miss Young. The "Lady with the Fox"
as they called her. They could not recollect having seen the man
in question talking to any one else, though this was only a vague
impression. But both were certain that they had not seen the man
after unmasking time. The butler could not recollect what name
had been on the card handed in by the guest in question. He had
happened to arrive at the same time as a group of local people,
one of whom, "Good King Rene," had mislaid his crown, and in the
confusion until the royal regalia was complete once more, the
stranger had passed on. The servant only remembered one point
about his appearance&mdash;that his hands were unusually dark for
a European.</p>

<p>"African combine&mdash;dark hands!" Rondeau ran his hands
delightedly through his curly hair.</p>

<p>Now the <i>juge</i>, a fervent Roman Catholic, was the author
of a book on <i>Roman Catholics and the Ku-Klux-Klan</i>. As the
garb of the unidentified guest was described to him in detail his
face grew longer and longer.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" he muttered, all but crossing himself.
"What have we here? And remember, <i>messieurs</i>, this man so
dressed, this guest who was not seen after the unmasking, kept
entirely to the company of the fiancée of one of the dead men.
And remember also that we have only her word that it was she who
broke the engagement off. Everything suggests that it was Sir
Anthony, rather than she. Everything! And now, recollect that
this same stranger was apparently no stranger to her. We have the
evidence of one of the waiters, now back in Macon, who heard him
ask her to 'give him what he had come to get.' Personally,
gentlemen, I find here in this mysterious figure, and this
mysterious fiancée, a conjunction more suggestive than in the
thief of the <i>rapide</i>&mdash;Tibbitts and some accomplice. I
will question Mademoiselle Young yet once more."</p>

<p>Vivian sensed the increased antagonism of the <i>juge</i> at
once. In his manner, in his eyes, in his voice. Her own dislike
answered to his.</p>

<p>Questioned, she replied that she recalled the figure
perfectly. It was Mr. Lascelles, she felt sure. She explained Mr.
Lascelles, as far as she knew him. She had not seen the figure
after supper either, that was to say, after the unmasking. There
was something in her tone that made the magistrate sure that she
was holding something back or not telling the truth. Personally,
he thought the latter.</p>

<p>"What is your religion, mademoiselle?" he asked
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"I am a Christian," she answered blandly, for Pointer did not
need to translate the simpler sentences to her.</p>

<p>The magistrate frowned. This was levity. Or downright
mockery.</p>

<p>"Are you a Roman Catholic?" he asked shortly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And Sir Anthony Cross?"</p>

<p>To his disappointment the <i>juge</i> learned that he was not
one either. Vivian assured the magistrate, after many further
questions, that she knew nothing whatever of the <i>frater</i> of
the Ku-Klux-man beyond meeting him at Villa Porte Bonheur as Mr.
Smith's friend. The <i>juge</i> did not believe her. He sensed
that she was not telling all that she knew. For Vivian at first
kept back the strange episode out side the door of the cedar room
between the <i>frater</i> and the "Egyptian Lady." She hoped that
Mackay might yet make some good use of that. She wanted that lame
duck of a self-distrustful young man to swim. So finally the
<i>juge</i> dismissed her with some acerbity.</p>

<p>"A very determined young lady!" was his comment; "and yet,
according to her own story, we are to believe that she stood
aside and let things take their course?" He shook his head slowly
and firmly. "That, I do not believe."</p>

<p>"That is what I ask myself," Rondeau burst out excitedly; "did
she do that or did she not? I learned, though at the moment I
thought it of no importance, that she practiced pistol shooting
on the very morning of the dance together with Monsieur Smith in
the shooting gallery. Now that is an odd way for a young lady to
spend her time, just before her lover came down to see an old
flame again."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is an American," Cambier put in dispassionately.
"I understand that in that country pistol shooting is part of
every lady's daily round."</p>

<p>The other Frenchmen nodded. Yes, they, too, were aware of
that, but still, in this case...</p>

<p>"She brought her pistol down with her, and it is an
automatic," Rondeau pointed out. "And I ask myself if she did not
bring it intending to use it on Sir Cross."</p>

<p>"Rondeau, do not embroider!" begged his chief. "Her automatic
was not the one that killed either of the two men. And a national
amusement does not mean a crime."</p>

<p>"But, <i>là bas</i>, I understand that every one shoots at
least one person in their lives. So I ask myself&mdash;" Rondeau
murmured, but Cambier asked him to jot down instead some
inquiries about Lascelles which were to be made by telephone and
wireless.</p>

<p>"It is very curious," the commissaire went on, "that all the
men who were at the villa just before or during the time of the
murder have disappeared. Mr. Murgatroyd is unfindable. He is
expected back home in September, and you"&mdash;he turned to
Pointer&mdash;"your people cable you that all researches into his
past are of a most ironclad respectability. That he is, as we
here always took him to be, a savant, a writer on many works of
the past. As to respectability, that, too, seems to clothe
Monsieur Smith."</p>

<p>There was a short pause.</p>

<p>"Have you inquired of Monsieur Smith the address of his
friend, Lascelles?" asked the <i>juge</i> of Rondeau.</p>

<p>The latter had, but Smith had said that he hadn't the faintest
idea where Lascelles was hanging out, bar the fact that both had
arranged to meet at Zermatt in a week's time and try the
Matterhorn by a different traverse. Yes, he had heard from
Lascelles since leaving Cluny. But the letter was only posted
<i>en route</i>, from Geneva, he thought, but he couldn't be
sure.</p>

<p>This was all that could be got from Smith, and it was very
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>"We have no reason, however, to think that either Smith or
Lascelles knew the dead men before coming to Villa Porte
Bonheur," the <i>juge</i> pointed out. "Madame Brownlow, before
she became so ill, poor lady, told us explicitly that she and her
husband knew none of the guests staying there. Except, of course,
Tibbitts&mdash;and except, as came later, Sir Anthony Cross. He,
we know, came to Porte Bonheur villa because of Brownlow, whom we
now know was not merely an old acquaintance, but a temporary
partner of his."</p>

<p>"Whom we have been told was. I dinna believe that last part,"
Mackay remarked as always.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mrs. Eastby arrived. Nothing could make her
anything but a very handsome woman. But her wonderful eyes looked
as though they had spent some hours staring into black depths.
The lines around her passionate, rather disappointed-looking
mouth had grown a great deal deeper than when Vivian and she had
watched each other at the supper table the night of the dance.
She explained to the <i>juge</i> that she and her husband,
Colonel Eastby, were old acquaintances of Sir Anthony. Her
husband was in a nursing home, or the whole affair would have
been carried out by him&mdash;doubtless very much more cleverly.
This pleased the <i>juge</i>. It was the correct attitude for the
other sex. She went on quickly, but clearly, to explain that the
friendship between the three of them, though of long standing,
had never been a very close one. On coming down to Cluny to see a
town of which all the world had heard, she had met Sir Anthony in
the train&mdash;to their mutual surprise. He had happened to
speak of a new business venture which he was about to sponsor. He
had not gone into details, but he had let it be seen that it
would make the fortunes of those who got in on the ground
floor.</p>

<p>"Now," Mrs. Eastby went on with winning frankness; "I'm under
fearfully heavy expenses just now, with my husband ill, and I
asked Sir Anthony at once to invest in it some savings which I
had been able to make out of our very tight fit of an income." He
had put her off, but not definitely. She had hardened herself and
waylaid him for an invitation to the dance at the Villa Porte
Bonheur&mdash;a dance of which the hotel was talking, and where
she hoped to find him in a more genial mood. Her hopes had been
justified. He had taken the sum which to her was so big, to him
so tiny, and had promised to invest it at once for her as she
wished.</p>

<p>"But I must&mdash;I <i>must</i>&mdash;have my money back,
since it's not been invested as I hoped. I simply must have it!"
She was extraordinarily pale, and in her eyes was a look as
though she were fighting down stark terror.</p>

<p>Terror of what? wondered the two Englishmen.</p>

<p>Vivian had talked over Mrs. Eastby with both the Chief
Inspector and the private inquiry agent as soon as it was known
that that lady was coming to Cluny.</p>

<p>Mackay had advised silence.</p>

<p>"That puir wumman had naething to dae wi' the deaths," he said
for the tenth time. "Why drag her affairs oot for general
inspection? It was some wee matter o' her ain, sic as we a'
have."</p>

<p>"Is that according to the light o' reason, or second sight?"
Vivian asked with her disarming laugh.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for Mr. Mackay to say that Mrs. Eastby had
nothing to do with the two murders," she went on. "I don't think
she had actually, but the Ku-Klux-man? Those words I overhead
were sure funny! Do you mean to say, Mr. Mackay, that you won't
even make any use of <i>them</i>?"</p>

<p>"I'm on ma ain job," he replied doggedly, undeterred by her
half-incredulous, half-pleading face.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Pointer had now spoken, and very gravely.</p>

<p>"You ought to tell everything you know, Miss Young. Possibly
Mackay's right, and Mrs. Eastby has nothing to do with this
double crime. But that's not for any civilian to decide. The
responsibility is too tremendous. The very thing you keep back
might help the criminal to escape. Even a detective, who has a
theory of the case, can't possibly tell what's important and what
isn't until near the end, let alone you. By you I mean any
outsider."</p>

<p>"Have <i>you</i> a theory of the crime?" she asked quickly.
Vivian liked the chief inspector, or rather she would have liked
him had she seen more of him. But he held himself very aloof as
he moved to and fro in his pleasant, unobtrusive way. She was
quite sure that nothing escaped those fine eyes of his, but
neither did anything escape his firm mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm too busy asking myself questions&mdash;like
Rondeau&mdash;to have a theory as yet," he said with a smile.</p>

<p>So Vivian now finally told the <i>juge</i> of the scene
outside the cedar room between Mrs. Eastby and Mr. Lascelles, or
rather, between the "Egyptian Lady" and the hooded friar. It was
after Mrs. Eastby had had her first talk with the officials that
Vivian made her statement. It was received very noncommittally.
Then came a surprise. Mrs. Eastby denied the whole
incident&mdash;denied ever having met a man called Lascelles, or
ever having spoken to the hooded figure at the dance, except,
perhaps, some light, passing word.</p>

<p>If Miss Young were telling the truth&mdash;she shot a baleful
glance&mdash;then some one made up in a similar dress had
impersonated her, Mrs. Eastby.</p>

<p>Vivian was aghast, but Mrs. Eastby was not to be shaken. Nor
was Vivian.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> eyed the American girl with all but open
suspicion. Mrs. Eastby turned on her in a burst of almost
hysterical fury:</p>

<p>"I didn't shoot either of those poor men," she cried wildly
when Vivian had left, a very ruffled Vivian, a Vivian by no means
at her best. "I wish to God Sir Anthony Cross were here alive and
well. But that girl? The girl who could tell such a wicked
untruth is capable of anything!" And she began to cry
shakily.</p>

<p>Pointer, watching her, thought that her grief was even deeper
than she wished to show. The others thought the same.</p>

<p>"She loved him," Cambier said firmly, after she had left them;
"yes, poor woman, she is, I think, agonized by the fear that by
handing him over the money, she may have been an indirect cause
of his murder. For three large piles of banknotes..." the
<i>juge</i> shrugged.</p>

<p>"But that money was not to be invested!" Rondeau said almost
violently. "I have learned that Mrs. Eastby was seen talking to
Sir Cross at the station in Enghien by a porter. Therefore she
followed him down here. Oh, there is more behind that sum of
money than an investment! I have a feeling that there is
more!"</p>

<p>So had the <i>juge</i>, and he was a very experienced
psychologist.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">RONDEAU spent the afternoon in a frenzy of
activity. His chief, the commissaire, was busy too. Between them
they learned that two other people had seen Mrs. Eastby and the
tall, hooded figure talking very earnestly together. In each
case, unfortunately, the observer did not speak or understand
English. But each thought that Mrs. Eastby was soothing her tall
companion, or adjuring him to do something that he did not want
to do.</p>

<p>Rondeau found out that a youngish man with very dark hands had
driven Mrs. Eastby away from the hotel. Questioned, she refused
to give the man's name who had driven her or any information as
to the car. She tried to pass off the finality of her refusal as
the merest decency to an absent friend, but the explanation was
patently false.</p>

<p>But, whoever the man in the robe or the driver might have
been, it did not seem possible that he was Lascelles. For Rondeau
finally located that young man. And Lascelles referred the police
Geneva for the night of the dance, to an hotel there which had
known him for years, with whose resident proprietor he had often
gone climbing. Inquiries proved that unless the whole hotel
staff, as well as the Swiss who owned it, were all in league
together, Mr. Lascelles had most certainly spent the fateful
night there. Investigations at the frontier showed that his
passport had duly passed through in the later evening. So, in
spite of Vivian's fancy, whoever the man in the long robe was, it
could not have been Smith's friend, the young science master.</p>

<p>Vivian was at first incredulous, then utterly dumbfounded. As
for the <i>juge</i>, he plainly showed that this shaking of part
of her testimony gave him the gravest doubts as to the rest.</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;say, I was dead sure&mdash;" she
stammered to Mackay in the garden.</p>

<p>"Aye. One thinks!" he retorted; "and one's dead sure. But half
the time one's wrang!" And on that he fell silent.</p>

<p>"Are you coming down to the village, I mean the toon?" he
asked, as she made for the gate.</p>

<p>"I am. Before that judge has me arrested I want to return
something I've stolen." She waved an umbrella at him. As to her
words about arrest, Vivian had no idea how possible, in the
magistrate's opinion, that step seemed.</p>

<p>Mackay had already noticed the umbrella hanging on her arm,
and noticed, too, that it was of a size and make unusual in her
belongings.</p>

<p>"Whose is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know. A couple of strangers came to the museum
yesterday, in which I am being driven to take an interest, very
much against the grain I do assure you. Like Mr. Murgatroyd these
two, however, obviously came to worship. I left before they did,
and the man in charge of umbrellas gave me this instead of my
own. As Mr. Murgatroyd said, it's always to me, or near me, that
things happen!"</p>

<p>"What makes you think this belongs to those men you saw?" he
asked grumpily.</p>

<p>"I happened to notice the men walking up to the museum. One of
them had this very umbrella swinging on his arm. As it's no use
to me, I intend to return it."</p>

<p>"If you've identified it as well as you did Mr. Lascelles's
voice," he began with unkind frankness.</p>

<p>"That alibi of his may be phony after all," she said at once,
but only half-heartedly.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Better give me the brolly," he suggested.
"I'm going that way, the way of the only hotel in the place where
strangers are likely to put up besides my own, and they're not
staying where I am."</p>

<p>But Vivian did not let go.</p>

<p>"Tell me what he looked like and I'll find him out," he
persisted.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I have some interest in life?" she countered.
"As to what he looked like in the museum&mdash;an undertaker
taking a friend to see his mother's grave. That's what he looked
like." And with that brief sketch of the umbrella's owner, Vivian
turned down the avenue of limes. He kept beside her.</p>

<p>"You've quick eyes if you can be as sure as that of the
owner," he repeated after a moment.</p>

<p>"Sure. When all this terrible affair is over, I'm going into
partnership with you, Mr. Mackay. We'd get on fine. You could do
the reasoning, and I the mistakes."</p>

<p>Mackay looked at her. His careworn young face lighted. For a
second she thought that he was going to speak and say something
pleasant, but the usual cloud of taciturnity swept down on him
again.</p>

<p>"It's a ruined concern, Miss Young," he said wearily; "yet, if
I pull off this thing, I might take you at your word," he
finished, giving her a keen, searching look, "but I doot it's
beyond me.</p>

<p>"The dice are sure loaded in this game," she said gently. "It
would take some one like that chief inspector to play them."</p>

<p>"You think he's so good?" Mackay asked without any look of
pleasure; with something that sounded like jealous disparagement
in his voice.</p>

<p>She nodded with certainty. "I know that make of man. And I
know your make."</p>

<p>"And the difference?" Mackay asked shortly.</p>

<p>"You're a man of action," she said kindly. "And that's the
trouble. Detecting doesn't take action. But here's the hotel.
I'll go in and ask if any one answering to the man I saw with
this is staying here."</p>

<p>But Mackay insisted on doing it for her, while she sampled
some ices and cakes at the town's best confectioner's.</p>

<p>Vivian was never more sure that America was God's country than
when she was in a French cake shop. But Mackay found her doing
her best to initiate the young woman in charge into the mysteries
of a Texas sundae. The best local equivalent seemed to consist of
jam and cream and strawberry ice. Mackay shuddered at the sight,
but Miss Young thought it quite fair for a first effort.</p>

<p>"Did you find the man? <i>Is</i> he an undertaker on his way
to his mother's grave?" she asked Mackay on his return.</p>

<p>"He's a Swedish art critic, who only speaks Swedish, so our
interview was short. But he recognized his umbrella."</p>

<p>"And what about mine?" Vivian asked. "Consider me as crushed
as you like, still I want my umbrella."</p>

<p>"The chap, whose gamp was given you, has sent yours to the
villa."</p>

<p>"But how did he know where I was staying?" she persisted in
surprise.</p>

<p>"The mon in charge told him your name and address. A' the lot
of us at the villa are marked men and women, ye ken."</p>

<p>"But the man in charge of the umbrellas doesn't know me! I
went to him at once about it before I came away. He sure didn't
know me from Adam&mdash;or let's say, Eve. He told me as an
excuse that he was new to the town. Say, that's queer!"</p>

<p>"Some other official supplied the information then," Mackay
said carelessly.</p>

<p>Vivian returned to the villa, where she found her umbrella. It
had been left by the <i>chasseur</i> of the hotel where the
strangers were staying. She was sufficiently intrigued to walk on
to the museum which shared with the Hotel de ville the honor of
being housed in what had been the Abbotts' Palace.</p>

<p>The same man was in charge of umbrellas.</p>

<p>"I received my umbrella safely," she said at once; "did you
give the man who took mine my name?"</p>

<p>"But I do not know your name, madam," he said in open
amusement.</p>

<p>"Didn't he come and ask you for it?"</p>

<p>He had not. The man assured her that he had not had any
questions asked about either her umbrella or the one given her by
mistake, except from herself. She decided to ask the same
question of the man at the door. But he was talking volubly in
low tones to a couple of gendarmes. Just behind their heads was
an open window, so high up that any one standing there could
probably not be seen but could hear. Vivian had passed that room
coming out. It was empty now. She stepped back into it and, as
she hoped, her head was barely level with the sill. She listened
intently. She felt quite sure that it was of "the Problem" that
they were talking. It was. And, as far as she was concerned, it
certainly was news. For it was of Tibbitts's escape they were
speaking. And the men, being among themselves, doubted whether he
ever would be taken. The man was a foreigner, they pointed out,
and would probably make for home; and once outside of
France&mdash;well, all Frenchmen knew how slender was the chance
of any one finding a criminal when they couldn't.</p>

<p>Vivian, slipping out in time to meet the man returning to his
post, found that he, too, had had no questions put to him about
any umbrella. She walked home very much mystified. But foremost
was the escape of Tibbitts. How it was accomplished she had no
idea. Evidently it was not supposed to be known, for there had
been no hint of it in any newspaper.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, through information at once furnished him by the
London office of the South African Diamond Combine, the
commissaire had been in telephonic communication with the chief
detective employed by them to trace the perpetrator of the
constant thefts. The man was a Dutchman called Oor, with a number
of men under him working in various capitals. Oor was personally
certain that Sir Anthony's murder could not be connected with the
inquiries proceeding. They were not yet far enough advanced to
need any such panic measure, nor were the men he was after
"killers."</p>

<p>He also maintained that neither the head of the small gang nor
any member of it could have been near Cluny, or south of Paris
since over a fortnight ago. They were all under observation, and
knew it. As to Brownlow, the man killed at the same time as Sir
Anthony, being in any way or sense a helper in locating the
diamond thieves, Oor negatived that quite definitely. Apart from
the fact that Sir Anthony was notoriously a man who only believed
in professional help, this especial tracking was not one where
the cleverest amateur could assist. It could only be solved by a
close inside knowledge of the posted routine of two continents
and the seas between. Had the late Brownlow been a retired
officer of the merchant service or some postal official, there
might have been a possibility of Sir Anthony having asked his
help; but a silk merchant!</p>

<p>As to a suggestion that Sir Anthony had come to Cluny to meet
some other person still who might throw light on the losses, the
speaker had been in secret telephonic communication with Sir
Anthony on his leaving Enghien, and the baronet had not mentioned
the matter. Yet Oor was absolutely certain that he would have
done so in that case. Sir Anthony was a very loyal man, who took
no step without talking it over with the men engaged on the task.
Nor could he have stumbled by chance on any proof at Cluny which
might have brought about his murder or the murder of any
helper.</p>

<p>Oor again repeated that the case was not far enough advanced
for anything of that sort to be possible.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> murmured that he had felt sure all along that
Mademoiselle Young's suggestion as to Sir Anthony having come
down on any inquiry connected with the diamond thefts was but a
blind, a false trail.</p>

<p>"She is deep, that young lady!" he said gravely. "Very deep!"
As to whether Brownlow was helping Sir Anthony as a go-between
for some purchase of a stone or stones, Oor could not say. All he
did know was that such a purchase would have nothing to do with
the firm, but be a purely private matter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pointer, by wireless via Lyons, had been getting
all the information possible about Mrs. Eastby. As far as was
known, neither she nor her husband had ever been in any trouble,
and until he exchanged into a camel corps, he had generally been
stationed in some home garrison where all possible facts were
available.</p>

<p>They had one son. This son had entered the counting house of
the Johannesburg branch of the Diamond Combine two years ago. He
bore, as far as was known, a satisfactory character in every way.
He had been nominated by Sir Anthony Cross, and inquiries showed
that it was Sir Anthony again who had told him to take the four
weeks holiday which was due him this autumn, now, in July. Young
Reginald Eastby was over in London it was thought, though his
only address there was a small club much used by army men from
Egypt. There Pointer could get no present address, only a vague
idea that young Mr. Eastby was in France.</p>

<p>It was the existence of the son which was the important point.
Why had Mrs. Eastby said nothing about him? A son, moreover, who
was old enough&mdash;twenty-six&mdash;to be in the employment of
Sir Anthony's company, though not, it appeared, in any capacity
that brought him into personal touch with that director.</p>

<p>A confidential inquiry had been "beamed" to the firm as to
whether Sir Anthony had in any way seemed to especially favor
young Eastby. The reply was that, considering that the young man
was his nominee, Sir Anthony had always seemed ultra-critical of
his work. Eastby had just been recommended for a very important
rise, a vacant post in London, to which the other directors
thought him especially fitted, but Sir Anthony had opposed the
recommendation, saying that he did not think the young man up to
the new position's difficulties.</p>

<p>An idea of the <i>juge's</i> was swept away by these later
facts.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, of course, one might think..." he said vaguely,
shaking his head; "yes, indeed, one might think...Fortunately Sir
Anthony Cross's legal adviser and personal friend is, I
understand, on his way here. He will represent the family. And
from him we may gain a great deal of help."</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> was referring to Mr. Maitland, who was on his
way to Cluny to take Sir Anthony's remains back to the family
vault. He was, it seemed, one of the executors of the baronet's
will, a friend of many years, and up till now the solicitor in
whose hands the Diamond Combine, at Sir Anthony's instigation,
had placed all its legal business, just as he had transacted
everything of that kind for the dead man for many a year. He had
just retired a few days ago&mdash;to enter parliament, it was
thought&mdash;but seeing the urgency of the situation, he had
volunteered to continue working as heretofore for a few weeks
more, giving the office in London the benefit of his advice and
intimate knowledge of Sir Anthony's plans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Cambier had been furnished with approximate
measurements and a photograph of Reginald Eastby from England.
They showed that it was not impossible for this young man to have
been the Florentine Brother of Mercy at the dance, and that,
later on, he might have driven his mother away from the hotel. If
it were he, why had he come to Cluny for so short a time? Why
gone, without apparently making himself known to his host?</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby was asked where her son was. There was such stark
terror in her face at the question, which was suddenly shot at
her after several quite casual ones, that all the men in the room
were sorry for her. She stammered something unintelligible with
pale lips.</p>

<p>"Madam," the <i>juge</i> said not unkindly, "you had better
give us his address at once. We shall have to have it. We have
evidence showing that he was here the night of the dance."</p>

<p>"But I don't know where he is!" Mrs. Eastby cried in something
near to a shriek. "Somewhere in Bulgaria&mdash;fishing&mdash;and
then he was going on to Cyprus."</p>

<p>"It sounds an expensive holiday..." murmured the <i>juge</i>
who, like most of his nation, did not travel. "I understood that
your means were straightened."</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby replied that Reginald traveled third class and was
doing it extremely cheaply. Most of it on foot. How could she
reach him? She replied that she had no means of doing that. That
when his month was up he would come back to London.</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" muttered the <i>juge</i> with dreadful clearness.
"Madam, I am sorry to wound a mother's feelings, but we have
today&mdash;now&mdash;learned that Sir Anthony requested your son
to take his holiday at once, and at the same time that a
chartered accountant was instructed to go through the young man's
accounts. There was no reason given. But it speaks for
itself."</p>

<p>"Because he was appointed to, or as good as appointed to, a
very much better position in London," Mrs. Eastby cried, twisting
her fingers until the small knuckles&mdash;the knuckles of a
woman of feeling and impulse, but not of much logical
capacity&mdash;seemed to crack.</p>

<p>"Sir Anthony had at the last moment scratched through that
appointment, Mrs. Eastby. That was a proceeding, madam, that
might well arouse passionate fury in the breast of a young man,
who perhaps thought he had a right to extra favoritism on the
part of Sir Anthony Cross.</p>

<p>"You were overheard telling him not to go into the room where
Sir Anthony was." The <i>juge</i> now inclined to believe that
Vivian had told the truth. "He asked Miss Young, taking her for
you, for what he had come to fetch..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby had pulled herself together by this time. Again
she maintained that her son was nowhere near Cluny on the
occasion of the recent dance&mdash;that he and Sir Anthony were
on as good terms as any young man in the firm's employment. As to
Sir Anthony having started him with rather a better paid post
than most beginners had to take, that was due, of course, to the
dead director's friendship with her husband and herself. Her
husband had asked him to do his best for their boy, who had just
left Oxford with a scraped-through pass. Sir Anthony, she
thought, was rather afraid that, having done as much, Reginald
possibly, and certainly the other members of the staff, might
think that he intended to make a favorite of the boy. For that
reason he had gone out of his way to show that, though he had put
the young man in his position out of kindness to the parents, his
kindness ended there. There was no question of any intimacy at
any time between the two.</p>

<p>She was very good indeed now, very matter-of-fact, very clear,
very detailed. Yet there was that in her eyes that told of her
back against some wall.</p>

<p>"She is shielding her son," the <i>juge</i> said when she had
been released from the rack. That was the comparison that the
Scotland Yard man and Mackay both had. "Yes, she is shielding her
son. The poor woman! Of course he came here. Came to meet 'Jane.'
His mother's name is not 'Jane.' Nor do I think he would call her
that. I think 'Jane' is some one else&mdash;perhaps some one who
did not come. It is perplexing&mdash;very, very! Now, the latest
information which we have just received is that Mrs. Eastby is in
some financial difficulty. That she had asked, less than a month
ago, for a loan of a hundred pounds from her bank and was
refused, as she had insufficient security to offer. Her husband's
pension ceasing at his death."</p>

<p>Pointer had just ascertained these facts from the bank manager
in question.</p>

<p>"Yet we find her handing three times that amount to Sir
Anthony Cross. Still, there are ways...There are gambling tables,
there is a lucky deal on the stock exchange. There are the
<i>petites economies</i> so dear to ladies. The savings in the
stocking, never referred to, but always produced when it is a
question of a remarkable chance. Yes, yes, we understand all
that..." murmured the <i>juge</i>. "It is the son, in that
extraordinary garb. Even without believing that fantastic tale of
the young American girl's, it is the son that is of interest to
us," he went on ruminatingly.</p>

<p>A policeman interrupted. Saluting, he brought information that
on the Paris express from Macon had arrived not Mr. Maitland, the
expected representative of the family and Sir Anthony's personal
friend, but a very important person none the less, the head clerk
of the London office of the combine, a man who spoke French as
well as he did English or Tal. Mr. Heimbrot, the clerk in
question, brought with him a letter that had reached the office
after the death of the writer, Sir Anthony. It was dated the day
of his death, and had been collected by the midnight collection
in Cluny. Evidently it was one that had been posted by himself
late in the evening. In it, he not only withdraw all his
objections to young Eastby's obtaining the London appointment,
but strongly urged that he should at once start in his new sphere
on his return from his holiday. Heimbrot believed that Sir
Anthony had intended to do this all along, and had had the young
man take his leave now instead of later with this in view.</p>

<p>Mr. Heimbrot went on to say that he had written to
congratulate young Eastby on the good news, for this letter quite
settled the appointment. Where had he written? To Mr. Eastby's
club in town. It would be forwarded. Mr. Eastby was in France at
the moment. Sir Anthony had referred in a previous letter to
having met Mrs. Eastby in Enghien-les-Bains, and Eastby was
traveling with his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Heimbrot, a middle-aged man with shrewd but kindly lines
on his face, looked uneasy at something in the eyes of the
Frenchmen fixed so eagerly on him. He paused in his
narrative.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Eastby and her son in Enghien? Oh, yes. The name of the
hotel? I want to get into touch with Mr. Eastby," murmured the
<i>juge</i> with an air of content that relieved Mr. Heimbrot.
But the head clerk did not know at what hotel the mother and her
son had stayed. The dead baronet's reference had suggested a
chance meeting.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> next asked for all possible details concerning
Reginald Eastby. Heimbrot told everything that he knew concerning
the young man. No fresh material was added to the known facts,
though he supplied the secretaries of the officials with plenty
of dates. Young Eastby had done very well in the office where he
worked, and had shown executive and financial ability quite above
the average. For which reason he had been proposed for the
unexpected vacancy in London, which meant a big rise in position,
salary and prospects.</p>

<p>Yes, the head clerk had understood from Sir Anthony that he
did not intend to recommend Reginald Eastby to the post, but
evidently, on reflection, he had recognized his undoubted fitness
for it.</p>

<p>"And can you tell me why he had a chartered accountant go
through the young man's books while he himself was away on a
holiday, a holiday which the murdered man had practically ordered
him to take?" asked Cambier. The secretary pursed up his
lips.</p>

<p>"Suspicious, I should say. It looks like that. But evidently
unfounded, or Mr. Eastby wouldn't have got the rise. I think some
one must have been telling tales, false ones, that set Sir
Anthony against young Eastby. There was no reason for them. You
see, I'm from the Jo'burg office myself, a couple of years ago,
and I keep in touch with my old friends out there. Reginald
Eastby is as steady as a rock. Hard working and clever. Lives
quietly with his mother."</p>

<p>"What about Colonel Eastby?" asked the <i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>Heimbrot opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Colonel Eastby's in an asylum. Has been there for donkey's
years. Got kicked on the head by a camel just after he joined the
camel corps. And no hope of recovery, they say."</p>

<p>"In a lunatic asylum?" queried Rondeau, half-rising from his
seat. "A maniac. Homicidal?"</p>

<p>The secretary nodded pityingly. "So they say&mdash;a certified
lunatic."</p>

<p>"And where is this asylum?" breathed Rondeau.</p>

<p>"At Passy. Close to the American hospital there. There's a man
there said to be a marvel. But he hasn't been able to help the
poor colonel, I understand. He's been going from mental home to
mental home for years and years. No good."</p>

<p>"How long ago was his injury?"</p>

<p>"I understand that it happened when young Eastby was a little
chap. He's twenty-six now. About twenty years ago, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"And now," the <i>juge</i> leaned forward and dropped his
voice; "now, about Mrs. Eastby and Sir Anthony Cross?"</p>

<p>Mr. Heimbrot only looked at him.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the friendship between them was of long standing,
<i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>Mr. Heimbrot could not seem to say. He had apparently became
quite vague as to details. He could not say that he had ever
heard any talk connecting Mrs. Eastby's name with that of the
dead man. But he did know that Mrs. Eastby had come to
Johannesburg years ago, just after the accident to her husband,
with her little boy. She lived there very simply. Heimbrot added
that every one was uncommonly sorry for the lovely girl&mdash;she
was little more than that at the time. For herself and for the
ghastly fate that had overtaken her marriage. The Eastbys were
not badly off, but their modest resources were strained to penury
by the expensive charges for the colonel, and had so remained
ever since.</p>

<p>"I saw the letter some four years ago in which she thanked Sir
Anthony for having got her son a post," Heimbrot went on. "She
had marked it 'Personal,' but it got into the wrong pile. Most
touching letter I ever read," he said after a little pause. "And
a credit&mdash;both to the woman who wrote it and the man who got
it," he finished warmly in English.</p>

<p>"Well done!" breathed Mackay to the chief inspector sitting
beside him.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> asked a few more questions. As, for instance,
how Sir Anthony and Mrs. Eastby had come to meet at Enghien. Mr.
Heimbrot had no idea. He did not know either where Mrs. Eastby
was at the moment.</p>

<p>Did he think that possibly she and her son were traveling with
Sir Anthony? Mr. Heimbrot did not. He added that there was a
belief in the office that, personally, Sir Anthony rather
disliked young Reginald Eastby. Pressed, he confessed that he,
too, thought that the baronet was inclined to be over severe on
that young man's work.</p>

<p>The next question concerned the leakage of diamonds from the
parcels sent to Amsterdam. Mr. Heimbrot was very reticent, but he
agreed that Sir Anthony's presence in France was due to some
investigations now going on. That was all for the time-being, and
Mr. Heimbrot, with many thanks, was allowed to stroll around the
little town at his leisure.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence after he left.</p>

<p>"So it was Madam Eastby&mdash;not the husband, who was in a
lunatic asylum&mdash;who asked for that post for her son," the
<i>juge</i> murmured. "And she and her son were together at
Enghien. And she followed Sir Anthony Cross down here. And the
son? I think we may take it that he followed with her. And Sir
Anthony had refused to give the son this rise." He took off his
pince-nez and rubbed them clear. "Does a man of Sir Anthony
Cross's apparent strength of character give an underling a post
because of such persistence? Is it not rather calculated to make
him stand still firmer to his refusal? You, monsieur," the
<i>juge</i> turned to Mackay, "have met him; do you think he was
the kind to yield to pressure?"</p>

<p>Mackay did not. "But he was the kind to yield to common
sense," he said. "Evidently the more he thought it over, the more
certain he grew that this young Eastby was the man for the job.
As Mr. Heimbrot says&mdash;and as seems logical."</p>

<p>"Then why did the mother say nothing about the son's presence
here?"</p>

<p>"Pride," Mackay said at once. "She didna want us to think he
had to beg for it. Aye, and verra likely she didna want the son
to know what was up. Ma idea is that Mrs. Eastby had
him&mdash;her son&mdash;on hand, if need should arise, if Sir
Anthony should want an interview with him, but that she didna
want Sir Anthony to know that Eastby was there unless he asked
for him. Thae words Miss Young overheard, they might fit in wi'
that theory."</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> pondered this, eyes on the notes taken.</p>

<p>"You forget that we have here a double crime of singular
ferocity," he pointed out; "a double crime. And a cunning one.
Locked door on the inside, revolvers beside each man. The
detective in charge of the inquiry into the disappearance of the
diamonds is certain that there is no one in Cluny connected with
that."</p>

<p>"I do not say that I agree with him," Cambier cut in as the
<i>juge</i> turned to him. "But on the other hand, he is certain
that Monsieur Brownlow, whatever Madam Brownlow's idea was,
cannot have been taking any part in the search for the missing
thieves."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I ask myself&mdash;" put in Rondeau.</p>

<p>Unheeding him, as usual, the commissaire went on: "I think Mr.
Oor's reason for that belief is sound. I confess it appeals to me
more than his certainty that no criminal connected with the
thefts from the combine could have come to Cluny. Tibbitts for
one&mdash;and in some way, Smith too? Though of him I do not feel
really suspicious. But now this little perplexity about the son
of Mrs. Eastby..."</p>

<p>"What I ask myself," Rondeau announced; "is where is the
colonel? The mad colonel? Have we not here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A forged document," the <i>juge</i> finished, speaking very
solemnly. "That, messieurs, is the great, great question on which
much hangs." He paused. You could have heard a piece of paper
fall in the attentive silence. "Is this letter a forgery?" He
held up the one Heimbrot had brought him. "Was it a final
desperate effort on a mother's part to get her son into a good
position, or on his own part, with her connivance? Was Sir
Anthony already dead when this letter was concocted, or was he
killed to prevent the inevitable discovery that it was a forgery?
And the death of Mr. Brownlow, was that, as has been already
surmised might prove to be the case, an effort to cover up the
first crime? Did he intrude on the murder&mdash;or the forgery?
Was he silenced by the only means that spells perpetual silence?
Since, I take it, in the next world we shall not need tongues.
Our experts will decide the question of forgery at once. I think
it looks very dark indeed, <i>messieurs</i>. Not so much against
that poor wife and mother, whose fate has certainly been in
life's shadows, but against the son. Evidently ambitious. Else
why the quiet life, the attention to duty, of which that kindly
disposed head clerk has just told us.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Cambier, you are an expert on such a
point?" He handed the note over and went on: "Personally, I think
the note looks unlike Sir Anthony's usual writing, of which Mr.
Mackay provided us with an example. If it be a forgery, then we
come back to the theory of the impassioned pleading of the
mother, resulting in one more absolute refusal to place the son
in a position for which she thinks him so well suited, for which
he has strained every nerve to fit himself. That dislike of the
son&mdash;it looks as though at some time the mother had put the
son first and Sir Anthony second," the <i>juge</i> said
slowly.</p>

<p>Cambier looked up long enough to nod.</p>

<p>"That's what I think." That was what Pointer thought too.</p>

<p>"One can imagine...one can imagine"&mdash;certainly one could
almost see the <i>juge</i> at it&mdash;"a young wife, very
beautiful, kept to her duty by the little son. And a man
rich&mdash;of the nobility&mdash;also young, accustomed, perhaps,
to being all-victorious, who found that, because of that son, the
mother stood firm where the woman and the wife would have
weakened. Well, Cambier, what of that letter?"</p>

<p>"It is hard to say." Cambier had all the reluctance of your
expert to commit himself.</p>

<p>"The difficulty will be to find the son&mdash;the masked young
man who was no more seen after the hour for unmasking."</p>

<p>"If nothing leaks out, he must return when his leave is up,"
Cambier thought. "Then of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rondeau came in with fresh information. He had just been
called to the telephone. His researches had borne fruit. Mrs.
Eastby and her son had stayed at one of the small hotels in
Enghien while Sir Anthony was there, arriving the same day that
he came, and leaving the day that he left. Apparently Reginald
Eastby had never been seen with the magnate, but spent most of
his time on the Enghien golf course. But on four occasions he had
been seen in the local teashops with a young, fair American
girl.</p>

<p>"Young, fair American? <i>Sapristi!</i>" muttered Cambier.</p>

<p>"Does it fit Mademoiselle Young, that description, or does it
not?" purred the <i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>Rondeau went on with his gleanings. Reginald Eastby seemed to
have spent a very quiet time at Enghien. Neither he nor his
mother went near the gaming tables, which was surprising, for one
only goes to Enghien-les-Bains to gamble.</p>

<p>"I ask myself," Rondeau said, laying down a copy of the
report, "whether it was Tibbitts whom Mademoiselle Fumier heard
in the cedar room. Suppose it was young Eastby with whom that
quarrel took place."</p>

<p>"Ah," the <i>juge</i> nodded, "ah! That would fit well.
Mademoiselle Fumier heard the word 'thief,' and many times the
word 'money.'" He paused and repeated, "'Thief'&mdash;a chartered
accountant to go over a clerk's books&mdash;a mother who insists
on paying to the director three hundred pounds which she can ill
afford to spare. Oh, <i>messieurs</i>, here, I think, lies one
end of this tangle. We will see that poor Madam Eastby once
again."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. EASTBY came in looking as though some inner
fire were scorching her up.</p>

<p>Rondeau had found a piece of evidence which the <i>juge</i>
now used with very good effect. Rondeau's find was a waiter, at
present in Lyons, who had been sent by a local <i>pattissier</i>
to help at the villa the night of the dance&mdash;the night of
the double murder, as it was called in the local press. He had
been told to fetch a small table from a window in the passage
that ran between the cedar room and the writing-room. He found
that the table had already been taken, but while looking about
for it he, too, had seen that strange interlude which Vivian had
watched and overheard between the veiled Egyptian woman and the
tall hooded figure.</p>

<p>He had seen Vivian too, and his confirmation of her presence
and of the pantomime&mdash;he understood no word that was
said&mdash;now bore out the girl's story. Even the <i>juge</i>
accepted it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby was told that a second witness had been found who
definitely identified her son, a witness who had seen him at
Enghien-les-Bains, where he had been staying with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby's rouged thin cheeks went blue-white. So did her
lips. Her eyes had in them the unforgettable look of a hunted
deer when the dogs close up. There was only profound pity in the
faces of those watching her, but they were all the hounds of the
law. Pledged to run down the guilty without pity. Mrs. Eastby
pulled herself together splendidly after one second's
hesitation.</p>

<p>She explained, with an appearance of great frankness which
only the look in her eyes made unconvincing, that she had so
hoped to keep her son out of this terrible affair. This was what
had happened. She wanted Sir Anthony to invest the three hundred
pounds for her as she had already explained, but her boy had a
dislike of Sir Anthony and a great objection to making any use of
him. But she wanted her son to come with her; after all, should
it come to a difficulty in talking over money matters, a woman
liked to lean on a man, even on her son. She gave a bright smile
at this, a smile that she kept flying in face of the deepest
gravity around her. So, in order to have Reginald with her in
case of some hitch, and yet not have him know what she wanted of
Sir Anthony, she told him that a girl with whom he was very much
in love, an American girl whose first name was Jane, would be at
the dance in fancy dress, and masked, of course. He had come for
that reason. Miss Young was the only English-speaking young woman
present, and though considerably taller than her son's "girl,"
the difference between them was attributed by him to the costume
and mask and the effort to be disguised.</p>

<p>She, Mrs. Eastby, by the way, had a bet on that no one would
recognize him. A very big bet. It did not apply to "Jane," as
otherwise he refused to come with her, but to every one else.
That was why she did not want him to enter the room where Sir
Anthony was, who would, of course, have known him from his voice,
if from nothing else.</p>

<p>With whom was this bet?</p>

<p>She declined absolutely to say. Unfortunately her son had an
understanding with "Miss Jane" about a photograph of hers that
she was to give him if&mdash;well, as an answer to a letter which
he had written her. Mrs. Eastby did not know what letter nor what
answer, but, of course, one could guess. Again her heart-breaking
smile flashed around. Her son, as she said, had at first mistaken
Miss Young for this other girl, but he chanced to overhear her
speaking to Mr. Smith in her natural voice, and on that he had
very indignantly refused to stay, either to supper or later. She
had remained behind, delighted that Sir Anthony had taken over
the money for her, and after supper and a change at the hotel,
her son, who had been driving about to cool off, had come for her
as had been arranged and driven on with her to Macon, where they
caught the Geneva express.</p>

<p>By this time, for the <i>juge</i> did not let her story go
unquestioned, the report of the specialists was put in his hands.
Three of the five experts considered that the letter brought by
Mr. Heimbrot, the head clerk, was written by Sir Anthony Cross,
though under the stress of considerable haste and emotion. Two
were sure that it was a forgery.</p>

<p>He read it through, handed it around, and then turned to the
woman, who passed her tongue over her lips.</p>

<p>"Now, madam, I am sorry, but there is one more point. One of
the dancers heard a man quarreling, or at least having a very hot
disagreement with Sir Anthony Cross just before he must have been
murdered. This man was your son." He spoke with great
certainty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby stared at him in apparently genuine bewilderment.
"A quarrel?" she asked more quietly than she had yet spoken.</p>

<p>"A disagreement of the strongest kind, let us say then." The
<i>juge</i> pursed his lips, as though he had no need to quibble
about trifles. "The word&mdash;forgive me for hurting a mother's
feelings&mdash;but the word was 'thief,' and there was a constant
reference to 'money'&mdash;to the three hundred pounds you
brought back. There is a suggestion," the <i>juge</i> went on,
"that the man speaking to Sir Anthony Cross was Tibbitts. But he
denies that flatly. I am inclined to think it was your son."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Mrs. Eastby said eagerly. "Oh, no! He was dancing
with Miss Young at the very moment. I heard that talk. I
and"&mdash;she swallowed hard and tried to turn her et&mdash;she
was speaking French&mdash;into a cough.</p>

<p>"You and Mr. Murgatroyd," finished the <i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>His shot went home. Mrs. Eastby again paled, a sickly pallor.
Her hand went to her heart.</p>

<p>"I too as it happens, heard part of a long talk between Sir
Anthony and a man," she went on steadily enough. "It was before I
had my talk with him."</p>

<p>"Sir Anthony and Tibbitts, I presume," the <i>juge</i> said
wearily.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Oh, no. I had talked to Monsieur Tibbitts
that evening. This was a gentleman speaking. The voice was
cultured. The intonations quiet."</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> was rather surprised, though he did not show
it, that she had not snatched at the idea of the speaker being
Tibbitts.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what was said?" the <i>juge</i> asked
noncommittally.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, no! I was too engrossed with&mdash;my hopes
that Sir Anthony would invest the money for me to pay much
attention. I only listened to hear when the voices would stop and
I could speak to him again."</p>

<p>"You heard enough to tell you what they were talking about,
doubtless?" the <i>juge</i> asked.</p>

<p>"I only heard the word 'tufa' said very clearly once."</p>

<p>"Tufa?" the <i>juge</i> looked puzzled. "What meaning has that
word in English, madam?"</p>

<p>"The same as in French. It's a kind of volcanic rock, I
fancy." There was a pause. The <i>juge</i> was inclined to
believe Mrs. Eastby. The word overheard was not of the kind which
one could see any reason for her inventing.</p>

<p>"How was it used?" he asked next. "I mean, was it in a
sentence or by itself? Said as though in explanation or in a
question?"</p>

<p>"Said in great anger," she replied at once. "Sir Anthony said
it. It seemed to be in reply to a long sentence on the other
man's part which I didn't hear&mdash;as I say I wasn't listening
to what was said&mdash;but this word came like a sort of whip-crack; 'Not tufa!' as though that ended things. There was a long
silence after that, and the rest was carried on in a lower voice,
and again I paid no heed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby was allowed to leave them for a brief respite, and
Mr. Heimbrot was asked to come in again, after the <i>juge</i>
had studied an English-French dictionary very carefully and
consulted an encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Mr. Heimbrot was at once asked if he had ever heard of tufa in
connection with Sir Anthony's interests or in connection with the
combine's properties.</p>

<p>Mr. Heimbrot thought a while.</p>

<p>"If you mean 'volcanic tuff,' which used to be called 'tufa,'
there might be a connection&mdash;if Sir Anthony were talking to
some one who was not familiar with diamond earth. I don't know of
any diamonds that have been found in volcanic tufa, but we're
always on the lookout for that possibility. The Great Matan stone
was found in a layer of it in Borneo. For years it was held to be
a diamond, though now it is considered a rock crystal, but it's
very close to being a pure diamond. Just a little more of this,
or that, and it would have been one of the finest stones in the
world. Three hundred and sixty-seven carats, mind you. The Great
Moghul was only two hundred and seventy-nine. Yes, I shouldn't
wonder at all if the talk was on diamondiferous earths, which
always are volcanic in origin, of course. Volcanic breccia
generally."</p>

<p>"Do you think Sir Anthony was about to start any new
enterprise? Form any new company?" the <i>juge</i> went on after
a pause, "One into which he might let a friend on the ground
floor now, but which would be closed to further capital on such
advantageous terms very soon?"</p>

<p>Heimbrot was all eagerness. The <i>juge</i> repeated most of
what Mrs. Eastby claimed had passed between herself and Sir
Anthony Cross about the investigating of the three hundred pounds
which she asserted that she had handed him. Heimbrot was like a
ratter who hears a rustle in the hayrick. Nothing could quiet him
down. He pelted the <i>juge</i> with questions. It was only when
he was really convinced that no one in the room could tell him
more that he returned to the role of the questioned, not the
eagerly questioning.</p>

<p>Evidently getting in on the ground floor with Sir Anthony
Cross was a privilege not to be lightly turned down.</p>

<p>Then followed an adjournment for refreshments. Mackay caught
sight of Mrs. Eastby's face at the window of one of the rooms.
Again he thought of the deer and the closing in of the hounds.
Instantly he wheeled and went back, opened the door of the room,
and went up to her. His usual shyness gone. He took her hand in
his. It was as hot as though she were in a fever.</p>

<p>"Don't give way," he said abruptly enough, but in a voice that
turned her to him. "Things look black, but your son is all right,
Mrs. Eastby. We know he didn't hurt a hair of either man's head,
and we'll prove it yet. Trust me." There was a ring of certainty
in his voice. Her other hand closed around his lean brown one
with its big knuckles.</p>

<p>"He's innocent, oh, he is indeed!" she said in a gasp;
"but&mdash;but&mdash;" She looked at him in a haggard terror.</p>

<p>"I know he's innocent," Mackay said again. "I have the gift of
second sight, Mrs. Eastby. It hasn't let me down so far. I saw
your son the night of the dance. He's no murderer!"</p>

<p>Her eyes lost a little, but only a very little of their
terror. "If you can bring the others around to your way of
thinking, Mr. Mackay, I'll bless you&mdash;wherever I am. The
mere suspicion of a crime would ruin his career. He would never
get over it. Never! And he's worked so hard to get on, and has
had such an uphill fight. And he's so proud&mdash;" She turned
away, her face working convulsively.</p>

<p>A gendarme entered. Would monsieur step back into the
conference room? Monsieur Maitland, the representative of the
family of Sir Cross, the dead baron, had arrived at last.</p>

<p>Mackay gave Mrs. Eastby's arm a warm, encouraging touch, and
hurried off. But he stopped before the Winter plaque on the wall
and looked at it very long, instead of going at once into the
room where the <i>juge</i> was receiving the newcomer.</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland proved to be a tall, thin, very reserved-looking
man of around forty, with a sensitive mouth and rather unusually
dreamy eyes for his profession.</p>

<p>He soon supplied the police with a large amount of fresh facts
concerning Sir Anthony Cross's life and activities.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what piece of financial activity Sir
Anthony was contemplating which would be to the advantage of his
friends to invest in, should he permit it?" the <i>juge</i> asked
finally.</p>

<p>"You mean the Mongolian Exploration Trust?" he asked
doubtfully. "I doubt if that would exactly be considered an
investment plum by many people. Sir Anthony was financing it
largely. All the members of the expedition were contributing. It
was rather in the nature of a strictly family party. No outsiders
permitted. There could be no returns for some time."</p>

<p>"But a sum of three hundred pounds invested in it would be
profitable in the long run, eh?"</p>

<p>Maitland seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"Three hundred pounds? You mean three thousand? Hundreds are
of no use in such an enterprise."</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> only nodded. Yes, he thought this rhymed
fairly well with Mrs. Eastby's story. Mr. Maitland might think in
thousands, but on an occasion, for an old friend, Sir Anthony had
evidently condescended to include a small sum in the
enterprise&mdash;doubtless a golden one.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> passed on to other questions, general ones,
about Sir Anthony. His friendship with the Brownlows, for
instance, Mr. Maitland said that the three had met long ago, but
that, as far as he knew, Sir Anthony and the Brownlows had not
seen anything of each other for many years.</p>

<p>"He wrote to Monsieur Brownlow a short time ago, we have been
told." Maitland murmured that that was quite possible. The
<i>juge</i> went on to detail the idea of Mrs. Brownlow that the
husband was acting for Sir Anthony in some way.</p>

<p>Maitland listened very closely. He made no comment. Pressed
for an opinion, he explained that he would know nothing of Sir
Anthony's personal plans. Did he know whether Sir Anthony had
come to Cluny at the Brownlows' suggestion or on his own
initiative. Maitland was quite certain that the latter was the
case. There was a letter, written by Sir Anthony&mdash;Maitland
put his hand into his breast and drew out a letter-case, but
after a glance at its contents, shook his head. He had not kept
this particular letter to which he was referring, as it was not
connected with business, he explained, but in it Anthony Cross
had mentioned that he had suddenly decided to run down to Cluny
for a couple of days. He had even asked him, Maitland, to join
him there. If the <i>juge</i> had not just told him about the
business link between the two dead men, Maitland went on to say
that he would have suggested that possibly Sir Anthony had gone
to Cluny for a quiet rest to think over the diamond thefts which
were troubling him greatly&mdash;not because of their intrinsic
value, though in view of the raised insurance rates, that was
something, as because of the suspicion that it might be a member
of their own firm out in Johannesburg who was, if not the actual
thief, then in league with him.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i>, remembering Mackay's assertion that Brownlow
was connected with those thefts, questioned Mr. Maitland closely
about them, or as closely as that gentleman would permit.</p>

<p>For Maitland explained that steps were even now being taken
which any leakage would nullify, and he had had to promise their
Mr. Oor to be silent concerning them.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> sat a moment thinking.</p>

<p>"Did Sir Anthony suspect Mr. Reginald Eastby of being
connected with the thefts?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Maitland said, looking very grave; "yes, he did. Quite
without foundation, in my belief, and in the belief of the other
directions. Fortunately, Sir Anthony himself evidently found some
reason to come over to our way of thinking, or he would not have
written the letter pressing Reginald Eastby's claims in
a&mdash;for him&mdash;singularly warm way to the new post in
London. I understand that the head clerk, Mr. Heimbrot, brought
you that letter?"</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> said that they had seen it.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then the magistrate wanted to know if Sir
Anthony was interested in geology.</p>

<p>"Naturally," Maitland agreed with a smile. "His Mongolian
expedition was to search for valuable minerals."</p>

<p>"A quarrel, or at least a discussion, was overheard not long
before he was murdered, in which the word 'tufa' occurred in such
a way as to suggest that it played an important part in the
discussion. 'Not tufa!' were the exact words, said very sharply,
and apparently angrily. Could you help us to understand
this?"</p>

<p>Maitland had light blue eyes, of that clear color that is very
pleasant to watch. Now they went black. The pupils had dilated
suddenly. But otherwise he showed no sign.</p>

<p>"'Not tufa!'" he repeated, stroking his chin thoughtfully;
"that is not enough of a sentence to help much in guessing the
conversation, beyond showing that the talk was geological in
character."</p>

<p>"The word may have been misunderstood. Or the account of the
interview may be unreliable," the <i>juge</i> murmured. He then
questioned Mr. Maitland about the state of feeling between his
dead friend and Mr. Reginald Eastby.</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland thought that Sir Anthony had not cared for Eastby
personally, but that there was no use denying that the latter was
a most suitable candidate for the London post. As to any
friendship between the mother and the dead man, Maitland
stiffened at the question. He grew as vague as Heimbrot. Sir
Anthony and Colonel Eastby had been friends before the latter's
accident cut him off from the outer world. Naturally he must have
known Mrs. Eastby, perhaps quite well. Maitland really could not
say. He had never met Mrs. Eastby. His work had lain in London.
Even young Eastby he only knew from his work and the
correspondence which he had had with him.</p>

<p>Mackay entered the room at that. He whispered a word to
Rondeau, who leaped from his seat and vanished with him. A moment
later Cambier rose. There was something in the wind evidently.
When his junior fled in that hurried fashion it was as well to
follow.</p>

<p>Rondeau was standing staring up at the pewter dish at the end
of the hall. "You are right. It does look like it. But"&mdash;a
second more and he had jerked the dish from its holders, all but
decapitating himself. On the floor, all three bent over
it&mdash;"this apparent second sun, <i>mon chef</i>. Monsieur
Mackay here thinks it&mdash;ah, it is!"</p>

<p>With these cryptic words Rondeau pried out a little ball and
held it in his hand. "Look, a revolver bullet!"</p>

<p>Cambier examined it carefully. "Flattened a bit, but the mate
to the one that killed Sir Anthony Cross. But this is most
extraordinary! I confess I have always taken it for a mere
repousse lump. Let this be a lesson to you, Rondeau; you think I
pay too much attention to trifles. Here is an instance of not
paying enough attention! This is very strange&mdash;evidently
that plaque hung in front of the cedar room door. See the old
marks of the hangers. We will question the maids at once. Without
saying why, naturally. Carry this into the writing-room and lock
the door." Rondeau dragged it off. Cambier went into the dining-room and held a review of the servants one by one.</p>

<p>The information he obtained was that the plaques had hung in
their right order the morning of the dance. Butler as well as
maids was positive of that. Also they had been carefully cleaned
that same morning. There had been a suggestion of hanging them in
a line in the ball-room behind some clumps of pink geraniums, but
Mrs. Brownlow had finally preferred mirrors. As to the
possibility of any bullet having been at that time lodged in the
dish, the bullet had not been polished. But in the dent behind
it, a speck of sand had been driven into the metal. The plaques
were scoured with sand and vinegar.</p>

<p>So two bullets had been fired from the pistol that killed Sir
Anthony, or at least from a similar one. Was it at Brownlow that
it had been fired, and had the murderer then remembered that he
had provided himself with Anthony Cross's revolver to use on this
man so as to suggest a duel? It was a very perplexed Cambier who
finally re-entered the conference room where the <i>juge</i>, his
questions done, was chatting amiably with Mr. Maitland and
discussing the wines of the district. A glance at the commissaire
and the <i>juge</i> begged Mr. Maitland not to let him detain him
from resting after his journey.</p>

<p>Maitland seemed quite willing to leave.</p>

<p>When the door shut behind him, Cambier suggested a move into
the writing-room. There the plaque was examined, the bullet was
examined, and the butler was finally once more examined.</p>

<p>"It is a most enigmatical case!" murmured the <i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>"And, monsieur <i>le juge</i>" broke in Rondeau; "that
geological talk, that word 'tufa'&mdash;I ask myself whether a
science master, who was a geological expert&mdash;in other words,
whether, after all, Monsieur Lascelles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not be led away by what would be interesting!" counseled
Cambier. "Monsieur Lascelles has an alibi that seems
unshakable.</p>

<p>"Yet it is a thought!" mused the <i>juge</i>, dangling his
glasses.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," put in Cambier, "that the finding of that
bullet tends to exonerate all people not actually staying in the
house. For it looks like some one who would have leisure to
change the plaques. It suggests some one who was a
friend&mdash;an inmate. Yes, to me it suggests Tibbitts."</p>

<p>"I will ask Monsieur Maitland, if he is still in the house, a
few more questions," the <i>juge</i> said finally, as the result
of his cogitations. He rang the bell. Mr. Maitland had not yet
left. He was inquiring after Mrs. Brownlow, who still tossed and
moaned and babbled on her bed overhead.</p>

<p>The <i>juge's</i> questions led to nothing fresh. He was just
finishing the interview when a note was handed him. Mrs. Eastby
wondered if she might speak to Mr. Maitland before he left. She
wrote that she wanted to press for the return of the money handed
by her to Sir Anthony for investment. Possibly the executor of
the dead man would raise no objection to its being paid back at
once, out of the estate. Sir Anthony's fortune had gone, as they
had just been told, to a distant kinsman, the heir to the
baronetcy, apart from charities bequests and a very handsome
legacy to his executor, himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastby was admitted at once. She and Mr. Maitland, who
introduced himself, exchanged a few words of mutual regret on the
sad occasion of the meeting, and Maitland went on to say a kind
word about her son. Mrs. Eastby was very pale. She did not bring
forward the reason which she had given in her note for wishing to
meet the newly-arrived friend of the late Anthony Cross.</p>

<p>Instead she leaned forward to the <i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>"Might I have a few words with you when this gentleman has
done?"</p>

<p>Maitland insisted on leaving at once. The others, intrigued by
something in Mrs. Eastby's face, gathered around.</p>

<p>"That man&mdash;Mr. Maitland&mdash;that's the man I heard
quarreling with Sir Anthony in the cedar room! That's the voice I
heard. Oh, I could swear to it anywhere. And would."</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> turned on her his cold scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Be very careful, madam. The point is important. Very."</p>

<p>"Of course. I know that. But it was his voice that I heard
answering when Sir Anthony broke out into that angry cry of 'Not
tufa!'"</p>

<p>She was questioned and cross-questioned. The men listened most
intently, for, though she did not know this, a man had told them
only yesterday that he had seen a stranger making his way across
to the villa about midnight dressed in a big loose coat and soft
cap. The man, a baker going on night work, had noticed him
because the evening was so warm, and he had wondered at that
coat. It did not conceal a fancy dress; he had looked to see as
much. The stranger was carrying a small dispatch case. He claimed
to have even seen him stop and look at his watch once. The hour
was about eleven. Nothing had come of the efforts to trace this
stranger, and the police had decided that he was a certain
traveling salesman, who said that he had passed that way about
that time and had stopped at the lamp-post in question to see the
time. He had been wearing a top coat, but not carrying a bag of
any kind.</p>

<p>Now, however, the baker was questioned again. His description,
which had fitted the traveling salesman badly, fitted Maitland
very well indeed. A top coat meant a car probably, since the man
was wearing tweed trousers. Around eleven&mdash;an express got
into Macon in time to bring a traveler, in a car, to Cluny around
then. Now, there are not many night garages in Macon. An inquiry
was put through at once. Meanwhile all the attention of the
French police was concentrated on the new
possibility&mdash;Maitland. Maitland, the dead man's friend, the
beneficiary by a large bequest, a party to that new enterprise
which Mrs. Eastby had been told by Sir Anthony was so
valuable.</p>

<p>There followed a few hours' intensive work, hours which
brought some interesting facts to light. Then Mr. Maitland was
asked to come to the <i>juge's</i> room in the Hotel de
ville.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> said that a man resembling him had been seen
the night of the dance making for the villa. That a voice,
definitely identified as his, had been heard talking to Sir
Anthony. Where had Mr. Maitland been the night of the
murders?</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland was not swift in his replies. He had a way, from
the first, of looking at his interlocutor before speaking that
gave him an air of caution. He now eyed the <i>juge</i>
meditatively for a full second, then he said quietly:</p>

<p>"I motored over from Lyons the night of the dance to see Sir
Anthony Cross."</p>

<p>"Indeed? This is the first we have heard of it&mdash;from you,
monsieur." Maitland said nothing. He looked quite at his ease.
But he was the kind of man to look at his ease with a boiler
bursting beneath him.</p>

<p>"What hour was this interview, pray?"</p>

<p>Maitland seemed to ponder.</p>

<p>"I got out of the car around eleven. I was driving it myself,
and left it in a field the other side of the river. I met Sir
Anthony by chance in the garden. He had just posted that letter
concerning Reginald Eastby, so he told me. We walked together
through one of the open windows into a room, which I think must
be the one you call the cedar room. Sir Anthony had been writing
some letters there. We sat down and talked over a business
matter, of which I regret that I am not at liberty to give you
any particulars. Then I left by a little side door very close to
the room, which Sir Anthony shut behind me. I motored back to
Lyons and flew home to London. I think that is all."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" the <i>juge</i> permitted himself to be sarcastic.
He opened a slip of paper that Rondeau had handed him. It was
from Cambier, who was sitting in an adjoining room with Miss
Young and the doctor's daughter. The latter identified the voice
which had been thought to be Tibbitts's, the voice which she had
heard during her stay in the garden talking in a very heated
argument with Sir Anthony as that now speaking to the
<i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>Vivian Young, on her part, was equally certain that it was not
the voice of the young man in the long robe, the young man who
had called her Jane, and who was now believed to be Eastby.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> destroyed the little note and turned again to
Mr. Maitland.</p>

<p>He wanted to know if there had been any disagreement between
Mr. Maitland and Sir Anthony. Maitland said that, unfortunately,
there had been a distinct difference. About methods only.</p>

<p>"And are you still unable to explain the mention of the word
'tufa'?" the <i>juge</i> put in blandly, but at a venture.</p>

<p>Maitland seemed to make an even longer pause than usual before
replying:</p>

<p>"I fancy that must have referred to the possibility of some of
the regions we intended to explore first of all being in a tufa
belt. I was keen on not wasting our time, the time of the
expedition, which was going to be an immensely costly affair, on
baser metals. Tufa, as we rather loosely called it&mdash;I am no
geologist nor yet a diamond expert&mdash;referred to those
volcanic pipes in which diamonds are often found."</p>

<p>"And the question about 'money?' And the word 'thief'?"
pressed the <i>juge</i>.</p>

<p>Maitland looked at him as though he considered him very dull
witted.</p>

<p>"Obviously the 'money' referred to the sums necessary to fit
out the expedition. 'Thief,' on the other hand referred to the
losses the combine was suffering."</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> had copious notes taken throughout. He now
asked Mr. Maitland if he himself were a friend of the
Brownlows.</p>

<p>Maitland murmured that he could not claim that honor. Like Sir
Anthony, he had met the couple many years ago in one of our
colonies.</p>

<p>"But not since?"</p>

<p>"Not since," Maitland murmured positively.</p>

<p>The <i>juge</i> held out a lighter. It was a gunmetal and
silver affair. On one corner were the initials "T.M."
intertwined.</p>

<p>"Then how do you account for this?" he asked. "This is
yours."</p>

<p>Cambier's note to the <i>juge</i> had finished with this
suggestion. He now sat watching the scene like a cat licking its
whiskers after creams. The idea was entirely his own. The lighter
had been considered to belong to Tibbitts, and as such had not
been given more than a passing glance, but the commissaire had
noticed that if one read the monogram as T.M.&mdash;instead of
M.T., as had been done&mdash;they were the same as those inside
Mr. Maitland's hat now hanging on the hall-stand.</p>

<p>Maitland went pale. At last a shot had got home. He turned the
little case over in his hand. Would he deny it?</p>

<p>"It is mine," he said finally and carelessly; "I must have
left it in the cedar room."</p>

<p>"It was not found in there."</p>

<p>"Probably some one picked it up, used it, and left it
somewhere else," Maitland still spoke casually.</p>

<p>"The maid found it on the mantelshelf after Mrs. Brownlow and
you had been talking in a small, little-used room off the
billiard room," the <i>juge</i> said quietly.</p>

<p>The maid's story had been that during the dance Mrs. Brownlow
had met her in the passage outside the room in question and asked
her to give a message to Mr. Smith at once. The message had
concerned some music that was to be played next. Mr. Smith was to
talk it over with the conductor. The maid had carried out the
instructions by passing the message on to a footman and had
hurried back. It was the head housemaid who disliked Mrs.
Brownlow. She had an impression, so she had told Cambier, that
madam had only wanted to get her out of the way. She found no one
in the passage or in the rooms opening out of it, but the little
room next the billiard room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.
Not the kind that Mrs. Brownlow smoked, but a much stronger kind.
And besides that, the maid was positive that some one had just
burned some papers; the smell was unmistakable, so she claimed.
On the mantelshelf she had found the case, which she had handed
Cambier, and which had then been held to be marked with the
initials of Mathew Tibbitts. Questioned afresh, the maid had said
that the passage way smelt of the same cigarette smoke as she
detected in the room. It ended in a door. And Maitland just now,
in speaking of the door by which he had left the house, had
referred to it.</p>

<p>"Just so," Maitland now said equably; "just what I suggested.
Some one evidently picked it up after my talk with Cross and
finally left it in some other room, where it was found later
on."</p>

<p>"But this errand on which the maid was sent, monsieur, this
message about the music to be played was before eleven, so the
conductor can prove. And Sir Anthony Cross did not go to the
cedar room to write, and eventually post, some letters until an
hour later. In other words, monsieur, your lighter was found in
the one room before it could, according to your story, have been
left in the other room. The room in which two men were afterwards
found murdered."</p>

<p>The <i>juge's</i> voice was stern.</p>

<p>And then began one of those scenes of cleverly-put questions,
and thundered denunciations, and subtle traps, of which the
French <i>juges d'instruction</i> are pastmasters. It is a
terrible thing to which to listen, when the mind of a man is
driven from corner to corner, when its defenses and barricades
are pulled away one by one, when you can almost hear the blows
rain down on it.</p>

<p>None of those listening but was moved, the Frenchmen, like
bloodhounds on the trail, almost leaping from their seats with
every point well driven home, the two men from Britain with set
jaws.</p>

<p>But, as Mackay told himself, though it was the third degree of
the United States, there was here no possibility of physical
brutality added. And, horrible though it might be to hear, there
was, therefore, no need for the innocent to dread it. No cross-fire of questions, no cleverly-hidden traps can confuse the truth
or the truth-teller.</p>

<p>But Maitland was confused. Though he maintained that there was
a mistake, that he and Mrs. Brownlow had not met the night of the
dance. In the end, he took his stand in silence, and with set
lips refused to answer any more questions. Finally a paper was
handed the <i>juge</i>. A wireless reply to a wireless
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Tell me why," thundered the <i>juge</i>; "why did you resign
from the English Law Society the morning after the murder of Sir
Anthony and Mr. Brownlow? I have here an information that you, by
your own letter of that date, no longer belong to that honored
body of respected men."</p>

<p>This time Maitland spoke.</p>

<p>"Because of the enterprise on which Sir Anthony and I were
about to embark&mdash;the Mongolian expedition, about some of
whose preparations and itinerary we had quarreled, if one can
call a somewhat acrimonious discussion a quarrel. I considered
that the legality of certain of the steps contemplated were
questionable and, therefore, as I did not wish to give up my
association with the enterprise, I resigned from the Law
Society."</p>

<p>"Because he threatened to denounce you if you did not!" the
<i>juge</i> said harshly, and Mr. Maitland left the room for
another on a floor above, with an <i>agent</i> beside him and two
gendarmes bringing up the rear. Though not actually arrested, he
was to be detained while further inquiries could be made. The
<i>juge</i> made no secret of the fact that unless these brought
some new facts to light&mdash;facts that should prove Maitland's
innocence&mdash;he intended to send him up for trial, accused of
the murder of both men. It was for Cambier to find out the
motives.</p>

<p>Pointer did not think that the case against him would break
down easily.</p>

<p>"His resignation from the Law Society will be made the most
of. This mysterious expedition will be made the most of. He's in
a tight place," Pointer said finally, as he and Mackay walked
back to their hotel together. "Unlike Tibbitts there will be no
escape for him. That sort of thing doesn't happen twice." There
was a silence.</p>

<p>"You don't think it was Maitland, do you?" Mackay asked. "I
don't. There's nae logic in sic a thought. He's in trouble,
probably owing to some affair wi' Mrs. Brownlow, an auld admirer
verra likely; the wumman seems to hae an extraordinary influence
over men. That's the why I wadna meet her mair than I could help.
But you don't think it was Maitland, do you?" Pointer refused to
give an opinion.</p>

<p>"It's not my case. I haven't worked it up. It's like judging a
man from what you might read of the trial in a newspaper. Half
the facts which would guide you to a decision are not given, and
the other half are badly stated."</p>

<p>"But the clues so far?" Mackay wondered.</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as a clue. It all depends on who finds
it. To use the jargon of the day, it's the detective's reactions
to what he finds that turns things into clues."</p>

<p>"Aye, that's what Miss Young canna seem to get intae her head.
It's no use asking me what I think o' this or that. This case
doesna worrk oot according' to reason. I just wait for the next
think frae the bran pie to come to hand." He said as much to
Vivian herself when she met him later on.</p>

<p>Vivian forbore to make any comment on his helplessness. At
last she knew what it was to be helpless herself.</p>

<p>"They think the noo that it was Maitland wha helped Tibbitts
to escape," Mackay said after a long pause. "That they twa are in
collusion."</p>

<p>"My, Mr. Mackay, where will this tangle end!" she asked.</p>

<p>His expression was hopeless.</p>

<p>"I dinna ken. It seems to gang on for ever and a'."</p>

<p>"Here's this son of Mrs. Eastby, and now here's this friend of
Sir Anthony's..." she mused.</p>

<p>"Yon professor at the villa was richt," Mackay said suddenly.
"Aye. Ane violence brings anither. And it in its turn anither.
And so on in rings."</p>

<p>"You've always maintained that Tibbitts was innocent. How
about this newcomer? Doesn't your second sight tell you about
him?"</p>

<p>Mackay looked hurt.</p>

<p>"I micht ha'e known that you'd but laugh at me," he said
reproachfully. "Na, Miss Young, the gift comes and gangs awa'.
But my reasoning powers tell me that nae motive sufficient has
been foond to account for Mr. Maitland, wealthy and respected,
killing Sir Anthony. He had too much to lose. And not eno' to
gain."</p>

<p>"And what about Mrs. Eastby?"</p>

<p>"Are you back again at her?" Mackay asked wearily.</p>

<p>"Why did she look so desperate that night before the dance?"
Vivian said, in the tone of a woman who meant to know some day.
"Nothing she's said explains her face outside the villa.
Anthony's refusing to invest her money? Shucks! That's too silly
to be mentioned&mdash;to me, who saw that look in her eyes."</p>

<p>"Hoo's Mrs. Brownlow?" he asked after a pause.</p>

<p>"She's still delirious. Say, Mr. Mackay, I'm coming down with
brain fever next!"</p>

<p>There followed another silence full of thought. Vivian broke
it.</p>

<p>"You know that umbrella of mine that got mixed?" she asked
somewhat incoherently. Mackay said that he recollected the
incident. "Well, this morning I was driven to have another look
at the museum, and there sat this same man I spoke of, drawing a
piece of cast-iron work, and drawing it real well too. But he
pressed too hard on his pencil and broke the lead, then he
sharpened it to a needle's point, and then he dropped it and
broke the point again and&mdash;my!"</p>

<p>"Ye shudna have stayed within earshot!" said Mackay
virtuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was prepared for some swear words&mdash;I should have
used a few myself! But it wasn't what he said, it was the
<i>voice</i>, Mr. Mackay. It was Tibbitts's voice!"</p>

<p>Mackay's jaw actually dropped.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;why he's a Swedish art critic they told
me at the hotel!"</p>

<p>"No, na, Miss Young. There's naething so misleading as a voice
or even a likeness. Remember hoo you thocht that Mr.
Lascelles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, my braw laddie," Vivian said tartly; "would a
Swedish art critic say 'Now I've broken the bloody point
again'?"</p>

<p>Mackay could not maintain that he would.</p>

<p>"You heard those actual words?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I shall never be the same again," she said, nodding her
head.</p>

<p>Mackay stood as though rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said swiftly, "you've often told me that my
chance was in this case. Well, it's come!"</p>

<p>"It's been banging you on the head for days," she said
huffily.</p>

<p>"Na, na; I mean the money. Mr. Davidson's thousand that I want
to get back. Now, then, Miss Young, ye havna spoken o' this
recognition, if one cud ca' it that?"</p>

<p>"You can. Even by the light of reason," she said shortly, then
she softened at the worried, anxious look on his freckled face.
"No, I haven't spoken of it to any one but you. You're the most
trying young man I ever met, but if I have at last wound you up
to go, thanks be!"</p>

<p>"Then not a worrd. I ha'e a plan. Ooch aye! But leave it tae
me. And not a hint to any one mind, or it fails."</p>

<p>Mackay was really on the jump. Vivian promised absolute
silence, and handed him over Tibbitts, the Swedish art critic,
for his sole and only use. Though she had her doubts as to what
the outcome would be.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">CAMBIER dropped in for a chat with the chief
inspector. Mackay happened to be out. When he returned, Pointer
passed on to him the gist of the talk.</p>

<p>"He's hunting around for something to link the three men
together, Sir Anthony, Brownlow, and Maitland. Tibbitts is
considered to be merely Maitland's tool. Cambier, or rather the
magistrate, thinks they will find the tie between the three men
in some diamond-tufa proposition, that that was the business in
which Brownlow was helping Sir Anthony, and the reason for which
Maitland murdered both men. As to the key found in the garden,
they think it's the key of a safe containing papers bearing on
the proposition which Maitland took from Brownlow's dead body and
then lost as he rushed away to his car. The safe is probably in
London, they think. Maitland, according to what the police are
going to try to prove, came back to the villa unseen, at dawn, to
hunt for the key, and then had to give up. They think he has been
in hiding nearby all along. As you know, they are certain that it
was he who helped Tibbitts to escape&mdash;probably because the
key was lost."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Mackay peered with knitted brows.</p>

<p>"The idea is that Tibbitts was to make him another as the
price of rescue."</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Finally Mackay said:</p>

<p>"Of a' the preplaixing affairs. Ratiocination seems nae help
at a'."</p>

<p>"The French may not be far out in the idea that there is a
link between the three men," Pointer said after a pause, during
which they sat smoking their pipes.</p>

<p>"You mean the diamond proposition?"</p>

<p>"I mean Touva." Pointer gave a short laugh. "I shouldn't be
surprised if that was the real word that Mrs. Eastby heard."</p>

<p>"Is that the way tufa should be pronounced?" Mackay asked a
little shyly.</p>

<p>"Touva is not anything geological. It's the name of one of the
new Soviet States lying between Siberia, I mean Soviet Russia,
and Mongolia."</p>

<p>"Weel?"</p>

<p>"It's chief town is called Krasny," Pointer murmured, puffing
away.</p>

<p>"What for no? I confess geography was the lesson I aye scamped
at school. But we ken that Sir Anthony was interested in a
Mongolian expedition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so, and Mr. Brownlow is, or rather was, at the time of
his death interested in Krasny, and it seems that young Jackson,
the lad of whom Brownlow was supposed to have been jealous in
Shanghai ten years ago, had been exploring the other side of the
Gobi Desert. The new republic of Tannow Touva lies the other side
of the desert too."</p>

<p>Mackay was all attention now.</p>

<p>"You've been making inquiries?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Strictly and only between ourselves," Pointer confessed,
"though should they ask me, all I know is at the service of the
men working on the case, of course&mdash;I have so far
overstepped my official position as observer as to make a few
inquiries about that murdered lad. For murdered I think he was.
It seems as near proven as a thing not actually witnessed could
be. Had any motive, other than jealousy, been found, nothing
could have saved Brownlow from the gallows."</p>

<p>"But what's yon auld affair to do wi' Sir Anthony's murder?"
Mackay spoke in the tone of a man who had no room for spare
cargo.</p>

<p>"Cambier is hunting for a chain between the three men," the
chief inspector explained. "I think its end is young Jackson. For
Sir Anthony is the man who was briefed to defend Brownlow in the
trial that never came off! He was attached to the British Supreme
Court for China at Shanghai for a couple of years, as we learned
in <i>Who's Who</i>."</p>

<p>"Losh!" muttered Mackay; "but surely they wadna, I mean
Brownlow wadna, ha'e shot Anthony Cross because he had tried to
get him off in an auld trial?" Mackay spoke in bewildered tones.
"He <i>did</i> want to get him off, didn't he? If he was his
counsel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think so. I'm told that Sir Anthony, like Abraham
Lincoln, would never take on a case in which he didn't feel sure
of his client's innocence. That really was one of the reasons why
Brownlow was not absolutely done for, socially. A great many
people argued that if Anthony Cross, who was as straight as he
was brilliant, believed in him, Brownlow could only have acted
hastily, not criminally."</p>

<p>"But the wife&mdash;" Mackay dropped his voice. "The widow, as
she is the noo, talked to us as though she had nae
doots&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she hadn't," Pointer said a little dryly. "And also,
just then, you were throwing so much doubt&mdash;justified
doubt&mdash;on the idea of a duel having been fought over her,
that she wanted to convince you of Brownlow's passionate
nature."</p>

<p>"But hoo do you link up Mr. Maitland wi' a' this?" Mackay
asked after another silence full of thought.</p>

<p>"Thomas Maitland was the consulate solicitor at that time. I
shouldn't wonder if that was where he and Sir Anthony met. He
seems to've been offered the post of solicitor to the Diamond
Combine by the latter when he left to join the board of that big
affair."</p>

<p>"Consulate solicitor&mdash;then he, too, wad ha'e been for the
Brownlows&mdash;" murmured Mackay.</p>

<p>"Very much for them, I gathered, especially for Mrs.
Brownlow."</p>

<p>"And a' this means?" pursued Mackay.</p>

<p>"That's to find out," Pointer said equably. He had a guess or
two as to what would be found, but only guesses as yet. "Cambier
and Rondeau are good hunting dogs. Once they strike the
Touva&mdash;not tufa&mdash;trail, we shall have some quick
developments; and Maitland will be past praying for. Cambier told
me just now that they believed that Maitland aimed at Sir Anthony
first as the latter entered the room, and then got him with the
second bullet. He would know where Sir Anthony kept his revolver,
and, so they think, had frightened Mrs. Brownlow into telling him
where Brownlow kept his."</p>

<p>"And the revolver we did find by the body they think was put
there by Mrs. Brownlow," Mackay went on, half to himself.</p>

<p>"Quite so," Pointer agreed; "according to him, the
<i>juge</i>, too, thinks that Maitland terrorized Mrs. Brownlow.
Either that, or that he was in some way an apparent friend to Sir
Anthony, and, therefore, accepted by her as a friend of her
husband's too. They're doubtful of the means he used, but they
seem certain that it was under pressure exerted by Maitland
during that preliminary interview with her that Mrs. Brownlow
supported next morning the idea of a duel. Or, rather, helped to
create it. They think, as I say, that she had been told to put
that revolver down as soon as the room was opened. Their notion
now is that Maitland wanted to be sure there were no fingerprints
on the one found, and that it should only show one bullet
fired.</p>

<p>"Rondeau has routed out a leather case of Brownlows, which
shows that he had a brace of automatics, duplicates of each
other, probably. They are too usual a make to be able to trace
easily."</p>

<p>"And what do they think happened to the revolver that Brownlow
used?" Mackay asked.</p>

<p>"They're going to look for it. It won't be difficult to find,
probably."</p>

<p>"Think not?" Mackay wrinkled his forehead.</p>

<p>"I know where <i>I</i> should drop a revolver under those
circumstances, supposing I wanted to drop it anywhere," Pointer
said briskly.</p>

<p>"Ye mean&mdash;in the Grosne?" Mackay asked; and nodding at
Pointer's assent, they went off to watch the work of salvage.</p>

<p>From the cornfields around came the yellow-hammer's notes,
without which August would not know itself in the country. Down
by the river the little sedge warblers were silent at last, their
long season of song over. One missed their cheery chatter, heard
on so many a summer's day, that it seems to belong by right to
the murmur of every stream, like the splash of fish or the plop
of voles.</p>

<p>In the trees around the ring-doves kept up their throaty notes
of full content. The drone of insects sounded an undertone to the
harvest noises. A peacock butterfly dipped and floated among the
knapweeds. It, too, belonged to that sound.</p>

<p>Disturbed by the dozen from the nut-brown ears of wheat, its
plainer cousins, the meadow browns, and whites, and blues, and
coppers floated past, making the most of their short summers.
That fair-weather sailor, the Red Admiral, was a splendid sight
as, wings fluttering open and shut, he swung on a teasel.</p>

<p>Hardly lighter than they, thistledown was everywhere, and the
tiny silk shuttlecocks of the rose bays. You could even catch the
quick firing of the yellow gorse, as the pods cracked in the hot
sun. Among the not yet cut oats, shimmering in silver-green as
the air stirred them, danced gatekeeper butterflies, and tall as
the oats themselves showed the blue-mauve heads of scabious in
its prime. Black as their own shadows were most of the trees,
except for the tufting green on the oaks ends, but the leaves of
willows and poplars and ash, tossing over in the breeze, rippled
among the dark green like wave crests at sea. Beauty was
everywhere&mdash;the beauty of the country-side, in the full tide
of summer. Only the warm, delicious scent of stocks from cottage
gardens that spice the air of every English harvest scene was
absent&mdash;as were the cottage gardens.</p>

<p>They found Rondeau directing his men in waders and armed with
a net. The Grosne is swift, and its deepest pool well known.
After half an hour's work a revolver was fished up, to the great
surprise of a fat and stately old trout who lived there.</p>

<p>The weapon was the mate to that found beside Brownlow, but two
shots had been fired from this, and it bore the mark of a
silencer.</p>

<p>Rondeau hurried off well content. Mackay looked frowningly
after him.</p>

<p>"We're just dancing dervishes, that's what we a' are," he said
disgustedly; "just turning roond and roond oorseles wi' the
murder in the cedar room in the center." He looked at his watch.
Maitland was to be questioned anew within a few minutes, and the
two men hurried away.</p>

<p>Rondeau had collected a good deal of fresh information in tiny
bits. But like that wonderful Chinese enameling that is done on
crushed egg shells, each little dot of information was added
skilfully to another dot, until a pattern was formed. And the
pattern, as composed by Cambier, showed that Maitland had
certainly left the villa by the side door as he had said. But
much earlier in the evening. The men thought that Mrs. Brownlow
had let him out. After that he had not been seen until much later
on; a dancer had noticed him step out of a cedar room window.
Some one had shut the window after him and rolled down the steel
shutter. Who, the dancer had not noticed, for inside the room the
long curtains were drawn. Nor could he be sure of the time,
except that it was past the wassail drinking. He thought some
long time past, but as the <i>juge</i> extracted from him that he
was waiting for a girl&mdash;his girl&mdash;to arrive with her
people, it was highly probable that, like the poet, he had
counted time "by heart-throbs not by figures on a dial." Of the
fact, however, he was quite sure. He added details of the man's
general appearance that confirmed those of other witnesses. He
thought he saw the man in question toss something into the bushes
as he passed out the gate. A cigarette stub he had fancied then.
The police thought differently now. They thought the little key.
Though why he had flung it away still eluded them.</p>

<p>Maitland refused to answer yea or nay, press him how they
might. As for Mrs. Brownlow, she was still babbling of her
husband, apparently back in some English home. Maitland was once
returned to his rooms, and the French police worked on.</p>

<p>Vivian meanwhile had gone into Lyons. She seemed to be free
from surveillance for the time being. Knowing that foreigners
must show their passports to register at any hotel of repute
overnight, and having given notice of the names of all the
inmates of the villa at the frontier as "not to be allowed
through," the French police were concentrating on Mr. Maitland's
past and present. She was puzzling over the problem, which still
was as impenetrable as ever to her eyes. And she could see as far
into a brick wall as the next, she told herself. As to
Mackay&mdash;well, the boy sure had bad luck to have this sort of
a case drop on his head. But she was convinced that he would do
his best, and perhaps win through after all with Davidson's
commission.</p>

<p>She herself was trying to divert her mind by some necessary
shopping. What Vivian thought of the average French shops had
better be left unsaid.</p>

<p>A man joggled her arm, and half-spun her round with his heavy
package, and standing so for a second, she found herself looking
down a corner street, along which two people were passing just
now. One was Mrs. Eastby, and the other&mdash;it was Mr.
Murgatroyd. Vivian started. He sure was right about her being on
the spot when things happened. She followed close on their heels.
What they said she could not catch, but evidently it was not of a
harmonious nature. Each of them, according to her scrutiny, was
as mad as they could be. Finally Mrs. Eastby stopped so suddenly
that Vivian only just had time to spin towards a shop window, but
neither of the two were noticing her.</p>

<p>"I utterly refuse!" Mrs. Eastby was saying, firmly and yet
with some suppressed emotion that made her voice tremble. "I
utterly refuse."</p>

<p>Mr. Murgatroyd came closer and said something quietly and very
low. It was not a short sentence. It looked like a threat. As it
continued, Mrs. Eastby's defiance seemed to wither. She made some
reply that Vivian could not catch, but which, judging by its
tone, was grudgingly submissive, and again they walked on, this
time only for a moment. Again they paused.</p>

<p>"I'd better not be seen," Vivian heard the man say, and then,
murmuring some quick low words of farewell, he lifted his hat and
turned away. She did not dare to follow Mrs. Eastby too closely
now that the latter was alone, and in the end she lost her
altogether.</p>

<p>Vivian herself went home by train deep in fruitless
thought&mdash;thought of Mr. Murgatroyd, evidently able to meet
Mrs. Eastby when he chose; thought of what little she had seen
and heard of their meeting, and, most of all, thought of Tibbitts
sharpening a pencil in the museum. What in the world had brought
him back into such appalling danger? Who was the man with him?
Mackay had refused to discuss his plans, but Vivian knew that he
was hard at work. Would he succeed? He was not on hand on her
return.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, and after some very dull games of
patience that refused to come out, she went up to bed. But she
could not sleep. Finally she got up again and decided that an
hour's writing might quiet her mind. She was sending in an
account of the Hotel de ville's most obvious treasures to a paper
which always took any article of hers. After a few minutes'
writing she stopped.</p>

<p>She was working with a brochure beside her to help her as to
historical facts, and she had come on a word that she did not
understand. She could not find it in her pocket dictionary. But
downstairs was a big one. She slipped down to the library,
wearing her soft bedroom slippers. The dictionary was not there.
Then she remembered that it was now kept in the cedar room on the
mantelshelf. She half-turned away. Then common sense came to her
aid. After all, the daughter of a Texas ranger was not going to
be frightened of entering a room because a tragedy, even a double
tragedy, had happened there. She stepped quickly down the
passage. As she came up to the door of the room at the end, she
heard the sounds of some movement inside.</p>

<p>Who was in the library at this hour of night? By the clock she
could see that it was close on twelve. She stood listening. Again
she heard something stir inside, and this time made out a very
light step and the soft sound of a chair or table shifted on a
thick rug. She felt for the door-knob and turned it noiselessly.
But the door was locked.</p>

<p>She could not get out through the front door without a noise.
The same was true of hoisting one of the steel window shutters
from any of the windows around. Yet whoever was inside must have
got in from the outside, for, barring the servants, there was
only herself and Mrs. Brownlow in the house. Suddenly she
remembered that Smith's room had an outside balcony and
staircase.</p>

<p>She crept up to his room, found the key in the lock, opened
it, passed through the bedroom and let herself out by the door on
to his balcony. To her surprise she found all the doors unlocked
and the bolt on the balcony door unshot. So that some one in the
library downstairs could have got in this way, supposing they
knew of it. Tibbitts for one would know of it. So, of course,
would any one probably who had stayed in the house. Should she
wake the butler? He and the two footmen were stalwart fellows,
and they slept on the floor above her own. But Vivian was an
intrepid soul. She determined to find out for herself who was
inside the villa tonight. She slipped down the outside stairs and
turned towards the cedar room wing. All the windows were
shuttered. She climbed the wooden stairs to Smith's room again.
Entering, she locked the door behind her and put the key in her
pocket Then, for the first time, she looked about her in both
bedroom and sitting-room. Here, too, the shutters were down, all
the furniture was sheeted and covered, but on a chair lay a man's
soft felt hat. Inside it was still warm to the touch. It was the
kind of hat that nine men out of ten were wearing just now. Mr.
Murgatroyd had been wearing one like it, she thought. She tucked
it under her arm and laid it in a drawer in her room, locking the
drawer. Vivian intended to disarrange as many of the plans of the
person or persons in the house as possible.</p>

<p>In her room, too, she paused long enough to put on a black
traveling coat, wind a scarf of thin silky stuff, also black,
around her head and face, and finally draw on a pair of black
gloves. That swiftly done, and with nothing light about her to
catch the eye, she slipped down the stairs. Listening with her
ear against the library hinges she heard the stealthy movements
continue for some time longer. Then came the click of the lights
turned out, and she flattened herself back into the shadow of a
cabinet.</p>

<p>Cautiously the door opened, slowly the figure that had been in
the room seemed to ooze out through it. It passed her and made
for the stairs. It was a woman. Vivian crept up the stairs too.
The figure turned down a passage leading in the direction of Mrs.
Brownlow's room. Vivian slipped after her. She knew that Mrs.
Brownlow had only one nurse now. And she, a sister from a convent
nearby, slept in the sitting-room opening out of her patient's
room, where she could be summoned at once or would hear any call
or cry from the patient; but the latter's condition, though
obstinate, was not getting worse, the doctor thought. It was
simply a case of time and absolute quiet. That meant, Vivian
thought, that Mrs. Brownlow might be practically defenseless in
her room. When she heard the door of her bedroom very cautiously
opened and closed, she was close beside it, her ear against the
panels. Faint stirrings reached her, fainter even than in the
library. Then came, to her boundless surprise, the creak of a
wooden bedstead and the rustle of sheets. Vivian was peering
through the keyhole by this time. It showed her, by a faint
night-light, the bed which was in a line with it. There was some
one sitting up in bed, pulling the bedclothes straight. A second
later Vivian caught sight of her face in the light. It was Mrs.
Brownlow, but a Mrs. Brownlow with a most intelligent eye cocked
in the direction of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Evidently she too had caught a hint of stirring, but fancied
it came from the sister there. A moment later she lay down
noiselessly and Vivian could hear the deep sound of her
breathing. A sound as of heavy sleep. Vivian stole away. So Mrs.
Brownlow was not ill. Mrs. Brownlow was hunting for something in
the library downstairs. For what? For what else, Vivian told
herself, than for clues to her husband's murder. But why the
deception by day? She had no time to waste in vain cogitation,
however. Mrs. Brownlow might have been in the library, but she
certainly had not entered by Mr. Smith's balcony, nor worn that
felt hat now locked in Vivian's room. She slipped downstairs
again, and stood by the newel post, listening intently. She
thought she detected a creak here, a rustle there, that did not
belong to the house. She herself made no sound. She hardly
breathed as she put all her will power into increasing her sense
of hearing. She did not close her eyes because, with Vivian,
sight had often helped hearing. It did so now. For as she stood
tense, something moved in the long corridor with its many
shuttered windows on one side, its doors on the other, its tables
and chests and chairs between, set flat against the wall.</p>

<p>Something or some one moved swiftly towards her. It was a man.
She could not see his face, though that was a dim gray in the
darkness. The electric battery of her torch had given out long
ago, and could not be replaced in France, she had found, If she
were to switch on the light, she would show herself. She waited,
one hand on the post. She was afraid even to draw herself more
compactly together for fear of a rustle. And then a hand was laid
flat on hers. It was a very firm, warm hand. She was too startled
to move now. She heard a low questioning, "Is that you
Lascelles?" and a torch, just such a one as she would have liked
to use, played over her. It struck her that she must look rather
a ghastly figure in that house of death, with her black gown, and
black gloves, and black veil twisted over her face so that it
should not show as a face. Apparently she did, for she heard a
stifled ejaculation, and some one passed her, taking the stairs
three at a time in great, lithe bounds. Vivian slipped after him,
but at a cautious distance. So cautious a one that she had to
stand irresolute on the first landing, listening intently again.
It was Smith. She was sure of that. Her blood was up&mdash;the
blood of a first-class reporter, a getter of news unsurpassed in
her own town. She stepped quickly, but without making a sound, to
his room and gently felt for the door. It was standing open. At
that she did draw back. That open door stopped her far more
effectually than a barred one would have done. To what did it
invite? It cost her an effort to enter. Listening again, if
possible harder than ever, she felt sure that the room was empty.
Then where had that figure gone? Mrs. Brownlow's rooms and a
servant's staircase alone lay in the other direction. She turned
now and all but ran towards them. As she ran, a low, suppressed
cry rang out, so filled with almost unbearable fear that Vivian's
very hair crisped. In a second she had leaped to Mrs. Brownlow's
sitting-room and called out, "Sister! Is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>The door opened instantly. A very sleepy-eyed nun looked out,
her finger to her lip.</p>

<p>"Sh-sh! It was only delirium. A bad dream. She is fast
asleep."</p>

<p>Vivian came in. She saw in the farther room a white face on
the pillow; a very, very white face, but the eyes were closed and
she heard again that deep, softly hissing sound of breath drawn
in and given out in profound slumber. The sound that she had
heard a few minutes before while Mrs. Brownlow was sitting up in
bed and eyeing the sitting-room attentively.</p>

<p>Vivian said something apologetic to the nun and left the room.
Mrs. Brownlow's game&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;was not her
business tonight. She wanted to search the villa.</p>

<p>She did. She found no one. But that proved nothing, as she
told herself, with something of Mackay's baffled weariness in her
thoughts. She did not know the cupboards nor the cellars of Villa
Porte Bonheur. Smith and his friend, Lascelles, or his
accomplice, Tibbitts, aye, or even Mr. Murgatroyd, might all be
on the premises.</p>

<p>At long last she went to bed and fell fast asleep, thoroughly
worn out, to find herself continuing in her dreams her article on
the Hotel de ville's treasures. She was searching for the right
words with which to describe Mrs. Brownlow's cry that was shut up
in one of the glass cases along with her own umbrella, when
sounds coming from down the corridor awoke her. The shrill tones
of the head-housemaid, the butler's authoritative, but quiet
voice. Then the steps of a man hurrying to her door, a tap, and
the butler's voice asking:</p>

<p>"Is mademoiselle within? No, do not disturb yourself&mdash;I
only wanted to be sure."</p>

<p>Vivian slipped into something and flung her door open.</p>

<p><br> <br> Pointer was out fishing before breakfast, when he
saw Mackay making towards him. It was then about half-past eight
in the morning.</p>

<p>"Something's happened at the villa. The commissaire won't say
what. But his car's on the road above. I told him we would both
come along."</p>

<p>Pointer unjointed his rod with precision but with speed. He
left his catch to look after themselves under a bush.</p>

<p>"I canna think what's happened the noo," muttered Mackay. "Can
yon?" he asked, wheeling suddenly.</p>

<p>"I can hazard a guess, but whether it's right or
wrong&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A guess? What wad it be? I canna guess onything. But then I
never could."</p>

<p>"That Mrs. Brownlow is missing," Pointer said quietly, as they
hurried off. "I should expect that to be the next step."</p>

<p>Mackay stared at him. "Wow!" he muttered; "ye beat me! I canna
see by what reasoning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wasn't talking of reasoning, but of guessing," was all that
Pointer would say. He was right in his guess, whatever his
grounds for it. Mrs. Brownlow was missing. The nun, on waking
about eight, had found her patient's bedroom in wild
disorder.</p>

<p>Cambier, fiery-eyed this time, was moving quickly about,
darting here and there, rather like a tom-cat with whose
preserves the mice have been taking liberties.</p>

<p>"<i>C'est trop!"</i> he muttered fiercely to Pointer. "Too
much indeed. They mock us, these miscreants. But we shall see.
And they shall see..." His moustache bristled.</p>

<p>"What miscreants?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Those who staged this scene. Bah, it belongs to the theater,
not to the police. Rondeau is always asking himself questions,
but I would like to tell him to look instead at one
thing&mdash;one thing only!"</p>

<p>"And that is, <i>mon chef</i>?" Rondeau demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>Cambier pointed dramatically. "Tossed sheets, twisted
mattress, bolster and pillow on the floor," he recapitulated,
"chair overturned, window curtain half-torn off its hooks,
creepers below the window half-torn down&mdash;bah! Look,
Rondeau! No, do not think! Do not ask yourself anything at all!
Just look! Merely look!"</p>

<p>Rondeau looked. But as always under such conditions did not
see what he was expected to see.</p>

<p>"The stand lamp is overturned," he said slowly; "but the
electric bulb itself is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean you to look at this!" hissed Cambier, waggling the
flex leading from the lamp to the wall-plug. "See this wild
confusion? Yet the wall-plug is still in the <i>prise</i>, and it
comes out at a touch. Could this particular lamp have been
overturned and it be still in the wall? It could not. The stage
was set, Rondeau. Mrs. Brownlow left; she was not taken by force.
It was a wet night. There are no footprints of any outsider in
here..."</p>

<p>"Overshoes, woolen socks..." murmured Rondeau doubtfully.</p>

<p>"...Would leave marks on this rather stickily polished floor.
Look at the tracks we ourselves have made, and we rubbed our feet
well. There was no stranger in this room. There are no finger-prints but those of madam herself, or of the sister nursing her.
Here is one of Mrs. Brownlow's far back in the room on this white
wood which shows a faint mark of soil and green stain as well.
From the creepers that she had just pulled loose. Oh, yes, my
friends, this is all the doing of Madam Brownlow. That poor
madam, who was too ill to be questioned. Who raved&mdash;bah, the
doctor is one of her admirers&mdash;I should have remembered
that. He would be easy to hoodwink&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the nurses, the sister, <i>mon chef</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The sisters? Rondeau do not exasperate me! The intelligence
of a <i>religieuse!</i> I see by the chart here that madam's
temperature was taken twice a day, mornings at eleven and
afternoons around five. I learn from these notes at the side that
she always has a cup of hot bouillon at eleven, and that the tea
things are brought in before five. Well, it explains itself. A
dip of the thermometer into bouillon or tea, and behold a high
temperature. There are other ways of course. A hot-water
bottle&mdash;there is even a way of rubbing it along a
blanket&mdash;<i>enfin</i>, the thing was easy. And this poor
invalid is laughing at us&mdash;at me!" He finished with a snap,
"But have a care, madam!" He apostrophized the air in a way that
made Pointer's face grow firmly wooden, while Mackay leaned far
out of the window. It would not do to grin at the
commissaire.</p>

<p>"We shall see who laughs in the end. Now, then, Rondeau, I
think we are all agreed on noticing that Monsieur Tibbitts is at
liberty. Oh, yes, we are fools compared with madam, but that much
we do notice. Also, we know that at midnight last night a man was
seen walking away from the Villa Porte Bonheur in a most
secretive way, more suitable to a hunter after game than to a man
leaving a friend's house. The hour was just on one in the
morning. And the man was Monsieur Smith, we are nearly sure,
though he got away before my men could close in on him. They gave
him a good chase as it was. Which was what he wanted. Which was
what madam wanted. It had been arranged between the three of
them, her and Smith and Tibbitts, that Smith was to call my men
off from the benevolent guard they were keeping on the villa,
while Tibbitts helped madam to get out of her room by means of a
ladder held for her to descend comfortably, and then drove her
off to some place of safety. Oh, it was all quite simple and
quite easy. But we shall see; Monsieur Smith will see; Tibbitts
will see; Madame Brownlow will in good time see, too! This flight
of her's throws a most lurid light on the tragedy." And with
that, the commissaire transformed himself into a whirlwind engine
and zoomed off amid his men to meet the <i>juge</i>, who had been
hastily summoned to the Hotel de ville.</p>

<p>The magistrate did not agree with the commissaire.</p>

<p>"You think there is nothing of Maitland in all this?" he asked
sceptically. "I do not agree. I think madam escaped, fled if you
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I like!" snorted Cambier.</p>

<p>"In order to avoid having to give her evidence against
Maitland. Which can only mean that she knows it would be damning.
It is quite possible that she slipped away to avoid the last, the
inevitably terrible end of our inquiry&mdash;the accusation, and
in due time the trial and condemnation of Maitland. In my
opinion, Maitland made her some proposal&mdash;to pass on to her
husband. I think he tried to blackmail him, or did blackmail him,
through her, in that interview before he killed the
husband&mdash;and his other victim, Sir Anthony Cross." Something
like that was Cambier's idea. That in the well-born and well-connected Mr. Maitland they had a secret blackmailer battening on
the mistakes of the past.</p>

<p>He said as much now, but nothing would induce him to pardon
that semblance of force which had been staged in the supposedly
sick woman's room upstairs. He said that too. The <i>juge</i>
only pursed his lips and repeated:</p>

<p>"Madam was very timid. She is a woman who needs a man to look
after her. A man of gentle manners, but iron principles." He
shook off some thought and went on briskly, "As to how she
escaped, I am on the whole inclined to think that Monsieur Smith
actually helped her away, not merely assisted by serving as a
decoy for our men. Oh, I do not pretend to have solved this
difficult problem"&mdash;he eyed Cambier a little
maliciously&mdash;"but that is how things look to me for the
present. For the time being, I think we should suspend judgment
on that sorely-tried woman, Madam Brownlow." Cambier left him
with a look, as though he could not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>Mackay said that the <i>juge</i>, on the whole, was right. At
least in thinking that Tibbitts had no share in the
happenings.</p>

<p>"I was watching his hotel all last night," he confided to
Vivian; "and he didna stir. I couldna tell the police that."</p>

<p>"Unless you put it down to second sight," she agreed. "In my
belief, Mrs. Brownlow has gone off to rout out something. I think
she's on some one's track. She was hunting for proofs in the
library last night. I'm sure of that. But I can't get that
suppressed scream of hers that I told you of out of my head. But
for it, I shouldn't be worried. It was an awful little cry, Mr.
Mackay. It haunts me. Suppose she had come on something and has
been spirited away because of that? By some enemy? By whoever
murdered her husband and Sir Anthony?"</p>

<p>"The French think she went off of her own free will," he
reminded her doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Just like them!" was Vivian's compliment. "Say, Mr. Mackay,
there's such a thing as going of your own free will, and yet
absolutely against the grain. You can be terrified into doing
something you would give a great deal not to do. If Mrs. Brownlow
isn't gone for the sake of getting some evidence, then I sure do
feel worried about her. It was Smith's voice that asked me 'Is
that you, Lascelles?' in a queer, strange sort of tone. And
look&mdash;" She held out a hat. "Do have some second sight for
me, too, Mr. Mackay, and tell me who wore this and when?"</p>

<p>"I ha'e surprised people wi' the correctness o' ma
descriptions before noo," he muttered, taking it from her and
holding it tightly pressed against his breast, while he fixed his
eyes straight ahead of him as he said slowly:</p>

<p>"It's nicht. A's dark. I see a big young man. Wi' a face that
says creation did a fine piece of warrk the day it made him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith?" Vivian was half-laughing, half-impressed.</p>

<p>"It's moonlight&mdash;na, na, it's raining, but I see him
dimly slipping to this hoose and climbing the door to the balcony
up yonder."</p>

<p>He handed her back the hat and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Am I richt?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." She told him where and how she had found the
hat.</p>

<p>"It's Smith's," he assured her.</p>

<p>"You're certain?" she asked, a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Aye. I recognized it by a mark on the band when you handed it
to me. He a' but burned a hole in it wi' his cigar when it was on
a chair beside him the evening I watched him and Lascelles on the
grass. The evening you met me."</p>

<p>He hurried off, leaving Vivian as before, half-angry, half-amused.</p>

<p>In about two hours she was called to the telephone. She heard
a man's steps pelting down the basement stairs as she went. Some
policeman was racing for the extension below, she rightly
guessed.</p>

<p>"Vivian&mdash;it's me," came the voice of Mrs. Brownlow. "I'm
quite safe. I went away, just as I pretended to be so ill,
because I couldn't face all the questions. I couldn't bear to be
the one to get people into trouble, and quite the wrong people
probably. I must stop at once; but I couldn't let you worry over
me&mdash;" The voice ceased on that.</p>

<p>Below Vivian heard excited French voices. The <i>agents</i>
did some swift work. They located the call within five minutes.
It came from a <i>patisserie</i> in Lyons. But nothing was known
of who had sent it. Vivian was relieved, and yet&mdash;she could
not forget that strange, low cry that she had heard Mrs. Brownlow
give just after Smith had gone on up the stairs. She went to her
own room, trying to think things out "according to the light of
reason," as Mackay would have said. She had just started a reply
to a most incoherent, excited letter of condolence which she had
received from Edith Montdore demanding, rather than asking, a
full account from the inside of the extraordinary double murder
at the villa, or supposing her dearest Vi could not bear to write
of that, then at least an analysis of Mrs. Brownlow. Edith
Montdore still called her "the vamp." Vivian had twice tried to
begin a letter, and twice given it up. Her own thoughts were too
vague, changing as cloud shapes change. What did she really think
of Mrs. Brownlow?</p>

<p>She got up from the writing-table impatiently. Edith must wait
for a clear summing-up of the widow's character. Wait, perhaps,
for days, perhaps&mdash;as far as Vivian was concerned&mdash;for
ever, and she again tore up the sheet of paper on which she had
begun to write.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">BY next day the French police were on the track
of Maitland's connection with both Brownlow and Sir Anthony Cross
in Shanghai. An association in a non-proven murder suspicion. The
<i>juge</i> made the most of it. And Cambier promised to make
more when fuller information was to hand.</p>

<p>Maitland did not break his silence. No taunt, no cajolery, got
a word out of him.</p>

<p>"The typical blackmailer of the <i>haute monde</i>," Cambier
thought, and so thought the <i>juge</i>. That idea explained so
much, fitted so many of the cogs and promised to fit all with a
little patience.</p>

<p>At noon the chief inspector sat smoking his pipe in his
sitting-room and thinking over the case, as far as it had gone,
when the door opened and, without any announcement, Mrs. Eastby
stepped in. She was staying at the same hotel, watched more or
less carefully, chiefly less nowadays. For suspicion had shifted
entirely away from her and her son.</p>

<p>She closed the door now very carefully behind her. Then she
came up to the chief inspector. She was very pale. Even her lips
were white. She had certainly gone through some ageing process
here in Cluny.</p>

<p>"I've come to make a confession," she spoke almost in the
voice of the confessional.</p>

<p>Pointer stopped her at once.</p>

<p>"I'd much rather you didn't." He spoke gravely but very
kindly. "You're turning to me because I'm a man of your own
country, and you're among strangers. But I can't let you forget
that I'm a detective officer, though I am only acting as an
observer in this case. Why not speak to Mr. Mackay?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Murgatroyd would only let me tell my story to
you&mdash;or he intends to come forward and tell all that he
knows to the <i>juge</i>. He's forcing me to speak." Her face
worked. But she had herself in hand. "You are to make use of it
if you must." Her pale face seemed to whiten still more. "Will
you kindly let Mr. Murgatroyd know that I have really spoken to
you, as I promised him yesterday."</p>

<p>"How can I communicate with him?" Pointer asked. "He says that
you worked on a case some months ago that took you to Paris, that
you saved a young English diplomat there. Mr. Murgatroyd says
that if you will wire to this young man 'Deposit received,' he
will get it almost at once and understand it as meaning that I
have spoken. Oh, he didn't trust me!" She set her lips in a way
that suggested that Mr. Murgatroyd was not entirely wrong in his
doubts of her willingness to speak out unless she were given no
alternative.</p>

<p>For a moment she and the Scotland Yard man sat in silence. He
was looking at his shoes, she staring straight ahead of her.</p>

<p>"It had nothing to do with the murder of Anthony Cross," she
began fiercely; "except, perhaps, that I had handed him that
accursed money." Her voice faltered. "But Mr. Murgatroyd suspects
my son&mdash;oh, he does! It's incredible, but he doesn't feel
sure that somehow...And because I had to say what I did against
this Mr. Maitland, he is forcing me to&mdash;to tell you the
whole story." The fire in her voice died down, smothered by some
other feeling. She sat for some moments without speaking, and
when she began again it was in a quiet, weary tone.</p>

<p>"As I think every one who knew us at the time guessed, Sir
Anthony and I loved each other very dearly&mdash;long ago," she
said finally. "Long, long ago. I was never in love with the man I
married. Though I thought I was at the time. After he had an
accident to his head, I fell ill myself. It was while I was
getting well that I met Anthony Cross." There was a long pause.
"I didn't run away with him," she went on dreamily, "because of
Reggie. Even as a child he was so straight. But I very nearly
did. Very, very nearly. And I think Sir Anthony never forgave me,
and never forgave Reggie. You see, I had let him make all his
arrangements, and then at the last moment, when I stepped into
Reggie's room to say good-bye to him asleep, I couldn't
go&mdash;he was only ten&mdash;" There followed a long pause.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you this because it alone explains why Sir
Anthony never did justice to Reggie's abilities or character. He
didn't want to give him a post really, but I&mdash;well, I
reminded him of what we had once felt for each other...Oh, this
was years later, after Reggie had just scraped through his pass.
He gave him a post, and a good one, but in some way he grudged
him every little success." Again there was a pause. "And now,
chief inspector," Mrs. Eastby went on in a very faint voice,
"comes the dreadful part. I&mdash;I&mdash;we were very hard up
this last year," came in a rush, as though to get the telling
over. "Harder up than usual. Living has gone up frightfully in
South Africa too. And I'm not a very good manager. There were the
heavy expenses for my husband's removal from one nursing home and
settling him in another&mdash;and Reggie needed a holiday badly.
And one evening one of the men from the combine's counting-house
where Reggie worked talked to me a lot about how little red-tape
there was in their house. He said he often wondered money wasn't
taken by some of the smaller employees, and pretended to think
that it would never be missed if it were taken. Or small stones
either. Oh, he chattered a lot about it all." She spoke wearily.
"I believed it, though I didn't know that I particularly
listened. But two days later I went to fetch Reggie for a tennis
party to which we were going together. I was shown into a
waiting-room in quite a different part of the building. After a
while, I got tired of waiting, and strolled off to find his room.
The names were put up on cards by the doors. There was one room
that had no name on it, and I opened it, really to ask how
Reggie's room could be reached. As I said, I was in a wing that I
didn't know. The room was empty, but on the table were some
packets of one-pound notes. There were three packets in all."
Again she paused, then came a low, "I took them. Almost before I
meant to do it it was done, and I was out of the room and down
the corridor and out of the building. There were dozens of people
coming and going. I felt sure that no one could ever
know&mdash;ever guess even. Besides, what Mr. Barclay had said
about how careless they were in checking-up came back to me. I
thought I was quite safe." There came another pause but not so
long. "Chief inspector, it was Reggie's own room! He had moved
into a newer, larger room, and I think&mdash;<i>I
think</i>&mdash;that the money was put there as a test. At any
rate, he seemed to know nothing of it when he told me that night
about his new quarters. I was horrified. And terrified. But next
day came a note saying that he was to take his month's leave at
once. Reggie was delighted. He thought it meant a promise of the
post in London, of which he told me for the first time. I&mdash;I
went with him, telling myself that all was all right&mdash;that
no one would ever know. I spent some of the money on the
trip.</p>

<p>"We went to Paris on our way to Switzerland. It was there that
a letter came for him in Sir Anthony's writing. I was down at the
breakfast table first. I wasn't sleeping well those day...It was
only about four lines long, and was to say that Reginald was to
bring the three hundred pounds that he had taken to Sir Anthony
immediately at his hotel in Paris and send in his resignation. If
he failed to do both at once, the combine would prosecute." Again
there was one of those poignant pauses that marked her story.</p>

<p>"I went instead, and&mdash;Sir Anthony refused to believe my
story. The true story. He thought I was shielding Reginald.
He&mdash;oh, he had quite got over any feeling he once may have
had for me." She pulled herself up. "No, that isn't fair. He did
love me once, as I had loved him. But that love, passionate and
headstrong, had passed with our youth. He didn't love me now, and
so I hadn't even that weapon. I had rather counted on it. I could
do nothing with him. For if our love had gone, his
jealousy&mdash;I think it really was a sort of unacknowledged
jealousy&mdash;of Reggie had not gone. It seemed stronger than
ever. Well"&mdash;Mrs. Eastby spread out her hands in a wide,
weary gesture&mdash;"it's true, but very terrible, that you can
do wrong in one moment of madness, and not put it right in weeks
and weeks of agony and remorse. I followed him to Enghien, and
again had an interview with him. I forced it on him. All I could
do was to get him to put off the date when the money was to be
paid back till the end of this month, when there was to be a big
board meeting in London. He still absolutely refused to believe
me. I&mdash;I think he didn't want to."</p>

<p>Her voice shook. "I had been the romance of his youth. It was
too horrible that it should end in&mdash;in the truth." Her voice
was but a whisper now.</p>

<p>Pointer, his head resting on one hand, traced symbols on the
blotting-pad with his pipe stem. He did not look up once, but his
face was very kind.</p>

<p>"Fortunately my son had met a charming American girl, and he
and she were quite content to stay at Enghien for the remainder
of their lives. Or at least they thought so. The girl's father
had a talk with me. He's rather a big man over in the United
States. He wanted to see Sir Anthony about Reginald. I&mdash;I
prevented that by saying that it would spoil Reggie's chances of
getting that much-coveted post in London, to which he was sure to
be appointed if nothing was done. He believed me, and let the
affair between the two children continue on the understanding
that if Reggie really got the post, he would have no objection to
a marriage.</p>

<p>"I followed Sir Anthony down here. I made up my mind that if
the worst came to the worst I would tell my story before Reggie
too. I knew that in face of his horror and incredulity even Sir
Anthony would have known that I was telling nothing but the
truth. I tried over and over again to make him see it, but the
night of the dance I was desperate. Time was all but out. All
but! Sir Anthony would not extend it. He had told me so very
sharply the night before when I spoke to him outside the house.
So I got Reginald to come to the dance by saying that Jane would
be there&mdash;as I've told already. And at the dance Sir Anthony
refused me more curtly than ever. I practically was mad after
that. I&mdash;I made up my mind to end everything. I wasn't going
to tell Reggie. I couldn't lose all that was left me&mdash;his
love. I couldn't live on after that. I felt that if I did make
away with myself, Sir Anthony would know that I had not been
shielding any one. I couldn't stand the dancing; I groped my way
somehow to the upper first landing where I meant to wait until I
saw Reggie come out and then tell him to take me away. I thought
of throwing myself out of our hotel window&mdash;my room was on
the fourth floor&mdash;but I ran into Mr. Murgatroyd, who was
watching the dancers. He made some laughing remark to me.</p>

<p>"As I say I was mad. That people could dance when I was in
such utter torment seemed to snap something inside my head. I
don't know what I answered. I don't recollect clearly what
happened. He must have taken me down into the writing-room. I
must have told him the whole story. I had only a little over two
hundred pounds out of the three hundred left." She flinched at
the avowal anew. "And the bank wouldn't help me out. I don't know
what I said to Mr. Murgatroyd. I only know that I was on my knees
and crying as I've never cried in my life before. He
was"&mdash;her face worked for a second, but she had great self-control; in a second she went on&mdash;"very wonderful. He told
me not to despair, that he would make the sum up, and at once, to
the three hundred, and that he would see Sir Anthony there and
then and force him&mdash;force him to take my word for what had
happened. I didn't believe him. I mean that he could do anything
with Sir Anthony when I couldn't. And nothing else mattered. He
hurried away and very nearly ran into Miss Young in the hall
outside. Then, after she had gone on, and Mr. Murgatroyd had
rushed off to his rooms, came my boy, still thinking that she was
Jane. I only just got to the door of the cedar room in time to
prevent him going in. He thought she had gone on in. I got him
away by telling him, as I had told him before, that I had a big
bet on the fact that no one should recognize him. You see, I had
been terrified of his going up to Sir Anthony and of his learning
everything from him. I think he thought it was some relation or
friend of Jane's in the room. Luckily for me, oh, most luckily
for me, he is where he won't look at newspapers for weeks. He
really is in Bulgaria&mdash;or at least"&mdash;she shot a half-frightened glance towards the chief inspector&mdash;"at least
very near there&mdash;in Serbia. And when I said Cyprus, I got it
mixed with Sardinia."</p>

<p>Pointer made no comment on the geographical confusion that
seemed to prevail in the lady's mind, and she hurried on with her
story.</p>

<p>"Mr. Murgatroyd came back with the necessary money in notes to
bring up the sum to the three hundred needed, then he went into
the cedar room, and I heard voices, his very fierce at first.
But, chief inspector, he succeeded! By some miracle, where I had
failed, he succeeded! He rushed back for me and got a receipt
made out. I didn't care about it then, but he thought it most
important. He thought that if some accident happened to Sir
Anthony, it might be all I should have to prove that I had given
the money back, and that it had been taken back. Here is the
receipt. I couldn't show it unless I was prepared to tell the
story."</p>

<p>Pointer glanced through the paper she held out. It was in Sir
Anthony Cross's writing. It said that Mrs. Eastby had by mistake
taken three hundred pounds which she thought belonged to her son
from the latter's room in the office of the combine in
Johannesburg. That as soon as she had found out the mistake, she
had at once endeavored to return it to Sir Anthony, and that the
latter had now accepted it, together with her explanation, which
completely satisfied him, and was restoring it to the combine on
his return. That there was no question whatever of Mrs. Eastby's
good faith in the matter, and the letter added that Reginald
Eastby, neither at the time of the mistake nor of its return and
acceptance by Sir Anthony, knew anything of the money.</p>

<p>This was the paper that Murgatroyd and Smith had signed.</p>

<p>"After everything was over, I sat on&mdash;alone&mdash;in the
writing-room, getting myself in hand again. It seemed too good to
be true. That was when I heard the voices in the next room
arguing about tufa. And then I went back to the dancers, met my
son, who had found out that Jane wasn't there, and was furious
with me, and rushed off. He thought it was some kind of silly
joke between Jane and me to find out whether he could mistake
another girl for her or not. I had to tell him something. But I
didn't care what he thought, as long as I now knew that it would
never be the truth. Or at least, I thought so then. Though that
Miss Young rather worried me. She's desperately sharp. However, I
thought I was safely beyond the reach of harm that night at
supper." She sighed. Her face lost its momentary look of
vivacity. She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"I can't let even you keep that paper," she said a little
tremulously; "but if need be, I can produce it. But I only lend
you my story. Only if it must be told. Only if absolutely
necessary," she repeated imploringly. She went on to say that
when Sir Anthony was killed, and the money seemed to be lost, she
was desperate again. Again Mr. Murgatroyd had come to her help,
for before he left for Cluny in his hurried flight from questions
whose answers he was afraid might drag in her story, he had sent
her his address and told her that if there was any trouble, she
was to let him know, as he would not be able to get hold of a
newspaper easily.</p>

<p>At first she thought that she might have to appeal to him
again, but she had seen Mr. Heimbrot and shown him the
receipt&mdash;a wave of scarlet flooded her worn face. Mr.
Heimbrot pretended to believe it absolutely, and he had got the
French authorities to hand him over the notes found on Tibbitts.
He hadn't ventured to cash one before he was taken.</p>

<p>"Mr. Heimbrot cabled the money back to Jo'burg, and told me
that he would guarantee that everything would be all right. He,
of course, must have guessed," she whispered, torn by the anguish
of a proud nature conscious of guilt. "But I think he was sorry
for me."</p>

<p>Again came one of the pauses that marked the tragic story.</p>

<p>"But thanks to him I was able to tell Mr. Murgatroyd that his
help had not been in vain. As I was back here in Cluny, so near
to him, I wrote him, and we met in Lyons. Unfortunately, I told
him how the inquiry was going on, and that I was sure Mr.
Maitland was guilty. So is every one. But Mr. Murgatroyd actually
fears lest in some way my son is implicated in a terrible way.
Like so many good people, he evidently isn't at all clever."</p>

<p>Pointer reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>"I think I had better see Mr. Murgatroyd," he said finally,
"and hear from him about his interview with Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"He is staying with the Brothers of St. Peter Lateran outside
Lyons. It's a sort of training school for Roman Catholic
missionaries. He's great friends with the prior apparently. They
never read the papers there, and besides, his name is quite a
usual one." She got up and for a second stood in the shadow.
"Thank you for listening so patiently," she said, with something
very gentle and sweet in her face, something that gave a glimpse
of the girl that once had captured Anthony Cross's by no means
susceptible heart; "but I beg of you to remember that my
confession is only for use in the last resort."</p>

<p>Pointer promised her. He did not think&mdash;now&mdash;that it
would be needed. He expected a very quick wind-up to the Cluny
problem.</p>

<p>As there seemed to him nothing of any interest going on for
the moment, he motored over to Lyons at once, changed into a
tram, and then took a taxi to the big, bare building on the hill.
Mr. Murgatroyd was in, and came down into the parlor at once.</p>

<p>He confirmed Mrs. Eastby's story as far as the night of the
dance went. As to his part in it, he was as brief as he could
well be.</p>

<p>"It was an awful thing to see her despair that night," he said
gravely; "I've never seen anything so poignant. You see, she
thought that she had ruined her son's career, and as well as
broken to pieces his ideal of her. When she told me that Sir
Anthony refused to let her speak to him any more on the subject,
well"&mdash;he gave a faint smile&mdash;"I really think I saw
red. That one fellow mortal should refuse to let another fellow
mortal make restitution when restitution was possible."
Murgatroyd smacked his open palm on the table between them, again
stirred by the mere thought. His eyes flashed as they must have
done the night that he talked to the distracted woman.</p>

<p>"I went into that cedar room as a man goes to a fight. But no
sooner had I closed the door behind me than that feeling went.
Have you ever felt confident before you did a thing that you
could do it? I knew, as I stood there, that I should succeed. I
did. And seeing what was to happen to him, I wonder now if both
of us had an inner knowledge hidden from our conscious selves. My
appeal was based simply on what would be his fate&mdash;my
fate&mdash;the fate of any one of us&mdash;if our God were to
deal with us at our death in steely justice. I think Mrs.
Eastby's appeals to him were really working in him, though she
thought that she had failed. Or else that wisdom of which I
spoke&mdash;at any rate, he met me more than half-way. He
admitted that he had been too harsh, that every man needs mercy
shown him. He would show it to the boy. Let him make restitution
and he should have another chance.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't do either. I told him her story as I had heard
it&mdash;though only haltingly and not nearly so well or so
pitifully. But his ears were opened. Not by me. By some power
greater than either of us. He said that he had not understood,
that he would like to speak to Mrs. Eastby again for a moment. He
did, and then he drafted the receipt, read it over to me, and I
got Smith to sign as my co-witness."</p>

<p>Pointer returned to Cluny and there had a brief talk with
Heimbrot at the station, for that good man was leaving. The
combine's business did not delay for such a trifle as the murder
of a director.</p>

<p>"Easiest thing in the world to have happened," Heimbrot said
earnestly as they walked up and down beside the train. "Of
course, Mrs. Eastby thought it was her son's advance pay, seeing
that she felt sure that he was as good as appointed to the post
in London. We know what ladies are in money matters. I've told
her that it's quite clear, and that her mistake can be put right
in the office without any one knowing anything about it. Between
ourselves, chief inspector, it was Sir Anthony's idea of testing
the honesty of the staff out there. He was a bit inclined to
suspect Eastby&mdash;however, that's all over now. Mrs. Eastby
thinks Sir Anthony's where he knows everything. Maybe. Pity he
can't pass some information down to us. Such as who's helping
themselves to those diamonds <i>en route</i> to
Amsterdam&mdash;let alone who shot him and Brownlow, and why."
With that the talk ended.</p>

<p>That night in Villa Porte Bonheur, a man with a cap pulled low
over his eyes worked fast and well in the cedar room at a safe
hidden in the wall. Another man was keeping watch outside the
door. The shutters were down. No light showed. It was no wonder
that the safe had not been discovered by the police, for the
movable panel that concealed it was well made, sliding up into
grooves in the fretted paneling which were in no wise different
from other grooves around. The safe in Monsieur Pichegru's study
had been searched by the police, but the man working at this was
no policeman. It was Tibbitts. Across his face was a black mask,
but his hands and long, powerful arms were unmistakable.</p>

<p>French safes cannot touch English or American ones, but even
so, he was two hours at the job, and worked with the sweat
standing in beads on his forehead. Oxyacetylene blowpipes are hot
things. At last he laid down his tools and spat on his burning
palms. "Done! And well done!" he muttered approvingly.</p>

<p>Nearly ten minutes ago, at his back, the outside steel shutter
of one of the windows had been softly rising, an inch, then a
foot. The window was open, to give the workman inside all
possible ventilation. An <i>agent</i> had wormed his way through
it into the room with infinite precautions. Getting to his feet
now, he drew his baton and stepped on tiptoe towards the safe-breaker.</p>

<p>The club was actually lifting, when the door of the room was
flung wide, and a man with a jet black face and hands sprang
across the room in a lithe leap, and landed almost on the
<i>agent's</i> back. There was a sense of distance and a
sufficiency of movement in that leap that in itself would have
told of a first-class boxer. If there had been any doubt, the
punishing right hook as the policeman span around would have
dispelled it. The club merely tapped Tibbitts and then dropped to
the floor. The policeman's whistle went in a wide curve into a
distant corner.</p>

<p>Now, as it happened, the <i>agent</i> was an admirer and
imitator of Carpentier too. One of the best in the region. He
avoided the well-meant punch and got in a long range thrust to
the stomach that should have ended matters. But somehow it seemed
to miss the desired effect. The black man got in a really
brilliant left and right instead.</p>

<p>The policeman settled down to work. The man facing him was
only about half his size. <i>Peste!</i> He went all out for a
knock-down blow, but it was not to be had for the asking. Some of
his efforts got home splendidly, yet in weight and substance he
took more than he gave. And the funny thing was, that the blows
which he received turned him black, just as those which he landed
turned the black man fawn color or scarlet.</p>

<p>The <i>agent</i> was bursting with rage. His fury was almost
comic. He was faster than the smaller man, but the other was as
cool as a cucumber; his eyes, what could be seen of them, were
steady and confident. At last he got in a blow that ended it as
far as the <i>agent</i> was concerned.</p>

<p>It was only a few moments later that there came a shout from
somewhere in the garden, and Chief Inspector Pointer was peering
into the room. Two gendarmes ran to his call. The <i>agent</i>
was attended to, the house was searched, but there was no sign of
whoever it was that had so mauled the man on duty. The police
stared at the safe door confronting them.</p>

<p>"A secret safe! And here! And Simon knocked about! This is a
house of mysteries!"</p>

<p>The commissaire hurried in, followed by Rondeau. He, too,
opened his eyes at the sight of the metal oblong in its wall of
red-brown paneling.</p>

<p>But first of all he bent over the <i>agent</i>, who was now
sitting up and groggily feeling his head.</p>

<p>"There were two men," he reported. "One opened the safe. I
knocked him down when he got the door open. I waited till then.
The other&mdash;he was a man painted black&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Painted black!" repeated Rondeau with great gusto.
<i>"Saints!"</i></p>

<p>"He and I fought&mdash;I don't know what has become of him or
his mate. It was good boxing, though," the man muttered, "and
fair hitting. The English school."</p>

<p>"Has that Smith been taking a hand again?" snorted
Cambier.</p>

<p>"It was Tibbitts at the safe," the <i>agent</i> said; "he
moved his mask to wipe his face once. Besides I knew
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But naturally. The <i>portrait parlé</i>!" Cambier nodded.
"Pity he got away," Cambier repeated regretfully, "but it was
lucky that you, monsieur, were on the spot, since Simon had had
his whistle snatched from him."</p>

<p>"There is one spot in the road where you can see the light
from under the shutters reflected on the holly clump," the chief
inspector reminded them. "I was just there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was very fortunate, and now&mdash;" Cambier swung the safe
door open with the air of a man not expecting much except
disappointment.</p>

<p>There came a gasp from his men, an exclamation from Rondeau,
and a start from himself.</p>

<p>A heap of glittering stones lay on the floor of the little
safe, sparkling and blinking. A pocket-book of dark green morocco
lay to one side. On top of all lay an envelope with something
written on it.</p>

<p>"Your arrival evidently prevented the thieves looting the
safe," Cambier said joyfully to the chief inspector; "but this is
most fortunate! And surely these are the jewels of Madam Brownlow
so often described to us. Yes, these certainly look like them,
including that necklace of black pearls she valued so highly. And
here are her sapphires! And this&mdash;" he opened the pocket-book and looked at its contents&mdash;"this is the pocket-book of
Monsieur Davidson with the missing bearer bonds intact. All of
them."</p>

<p>Only now did Cambier pick up&mdash;officially&mdash;the most
interesting article in the safe. And that was the letter lying on
top of all.</p>

<p>"A letter for Madam Brownlow&mdash;in Monsieur Brownlow's
handwriting," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>There were no comments this time. Every eye had been fixed on
that square of paper for the past minutes.</p>

<p>Cambier slowly opened it with great neatness. He read aloud
the date. It was the date of the dance. In a still deeper hush if
possible he read on:</p>

<br>

<div class="letter" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">

<p>"My Dear Wife,&mdash;This will be a very long letter, and if
it is incoherent in parts, put it down to hurry. For the game is
up. I killed Peter Jackson in Shanghai, and not from jealousy,
but because he had found a platinum field, and duly taken out his
claim for some two hundred acres. He spoke to me of lumps of
platinum the size of pigeons' eggs covering the ground, and an
assayist in Shanghai gave a list of other valuable minerals, such
as osmium and iridium, which were present in the ore samples.
There was a huge fortune in the discovery. For one man. I drowned
Jackson, and ran down the assayist who analyzed his samples. But
their deaths brought me no good. All the region where Jackson's
find lies has been going through revolution after revolution,
both at the time that he was there and ever since. I have not
been able to get hold of any record of claims put in until just
lately.</p>

<p>"The republic of Tanou Touva&mdash;Krasny is its chief
town&mdash;has only now issued an edict, or whatever it should be
called, stating that all land and mineral claims duly recorded
since the fall of the monarchy, and paid for at the time, are to
be considered as valid. And now, when at last there is peace
around Krasny, where Jackson's claim is entered, and I could get
up a private expedition to work it, if a coup of mine which I'm
planning in Lyons came off with Tibbitts's help&mdash;Anthony
Cross has somehow got on to the truth. He intends to see me
swing, he says. I learned from him that Maitland was bringing him
some papers dealing with that old Jackson affair, but that
Maitland has just told him that, after a talk with you, he had
burned the lot. Cross was furious. But I think Maitland could not
bear to break your heart. He was in love with you years ago in
Shanghai. I've often wondered if you were aware of that. You
think Anthony Cross is, but there you're wrong, my dear. He
intends to let you think it for a while. But it's me&mdash;not
you&mdash;he's after. I made a bad break this evening in
answering one of his questions. His suspicions had been entirely
allayed, after his long talk with you yesterday evening, until I
made that unfortunate slip.</p>

<p>"Well, he has rushed the truth out of me by putting this and
that together and giving me no time to think over my answers.
Having just been told by him that Maitland had destroyed all the
papers, I shot Cross, hoping that his death would settle the
matter. Now I see by entries in his notebook that he's done me.
He's posted some letters which will set wheels a-rolling that
will crush me.</p>

<p>"I shall put my papers in order, and then, after arranging the
room to look as though a duel&mdash;not a suicide&mdash;had taken
place in it, I shall shoot myself. I have also seen to it that
Tibbitts will not be able to blackmail you, should he want to. As
I thought it safest to send in my claim at Krasny to Jackson's
land in his, Tibbitts's name, it will be as well to have a hold
over him. For he is a crook, picked up by me at Monte Carlo
because of his skill in opening safes. Never mind how I knew of
that skill. I had intended to arrange for some blunder on his
part in the Lyons affair which would make him perfectly safe ever
afterwards, but this will do as well for you. Which is why I am
writing the whole truth here so badly."</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>"For you!" repeated Rondeau. "Ah, he little thought for whom
he was writing these details."</p>

<p>"Madam shall see the letter," Cambier said promptly; "but
certainly she shall!" He read on:</p>

<p>"And I have arranged matters so that Tibbitts thinks it was he
who killed Anthony Cross. For which reason he is now putting as
many miles as possible between here and himself. I had intended
to shoot Anthony Cross with his own revolver, so as to have his
death look a suicide, as I have just written, but Tibbitts was
too drunk to be able to open Cross's bag tonight. As things
stand, it is just as well that I had to give up that intended
artistic touch. As soon as Cross was dead I went upstairs to
Tibbitts, woke him up, and told him that Cross had got on the
track of our little exploit on the rapide the other week. For it
was a put-up job. Incidentally, you will find the jewelery and
the bonds of Davidson intact with this. I was waiting for another
month or so before using either. For we are on the rocks, my
dear, and have been so for some time past. I told Tibbitts, when
I got him awake, that Cross was writing a letter which would mean
prison for him. That he was to go into the cedar room, flourish a
revolver, and demand the giving up of the letter, and get a
promise from Cross that he would hold his tongue for tonight. I
assured Tibbitts that Cross would give way if he acted exactly as
I told him.</p>

<p>"Tibbitts is a gullible fool. I chose him chiefly for that
when I picked him up at Monte. I intended using him for a plan of
mine in Lyons, which would have meant wealth for all of us when I
had brought it off. However, he did as I told him, took the
revolver which I handed him and assured him was unloaded, and let
me shove him ahead of me into the cedar room. He tripped on
entering, and as I grabbed at him, his revolver went off. I saw
to that. And also that it was fitted with a silencer before I
used it the first time.</p>

<p>"Anthony Cross was sitting with his back to us at a writing-table. He was dead, of course, and of course I fired, not at him,
but back over my shoulder when I touched Tibbitts. The shot went
out through the still open door and buried itself in a leaden
plate outside. I changed that plate afterwards to another
position. And what Tibbitts tripped over was a line which I had
tied from Cross's arm to the cabinet by the door. Cross's body
toppled over as the pistol went off. I rushed up to it, cutting
the line, and called out 'My God, you've killed him! He's dead!'
That finished Tibbitts. He babbled about it being an accident and
so on, but I stuffed some notes that were in front of Cross into
his pockets, and told him to beat it in my super-sports to Autun,
where I would telephone him what to do. Should there be no
telephone message waiting for him there, then he was to make for
Paris and hide. It would mean that the police were after him in
spite of all that I could do.</p>

<p>"He knows Paris all right. As I say, I don't think you'll ever
see or hear from him again. He was so appalled that he forgot to
ask about his share of the contents of the secret safe which I
had discovered by chance one wet day while playing fives in the
cedar room, and to which he finally fitted me a key. I shall
leave the key and a slip of paper telling you to get this letter
in your room in some secret place."</p> </div>

<br>

<p>Here came a gap. Then the lines of the odd, precise, and yet
irregular writing went on:</p>

<br>

<div class="letter" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">

<p>"I have just taken Cross's keys, had a dance with some one so
as not to be missed too long, gone upstairs, got his revolver
from his bag, and fitted it with a silencer. I shall put his keys
back in his pocket, and when everything is ready, lay beside me
the revolver that I shot him with, and use his. On myself. No one
will ever guess the truth. It will be taken for granted that his
pistol skidded towards me in some jerk he made when dying."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>On the line below came in a sudden, thickened scrawl the
words:</p>

<br>

<div class="letter" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">

<p>"That fool Tibbitts has taken my revolver off with him."</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>Here came another gap. And then, irregularly below this:</p>

<br>

<div class="letter" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">

<p>"My head feels as though it were going. I've got blood all
over my hands when I put Cross's keys back, and probably on my
clothes as well. I've wiped them and burned the handkerchief, but
even so, I daren't risk going up the stairs to our rooms again to
get the mate to the automatic that fool has taken away with him.
But there is that vanity-case of yours you told me to put
somewhere for you a little while ago, as it didn't go with the
blue of your dress as well as you thought. I told you that I had
hung it on the same hook as your Burbery in the cloakroom. You
will be pretty sure to get it before going upstairs, or to use it
some time during the night. At least I hope so. It's after all
for your sake I'm taking all this trouble. I can reach the
cloakroom unseen, with any luck. I'll chance it, and put in your
case a slip with directions as to what you are to do directly the
alarm is given. Be sure and do exactly as I say. Get my other
revolver from my case, watch your chance and slip it beside me
when you come into the room, and remember that I had just learned
that you were about to run away with Cross. I charge you on the
slip that I shall write, and I charge you again, to carry out my
wishes to the letter.</p>

<p>"Fortunately one cartridge was fired from the automatic that
you will find in the case. And it, too, has a silencer. Should
things go wrong you must show this. I am making it clear on
purpose. I leave it in the safe, of which I have made certain
that Pichegru has no idea, and shall drop the key with the slip
in your bag. On the back will be a diagram showing you how to
locate the safe. I am going to lock this up at once, then write a
couple of business letters to London and post them&mdash;I can
chance the darkness of the garden's outer paths, and then I shall
put the slip in your bag, and come back and end it all."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>There followed some words of leave-taking, but according to
the letter, he had already said his real farewell to his wife on
the slip of paper which he had placed where she would probably
find it before learning of his death and Anthony Cross's
murder.</p>

<p>There was a pause of complete stupefaction when the last word
was read. Then came a babble of comment.</p>

<p>"It was he who lost the key then!" Rondeau finally said, "when
he went out to post his letters after locking this safely up. But
he must have been distracted! And I ask myself what madam thought
when she read that there was a letter for her in a mysterious
locked safe, and could not open it. He would be sure to say in
the slip, which she evidently found when she went for her
smelling-salts, how all important this document was.
<i>Sapristi</i>, what a position for the poor woman!"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, and Monsieur Smith told us how he had to insist that
madam should not move her husband&mdash;she would be looking for
the key, as well as placing the revolver," the sergeant
thought.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Young asked herself," Rondeau agreed, "how it
was that she did not see that revolver. So did the <i>juge</i>!
We now know that it was not there when she first came into the
room."</p>

<p>Again the talk became mixed. Piece by piece the story was
tested and passed.</p>

<p>"So that is the truth of the Cluny problem!" Cambier said
finally, scrutinizing the letter through a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>"I think there is no doubt as to the genuineness of this
letter. And&mdash;yes, I agree, it explains everything.
Yes&mdash;everything. Well, well, I was afraid we were getting
too much embroidery into it! A simple case after all. A sequel to
an old scandal in China. Mixed up with other problems that do not
concern us, but which were very perplexing. You agree with me, I
know, <i>monsieur l'inspecteur en chef</i>. So the private
investigator is right! Brownlow was the only criminal, though the
reason for the crime will surprise Monsieur Mackay. And here is
his client's money. Untouched. But we were on the track of
Brownlow. But decidedly!"</p>

<p>"There is one thing," Rondeau was helping his <i>chef</i> put
seals on the safe; "it was not Smith who boxed with Simon here.
There is no reference to Smith throughout these papers."</p>

<p>"Nor who helped Tibbitts to escape," finished Cambier. "Some
confederate of Tibbitts evidently. As to Tibbitts
himself&mdash;well, it would have been a very difficult matter to
bring any share in the crime home to him after Monsieur
Maitland's arrival. So Maitland burned the papers, for Mrs.
Brownlow's sake, that would have helped Sir Cross to convict her
husband on that old affair in China! And refused to speak
out&mdash;especially when he thought she was ill with
inflammation of the brain...He looks like a man of feeling. And
to think that she knew all along that her husband was guilty. And
did her best to deceive us."</p>

<p>"Did deceive us," Rondeau said with a youthful grin. "I do not
think that the <i>juge</i>, for one, will find it in his heart to
be hard on her."</p>

<p>Cambier's gesture recalled the younger man to official
decorum. Pointer now took his leave for a short time, and the
police dispersed. Rondeau and his chief stayed behind to make a
few final notes for the magistrate.</p>

<p>"I ask myself if the <i>inspecteur en chef</i> will not have
learned a great deal from our methods," Rondeau said, putting a
sheet before the other to sign.</p>

<p>"It is that that distinguishes our work in
France&mdash;method," Cambier agreed. He began to sign.
"Finished! The Cluny problem," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Finished," Rondeau frowned down at the papers. "Though I
still ask myself how it was that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ta-ta-ta!" Cambier had his pen between his teeth and was
blotting furiously. "We must hurry or the <i>juge</i> will hear
the story before he has our facts. Come, hurry, <i>mon cher!</i>
No dreaming how complicated the story would have been had you
written it! Let this case be an example to you. Even I was
prepared to twist and tangle what we now know was quite a simple
case. Truth is always simple!" And with that the two hurried
off.</p>

<p>Mackay was busy in Lyons delving into some of Brownlow's and
Tibbitts's activities&mdash;activities which now assumed a very
sinister look. He refused to be called off until he had pretty
well proven that the business could not be genuine, that there
was no "backer," such as Brownlow had spoken of, behind him. But
though he would not leave the town when he heard that the letter
found in the safe was accepted as authentic, and that, therefore,
the case was over, the problem was solved, and the money of
Davidson was untouched, he asked Vivian Young to meet him on her
way to Italy, where she was going next, and the two had a long
talk. One that lasted, with intermissions, all the way to the
American church in that dull but respectable old town.</p>

<p>"You won't mind the uncertainties ahead of us?" he asked
finally, for he was selling his business, such as it was, and
intended to start a new life elsewhere&mdash;with her.</p>

<p>"That's life. Uncertainty, and never knowing what's around the
corners," she finished, with her eyes shining.</p>

<p>Mackay looked at her delightedly. This was a helpmate such as
he wanted and needed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER flew from Lyons to London, where some
really important matters were waiting for him. His leg was quite
well now, and he was eager to be a worker again, not an observer
merely. On his arrival, he had a long talk with the assistant
commissioner, who, after the usual warm greetings, for he and
Pointer were good friends, showed him a bulky pile of papers on a
table near by.</p>

<p>"The digest of the Cluny problem. Fairly complete." The
assistant commissioner moved over to them. "I know how impatient
you are to be at work, and you can be as brief as you like in
your replies. But there are just a few questions I want to put.
I've jotted them down in what seems to me the order of their
importance, and if we keep to that we shall soon be done. First
of all"&mdash;he seated himself and pushed his tobacco jar across
the table&mdash;"have you any idea how Anthony Cross got on the
track that possibly young Jackson's valuable mineral claim might
have been the real reason for his murder in Shanghai ten years
ago? How could he learn of the existence of such a claim in the
first place?"</p>

<p>"Very simply, I think, sir. Peter Jackson had a Chinese 'boy'
called Cheng," Pointer was lighting up, "so they 'beamed' me from
Shanghai. He was his employer's friend as well as servant. This
Cheng had a relative Cheng, who had a remote connection
Cheng&mdash;you know how these Tongs still run as one
family&mdash;who regularly traded into the Soviet States of
Central Asia."</p>

<p>"Of which this new republic of Touva is one." Major Pelham had
looked up the place on a modern map.</p>

<p>"The 'boy' Cheng and Peter Jackson's younger brother between
them tried to make out a case against Brownlow at the time, and,
as we know, had to give it up. It was Sir Anthony Cross himself,
by the way, who wrote to the Jackson family that they had nothing
to go on. I fancy&mdash;or rather I feel sure&mdash;that the
long-distance Cheng ran his eye over the list of claim-holders as
soon as they became available, which was some four months ago
now, at Krasny. He notified Jackson's Cheng, who was in touch, or
got into touch with the dead man's younger brother, that he had
found&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course! The name of Jackson on the list! And that younger
brother to whom he wrote would find it quite easy to keep track
of Sir Anthony Cross's whereabouts and career," Pelham
finished&mdash;he was jotting down a line as he spoke. "I know
there was a mother and a sister as well as this brother living at
the time in Canada."</p>

<p>"The mother died of what was practically starvation the next
winter," Pointer said slowly. "And the sister, who was
consumptive at the time, followed her not long after. When
Brownlow murdered Peter Jackson, he indirectly murdered the two
women as well."</p>

<p>The assistant commissioner made a sound indicative of
pity.</p>

<p>"So this brother writes to Cross," he went on, "and Sir
Anthony goes down alone to Cluny, making his fiancée think that
his visit had to do with the thefts of diamonds from his
combine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think she jumped to that conclusion," Pointer struck in.
"His words, as she told me them, might have equally applied to
the Brownlow-Jackson affair. I think Sir Anthony only wanted to
make sure that he would not have to introduce the Brownlows to
her&mdash;in case they could not clear themselves."</p>

<p>"I see. Very likely indeed. At any rate, he went down to clear
the matter up by a talk with the accused on the spot. Talk lasts
a long time that first evening." The assistant commissioner had
the tale at his fingers' ends. "Cross is not
satisfied&mdash;that's how I read the lines, or between
them&mdash;and wires for Maitland and the old papers. Maitland
got there a little earlier than was expected, found all the doors
open, walked in, met Mrs. Brownlow, who throws herself on his
mercy. She gets him to burn the papers he has brought and to
leave the villa without seeing Sir Anthony. Maitland yields to
her begging, but once away his brain clears. He decided to return
and tell Anthony Cross what he has done, and at once resign from
the Law Society. He comes back. Has the stormy interview, bits of
which were overheard. You think, too, don't you, that the 'thief'
and the 'money' and the 'tufa' all referred to Brownlow?" Pointer
did.</p>

<p>"Maitland leaves after that. When he is dragged into the
affair, he cannot tell the truth because of Mrs. Brownlow. She
probably told him that she was innocent, but her husband guilty,
and that she cannot prove her own innocence. Eh?"</p>

<p>"Probably," Pointer thought.</p>

<p>"Now, why did Anthony Cross leave the hotel and put up at the
villa for the remainder of the night of the dance?" Major Pelham
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"To avoid Mrs. Eastby, I think," Pointer suggested. "I fancy
that Mrs. Brownlow had very nearly satisfied him that there was
no question of deliberate murder, of murder for gain, during her
talk the early part of the night of the dance."</p>

<p>"And then Brownlow himself blundered in some reply, as he
writes in that long letter of his, and Anthony Cross pounces on
him. And the remainder of what happened&mdash;is it not written
in the Third Book of Kings?" Major Pelham shot a not entirely
appreciative glance at the mass of papers before him.</p>

<p>"Knowing how small a margin he had, Brownlow had laid quite a
neat plan&mdash;for a 'suicide' of Anthony Cross should the worst
come to the worst. How did he know that Cross had a revolver, by
the way?" he asked next.</p>

<p>"The day before the dance, Mrs. Brownlow telephoned to him
asking him to join them at the villa in a revolver-shooting
contest; she added that some one could lend him a weapon if
necessary&mdash;or a silencer if he had not one with him. Sir
Anthony said that he would come if he had time, and added that he
had an automatic fitted with a silencer with him and some
cartridges. He didn't go to the villa, as a matter of fact."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brownlow telephoned&mdash;" Major Pelham shot his under
lip forward a moment, but he went on with the papers. "There's
only one thing more, I think. What became of the whatever it was
that Cross had in his second bag, the one he himself packed? Do
you think they were business papers, which he posted himself late
that night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I think Brownlow took them&mdash;after he had
murdered Cross? And probably posted them to himself in town."</p>

<p>"I see." Major Pelham rose from that particular table. "Thanks
for clearing up all the vague points. By the way, the letter in
the safe gave a fairly accurate idea of things, don't you think?
As a rule, last letters are very one-sided, but the French police
seem to think this was an accurate and careful account of what
happened. Do you agree with them?"</p>

<p>"I think it was a careful account and fitted every point most
neatly," Pointer said with a smile.</p>

<p>"And written by Brownlow, of course?" Pelham asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"Written by the man who shot Brownlow," Pointer corrected
quietly.</p>

<p>"Shot Brownlow?" the assistant commissioner wheeled on him.
"What on earth do you mean, Pointer? Didn't Brownlow shoot
himself? What on earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mackay shot Brownlow, sir. Mackay Jackson, the younger
brother of the murdered Peter Jackson."</p>

<p>"Mackay? You mean&mdash;you don't mean the man who was
investigating Davidson's lost money at Cluny?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why the devil didn't you tell me so before?"</p>

<p>"But I was to answer your questions as you put them, sir, in
the order of their importance," Pointer said politely.</p>

<p>Major Pelham burst out laughing. "Scored off me there. And you
had this up your sleeve all the time? Come now, the story. The
story that isn't written in, eh, the Third Book of Kings." And
Pelham pushed the whole table away and wheeled up an arm-chair
for himself.</p>

<p>"The tale runs like this, sir," Pointer began swiftly; "when
his brother Peter was killed, Mackay Jackson had no money and no
influence. He was just a poor little Canadian boy. But he never
wavered in his certainty that his brother had been murdered by
Brownlow and for something quite different from jealousy. He
argued, rather shrewdly for a lad of sixteen, that his brother's
murder would not remain Brownlow's only crime. He entered
Pinkerton's and worked well. He was not considered brilliant, but
absolutely fearless, and a quite remarkable shot. When he had
sufficient experience, and had saved up some money, he got a
chance to buy up a Scottish inquiry agency in Aberdeen. His only
relative, his mother's sister, married a Mackay. Which accounts
for his name probably, and the weird Scottish that he
spoke&mdash;a bit of everything from Glasgow to Aberdeen. Yes,
sir, Mackay shot Brownlow dead after the latter had killed Sir
Anthony, and had fired full at him himself and missed. The shot
that went into the pewter plate was meant for his head&mdash;and
has had the deuce of a time saving suspects ever since," Pointer
broke into a reminiscent chuckle. "It was all quite wrong, of
course, and absolutely illegal, but it was funny too. Especially
his Gift. His second sight!"</p>

<p>"He must have been put to it," murmured Pelham appreciatively.
"I thought him an absolute fool when I came to that claim of his.
Oh, yes, it's duly set down somewhere among those reams."</p>

<p>"He found it rather difficult, you see, to explain his
absolute certainty that each person suggested as the criminal was
not guilty. He couldn't very well say why he knew they were
innocent!" The chief inspector had found Mackay's claim to occult
knowledge very diverting.</p>

<p>Pelham laughed. "But go on," he urged; "what came after his
purchase of the detective agency?"</p>

<p>"He promptly sent an account, and photographs, of the Brownlow
couple, taken during the time in Shanghai, to one private
detective agency in every large town of the world, offering a
price for any information concerning the pair. The offer was
renewed every anniversary of his brother's murder. And he has at
last got his reward."</p>

<p>"So has Brownlow!" murmured Pelham.</p>

<p>"And when the last of the string of Chengs sent him word of
the Jackson-Tibbitts sale of the claimed land in Touva, Mackay
added the name of Tibbitts to the other two. This theft of Mrs.
Brownlow's jewels and Davidson's money on the <i>rapide</i> came
as a gift to Mackay. He was at once informed by several agencies
that both the names that he was after had cropped up, the old and
the new. Mackay Jackson came over to Paris at once, and offered
his services to Davidson on the 'no success, no pay'
understanding. By the way, sir, it was he who had himself offered
his services as soon as he bought his business some years before
to the diamond combine in which Sir Anthony Cross was a director,
and he did some good work for them on the same understanding. As
far as this my tale is vouched for by known facts, but from now
on I'm only guessing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite good enough for me," murmured Pelham; "guess on."</p>

<p>"I think that he immediately wrote to Sir Anthony, not as to
the combine director this time, but as to the man who would have
been counsel for the defence in that murder trial that never came
off. He gave him&mdash;this is how I see it&mdash;the facts of
his brother's claim having evidently been in existence at the
time his brother was murdered, of the absolute absence of all
papers relating to any such claim on the dead body, of the name
of Tibbitts as the present owner, who appears to be a friend of
the man who killed his brother, whether in hot jealousy by a
hasty shove, as was thought by those who were on his side, or in
cold-blooded treachery. I imagine that Sir Anthony was better
than Mackay Jackson hoped, and wrote to him to meet him in Cluny.
Mackay does so, apparently while out fishing, the day after
Cross's arrival. I take it that Mackay suggested a few bull's-eyes the other might score when questioning the Brownlows. The
night of the murder, I believe that Mackay Jackson was listening
outside the door of the cedar room and heard the fatal
shot&mdash;heard Sir Anthony fall, and guesses what had happened.
The shot would come without warning, we may be sure, from
Brownlow. Mackay's one thought is to secure the papers which he
thinks Maitland has brought Cross, and which he imagines will be
in Sir Anthony's bag in his room, for they are too bulky to carry
on him.</p>

<p>"He must get them before Brownlow does. For they will bring
home the murder of Peter and of Anthony Cross&mdash;supposing
that Cross is, as he guesses he is, badly hurt, if not dead. I
think that thought was much more in his mind than even any idea
of the claim at the moment. He ran up into the room allotted Sir
Anthony Cross for the night and set to work. He would have to be
very careful not to be caught with, possibly, a dead man
downstairs. He finds nothing in the bag which he opens but a
revolver of Cross's. He takes this and goes downstairs to the
cedar room again, after nearly half an hour's work, for he had to
pick the wardrobe door as well as the bag.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, Brownlow has staged the little Tibbitts drama and
sent him off. Mackay Jackson opens the door of the cedar room
with his detective's nippers and finds Brownlow bending over
Cross&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Judging from the distance that the bullet that entered the
pewter plaque was probably fired?" asked Pelham briskly.</p>

<p>"Partly from that, and partly from the mix-up that followed
over the revolvers. For the moment, however, Mackay shoots
Brownlow, after getting a shot past his own head. Mackay doesn't
miss. Brownlow dropped dead, and his revolver falls from his hand
where he fell. Mackay, too, bends over Sir Anthony. He lays down
the revolver with which he has just shot Brownlow&mdash;the
revolver that is Sir Anthony's own&mdash;and tries to see if
anything can be done. But Sir Anthony is dead. All this, as I
say, sir, is purely guesswork, but I fancy it's fairly near what
happened."</p>

<p>It was exactly what had happened.</p>

<p>"Then Mackay drags Brownlow over to the corner where there is
a light&mdash;the opposite corner&mdash;searches him, and finds
what looks like the key of another safe. He had heard from Miss
Young about seeing Tibbitts in that very room with some black
pearls, like the lost one of Mrs. Brownlow, in his hands. Can
there be a safe in here? That would explain the missing papers.
Mackay decided that he must hunt later on&mdash;during the
inquiry. He picks up a revolver lying near Sir Anthony,
remembering that he had laid the one down that he had fired, and
hurries out when the coast is clear, locking the door from the
outside, but with the key on the inside. The key showed double
marks made by two uses of the ring nippers. As a matter of fact,
the revolver with which Mackay had shot Brownlow had probably got
shoved under Sir Anthony while Mackay raised him to see if he
could do anything. That, at least, is where it was found. It was
supposed that, twisting as he died, Sir Anthony had rolled over
it a little. Mackay, of course, dropped the one that he had taken
away in the Grosne, the river that runs beside the villa. And he
also drops&mdash;most unintentionally, and in the
garden&mdash;the key that looks like the key of a safe which he
has taken from Brownlow's waistcoat pocket. For in order to look
like a seedy debt collector at the dance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A grim irony in his choice of that character," put in Major
Pelham appreciatively.</p>

<p>"Mackay had ripped his coat lining and his pockets. So he
loses the precious key on his way to the gate. Loses it, and
looks for it desperately as soon as he can. He got to the villa
gates just a little before the police next morning, I learned,
and yet did not enter the villa except practically with them. He
had another hunt for it, openly and officially this time, with
the police, but he didn't find it. When it was discovered, he
tried to get hold of it&mdash;'to send it to
Davidson'&mdash;perhaps! But the police wouldn't let it out of
their sight." The chief inspector was back in the hours at
Cluny.</p>

<p>"When Mrs. Brownlow staged the idea of a duel by placing the
mate to the revolver that killed Sir Anthony beside her husband,
Mackay must have been staggered! It went against the grain with
him for Brownlow to be considered merely the man of honor
fighting for his wife. But he could prove nothing. He wanted the
papers&mdash;that were burned. When Tibbitts was arrested he was
in a bit of a hole. He tried his second sight, but it would only
impress Miss Young. He did a very daring piece of work and got
Tibbitts out."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> got him out? Whew! But his French?"</p>

<p>"The mother of the Jacksons was a French-Canadian, sir, who
couldn't speak more than a few words of broken English. Also, one
of the jobs he had done for the combine was in Paris, and I found
out that his French on that occasion had been perfect. So I
wasn't surprised to find that he could pass himself off as
Lenormand. I took care not to be at the hotel that
night&mdash;just in case of what he might be planning."</p>

<p>"You knew who Mackay was all the time?"</p>

<p>"I guessed it. I'll tell you how, and why, afterwards, sir.
And if so, it was Mackay's last chance for rescuing
Tibbitts&mdash;before he should give himself away when the
<i>juge</i> reconstructed the crime, as he intended to do. By the
way, it was Mackay who had got Lenormand down to defend Tibbitts
when he had no idea how desperate things were for that crook. And
Mackay was a very poor man indeed. When he rescued Tibbitts, he
evidently made his bargain with him. He felt sure that there was
a hidden safe. So he got Tibbitts, in return for his safety, to
stay around the villa well disguised, and burgle the safe at the
first possible opportunity. Also, I take it, he arranged for the
return to himself of any Jackson-Tibbitts claims in Touva. Mackay
got a genuine Swedish antiquarian from Cook's in Paris to be sent
to Dijon, a Swedish professor, moreover, who spoke English well,
but not a word of French. Tibbitts was whisked to Dijon, made up
en route, and well made up, and returned to Cluny with his
Swedish friend as a Mr. Larsen. As far as strangers, and the
French police go, a fellow Swede. Tibbitts would be sure to have
some underground way of getting whatever papers he needed."</p>

<p>"What about the <i>portrait parlé</i>?" asked Pelham in great
amusement, "it seems to've been rather silent."</p>

<p>"Tibbitts as a Swedish savant with a passion for museums was
evidently too much for it! Poor Mackay! He had his work all to do
again when the suspicion shifted to Maitland."</p>

<p>"If he hadn't been a silly ass," Pelham put in, "he would have
given Brownlow in charge when he entered the cedar room for the
murder of Sir Anthony, his own attempted murder, and the murder,
ten years ago, of his brother. Produced a copy of the claim
located in Touva, and got off with the thanks of the congregation
for putting such a dangerous criminal out of the way."</p>

<p>"Just so. That's where his impetuosity spoiled things. It used
to amuse me&mdash;as it must have him&mdash;to hear Miss Young
exhorting him to be a bit swifter. There was nothing slow about
Mackay. Nor did he look it. Which rather puzzled the young lady,
I think. She was a shrewd reader of faces, and Mackay's appealed
to the daughter of a Texas ranger, however halting his words and
slow his apparent actions might be. Well, when Maitland looked in
a bad way, I decided that it would have to be a document that
would save him. An escape couldn't succeed twice over. A
posthumous confession seemed the best and most likely card, and
when I found Mackay Jackson taking lessons from the commissaire
in how to detect a forgery and exactly what points to look
for&mdash;ostensibly, of course, over Sir Anthony's letter about
young Eastby&mdash;why, the inference made itself. As to the
whereabouts of the presently-to-be-found document, I remembered
the key which the police had found. I wondered if there might not
be a second, hidden safe. Tibbitts had certainly shown by his
face that the key meant a great deal to him. And Mrs. Brownlow
had a way of improving sufficiently at night, when the house was
all quiet, to come down into the cedar room and tap the panels
and work at them that suggested hunting for a safe."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Second sight too?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I was asked to observe, so I observed."</p>

<p>"I wonder you didn't add 'by way of routine.'"</p>

<p>"It was by way of routine," the chief inspector said sturdily,
"that I got into the habit of spending my nights tucked up under
the cedar room couch. The lights were so placed that it was in
the deep shadow."</p>

<p>"Tucked up!" scoffed the assistant commissioner.</p>

<p>"Well, I was asked to observe, wasn't I, sir?" Pointer
repeated. "So I observed. The fight among other things. Very good
show it was too. Gate money has been paid for worse. I knew
Mackay could box, by the way he had jumped back to escape a car
in the roads once or twice, jumped as a boxer does, keeping his
weight forward. I crept out from under the couch as soon as he
started in with the policeman. I also wanted to see what was
inside that safe. So while the two were slogging away, I
photographed all the most important looking papers I could find
in it. To develop at my leisure afterwards. There were two
packets. One was on top of the jewelry with blood marks on some
of the papers. They were taken from Sir Anthony's dead, or not
yet dead, body. Sir Anthony had evidently gone over his own notes
of the case when Mackay Jackson's letter reached him. I think
that was when Miss Young saw Mrs. Brownlow's
photograph&mdash;sent him by Mackay. It was still there. Then
there was one other packet in a drawer. Among these were some
papers which Brownlow must have taken years ago from Peter
Jackson, such as his original receipt for the purchase of his
claim, a document in Russian and Turkish, stamped with a curious
device which I am told is the Wheel of Fate&mdash;Krasny's
municipal stamp. Then there was a forged Jackson-Tibbitts sale,
dated just before the murder, and witnessed by the dead analyst,
who was dead when Brownlow drew it up! There was also the draft
of a re-sale to Brownlow by Tibbitts, as yet undated. There were
other papers which I should have liked to see, but I had to be
quick, for Tibbitts was just coming to as I worked. I slipped out
of the door before the <i>agent</i> was knocked out. I made for
the garden through the writing-room window, and watched, from
under the raised shutter of the cedar room, Mackay snatch all the
papers from the safe, toss in his own letter on top of the
jewels, grab Tibbitts, pull him to his feet, tell him to show a
leg for his life, and then the two made off towards a little car
which Mackay must have pulled under the hedge of the orchard. As
soon as they were safely off the premises, I 'observed,' from the
road where I was standing, the light on the hollies behind the
cedar room. That told any one who saw it that the shutter was a
least partially up and a light in the room. I called for the
police and hurried to the window. And the rest of the doings of
that night is, as you say, sir, to be found in the Third Book of
Kings."</p>

<p>"Mackay went to Lyons, I suppose?" Pelham asked.</p>

<p>"I think so. Luckily Tibbitts can drive, for Mackay himself
had only one eye half-open, which couldn't have looked around his
cauliflower of a nose if it had tried. His face would have needed
some explaining. Rondeau would certainly have asked himself a few
questions if he had caught sight of it. Which was why Mackay
concentrated on Brownlow's trail in Lyons, I fancy, and did that
chiefly by telephoning, I'll wager. Though he arrived with his
head nicely bandaged. He got that done at a convent hospital on
the outskirts of the town as you drive in. Told the night sister
that he had had an accident while motoring&mdash;a skid. She must
have thought that he had skidded chiefly on his face, but she
seems to have swallowed the story, and provided Mackay most
obligingly with a head like a football. Also she let him
telephone for a room to the hotel and again explain that he had
had a slight accident and would arrive looking slightly the worse
for wear. From the hotel he wrote and asked Miss Young to meet
him there on her way to Italy."</p>

<p>"Do you think he told her the whole truth?" Pelham wondered.
"I hope so."</p>

<p>"I'm sure so. Mackay would. And also, Miss Young would take it
very quietly. The Texas ranger had accounted for some thirty bad
men, she once told me. And certainly, by every standard, Brownlow
was a bad 'un."</p>

<p>"And Tibbitts, what of him?"</p>

<p>"'Mr. Larsen' and his fellow savant went on to Venice. There
'Mr. Larsen' terminated their connection. He went on alone,
though still as Mr. Larsen, to Constantinople, and there joined
Mr. and Mrs. Mackay Jackson. Mackay is giving him a new start in
life. He needs a metal-worker to help him in Touva. I happened to
overhear, or should I say 'observe,' a talk Mackay and Tibbitts
had after Tibbitts had blundered in some way and Miss Young had
recognized him. I think Mackay thought that Tibbitts had never
had a decent chance in life. And I don't think Tibbitts ever had.
He'll get it now. A fair and square deal."</p>

<p>There was a short pause.</p>

<p>"What took Smith to the villa that night Mrs. Brownlow left.
If it was Smith?" the assistant commissioner wondered.</p>

<p>"A bogus message from Lascelles, so he told me. I dropped in
for a chat on the way home. The message asked him to meet
Lascelles without fail at midnight in the writing-room at Villa
Porte Bonheur. If Lascelles was late, Smith was to wait for him
for an hour, and then leave. He was told that it was most urgent.
By the way, sir, Lascelles had been very keen on having a word
with Sir Anthony. He would have given his eyes, so Smith says, to
go with the Mongolian expedition, of which he had heard rumors
through the Cambridge Association. In fact, he waited around
while Sir Anthony and the Brownlows had their talk, and finally
waylaid Sir Anthony on his walk back to his hotel. But he was
told that the expedition was full up. Only tried men were to go
on it. But now returning to Smith and the bogus message. He got
the wind up after he'd been in the house only twenty minutes. Saw
a black-robed figure&mdash;we know that it was Miss Young, but he
didn't&mdash;by the cedar room door, and tried to slip out of the
house by his balcony, the way he had entered. He found the
balcony door bolted, and doubled down the corridor, past Mrs.
Brownlow's room and down the servants' stairs, and so out by
another side door. The police all but caught him, but he managed
to get back to Vichy unmolested. There, a tip of oriental
magnificence made a night porter get a little mixed as to the
hours, and tell the police that it was a good deal earlier when
he saw Mr. Smith come in than it really was."</p>

<p>"I suppose that message was Mackay's doing again?" Pointer
nodded.</p>

<p>"I suppose so too, sir."</p>

<p>"Why? Red herring?"</p>

<p>"Partly, and partly to pay Smith out, I fancy. Mackay likes
both to pay and collect his debts. I don't think Mackay had
forgiven Smith his refusal to see him when he came down to Cluny.
And I think he felt that he owed him a little discomfort on
account of Smith's high and mighty airs to Miss Young. And also,
in fairness, Smith was the only man available who would come on
that sort of a message, and who wasn't suspected of being in the
murder. Mackay did need a red herring to draw off the French
police while he forced Mrs. Brownlow to leave Villa Porte
Bonheur."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The assistant commissioner moved forward in his chair.
"I was wondering how Mackay worked that. You think he distrusted
her? I don't wonder!"</p>

<p>"Nor I either, sir! Though evidently Tibbitts told him
nothing, could tell him nothing, that incriminated
her&mdash;definitely. Still, once Vivian Young had recognized
Tibbitts in one of the Swedish savants, I don't think Mackay had
one easy moment. Everything&mdash;for him&mdash;turned on
Tibbitts. And everything for both Tibbitts and himself turned on
the latter not being taken again. Yet one incautious word of Miss
Young's, especially if Mrs. Brownlow was in the original crime,
would have meant the certain recapture of Tibbitts. So I think
Mackay terrified Mrs. Brownlow by climbing into her window and
telling her his real identity, at the same time ordering her to
dress and follow him or be handed over to the police as her
husband's accomplice. Like me, he must have watched her hunting
that cedar room&mdash;for proofs of clues as to who killed her
husband, Miss Young thought. Possibly that was the reason! At any
rate, Mackay drove her off to Lyons, and there&mdash;well, she
was a Frenchwoman born, you see, she wouldn't need to show her
papers if she went under her maiden name or took another name.
Probably she went to her own people in the south."</p>

<p>Pelham thought over what he had heard and nodded several
times.</p>

<p>"And when did you suspect Mackay?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well from the first, sir. There were so many odd
things about Mackay&mdash;apart from his remarkable Scottish
accent. First of all, I heard that he had not yet been to see the
body when the commissaire and I arrived, nor tried to see it.
That struck me as extraordinary on the part of a private
investigator, no matter whether he were on another crime or not.
I felt sure that he <i>had</i> been in the room. That raised the
question of when? Then, as a detective, he would be in possession
of just such a pliers as would turn that key, and would have the
requisite skill. Then, added to that, Miss Young told me that she
saw him and Sir Anthony fishing in the same stream the day before
the dance night. Now, I was at Macon then, and it was a wonderful
day. Clear and sparkling. Not a day on which and fisherman would
try to fish! In that light&mdash;Macon is only a few miles from
Cluny, as you know, sir&mdash;a line of spiders' silk would have
looked like a hawser, and not a trout of under six inches even
could have been tempted to rise, not by any bait, nor any skill.
Yet, I knew that Sir Anthony was a member of two very well-known
anglers' clubs. So I talked fishing to Mackay over our first
dinner, and he showed that he knew a good deal about it. Showed,
too, that he knew of some flies that are only used in Canada,
though he threw in references in the beginning to Scottish flies.
You see, he really was a good fisherman, and got keen on the
talk, and didn't quite notice how much he was giving away.</p>

<p>"Canadian flies! That gave me to think when I heard later on
that young Jackson had been a Canadian, and had a younger brother
who would be about Mackay's present age now. Then came the reply
from Shanghai to a question of mine that the brother's name was
Henry M. Jackson. The answer to another question told me that the
M. stood for Mackay! Besides, too, I was certain that he had
hunted that garden before any of us. There was the length of time
before he reached the house after he left the hotel. And while I
was with him, he let certain clumps quite alone, and only looked
in certain others. Besides, his whole character&mdash;assumed
character, I mean&mdash;was so at variance with his face! I felt
sure that he was impersonating some Scot whom he had known, the
original Uncle Mackay, very possibly. His talk of logic and going
by 'the light of reason,' went quite comically with the most
fearless, coldly daring face that I've ever seen&mdash;and a gait
to match. Mackay's stride was that of a&mdash;well, I should
fancy of a Texas ranger&mdash;according to Miss Young's glowing
descriptions of them." Pointer gave a reminiscent chuckle.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he guessed, or guesses, that you know..." Major
Pelham said half to himself.</p>

<p>"I wonder, too, sir. He may. He risked that. Incidentally, I
warned him that he had better hurry and get his final coup in
before the French linked up with Touva&mdash;which might mean
with him. Also I ventured on a wedding present of Copenhagen
china. A couple of dogs."</p>

<p>"Dogs?"</p>

<p>"They were asleep," laughed the chief inspector as he
rose.</p>

<p>"So you solved the Cluny problem in your own way. You
would!"</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head.</p>

<p>"The real Cluny problem, sir, was and is Mrs. Brownlow. She's
beyond me. Was she innocent? Was she guilty? And guilty all
through? Who can say?"</p>

<p>"I wonder Mackay Jackson tried to shield her so completely in
that final letter of his&mdash;the letter he signed as Brownlow,"
Pelham looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I think he had promised her he would do as much when he made
her leave the villa and go into hiding. And I think he wasn't
sure&mdash;any more than I am&mdash;whether she were innocent or
guilty, and knew that, as he never would be sure, he must give
her the benefit of the doubt. And also, I shouldn't wonder if he
didn't consider that her husband's death at his hand had settled
the old score in full.</p>

<p>"She evidently knew what make of bullet killed Sir Anthony,
since she was able to put the right weapon beside her
husband&mdash;without that non-existent chit in her vanity-case
to help her," the assistant commissioner said, after thinking
things over.</p>

<p>"She did, sir. But there again...we shall never know the
truth...and the <i>juge</i>, though he will probably marry her,
will never know...</p>

<p>"She didn't try to throw suspicion on any of the accused, or
semi-accused persons," mused Major Pelham.</p>

<p>"But there again, sir, innocent or guilty? If she were in with
her husband, she might well have been appalled at the idea of
suspicion falling on Tibbitts, that husband's partner. Brownlow
could doubtless have done a dozen things to suppress Tibbitts
which she could not, without showing her hand, and that, always
supposing she held one, she evidently was determined at all costs
not to do. As for Mr. Maitland&mdash;well, she had to walk a very
narrow ledge there, didn't she&mdash;innocent or guilty! I think
the Scottish verdict of 'Not Proven,' the only one that fits that
most enigmatic woman, for I ask myself, as Rondeau would put it,
and I always shall, whether she were what she seemed or a most
cunning accomplice."</p>

<p>And that was Chief Inspector Pointer's final utterance on the
Cluny problem.</p>
