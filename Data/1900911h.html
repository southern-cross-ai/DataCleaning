    New Year&rsquo;s Eve</b></h2>
  <p align="left">TWELVE people sat at supper in the spacious dining room of
    Manning Carleton, in his Fifth Avenue home.</p>
  <p align="left">Not an apartment. Even the most modern apartments, with their
    penthouses and terraces, had no charm for a Carleton.</p>
  <p align="left">No, he lived in one of the few remaining mansions on the Avenue,
    and his corner lot, facing Central Park, was the despair of all realtors
    and the hope of the construction companies.</p>
  <p align="left">The house was a double one, with rooms each side of its central
    entrance hall, and it extended to a great depth along the side street.</p>
  <p align="left">Next to the house, on Fifth Avenue, was a smaller house, whose
    architectural details proved it to have been built at about the same time.</p>
  <p align="left">This house also was owned by Manning Carleton, and there was
    no slightest chance that either of the two homes should fall into the hands
    of a wrecking company during the owner&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
  <p align="left">The larger house had been the home of Manning Carleton and
    his forebears for three generations, and the smaller house had been in the
    family an equally long time.</p>
  <p align="left">The last Carleton to occupy the smaller house was Roger Carleton,
    brother of Manning. But he had died ten years ago, and since his death the
    house had been rented to strangers.</p>
  <p align="left">At present it was occupied by Jack Mortlake and his wife, most
    satisfactory and exemplary tenants.</p>
  <p align="left">The Carleton house was on a north corner, and the front corner
    room was a large and heavily decorated drawing room. Back of this was a charming
    boudoir or morning room, devoted to the exclusive use of Carleton&rsquo;s
    wife, Pauline, or Polly, as she was called by her friends.</p>
  <p align="left">Back of the morning room was the dining room, a nobly proportioned
    apartment, with ornate frescoes and crystal chandeliers that had hung and
    twinkled over many a Carleton banquet.</p>
  <p align="left">Old-fashioned, yes. Antique, no. Yet the appointments were
  harmonious and beautiful, even as they had been when Manning Carleton was born
  in this house, sixty years ago. No modern innovations had been allowed, save
  in the matter of electric or other inventions that added to the comfort or
  convenience of the home.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="cp"><img alt="" height="750" src="1900911h-images/diagram.png" width="655"> </p>
  <p align="left">And now, round the long and wide extension table, were gathered
    a dozen merrymakers to welcome the advent of the New Year.</p>
  <p align="left">In fact, they had done so. It was now ten minutes after twelve,
    and the greetings had been said, the toast drunk, and the songs sung that
    tradition decreed appropriate to the occasion.</p>
  <p align="left">Though rather a decorous lot, some of the party inclined to
    gayety, lured on, perhaps, by the excellence of the champagne or the potency
    of stronger libations.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline, the hostess, was the second wife of Manning Carleton
    and thirty years his junior. This, in addition to her own charm, vivacity,
    and self-esteem, gave her all the latitude she wanted, and she took all there
    was.</p>
  <p align="left">Queen of her home, her husband, and her household, she never
    knew what it was to have a wish ungratified or a whim unhumored.</p>
  <p align="left">If she sometimes regretted that her life mate was not a man
    nearer her own age, she never let it appear by word or look to the man she
    had chosen.</p>
  <p align="left">Her attitude toward him, while not adoring, was affectionate,
    chummy, and ever solicitous of his comfort.</p>
  <p align="left">Polly was pretty&mdash;very pretty, with a tangle of golden
    windblown bob, big, innocent-looking pansy eyes, and a little heart-shaped
    face that could be wistful or merry to order. Incidentally, it could be suffused
    with amorous longing, but a glimpse of that radiance was seldom vouchsafed
    to Manning Carleton.</p>
  <p align="left">At the head of the long table Polly had on her right, Professor
    Abel Scott, old college chum of Carleton, and a correctly absent-minded,
    bewildered type. At least, he seemed to be, but there were times when a shrewd
    glance from under his bushy gray eyebrows rather belied any absentness of
    mind.</p>
  <p align="left">To offset this grave and reverend seigneur, on Pauline&rsquo;s
    left was Donald Randall, a young man who was over head and ears in love with
    her.</p>
  <p align="left">Randall was fat and pop-eyed, yet, strange to say, even these
    drawbacks couldn&rsquo;t prevent his being a handsome man with a splendid
    physique and great charm of manner.</p>
  <p align="left">Carleton, though most amiable and unnoticing in the matter
    of Polly&rsquo;s court favorites, had at last begun to wonder if he oughtn&rsquo;t
    to notice Randall, but he had, so far, postponed the matter.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, on the host&rsquo;s own right hand was Z&eacute;lie D&rsquo;Orsay,
    a rather disturbing friend of Pauline&rsquo;s, and possessed of a strong
    desire to disturb Manning Carleton himself.</p>
  <p align="left">Just why, nobody knew, not even Z&eacute;lie, but the impulse
    was largely the result of an innate tendency to tackle the most difficult
    job that presented itself. And it was to the credit of Manning Carleton that
    he had so far resisted her wiles, for the siren was of the dusky-haired,
    sloe-eyed persuasion, and her tactics were perilously akin to those of Machiavelli.</p>
  <p align="left">It was, perhaps, the necessity of dividing his attention between
    Z&eacute;lie and his left-hand neighbor that saved Carleton from making a
    fool of himself that New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
  <p align="left">The lady was his tenant from next door, from the other house,
    as it was usually called.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Jack Mortlake&mdash;her husband was also present&mdash;was
    a good-looking woman of thirty-five, whose placid serenity of countenance
    was achieved by a strong and determined will power.</p>
  <p align="left">An opportunity having occurred to rent the Carletons&rsquo; other
    house, Nan Mortlake had decided that her husband should do so, because of
    a great hope in her soul that proximity to the Carletons themselves would
    help her along on her somewhat uphill climb to the social heights she longed
    to attain.</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact it had, so far, done nothing of the sort,
    but Mrs. Mortlake had not yet lowered her banner with its strange device,
    and her soul still whispered, &ldquo;Excelsior!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">To-night, then, she sat next her host, albeit not at his right
    hand, and wreathing her face with smiles she endeavored to wring from him
    some helpful invitations over which he had jurisdiction.</p>
  <p align="left">Mellowed by the occasion and the celebration thereof, Carleton
    was proving rather more amenable than usual, and Nan Mortlake was in ecstasies.</p>
  <p align="left">Well, the others at the table were Carleton&rsquo;s <em>grande
    dame</em> of a sister, who, in another age and environment, might have looked
    like Madame de Pompadour, but who probably would have talked with Violet
    Carleton&rsquo;s sharp and ill-natured tongue.</p>
  <p align="left">And his son Claude, handsome, debonair, distinguished looking,
    and full of the <em>joie de vivre</em> that belongs to New Year&rsquo;s Eve and its
    due and proper celebration.</p>
  <p align="left">Jack Mortlake was simply his wife&rsquo;s husband.</p>
  <p align="left">The two secretaries, correctly quiet and demure, were Peter
    Gregg, confidential secretary of the great man of affairs, and Emily Austen,
    social secretary to Pauline.</p>
  <p align="left">That, then, is the roll of guests, with one important addition.</p>
  <p align="left">The twelfth member of the party, sitting between Claude Carleton
    and Miss Austen, was Kenneth Carlisle, the well known and in some circles
    famous private investigator. He himself preferred the simple term detective,
    but his business had become so widely known and his services so greatly in
    demand that a more pretentious title seemed necessary.</p>
  <p align="left">Now Carlisle had been an investigator only a few years. Before
    that he had been a screen star, a movie actor of great popularity. But, fed
    up with the adulation of the picture-loving public, and having a decided
    taste for crime investigation, he had changed his career entirely and was
    rapidly becoming as noted in his second venture as in his first.</p>
  <p align="left">His Hollywood days had left their impress. He was handsome
    in his own right, but his studio experiences had given him a grace of bearing
    and a charm of manner that never forsook him.</p>
  <p align="left">His dark, lean face, though mobile, was entirely under his
    control, and his calm was immovable unless of his own volition.</p>
  <p align="left">His eyes, dark and deep set, were a decided asset in his present
    calling.</p>
  <p align="left">He could sit in front of a suspect and by merely looking at
    him from under his dark, compelling eyebrows could often bring about a confession
    obtainable in no other way.</p>
  <p align="left">For the rest Carlisle was simply a correct-mannered gentleman
    of a bland and entertaining demeanor.</p>
  <p align="left">But this astute and clever detective was not at the Carleton
    supper party in his r&ocirc;le of sleuth&mdash;not at all.</p>
  <p align="left">He had been invited because he knew all about Hollywood, and
    he had accepted the invitation because Claude Carleton, the man who had proffered
    it, had been so insistent, even urgent, that Carlisle hadn&rsquo;t the heart
    to refuse him.</p>
  <p align="left">The two had met the week before at some club, and learning
    of the detective&rsquo;s previous career Claude had made up to him and had
    begged him for points about Hollywood and its ways and means, saying he was
    just going there to become a screen actor himself.</p>
  <p align="left">Always helpful, Kenneth gave him valuable advice and sage counsel.
    Also letters to managers and producers, also social introductions.</p>
  <p align="left">Whereupon, partly from a sense of gratitude, partly in hope
    of getting more advantageous assistance, Claude invited him to the party
    and urged him until he consented.</p>
  <p align="left">And now, seated at the supper table between Claude and Miss
    Austen, he was feeling a trifle bored.</p>
  <p align="left">The conversation, though light and bright, failed to interest
    him; the repartee, though a trifle above the average, was tame compared to
    the rapid-fire give-and-take of a Hollywood crowd.</p>
  <p align="left">Not that Carlisle was overcritical, but he seldom went where
    there was even a chance of his being bored, and he felt a slight chagrin
    that he had let himself in for it.</p>
  <p align="left">And then, partly because of his presence, partly because it
    was the trend of the times, the talk veered to detective stories.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it necessary,&rdquo; Don Randall was asking, &ldquo;for
    a detective to quote philosophy or poetry all the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For a fiction detective, yes,&rdquo; Carlisle answered
    him, &ldquo;for a live one, no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But why, for the story-book man?&rdquo; Randall pursued.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So the reader will know he is a detective,&rdquo;  Carlisle
    stated gravely. &ldquo;Would either Sherlock Holmes or Philo Vance stick
    in your mind if they hadn&rsquo;t aired their erudition as they did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I guess not,&rdquo; and Randall looked thoughtful. &ldquo;Ninety-nine
    out of a hundred story-book sleuths are as smart as those two, but they don&rsquo;t
    stick in your memory because they don&rsquo;t get off highfalutin lingo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; broke in Z&eacute;lie. &ldquo;Great
    detectives are great because of what they do, not what they say. Same as
    everybody else&mdash;I mean, great people in any line, in any field.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A great criminal, then, is great because of grande
  dame&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">This was Pauline&rsquo;s contribution to the conversation and
    was promptly cut off by her husband.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Shut up, Polly,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with his customary
    gallantry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you talk of criminals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will finish your sentence for you, Mrs. Carleton,&rdquo; Carlisle
    smiled at her; &ldquo;a great criminal must be a man of superior intellect,
    iron nerve, and a vacuum where his conscience ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The nerve and the lack of conscience, yes,&rdquo;  agreed
    Randall, &ldquo;but not of superior intellect. That is absurd. Think of the
    crimes committed by the entirely uneducated, the underworld, the&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I said a great criminal,&rdquo; Kenneth smiled at
    him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t count gunmen and yeggs among our great criminals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;our great criminals,&rsquo;&rdquo; objected
    Manning Carleton; &ldquo;it sounds as if we were proud of them as a class!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t mean it that way,&rdquo; Carlisle went
    on.  &ldquo;But even in crime, as Pope says, &lsquo;Some are and must be
    greater than the rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now I know you&rsquo;re a real detective,&rdquo; cried
    Polly, clapping her hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quoting poetry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I agree with Mr. Carlisle,&rdquo; put in Miss Carleton,
    her black eyes snapping from beneath her carefully arranged transformation
    of waved gray hair. &ldquo;Crime, like any other undertaking, is greater
    if committed by an intellectual mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you mean it is a greater crime or a greater achievement?&rdquo; said
    Professor Scott slowly, and looking at Miss Violet, who sat next him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It is a greater, a
    more impressive achievement, and consequently a greater, that is, a more
    to be deplored, crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well meant, though not so well put,&rdquo; declared
    her brother. &ldquo;But say no more, Violet. As I told Pauline, the subject
    of crime is not one I care to hear discussed by my women folks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And do your women folks discuss only what you say they
    may, Mr. Carleton?&rdquo; cried Nan Mortlake. &ldquo;How droll! And how it
    must narrow their field of conversation! Do you obey the despot, Mrs. Carleton?
    And Miss Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her rather commonplace features took on the sly look habitual
    with those who love to &ldquo;take a rise&rdquo; out of their friends.</p>
  <p align="left">But as neither of the women she addressed answered her, and
    as others quickly filled in the breach with their remarks, the rise wasn&rsquo;t
    taken.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course there are great crimes,&rdquo; resumed Carlisle,
    less bored now than he had been. &ldquo;They are on record.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Gregg, the secretary.  &ldquo;Look
    at all those books of Edmund Pearson&rsquo;s. They describe in detail the
    most celebrated crimes, and explain why and how they are great. The matter
    is looked at scientifically&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As it should be,&rdquo; declared Professor Scott.  &ldquo;Pearson
    is a great writer and thinker. The finest in that field. But not the only
    one. Many scholarly writers deal with similar subjects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let them,&rdquo; cried Manning Carleton angrily. &ldquo;But
    that&rsquo;s no reason the matter should be discussed at my table! I insist
    on a change of subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I never read Mr. Pearson&rsquo;s books,&rdquo; Pauline
    said, paying not the slightest heed to her husband&rsquo;s dictum. &ldquo;But
    I adore Edgar Wallace&rsquo;s. They say he writes one every week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No Wallace for me!&rdquo; put in Jack Mortlake a trifle
    timidly. &ldquo;I like the old Sherlock Holmes formula.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Professor Scott. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    my choice, too. Murder on the first page, solution on the last. All in between,
    clues, evidence, deduction, and false leads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the S. S. Van Dine type, too,&rdquo; Mortlake
    stated. &ldquo;And the formula of all the best English writers. And, by jingo,
    they can deliver the goods. Their best authors do detective stories, even
    Milne and Phillpotts and Zangwill and that Bentley chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real connoisseur, Mr. Mortlak,&rdquo; said
    Carlisle, looking at him in slight surprise.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I read a lot of &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re my favorite
    recreation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go &rsquo;em,&rdquo; admitted Randall. &ldquo;Oh
    I read some books, but mostly I go in for the short stories, the detective
    magazines, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not the murder trials as reported in the tabloid
    newspapers?&rdquo; asked Carleton, in a tone of withering sarcasm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I like those too,&rdquo; Randall said frankly. &ldquo;Only
    you never get anywhere with them. They set the problem and then go off and
    leave it, usually forgetting to come back. Now in fiction you&rsquo;re sure
    to get your solution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that every human being is a potential
    murderer,&rdquo; stated Z&eacute;lie, with the air of saying something astounding.  &ldquo;Do
    you believe that, Mr. Carlisle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth smiled. &ldquo;Like most of those shocking assumptions,
    it means nothing,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;If murder is merely the act
    of killing, then anyone who can use a gun, or a dirk, or his two fists is
    a potential murderer. If murder is a state of mind&mdash;or to put it in
    Scriptural phrase, if &lsquo;as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,&rsquo; then
    many, if not all, of the dwellers on this earth are most certainly potential
    murderers. The great majority of these, we doubtless all admit, are restrained
    by the fear of being found out. Were it not for this fear I shudder to think
    what might happen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle spoke very gravely at the last, for his work had brought
    home to him the conviction that what he was saying was entirely true.</p>
  <p align="left">And then, with his intuitive, almost clairvoyant insight, he
    glanced quickly from one to another, round the table.</p>
  <p align="left">So amazed was he at what he saw, he dropped his eyes instantly,
    only to raise them again, fascinated by the occasion.</p>
  <p align="left">For it seemed to him that everyone, or nearly everyone at the
    table was busy with his or her own thoughts. And it seemed to him that everyone
    was concentrating on murder or the possibility of murder, not in the abstract,
    but concretely.</p>
  <p align="left">Donald Randall, his prominent eyes more prominent than ever,
    was gazing far off, but his face bore a glare of venomous hatred, and his
    usually loose, slack mouth was set in a straight line.</p>
  <p align="left">Jack Mortlake, too, was absorbed in thought, and if his face
    was any indication whatever, he, too, was dreaming of killing somebody.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet was fairly gritting her teeth in her frenzy of
    imagination, and her delicate old hands, with their falling lace ruffles,
    were clenched on the rim of the table.</p>
  <p align="left">The two secretaries, while not seeming to be of murderous intent
    at the moment, were looking at each other with meaning but shocked glances,
    as if well aware of the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude Carleton was in what is popularly known as a brown study.
    But even as Kenneth stared at him he jerked himself together and resumed,
    with an effort, his gay demeanor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hello, everybody,&rdquo; he cried jovially, &ldquo;I
    have to be leaving you soon. Let&rsquo;s go back to the other room and have
    a bit of a dance before I go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Going away?&rdquo; asked Mortlake, also shaking himself
    free of his reverie. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; Claude said in surprise.  &ldquo;I
    thought everybody knew. I&rsquo;m going to Hollywood on the two o&rsquo;clock
    train to learn to be an actor like Carlisle here. Like he used to be, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good gracious, what a stunt!&rdquo; Mortlake marveled. &ldquo;Why,
    buddy, why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Primarily to earn my living,&rdquo; Claude laughed back, &ldquo;and,
    too, because I feel the screen needs me. I hear it calling me. So I&rsquo;ve
    had Carly down here to tell me things and give me pointers and so on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">If Kenneth resented this familiarity on Claude&rsquo;s part
    he didn&rsquo;t show it at all, and he had honestly tried to do all he could
    for the chap. He had heard that he had tried to make good in his father&rsquo;s
    banking office and had lamentably failed. And he thought if screen work was
    more in the lad&rsquo;s line it was at least worth trying.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, take a later train, Claude,&rdquo; Pauline begged
    as they all looked at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t, Polly. All my reservations and so forth
    are taken, and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">Just then Fenn the butler came in and spoke to Mr. Carleton.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Another present, I guess, sir,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;And
    a big one! An enormous box&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; cried Polly, trying to collect
    the women&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;And I say, Manning, let&rsquo;s have it brought
    out here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No room for it, dearie. No, we chaps will forego our
    tarrying at the table, and we&rsquo;ll all go in and open the box so Claude
    can be with us. I fancy I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He chuckled to himself, for an old crony had promised him a
    crate of pre-war fluids as a New Year&rsquo;s gift, and it hadn&rsquo;t yet
    come.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline rose to all the dignity of her five feet four and shook
    out her flounces of golden gauze that made her look like a very animated
    butterfly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Take me, Claude,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
    going away I must show you especial favor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude came toward her, none too willingly, it seemed, and
    escorted her to the drawing room.</p>
  <p align="left">The rest followed, in no strict order, Z&eacute;lie, however,
    cuddling her arm through that of Manning Carleton, who couldn&rsquo;t help
    himself.</p>
  <p align="left">At sight of the present everybody exclaimed.</p>
  <p align="left">For, held up at either end by a chair, was a long box that
    narrowly escaped looking like a coffin, but only because it was too short,
    too narrow, and not deep enough.</p>
  <p align="left">Though of smooth wood and free from splinters, it was merely
    a box of pine, the address splashed on with black marking paint, and the
    nails carelessly driven in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Carleton said, grinning at it, &ldquo;I
    know what it is. And you&rsquo;ll all help me enjoy it, I hope. Old Garston
    sent it, I know, and it&rsquo;s a fine brand, I&rsquo;ll wager. Get some
    help, Fenn, and open it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In here, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, right here. We want to see the whole performance.
    Sit down, all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Most of them seated themselves, awaiting with curiosity a sight
    of the contents.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hurry up, Fenn,&rdquo; Claude shouted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    miss my train, but I must see the New Year&rsquo;s present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carefully Fenn and a footman drew the nails and took off the
    top boards. A white paper covered the contents, and on the paper lay a sealed
    envelope. Carleton took it from the butler and read its message aloud.</p>
  <p align="left">It was only a few words.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"  class="note">&ldquo; &lsquo;I am sending you something supposed to be at
    many a feast.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, champagne, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said Manning
    Carleton. &ldquo;Go on, Fenn, remove the next paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The man did so, and was barely able to repress an involuntary
    shriek.</p>
  <p align="left">For exposed to full view was a bleached and grinning skeleton,
    and on the bony chest was a card which read:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left" class="quote">Long years ago you murdered me;<br>As I am now, you soon shall be!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</a><br>
    The Skeleton at the Feast</b></h2>
  <p align="left">MANNING CARLETON, as was well known by his doctor and the members
    of his household, had what is commonly described as heart trouble. While
    the medical man didn&rsquo;t give it a more definite or specific name, he
    did say positively that any sudden undue exertion or any strong emotional
    shock would mean troublesome and perhaps disastrous consequences.</p>
  <p align="left">And the unexpected sight of that terrifying, grinning thing
    in the box was enough to startle anyone with strong nerves and a normal heart.</p>
  <p align="left">What, then, might it mean to a man whose nerves were jumpy
    and whose heart was likely to go back on him at sufficient provocation?</p>
  <p align="left">Most of those present sensed this, and several of them moved
    as with one accord.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline, the wife, stepped quickly to the side of her husband,
    as he stood facing the gruesome sight, and she insinuated herself between
    the living man and the dead man so adroitly that the white and shaking Manning
    Carleton could not see the dread gift that had been sent him.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude Carleton too hastened to the side of his father and
    put an arm round the trembling shoulders.</p>
  <p align="left">Not at all a cowardly character, Carleton Senior was seldom
    frightened, but this fearsome sight, where he had expected to see gold-topped
    bottles of fine champagne, gave him a shock that left him spineless and breathless.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude eased him into a big chair, and Pauline ran to get some
    of the remedy the doctor had left to be used in case of attack.</p>
  <p align="left">But while they ministered to the sick man the others were unable
    to keep their eyes from the long box and its grisly contents.</p>
  <p align="left">Though apparently the skeleton of a full-grown man, it was
    fitted into a box much smaller than would have been needed for a dead man
    still clothed in his mortal flesh.</p>
  <p align="left">The bare skeleton was in a box merely lined with white paper,
    without padding or covering.</p>
  <p align="left">To the women it was a horrifying sight, and they turned their
    backs or peeped between their fingers.</p>
  <p align="left">But the men were frankly curious and drew nearer to examine
    the bones.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott especially was interested, and he went so far
    as to touch the arm and hand and even tried to turn the head.</p>
  <p align="left">Donald Randall was more absorbed in studying the card that
    lay on the ghastly looking chest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;&lsquo;Long years ago you murdered me!&rsquo;&rdquo; he
    read aloud. &ldquo;Rotten sort of joke, I call this business! I like a detective
    story, but not such practical presentations of murder as this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; said Z&eacute;lie,
    laughing rather loudly. &ldquo;Just a New Year&rsquo;s Eve joke. Some of
    his cronies wanted to rag him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pretty poor taste for a joke,&rdquo; said Jack Mortlake,
    looking scornful. &ldquo;I wonder if anybody did murder this very defunct
    person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If so it was a long time since,&rdquo; put in Scott.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    an old bag o&rsquo; bones, I can tell you. Out of a doctor&rsquo;s laboratory,
    presumably. You see it&rsquo;s articulated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gracious! what does that mean?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Mortlake,
    looking puzzled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It means the joints are fastened with wires,&rdquo;  her
    husband told her quickly, as if anxious to display his erudition.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; cried Donald. &ldquo;Then we can
    lift him out, and he won&rsquo;t fall to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Carleton had sat, a silent observer until now, but when
    Donald actually lifted the skeleton from the box she gave a scream and sank
    back in her chair with closed eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">Donald, however, gave her no regard, and grinned, like a child
    with a new toy.</p>
  <p align="left">He found that the skeleton did not drop apart, and being in
    a rollicking humor he disposed the dangling bones in an easy chair, and catching
    a velvet scarf from the piano he draped it about the bony shoulders. A lamp
    shade he commandeered to do duty for a hat, and then, sticking a lighted
    cigarette through a space left by a missing tooth, he surveyed the result
    of his handiwork.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stop your clowning,&rdquo; Claude said in low, angry
    tones, but Donald answered seriously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
    only way to manage the affair. See, your father is smiling in spite of himself!
    This horseplay will chirk him up and make a farce out of what might have
    been a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Pauline, who, now that
    her husband had revived, was interested in the others. &ldquo;Good for you,
    Don. If we can just get Manning back to normal, he&rsquo;ll get over the
    attack quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m over it now,&rdquo; Carleton declared, looking
    quite like himself. &ldquo;Now, who cut up that asinine attempt at a joke?
    Let me see that card!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He took it and read: &ldquo;&lsquo;Long years ago you murdered
    me&rsquo;&mdash;h&rsquo;m, guess this was meant for somebody else. I&rsquo;m
    not a killer. &lsquo;As I am now, you soon shall be.&rsquo; Well, old chap,
    we&rsquo;ll all be like you, some day, but I don&rsquo;t know about the soon.
    I can&rsquo;t think this is a joke on me by anyone. I&rsquo;m sure nobody
    I know would cut up a fool trick like this. I think it was meant for some
    other victim. Let me see the address tag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn brought the boards that had borne the address, and while
    it was clearly sent to Manning Carleton he declared he didn&rsquo;t recognize
    the lettering.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Take that fol-de-rol off him and put him back in his
    box,&rdquo; Carleton ordered, and assisted by the servants, Randall obeyed.</p>
  <p align="left">But a hush had fallen on the party. Nobody seemed inclined
    to resume the jollity of the supper hour or the merriment of the New Year&rsquo;s
    occasion.</p>
  <p align="left">Out in the street could be heard the horns and rattles of the
    noisy throngs that made up the usual holiday parade.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I must get along,&rdquo; Claude said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    all right, aren&rsquo;t you, Dad? I won&rsquo;t leave you if you&rsquo;re
    not. But I have my tickets and all&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know, I know,&rdquo; returned the older man.  &ldquo;Go
    on, I&rsquo;m all right, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent for Dr. Landon,&rdquo; Pauline said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    feel better to have his advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, what did you do that for?&rdquo; cried her husband
    testily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a doctor! I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe you are and maybe you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said
    his sister. &ldquo;I advised Polly to call in Landon, and I&rsquo;m glad
    she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then all was bustle and confusion, for Dr. Landon arrived
    and Claude departed at the same time.</p>
  <p align="left">Young Carleton&rsquo;s farewells were for the most part conventional
    and perfunctory, but he kissed affectionately his old aunt, his father, and
    his father&rsquo;s wife. Then he gave a warm handshake and hearty thanks
    to Kenneth Carlisle, blew a kiss from his finger tips to Z&eacute;lie, and
    with a few more nods and smiles he was gone.</p>
  <p align="left">The doctor, coming in upon the strange scene, waited till Claude
    had gone before he blandly inquired concerning the presence of the skeleton.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you never heard of the skeleton at the feast?&rdquo; asked
    Donald, grinning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought they were kept in the cupboard,&rdquo;  returned
    the doctor, seeing the subject was to be treated lightly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;I want
    you to give my husband the once-over and make sure his heart is all right.&rdquo;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left" class="note">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh, &rsquo;is &rsquo;art was true to Poll,<br>&rsquo;Is &rsquo;art was true to Poll,<br>An&rsquo; no matter what you do,<br>If yer &rsquo;art be true,<br>An&rsquo; &rsquo;is &rsquo;art was true&mdash;to Poll!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This stanza was gayly sung by Don Randall.</p>
  <p align="left">Having returned the skeleton to its box, he ordered the butler
    to stand the box up against the wall, as being less in the way.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle was fascinated with the thing.</p>
  <p align="left">Though he had passed by them in medical museums, a really,
    truly skeleton had never before come his way. He stood in front of it, observing
    the bones closely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The chap was murdered, all right,&rdquo; he said at
    last, still studying the exhibit.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Dr. Landon, who, having
    done all he could for his patient, turned to the young detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain sure&#8221; admitted Carlisle, &ldquo;but
    look at that rib. Isn&rsquo;t it just over where his heart would have been,
    and isn&rsquo;t it chipped&mdash;quite a bit gouged out? Well, how about
    a dagger or a bullet having made that break?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Landon rather indifferently. &ldquo;But
    it&rsquo;s impossible to tell at this late date. That man has been dead a
    good many years, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; asked Carleton, suddenly alert.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not a detective,&rdquo; the
    doctor said carelessly. &ldquo;Of course, a skeleton isn&rsquo;t the novelty
    to me that it probably is to the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;&lsquo;Rattle his bones,&rsquo;&rdquo; chanted Randall, &ldquo;&lsquo;over
    the stones; He&rsquo;s only a pauper whom nobody owns.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But why say you murdered him, Mr. Carleton?&rdquo;  asked
    Z&eacute;lie, who was sitting next her host and leaning over to look up in
    his face. &ldquo;You never killed anybody, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The girl was beautiful, always especially so when exhilarated
    by excitement or enthusiasm.</p>
  <p align="left">Her black hair was short and curled, except where it was drawn
    into a soft loose knot at the back of her neck.</p>
  <p align="left">Her black eyes were restless and scintillant, and her lovely
    lips, though artificially reddened, were mischievously luring.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet there was an earnest note in her voice, and Carlisle turned
    quickly to hear Carleton&rsquo;s reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Z&eacute;lie, no&mdash;I never murdered anybody,&rdquo;  returned
    Carleton slowly. &ldquo;Whoever sent that thing had a distorted idea of making
    a joke, a holiday joke. You know New Year&rsquo;s Eve is supposed to license
    all sorts of hoodlum performances. Pretty poor taste, I think, but, after
    all, there&rsquo;s no real harm in it. The sender probably bought the bones
    from some down-and-out medico, glad to sell his equipment. It isn&rsquo;t
    a first-class skeleton, is it, Landon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the doctor, &ldquo;yet it has a
    certain monetary value. It was put together a long time ago. Articulation
    is better done nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What shall you do with it?&rdquo; asked Nan Mortlake,
    looking at the uncanny thing with a shudder.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know,&rdquo; echoed Miss
    Violet. &ldquo;If it stays in this house I shan&rsquo;t sleep a wink all
    night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Violet,&rdquo; cried Polly, laughing,  &ldquo;he
    can&rsquo;t hurt you. You see he&rsquo;s so very, very dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; persisted the old
    lady.  &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sleep in the house with that thing in it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; asked Pauline amusedly.</p>
  <p align="left">Violet&rsquo;s fine old face showed determination.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go somewhere!&rdquo; she declared: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    go into the other house. Mrs. Mortlake will take me in for the night&mdash;I
    know she will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; Nan Mortlake said, but the most
    casual listener could have noted she did not favor the idea.</p>
  <p align="left">There are some women who hate to have a chance guest for overnight.
    It upsets their housekeeping routine, or interferes with some of their plans.
    Others, born hospitable, welcome any stray visitor and deem it no trouble
    at all to look after one.</p>
  <p align="left">And Miss Violet had the intuition to read Mrs. Mortlake aright,
    but so positive was she in her determination not to spend the night beneath
    the same roof as the skeleton, she merely nodded her thanks and seemed to
    consider the question settled.</p>
  <p align="left">Not so Pauline.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an idiot,&rdquo; she exclaimed to her
    sister-in-law; &ldquo;you are too silly. Why, we all have skeletons&mdash;you
    have yourself! Why object to another merely because his bones haven&rsquo;t
    as much flesh on them as ours have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he frighten you, Polly?&rdquo; Violet
    asked in an awed whisper.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Frighten me! I should say not! Why, I&rsquo;m growing
    really fond of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She stepped to the long box, and taking the jointed arm in
    her hands, endeavored to place it round her neck.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stop, Polly!&rdquo; cried her husband. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    going too far. Violet is silly to be afraid of the thing, but you&rsquo;re
    worse to play with it like that! I say, Landon, can&rsquo;t you take it home
    with you? It&rsquo;s right in line with your belongings, and you&rsquo;re
    welcome to it. You can use it in your business, or you can sell it or give
    it away. Do relieve me of the gentleman&rsquo;s unwanted presence.</p>
  <p align="left">But the doctor smilingly declined to burden himself with any
    more anatomical specimens and laughed at Miss Violet&rsquo;s foolishness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have it,&rdquo; said Professor Scott,
    gazing at the yellowed bones. &ldquo;If you really don&rsquo;t want it, Manning,
    I&rsquo;ll be glad to accept it&mdash;as a gift. I can&rsquo;t afford to
    pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No charge,&rdquo; Carleton said, looking greatly relieved. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    more than welcome to his lordship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you must take it to-night,&rdquo; stipulated Violet. &ldquo;I
    will not remain in the house with that thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, now, I can&rsquo;t take it to-night,&rdquo; Scott
    protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get proper cartmen and send for it the first
    thing to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; and Miss Carleton looked
    her displeasure. &ldquo;Unless I go to spend the night in the other house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Mortlake did not rise to this bait, and, paying no attention
    to it, she made some animated remark to Donald Randall which he had perforce
    to answer.</p>
  <p align="left">The doctor, too, made no helpful suggestion regarding the disposal
    of the unwelcome guest, and, greatly amused at the situation, Kenneth Carlisle
    threw himself into the breach.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell you what, folks,&rdquo; he said, in his good-natured
    way, &ldquo;Brother Bones really seems to be The Unwanted. Now, if it will
    meet with unanimous approval, I will take the unwelcome guest home with me
    and keep him there until it is convenient for Professor Scott to send for
    him. In that way the professor can arrange for a proper reception, get a
    room and bath ready for him, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Randall. &ldquo;You have cut
    the Gordian knot! But how will you manage it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; said Kenneth, &ldquo;because it
    is New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Otherwise there might be lions in the path. But
    on this one night of the year, the police are lenient, jovial citizens do
    pretty much as they like, and eccentric performances go unnoticed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course they do,&rdquo; put in Z&eacute;lie. &ldquo;You
    can get away with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Violet. &ldquo;Thank
    you, Mr. Carlisle. I am deeply indebted to you. If you will assure me that
    you will do as you have suggested and will promise to remove the dreadful
    thing shortly, I will now ask to be excused and will retire. I am exhausted
    by this unfortunate episode, and I frankly admit I am in need of rest and
    quietude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-night, Miss Violet,&rdquo; said Dr. Landon, taking
    her hand. &ldquo;I think you are wise to go to rest, but I can assure you
    and your friends you are in no way suffering from nervousness or exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good for you, Doctor!&rdquo; Pauline exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    glad of that assurance from you. Otherwise we would all be called up at intervals
    through the night to administer spirits of ammonia or aspirin or something
    to the victim of shattered nerves.</p>
  <p align="left">Polly&rsquo;s tone was good-natured and her manner gay, but
    it was plain to be seen she meant what she said, and Carlisle, who was studying
    the crowd with interest, concluded the old lady was a bit of a hypochondriac.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet said her good-nights, evidently trying to enact
    the r&ocirc;le of one suffering from shock but only succeeding in looking
    like a baffled and chagrined lady of indomitable courage and great strength.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How are you going to manage the thing?&rdquo; Dr. Landon
    asked of Carlisle.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are two ways,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;One
    is to dress him up in a full costume&mdash;woman&rsquo;s dress, for choice&mdash;and
    then load him into a taxi with me as if he&mdash;or she&mdash;had celebrated
    the New Year a bit too well. The other way is to leave him in his box and
    boldly take it home and into the house on the chance that nobody will prove
    too inquisitive. Which do you advise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At that everybody expressed an opinion in favor of one or other
    of the stated plans, and also proposed other methods.</p>
  <p align="left">At last, however, Carlisle, who had, in fact, paid no attention
    to any advice but the doctor&rsquo;s, decided to take the box with its contents
    along with him. He telephoned to his faithful valet to be on the job and
    await his coming.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be getting on,&rdquo; Carlisle said, &ldquo;for
    it&rsquo;s after half-past one, and the crowds in the street are beginning
    to thin out. The more noise and racket there is, the better for my purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go now, too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mortlake,
    rising and beginning to say her good-nights.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stay overnight, Professor Scott,&rdquo;  said
    Pauline hospitably. &ldquo;You live so far uptown, it&rsquo;s a long ride,
    and you can fit right into Claude&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The old man gratefully accepted the invitation, and, at a nod
    from Pauline, Emily Austen left the room to see about household arrangements.</p>
  <p align="left">Though ostensibly Pauline&rsquo;s social secretary, Emily was
    willing to assist in some of the lighter details of the domestic routine.
    She often arranged flowers or looked after the appointments of a guest room.</p>
  <p align="left">Calling a chambermaid, she went to Claude&rsquo;s room and
    was dismayed to find them in a state of turmoil.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought he
    was all packed and ready to start. He must have done a lot of packing at
    the last minute. Hester, you can&rsquo;t do it all. Get Louis to help you,
    and don&rsquo;t bother much with the papers and such things. Just stuff them
    into the desk drawers and make the rooms decent for Professor Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Louis was the valet, and a most efficient sort. With Hester
    to assist, the rooms were soon arranged, and Emily went back downstairs to
    find the long box, in the hall, closed and ready to move, and the party in
    the drawing room sitting around in rather quiet mood.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Waiting for the taxi,&rdquo; Peter Gregg told her, as
    he made room for her by his side on the sofa.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;re ever going to manage
    it,&rdquo; Z&eacute;lie said, for the dozenth time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It will manage itself,&rdquo; Carlisle said with his
    kindly smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t apprehend any trouble at all, but if any
    arises I&rsquo;ll tackle it when it comes. Why cross your bridges before
    the construction company has finished with them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish Claude were here to see you start off,&rdquo;  Polly
    said, laughing. &ldquo;He would be amused!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s well on his way to Hollywood,&rdquo; Kenneth
    said, looking a trifle envious. &ldquo;It has its points&mdash;has Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whatever possessed Claude to go in for that sort of
    thing?&rdquo; asked Professor Scott. &ldquo;The last thing I&rsquo;d ever
    dream of his taking up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; Polly warned him. &ldquo;Mr. Carlisle
    is an ex-Hollywooder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no offence meant, and I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Carlisle
    will hunt round for any. But for Claude, brought up in the lap of luxury,
    to go off like that&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Suppose the lap of luxury objected to holding him any
    longer,&rdquo; said Pauline, with a shade of bitterness in her tone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oho, is that it?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Mortlake. &ldquo;Well,
    I wondered!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fly off at a tangent, madam,&rdquo; Manning
    Carleton said in his most sarcastic way. &ldquo;Sometimes young birds fly
    the coop, disdaining the luxury provided for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He went off happily enough,&rdquo; Nan Mortlake pursued,
    as if determined to get at the root of the matter.</p>
  <p align="left">But nobody enlightened her further, and Manning Carleton deliberately
    changed the subject.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a private investigator, Mr. Carlisle?&rdquo; he
    said, with deference in his tone rather than criticism.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Carleton, though in my acquaintance with your
    son we harped back to my screen activities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Activities is doubtless a well chosen word, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, there was little tame or monotonous in the
    life as I knew it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what do you think of my son&rsquo;s prospects of
    success?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They seem to me very good. Claude is a lovable chap,
    light hearted and merry minded. That sort takes well out there. Moreover,
    he is clever and ingenious; those, too, are assets. Altogether, if he cultivates
    patience and perseverance, he will come out on top.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose you know you have mentioned the two qualities
    in which my boy is absolutely lacking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, not as bad as that. He can cultivate them a bit,
    but he certainly has something to start with. Well, I hear my taxi rumbling
    outside. Now, if your able-bodied butler and his helpful footman will give
    me a lift, I&rsquo;ll be on my way. I feel sure that to start out openly
    from a place like this is to disarm undue curiosity at the fountainhead.
    Goodnight, Mr. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-night, Carlisle. Come to see us soon and tell us
    how you got on with this proposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As Kenneth had assumed, the very fact of his leaving the big
    house so openly, making no secret of his strange burden, went far to disarm
    all suspicion on the part of the taxi driver or of any passing policeman
    or curious wayfarer.</p>
  <p align="left">With the help of Fenn and Martin the box was hoisted into the
    cab, Carlisle tucked himself in, and they set off.</p>
  <p align="left">Carter, his own devoted slave, met him at his home, and though
    it was a large apartment house, the doings of the detective were never questioned,
    and the oddly shaped box was taken up in the service elevator without comment
    or criticism.</p>
  <p align="left">Down in the Fifth Avenue house Manning Carleton and his wife
    said good-night to the two guests from the other house, and they went down
    the steps of the Carlisle mansion and up the steps of their own home.</p>
  <p align="left">The professor and Don Randall said good-night and went to their
    rooms. The two secretaries effaced themselves. Pauline and Z&eacute;lie,
    yawning, went off to bed, and, like one who treads alone the banquet hall
    deserted, Manning Carlisle kept solitary vigil for a time.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</a><br>The Tragedy Discovered</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">IN the country a house shut up for the night is a solemn proposition.
    Every window is examined as to its fastenings, every outside door is locked
    and bolted, and often various and sundry inside doors are also locked between
    rooms and halls.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, from the early closing hour until time to rise the next
    morning, there is no sign of life, no sound of moving humanity, nothing but
    black darkness and silence.</p>
  <p align="left">In the city it is different. There is little locking up to
    do. The front door is always fastened, the windows, most of them, likewise.
    Certain ones are used for ventilation, but the great ornate windows that
    disfigure the old-fashioned brownstone fronts are seldom if ever opened,
    and when the basement entrance and the area door are locked there is little
    else to do in the barricading line.</p>
  <p align="left">Also, the atmosphere inside the house is different. It is not
    unusual for people to move around the rooms, or to go up and down stairs
    at any hour. Whereas in the country this would bring about a frantic hopping
    out of bed, and opening of bedroom doors, and cries of &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    the matter? Is anybody ill?&rdquo; in the city, it is part of the natural
    routine, and nobody pays any attention to it.</p>
  <p align="left">All of which is respectfully submitted to show why no one in
    the Carleton house was disturbed or surprised at hearing various and sundry
    footsteps and voices off and on throughout the night.</p>
  <p align="left">It was about three o&rsquo;clock when Manning Carleton was
    left downstairs alone save for a few of the servants.</p>
  <p align="left">He went at once to his library, a front room across the hall
    from the drawing room.</p>
  <p align="left">A beautiful room it was, in the fashion of an older day.</p>
  <p align="left">But heavy cornices and massive woodwork are not quite so anomalous
    in a library, where the very books themselves are oldtimers, as in a living
    room.</p>
  <p align="left">And the Carleton library was in no sense a living room. It
    was not used, as a library often is, as a family gathering place, for the
    simple reason that the family declined to gather there.</p>
  <p align="left">The family, outside of the master of the house, seldom read,
    and if they did they would never choose a tome from those old shelves.</p>
  <p align="left">So it had become more and more the exclusive haunt of Manning
    Carleton, to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline had her own charming boudoir, back of the living room.
    Claude adopted for himself the cosy smoking room back of the library and
    separated from it by a cloakroom and lavatory.</p>
  <p align="left">Back of the smoking room was a good-sized office where Peter
    Gregg led his secretarial existence, and back of that again was a pleasant
    sunny little room devoted to the social correspondence of Mrs. Carleton as
    manipulated by the deft fingers of Emily Austen.</p>
  <p align="left">Opposite these two secretaries&rsquo; rooms and across a hall
    was the dining room, and, save for a pantry or two, the rest of the domestic
    and culinary offices were in the basement.</p>
  <p align="left">A big, comfortable home, worn smooth by the family life of
    four generations of Carletons, and standing firm on its old-fashioned foundations,
    though threatened now and then by fretful outbursts on the part of Pauline
    or Claude.</p>
  <p align="left">But Manning Carleton paid no attention to the advice and criticism
    of good-natured, easy-going Claude, and as for his wife, he knew when he
    married her she would behave like that, and he lent no serious ear to her
    pleas for a duplex apartment with penthouse and terraces.</p>
  <p align="left">Selfish, Manning Carleton was, in that he would have his own
    way. But, unless it interfered with his way, everyone else was welcome to
    his or her own way, and there was little if any friction in the family.</p>
  <p align="left">The other member, Miss Violet Carleton, was, like her brother, &ldquo;set
    in her ways,&rdquo; but her ways were usually for the interest and comfort
    of the household, and though what is known as strongminded, her strong mind
    was shrewd and well balanced.</p>
  <p align="left">With a few exceptions&mdash;one being a dread of anything gruesome
    or ghastly. The appearance of the skeleton had really thrown her into a nervous
    state of mind, which she was now trying hard to overcome as she sat in her
    pleasant little sitting room which adjoined her larger bedroom.</p>
  <p align="left">She had sat there ever since she left the drawing room, on
    the promise of Kenneth Carlisle to take the bony horror away from the house
    that night. And now her worry was a fear that he had not done so. She knew
    the guests had gone home or gone to bed, and she determined to go down to
    the drawing room and see for herself that the awful thing was not there.</p>
  <p align="left">But as she opened her door to the hall she saw Professor Scott
    going down the wide stairway. He was fully dressed, and the hall lights were
    still on full, so Miss Violet knew Fenn must still be about.</p>
  <p align="left">She concluded to wait a bit and returned to her rooms, where
    she took off her evening gown and donned a comfortable n&eacute;glig&eacute;.
    She had never had a personal maid and didn&rsquo;t want one, though the services
    of Polly&rsquo;s French Nadine were at her disposal when required.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott went slowly down the stairs, not knowing he
    had been observed. He moved with some apparent hesitation, and reaching the
    lower hall, looked into the now empty drawing room. Fenn came to him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can I do anything for you, sir?&rdquo; he asked deferentially
    but with a curious glance at the old man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no&mdash;oh, no,&rdquo; was the stammered reply.  &ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re
    still around, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn stiffened a little.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;m cleaning up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, yes. Do you have to do that overnight? Now, I should
    think that the morning&mdash;er, the morning, you know&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn began to feel sorry for him. He had always thought the
    old man a little dotty, and just now he looked it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I do some things, sir. Empty the stale ash trays;
    take away used glasses or plates; pick up the bags and scarfs the ladies
    leave around. Not brushing up or dusting, you know&mdash;that lays over for
    to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. I see. Well, Fenn, where is Mr. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his library, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can I see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;m afraid not. You see, it&rsquo;s
    the rule, when Mr. Carleton locks himself in, he&rsquo;s not to be interrupted
    or spoken to by anybody. Better wait till morning, sir. Anything urgent,
    may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes. Urgent, yes, exactly that. Now, shall
    I knock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for me to say, sir. But I don&rsquo;t
    think he will answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A little timidly the old man tapped at the heavy closed door
    of the library.</p>
  <p align="left">There was no response, and though the professor put his ear
    to the panel he could hear no sound.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you hear anything, Fenn?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p align="left">With an apologetic but obedient air the butler listened a moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I hear his pen a-scratchin&rsquo;,
    sir. But he won&rsquo;t answer. He&rsquo;s like that most nights. Writin&rsquo; or
    readin&rsquo; and answerin&rsquo; no knocks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Scott, annoyed now. &ldquo;He
    must answer. Manning, Manning,&rdquo; he called out, rapping a little more
    loudly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Scott, Let me in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not to-night, old man,&rdquo; came Carleton&rsquo;s
    voice, pleasant enough but decided. &ldquo;See you to-morrow morning. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott was decidedly upset. He was not accustomed
    to being treated like that.</p>
  <p align="left">He gave the unmoved door a scowl of indignation, and muttering
    some unintelligible but seemingly threatening words he moved off in the direction
    of the stairs. As he mounted the steps, his footfalls muted by the soft velvet
    carpet, the chimes of the hall clock rang out the quarter after three.</p>
  <p align="left">Violet Carleton, watching, saw the old man reach the top stair
    and turn in to the corridor that led to Claude&rsquo;s apartments, which
    Scott was occupying for the night.</p>
  <p align="left">The second floor of the Carleton house was exceedingly attractive.
    It had really more floor space than there was below, for less area was devoted
    to the great front hall, and the various suites were spacious and beautifully
    appointed.</p>
  <p align="left">More guest rooms on the third floor gave ample accommodations
    for all, and as low lights burned in all the halls and corridors one could
    go about with ease, though, incidentally, there were shadowy nooks and partly
    screened alcoves where one might dodge another, if desired.</p>
  <p align="left">It was in one of these curtained alcoves that Violet waited
    for the return of Professor Scott.</p>
  <p align="left">Then she went downstairs.</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn, just about to turn out the hall lights, paused at her
    appearance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Fenn,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;go on to bed
    now. I&rsquo;ll turn off the lights when I go up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very good, ma&rsquo;am. Good-night, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and
    the butler disappeared.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet turned into the drawing room, and to her great
    relief saw no disturbing sight.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then Mr. Carlisle took it,&rdquo; she said to herself,
    nodding her satisfaction.</p>
  <p align="left">She looked about the impressive if oppressive room and threw
    herself into one of the big easy chairs.</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn had put the smoking equipment in perfect order, so that
    the sight of a cigarette ready to hand impelled her to light one and take
    a few meditative whiffs.</p>
  <p align="left">Subconsciously she heard low voices in the library, but her
    brother&rsquo;s affairs had no interest for her, and she only looked up with
    a mildly questioning glance when Donald Randall sauntered into the drawing
    room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thought I smelled smoke,&rdquo; he smiled, speaking
    low, as seemed natural in a closed house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you were afraid the house was on fire and you came
    to help put it out?&rdquo; rejoined Miss Violet, with fine sarcasm. &ldquo;No,
    laddie, you thought&mdash;you hoped it was Polly who was having a goodnight
    cigarette here, and&mdash;you hoped she was alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mind reader!&rdquo; exclaimed Randall. &ldquo;And pretty
    good at it. Where is her ladyship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gone to bed, of course. And now, I&rsquo;m going. As
    I&rsquo;ve no doubt your secondary errand down on this floor is to imbibe
    a cheering draught, don&rsquo;t let me stand in your way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With a good-natured smile and a kindly pat on his broad shoulder,
    Miss Violet left him and started upstairs.</p>
  <p align="left">She reached the top, and, hearing a slight noise, stepped aside
    into the sheltering folds of a curtain that draped an arch in the hallway.</p>
  <p align="left">She saw Z&eacute;lie, robed in a transparent and bewitching
    n&eacute;glig&eacute;, go slowly and gracefully down the staircase.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet nodded her wise old head and drew down the corners
    of her cynical old mouth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wakeful! Going down to get a book!&rdquo; she chuckled.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    they always do it! Z&eacute;lie is running true to form. But she won&rsquo;t
    make any headway with young Randall. He&rsquo;s over head and ears in love
    with Polly, who doesn&rsquo;t care a picayune for him. Yes, she&rsquo;s heading
    for the boudoir. Wonder if Randall will play up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She hung over the banister, watching, and was rewarded by seeing
    Randall come from the dining room, where he had doubtless achieved his cheering
    draught, and paused at the door of Pauline&rsquo;s boudoir.</p>
  <p align="left">She could see no more, but she chuckled again at the thought
    of the man&rsquo;s disappointment at finding Z&eacute;lie there instead of
    Polly.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet Z&eacute;lie, in that enticing robe and in adventurous
    mood, could hold him for a while, the wicked old lady concluded, and seeing
    no further amusement toward, she went to bed, safe and content in her knowledge
    that no fleshless skeletons were under the Carleton roof.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What are you doing prowling about the place?&rdquo;  Randall
    inquired as he sat down beside Z&eacute;lie on the chaise longue.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I came down for a book I left here this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, you did! Produce the volume!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; and the girl looked about. &ldquo;I
    say, Don, who sent that horrible skeleton thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t know. Some crony, or more likely
    enemy of the old man&rsquo;s. Beastly thing to do. With his dizzy heart he
    might have gone straight to glory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That would have been nice for you and Polly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ye-ah?&rdquo; Randall smoked on in silence.</p>
  <p align="left">After a moment he said slowly, &ldquo;Just what did you mean
    by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly cryptic,&rdquo; Z&eacute;lie
    smiled at him. &ldquo;If an all-wise Providence should see fit to remove
    Manning Carleton to a higher sphere of usefulness, you and Polly could, perhaps,
    comfort and console each other in your mutual loss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why the mutual? Carleton doesn&rsquo;t crowd any of
    my hours with glorious life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No? But who&rsquo;s talking? I hear voices.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Voices of the night? Well, if you&rsquo;re really curious,
    I can tell you; I think. As I came out of the dining room, I heard those
    two precious secretaries hobnobbing in one of the rooms opposite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, those are the secretaries&rsquo; rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Their offices?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Though Miss Austen&rsquo;s is rather dressy for
    an office. Gregg&rsquo;s is more orthodox.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Miss Austen is social secretary to a very dressy
    lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Z&eacute;lie frankly yawned. &ldquo;I see
    you&rsquo;re in no mood for a flirtation, so I shan&rsquo;t make any attempt.
    I wish Claude was home. Not a man in the house but two old fossils and the
    already bespoke secretary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought you liked to flirt with Manning, and now you&rsquo;re
    calling him names.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do like him, but&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s locked in his study, and&mdash;oho, that&rsquo;s
    what you came downstairs for! All dressed up like a film queen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! I wish you&rsquo;d keep out of
    things. Go back upstairs, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, after I get a nightcap. Have something?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, thanks. Why don&rsquo;t you ask Gregg to join you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want him. Good-night, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He brushed her cheek lightly with a butterfly kiss and went
    out of the room.</p>
  <p align="left">He listened a moment at the door of Miss Austen&rsquo;s room
    and heard the low murmur of voices, then went on to the dining room.</p>
  <p align="left">An hour or so later, the noises in the street had become stilled;
    the holiday revelers, wearied by their boisterous activities, had sought
    their homes, or other shelter, and save for an occasional popgun or raucous
    rattle the celebration of the advent of the New Year was already a thing
    of the past.</p>
  <p align="left">Comparative quiet had also settled on the shadowy spaces of
    the Carleton mansion.</p>
  <p align="left">The only continuous sounds were the ticking of the great hall
    clock and the chiming of its quarter hours.</p>
  <p align="left">But any one near enough to the door of the library could have
    heard a repeated tapping on its sturdy old panels.</p>
  <p align="left">For outside that closed portal Pauline stood, her bare feet
    thrust into silken mules, her Oriental kimono held about her slender form,
    her knuckles already red and bruised as she pounded again and again on the
    insensate wood.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let me in! Manning!&rdquo; she cried, and her voice
    rose to a higher wail. &ldquo;Open the door! You must let me come in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But there was no response to her pleas, even though a barely
    perceptible crack at the sill showed a faint gleam of light beneath it.</p>
  <p align="left">Again she called, and, as might have been expected, her voice
    was heard in the upper rooms, and one after another doors were opened.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Pauline, what are you doing?&rdquo; cried
    the irate tones of Miss Violet, while Don Randall&rsquo;s heavy footsteps
    came thumping down the stairs.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I want to get in here,&rdquo; Pauline declared. &ldquo;Make
    him let me in, Don.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How can I, dear? If he won&rsquo;t open the door, he
    won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then he can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Pauline, her voice
    suddenly tragic and hollow.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pooh! Of course he can, but he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Violet
    stated. &ldquo;You know how stubborn he is, and if he&rsquo;s made up his
    mind not to speak, nobody can make him speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Pauline persisted, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
    that this time. He&rsquo;s had a heart attack or something. Where&rsquo;s
    Fenn? Get him, somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The butler, who had a way of turning up when wanted, came from
    the back of the house. He had pulled on his trousers and wore an old dressing
    gown, but he seemed aware of no incongruity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is it, Miss Polly?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What
    you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Get in that room, Fenn. I don&rsquo;t care how you do
    it, but get in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m. But I&rsquo;ll have to think a minute,
    ma&rsquo;am. You see, that ain&rsquo;t a room we can break in&mdash;no, not
    exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course you can break in,&rdquo; declared Randall.  &ldquo;Why,
    Fenn, you and I together can smash that door right through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, but why do it? Why not try a window or the
    like of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I say so,&rdquo; agreed Professor Scott, who had slowly
    negotiated the stairs. &ldquo;You know, in detective stories they always
    smash in the great massive doors and never think of breaking a windowpane!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; Randall assented, &ldquo;make
    for a window. Only the two front ones, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and Fenn unfastened the front door
    and flung it open.</p>
  <p align="left">The cold fresh air of the early morning was frosty and damp,
    and the women scurried back to warmth.</p>
  <p align="left">Z&eacute;lie had joined them, her great dark eyes wide with
    wonder, but asking no questions. Z&eacute;lie seldom asked questions, she
    gathered facts from what she saw and heard.</p>
  <p align="left">In a moment Randall had jumped from the stone rail of the front
    steps over the balustrade of the balcony that held the two library windows
    and tried to peer inside.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see a thing,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Both
    shades down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have to break the window,&rdquo; Professor Scott said
    in his decided way, but another voice made itself heard, and Peter Gregg
    said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No need to break the glass. Fenn, get a strong thin-bladed
    knife from your pantry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and Fenn disappeared.</p>
  <p align="left">Before he returned they heard the sound of a window above being
    hastily raised.</p>
  <p align="left">Randall, Gregg, and the Professor all turned their faces upward
    and saw that it was not a window in the Carleton home but in the other house.</p>
  <p align="left">Jack Mortlake stuck his head out and shouted:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on down there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get in the library,&rdquo; Gregg
    told him. &ldquo;We think Mr. Carleton may be ill or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Want any help?&rdquo; asked Mortlake, without, however,
    much enthusiasm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Randall, resenting the half-hearted
    offer. &ldquo;We have enough men here to take care of the situation. Go back
    to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Guess I will,&rdquo; said the disinterested one.  &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; cried Emily Austen, who had
    wrapped herself in an afghan and stepped outside. &ldquo;Oh here comes Fenn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The butler brought the knife desired, but it proved to be of
    no avail, for the old window frames were tight fitting, and the fastenings
    were a trifle rusted.</p>
  <p align="left">Meantime the policeman on the beat appeared and inquired the
    reason for the disturbance.</p>
  <p align="left">He listened with interest to the chorus of answers and marched
    inside the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Better bust the door down,&rdquo; he said, at last.  &ldquo;But
    ain&rsquo;t there some other door, a lighter one, say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; Gregg told him. &ldquo;I should
    have thought of that. There&rsquo;s a door in the back of the library; it
    opens into a cloakroom and then on into the smoking room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The men filed through the front door, the secretary and the
    butler chagrined that they were so stupid, but the guests of the house paying
    little heed.</p>
  <p align="left">The door from the cloakroom into the library was locked on
    the library side, but it was a much smaller door than the hall entrance,
    and it soon gave way under pressure.</p>
  <p align="left">The policeman, whose name was Garvin, was first in the room,
    closely followed by Gregg and Randall.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott, bringing up the rear, gave one glance and
    hastily turned away without entering.</p>
  <p align="left">This left room for Fenn, who stepped inside just as he would
    have entered had everything been normal.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Guard the door, Fenn,&rdquo; warned Gregg. &ldquo;Keep
    the ladies out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For the scene was an awful one.</p>
  <p align="left">Manning Carleton, seated at his wide table-desk, had fallen
    in a limp crumpled heap, and no second glance was needed to know the man
    was dead.</p>
  <p align="left">His left arm lay stretched out on the desk, and this the policeman
    gingerly felt at the wrist.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; he said succinctly. &ldquo;Any of you men
    related to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they all said, and Gregg took it upon himself
    to mention their names.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Women folks?&rdquo; asked Garvin, then.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, several,&rdquo; Gregg told him. &ldquo;His wife,
    his sister, and a visitor. Also a lady secretary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll call the medical examiner and the Homicide
    Bureau. But, look here, you. How did the murderer get out, or is it suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</a><br>The Old Problem of the Locked Room</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">THOUGH a first-class patrolman, Officer Garvin was not especially
    shrewd or observant. Yet he watched with scarcely concealed interest for
    reactions to his question.</p>
  <p align="left">Gregg spoke first, looking very serious.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s puzzling me. But if it&rsquo;s
    suicide, where is the gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Those things are outside my work,&rdquo; Garvin said
    abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the Precinct Station.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Seems as if we ought to call Dr. Landon,&rdquo;  Randall
    said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the family physician, and he may be needed to look
    after the women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hysterical lot?&rdquo; asked Garvin casually.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not especially so, but&mdash;oh, well, it seems more
    orthodox.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Call him if you like. No harm in that. I&rsquo;ll get
    the police here. Don&rsquo;t touch anything in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then Garvin drew from his pocket a big folded handkerchief,
    shook it out, and in its folds gingerly picked up the French telephone by
    its receiver end.</p>
  <p align="left">He put through several swift messages and replaced the instrument.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an extension some place, I suppose?&rdquo; he
    asked, and Fenn nodded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, call your doctor, if you wish, but don&rsquo;t
    call anybody else just now. You, Fenn, you&rsquo;re the butler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Fenn replied, disinclined to show
    much deference to this blunt personage.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Had Mr. Carleton a valet? Where&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All the servants are still in their beds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Better root &rsquo;em out. Get the maids up, and the
    housekeeper, or whoever&rsquo;s in charge. The day has begun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn went away, and Garvin&rsquo;s eyes continued to rove round
    the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Had to break in,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
    get in without bustin&rsquo; the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Carleton often locked himself in here alone,&rdquo; offered
    Peter Gregg, with seeming resentment of the comment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure. But if he locked himself in here last night and
    shot himself, where did he hide his gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; exclaimed Donald Randall, with sudden
    excitement, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s one of those cases of a murder in a sealed
    room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who says it&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo; Garvin flung at him.  &ldquo;How
    do you get that way? What do you know about it, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing, nothing at all,&rdquo; Don said hastily. &ldquo;I
    guess I&rsquo;ll go and look after the ladies. Will they have to be interviewed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Garvin stared at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say they will,&rdquo; he declared grimly. &ldquo;Yes
    interviewed, and then some. Yes, go and look after them. If they&rsquo;re
    in their nighties, tell &rsquo;em to get dressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Randall went off, and Peter Gregg was left with the policeman.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You some sort of secretary?&rdquo; came the question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gregg replied uninterestedly. &ldquo;Private
    secretary to Mr. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Know much about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Plenty about his business affairs; little about his
    personal matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Any money troubles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should say not! He had money enough for all his needs
    and heaps more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Retired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heirs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wife, son, and sister. I suppose they&rsquo;re the principal
    heirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably. Now, look here, laddie. The inspector will
    be here in a jiffy, and I&rsquo;ll be set aside. Tell me, is there any secret
    way in and out of this room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peter Gregg said, but he said it after an
    instant&rsquo;s hesitation, said it slowly, uncertainly, as if&mdash;or so
    it seemed to Officer Garvin&mdash;he were not telling the truth.</p>
  <p align="left">Just then Dr. Landon appeared at the broken and splintered
    door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&#8212;Oh, my God!&rdquo; he cried out,
    as he saw his old friend and patient huddled in his desk chair.</p>
  <p align="left">He went to the tragic figure and with a light touch that disturbed
    nothing satisfied himself that life was extinct and immediately deduced the
    cause.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Shot through the heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and at
    very close range. Who did it? Oh, yes, of course!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, who did it, Doc?&rdquo; Garvin asked eagerly,
    but Dr. Landon stared at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When the inquiry
    begins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was a pause, and then: &ldquo;I can do nothing here,&rdquo; Dr.
    Landon said, breaking the silence that had fallen on his last words.  &ldquo;Where
    is Mrs. Carleton? And Miss Carleton? I must see them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He went away, but Peter Gregg remained.</p>
  <p align="left">Like Garvin, he let his eyes roam round the room.</p>
  <p align="left">But as he looked there was a noise in the hall, and round through
    the smoking room and cloak room, into the library came the men from Headquarters.</p>
  <p align="left">The dapper medical examiner, Dr. Doane, and the more stalwart
    Inspector Gilbert came in together, and Doane went straight to the dead man
    and began his work without a word.</p>
  <p align="left">He carried a little black bag, which he now opened and placed
    on the desk.</p>
  <p align="left">There was plenty of room, for Manning Carleton&rsquo;s desk
    was a long and wide mahogany affair with a flat, roomy top.</p>
  <p align="left">A plain-clothes detective, accompanying the inspector, also
    carried a little black bag.</p>
  <p align="left">But his was of the sort known as &ldquo;Murder Bags,&rdquo;  or,
    more technically, &ldquo;Practical Criminal Science Outfit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The equipment of these bags is interesting, containing, as
    they do, saws, scissors, rubber gloves, chisels, trouble finders, magnifying
    glass, tape measure, test tubes, vacuum gun, black and white powders, paper,
    twine, notebook, crayons, and tweezers.</p>
  <p align="left">They are supposed to hold everything immediately essential
    to the solving of a murder mystery.</p>
  <p align="left">But it is in cases like the death of Manning Carleton that
    the Murder Bag breaks down. No test tubes or tweezers could indicate any
    way by which a murderer could have left that room locked behind him.</p>
  <p align="left">Nor, in the absence of a weapon, could suicide be predicated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Inspector Gilbert said cheerfully,  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    been confronted with this problem before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you always found the explanation?&rdquo; asked Gregg
    respectfully.</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert gave him a quick glance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Usually,&rdquo; he said, with a careless intonation
    that discouraged further remark on the subject.</p>
  <p align="left">Dr. Doane, still silent, worked at his own job, probing for
    the bullet, getting various data and now and then expressing astonishment
    by a quick intake of his breath or an instantly suppressed whistle.</p>
  <p align="left">Inspector Gilbert roamed about the big room.</p>
  <p align="left">The desk stood across the front end of the library, perhaps
    eight or ten feet from the front windows.</p>
  <p align="left">The desk chair was between the desk and the windows, so that
    one sitting in it faced the main part of the room and by turning on the swivel
    could see out into the hall if the hall door were open.</p>
  <p align="left">But that door was closed and locked. The front windows were
    still closed and locked and the dark shades drawn down.</p>
  <p align="left">There were several sets of curtains: net sash curtains next
    the panes; lace curtains down to the sills, inside the dark shades; long,
    elaborate lace curtains down to the floor, and over all these, heavy damask
    curtains, from ceiling to floor, with a massive lambrequin decoration across
    the tops.</p>
  <p align="left">The two windows were about three feet apart, and between them
    stood a low revolving bookcase.</p>
  <p align="left">Directly in front of this bookcase, then, was the desk chair
    where now was the body of the dead man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can do here,&rdquo; Dr. Doane announced
    at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send some mortuary people for the body when I
    learn the wishes of the family. Shall I see them now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your report?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing more definite than that he was shot by a gun
    held very close to his body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What sort of gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say exactly. But the bullet is small, about
    a twenty-eight caliber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How long&rsquo;s he been dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Between three and four hours, I should say. But that&rsquo;s
    problematical.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Killed about three or four o&rsquo;clock, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Something like that. We can&rsquo;t be exact, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know. Well, go on and see the family. I must give
    this place the once-over. Something tells me this case spells trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard detectives say that murder in a locked
    room is the easiest nut to crack of all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Those detectives were the nuts, then. And badly cracked.
    No, Doane, much water will flow over the Hudson Tunnel before we find out
    the truth about Manning Carleton&rsquo;s death. Could he have shot himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Offhand, I should say no, but until I can get him on
    an operating table, I can&rsquo;t answer that positively. But, supposing
    he could and did shoot himself he couldn&rsquo;t have hidden or disposed
    of the gun. Could it have been smuggled out of here before we came?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I think not. Garvin was here when the door was forced,
    and he is a watchful, reliable sort. Not brilliant, but alert and sharp eyed.
    I think he would have seen it if there had been any funny work. Well, I shan&rsquo;t
    hunt now for secret doors or concealed panels. I&rsquo;ll get what I can
    from the family first. Come on, we&rsquo;ll go together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Leaving two detectives in charge of the library and its still
    tenant, they went back through the cloakroom to the hall and crossed to the
    drawing room.</p>
  <p align="left">Only the men were there, the women having gathered in Polly&rsquo;s
    boudoir.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Please summon whoever is in authority here,&rdquo;  the
    inspector told Fenn, who, as always, appeared automatically.</p>
  <p align="left">The butler hesitated and then said uncertainly,  &ldquo;I suppose
    you want Mrs. Carleton and Miss Carleton, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You heard what I said,&rdquo; was the curt reply.</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn went off, and beyond impersonal nods none of the men in
    the drawing room acknowledged the advent of the two police authorities.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott favored them with a gaze in which were mingled
    curiosity and distaste, somewhat as if they were some new species of black
    beetle.</p>
  <p align="left">Donald Randall lighted a fresh cigarette and looked placidly
    out of the window. Peter Gregg had seemed to acquire a decided nervousness.
    Twice he essayed to speak and then swallowed his words.</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn returned with Pauline, Z&eacute;lie, and Miss Austen,
    and stalking after them with majestic dignity marched Violet Carleton.</p>
  <p align="left">But, though last, she was by no means least in any way. She
    selected the most throne-like chair, seated herself, and from this coign
    of vantage she scrutinized the two strangers.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; she said, not unaffably. &ldquo;Can
    you tell me who is the murderer of my brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not as yet, madam,&rdquo; returned Inspector Gilbert,
    with his politest air. &ldquo;But I trust after some investigation we shall
    be able to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He was relieved to find that the women of this household were
    not of a hysterical type.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Carleton looked as if she might be a Tartar, but Tartars
    were more gladly suffered than sniveling fools.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Carleton, the astute inspector noted, was what he sometimes
    called a handful. Yet handfuls could be handled more easily than Niobes.</p>
  <p align="left">The other two he disregarded for the moment, learning that
    these were his principals.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must ask you some questions, Mrs. Carleton,&rdquo;  he
    said, with a sympathetic glance at Pauline. &ldquo;It will, doubtless, be
    hard for you to answer them, but it must be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask me all you can, Inspector,&rdquo; said Violet briskly. &ldquo;My
    sister-in-law is more upset than I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Ignoring her suggestion, Gilbert addressed himself to Pauline.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why did you come downstairs and knock on the library
    door this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline gave him a slow, comprehensive glance.</p>
  <p align="left">He read it aright and flushed deeply. Her expression told him
    that she thought him too blunt, even boorish; that she was willing to reply
    politely to courteous queries, and that if he wanted to learn anything from
    her he would change his attitude and improve upon his manners.</p>
  <p align="left">Polly had a way of telling her thoughts without uttering a
    word, and Inspector Gilbert was nobody&rsquo;s fool.</p>
  <p align="left">He started afresh, in a more gentle tone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am told that you did do that, Mrs. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Inspector, I did. My husband frequently sat up
    late to read or write in his library, but I have never known him to sit up
    until five o&rsquo;clock, or nearly five. I woke at that time this morning
    and found he was not in his room, which adjoins mine. Naturally, I felt alarmed,
    and slipping on a kimono I ran downstairs to see if anything was the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why should you jump to the conclusion that something
    was the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Nearly everyone who knew Pauline Carleton had said at one time
    or another that her eyes were too big for her face.</p>
  <p align="left">This conviction was borne in upon Inspector Gilbert now, and
    though he made no audible remark he secretly writhed under the direct but
    enigmatical gaze she turned full upon him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; she murmured in a low tone, &ldquo;my
    husband is a victim of heart disease. He is&mdash;he was&mdash;liable to&mdash;to
    drop dead any moment, either with or without immediate cause. Therefore,
    when he was not in his bed, I wondered if he had&mdash;had an attack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; This pathetic statement did not seem to
    impress Gilbert too deeply, and Pauline looked at him in slight surprise.
    She was accustomed to have men follow her lead in moods.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you hear any sound from the library, Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, not a sound. But I could see a streak of light under
    the door, so I knew he must be there. He always turns off the light when
    he leaves the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Also, of course, the locked door proved he was still
    there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As this seemed to be a statement, not a query, Pauline made
    no reply.</p>
  <p align="left">The usual question was now imminent, but the inspector chose
    to word it in an unusual way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was your husband an enemy of anybody?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we all?&rdquo; countered Pauline. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
    everybody an enemy of someone? But I don&rsquo;t think my husband had an
    enemy desperate enough to take his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you his sole heir?&rdquo; asked Gilbert abruptly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; and
    the eyes grew too big again. &ldquo;No certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who are the others?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am not familiar with the terms of my husband&rsquo;s
    will, except that I know he provided bountifully for his sister, his son,
    and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is his son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His son, Mr. Claude Carleton, left last night for Hollywood,
    where he expects to become a screen actor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At what time did Mr. Claude Carleton leave New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think he took&mdash;what train was it, Don?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The two o&rsquo;clock on the Pennsylvania Railroad,&rdquo;  answered
    Randall, who was moodily listening to what he considered a baiting.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet the inspector was doing no more than his simple duty in
    making his inquiries.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ought he not to be recalled, in the circumstances?&rdquo; asked
    Gilbert.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He has been recalled,&rdquo; Polly told him tranquilly. &ldquo;We
    telegraphed to him on his train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where did you reach him?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell him, Don,&rdquo; Polly directed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I looked it up in the time-table,&rdquo; Randall said, &ldquo;and
    I found he would reach Harrisburg at seven-seventeen. It was a little after
    six, then, so I sent a wire to Harrisburg. Of course, we haven&rsquo;t heard
    from him yet, but I&rsquo;ve no doubt we will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were young Carleton and his father good friends?&rdquo; Gilbert
    turned back to Pauline.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Best in the world. We were a truly happy family. I am
    Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s second wife, and we were a devoted couple. His sister
    Miss Violet Carleton is the dearest and kindest sister-in-law I could wish
    for. Claude was an ideal son to his father and a good friend to me. I am
    sure my relatives and friends will corroborate these statements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline spoke simply and without undue emphasis.</p>
  <p align="left">Inspector Gilbert could find no family jar, no household friction
    to inquire about.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then it would seem,&rdquo; he resumed, after a moment&rsquo;s
    thought, &ldquo;that some enemy from outside must have done this dastardly
    crime. We are disregarding for the moment the curious conditions that make
    the deed such a mystery and conjecture only as to the personality of the
    murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is no doubt as to the personality of the murderer,&rdquo; Pauline
    stated calmly.</p>
  <p align="left">If she expected the inspector to fall off his chair at this,
    she must have been disappointed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have a suspicion, then?&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a suspicion: I know who did it, only I don&rsquo;t
    know who he is.&rdquo; The inspector refrained from smiling and said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I mean I don&rsquo;t know his name. But&mdash;oh, let
    somebody else tell you, please!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She leaned back in her chair, as if exhausted, and Don Randall
    went across the room to sit beside her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let me tell it,&rdquo; broke in Miss Violet, who was
    really aching to step into the limelight. &ldquo;You mean about&mdash;about
    the big box, Polly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Vi. You tell the inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Receiving a gracious permission, Violet launched into the story
    of the skeleton that had arrived the night before. She told the tale dramatically,
    and when she quoted the line, &ldquo;&lsquo;As I am now, you soon shall be,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
    seemed like a veritable Cassandra, pronouncing a doom.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you think, all of you,&rdquo; Gilbert asked slowly, &ldquo;that
    the sender of that gruesome gift, the writer of those lines, in some way
    managed to make good his threat and brought about the death of the man he
    threatened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Violet and Pauline.</p>
  <p align="left">Emily Austen preserved a discreet and modest silence, but Z&eacute;lie
    D&rsquo;Orsay spoke up hotly and cried, &ldquo;No, nothing of the sort!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott nodded his fine leonine head and said, &ldquo;I
    agree to that. Whoever sent that absurd gift did it for a joke, a holiday
    jest, and it meant nothing tragic or sinister. As proof of that, there was
    another line on the card, which Miss Carleton has evidently forgotten: I
    think it runs, &lsquo;Long years ago you murdered me.&rsquo; Now we all know
    Manning Carleton never murdered anybody. The thing was a hoax perpetrated
    by some college chum or business buddy. You all noticed it brought no embarrassment
    to Mr. Carleton, though some of the ladies were almost frightened by it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A very strange thing,&rdquo; said the inspector ruminatively.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not strange at all,&rdquo; growled Don Randall. &ldquo;A
    silly thing, and in rotten taste, but easily understandable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t agree with you, sir,&rdquo; the inspector
    said, looking as if he were getting into very deep waters. &ldquo;Now, were
    all of you people here last evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he was told.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Anybody else here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Randall, who had drifted into the r&ocirc;le
    of spokesman. &ldquo;Claude was here until shortly after one o&rsquo;clock,
    and two people from next door were here, Mr. and Mrs. Mortlake. Oh, yes,
    and Kenneth Carlisle, a sort of private detective, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you do well to believe it,&rdquo; the inspector
    informed him. &ldquo;That young man is looked up to by our Detective Bureau,
    and that is no small praise, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; said Randall, determined not
    to let the inspector beat him at nonchalance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; the inspector then said in a more kindly
    tone, &ldquo;you all would be the better for some breakfast. But first let
    me put one question, and then you may all go to the dining room. The medical
    examiner has decided that Mr. Carleton was shot between three and four o&rsquo;clock
    this morning. Say, approximately, half-past three. Will you each be good
    enough to state exactly where he or she was at that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Even the imperturbable inspector was startled at the varying
    expressions on the faces of his audience.</p>
  <p align="left">Violet spoke first.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I went up to bed rather earlier than the others,&rdquo; she
    said. &ldquo;I was in my room before half-past two. Of course, we were all
    up late, owing to the New Year festival.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I went to bed about three,&rdquo; Pauline stated clearly. &ldquo;I
    did not leave my room again until I went down at five o&rsquo;clock this
    morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I went up when Mrs. Carleton did,&rdquo; Z&eacute;lie
    declared. &ldquo;It was about three, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you, Miss Austen?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.</p>
  <p align="left">The girl colored painfully, and her voice trembled as she said, &ldquo;I,
    too, went up about that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; remarked Gilbert, but not aloud.</p>
  <p align="left">The men said they had all gone to bed about three o&rsquo;clock.
    Fenn was called in to testify as to this, and he said that he turned out
    the lights downstairs at quarter-past three, or very near that time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you then hear any sound from the library?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t listen specially. I saw the light under
    the door, so I knew the master was in there.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</a><br>Somebody Telephones Kenneth Carlisle</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">AS they all straggled out to the dining room, where a delightful
    breakfast awaited them, they took their seats in a general silence.</p>
  <p align="left">Each seemed busy with his own thoughts, and there was more
    an atmosphere of suppressed excitement than any exhibition of sorrow.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline, as always, sat at the head of the table, and Miss
    Violet marched herself down to the other end and took what had been her brother&rsquo;s
    seat.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I belong here now,&rdquo; she said a little curtly.  &ldquo;It
    is my place, not Claude&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She looked around as if expecting to hear objections, but none
    was made.</p>
  <p align="left">Whereupon she relapsed into silence, for her mind was busy
    trying to figure out why Fenn had told more or less of a falsehood about
    turning off the lights. To be sure, he had turned off the larger ones at
    that hour, but just then he had seen Miss Carleton come downstairs and had
    obeyed her order to go to bed himself and she would look after the other
    lights.</p>
  <p align="left">Could he be trying to screen her from the suspicious glances
    of the inspector?</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet Carleton did not want to be screened, and particularly
    not by a servant. She bridled at the thought of it and gave Fenn a withering
    glance which, fortunately, he did not see.</p>
  <p align="left">Meantime, the inspector, in the drawing room, was breakfasting
    sumptuously from a tray which had been sent him.</p>
  <p align="left">But though the viands were delicious they might have been sawdust
    and chips for all they meant to him. He was so engrossed in this problem
    that had been flung at him that he ate unconsciously, mechanically, his mind
    in a whirl.</p>
  <p align="left">When, then, he heard someone come in at the front door and
    looked up to see Kenneth Carlisle smiling at him, he drew a great sigh of
    relief.</p>
  <p align="left">Now he had someone to talk to, someone to discuss theories
    with.</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert quite appreciated this young man&rsquo;s cleverness
    and ingenuity of ideas, but he had small opinion of his police experience
    and determined to use him only as a consultant.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, how did you chance to blow in?&rdquo; he inquired,
    as Carlisle sat down near him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Somebody telephoned me to come. I don&rsquo;t know who
    called up, my man took the message. I supposed you gave the order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re
    here. Know all the details?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not one. Who&rsquo;s dead? Old man Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Shot in a locked and barred room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ve always wanted to horn in on a case of
    that kind! Forgive my seeming heartlessness, but&mdash;well, tell me the
    salient points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the salientest point. Mr. Carleton was
    alone in his library&mdash;well, we must assume he was alone&mdash;anyway,
    he shot himself or somebody shot him about three or four o&rsquo;clock this
    morning, and every door and window of the room was fastened on the inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gun there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Positively not. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Secret entrance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not observable on preliminary search. But we haven&rsquo;t
    made a real investigation yet. I&rsquo;ve two detectives guarding the place,
    but they&rsquo;re not to make the big hunt. I think you and I&rsquo;ll do
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Carlisle, looking boyishly
    excited.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No! now, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. Aren&rsquo;t you
    going to see the family, express sympathy, and all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course. I must do that. Say, young Carleton
    has gone to California.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know. They&rsquo;ve wired him to come back. Wait a
    minute. Before you go, tell me what you think of that skeleton business last
    night. And I understand you took the thing home with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did, and a darned nuisance it is. Takes up a lot of
    room, and it&rsquo;s an unpleasant visitor besides. But I took it to oblige
    that nice old fossil, Professor Scott. What about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know it had a threatening message on a card.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rubbish! It was a joke&mdash;a very poor one&mdash;carried
    out, I&rsquo;m sure, by some of Carleton&rsquo;s cronies. There are a lot
    of old graybeards in his Pantaloon Club who would think that sort of horseplay
    a scream. Manning Carleton wasn&rsquo;t much upset over it. Not nearly so
    much as his sister was. That&rsquo;s why I took the thing away, she carried
    on so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think the hand that wrote the message
    is the hand that dealt Carleton his death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, no, not as yet. But, Lord, man, I can&rsquo;t judge
    all of a suddint-like! Let me see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go and see the ladies first. Observe the amenities.
    You were a guest here last night, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Claude&rsquo;s guest. When will he get here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As soon as possible, I suppose. What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Claude? Temperamental, visionary, impulsive, ambitious,
    and a generally all-round amiable, lovable sort. Well, I&rsquo;ll clear out.
    Finish your breakfast, and I&rsquo;ll return anon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle suppressed his longing to go straight to the library
    and went instead to the dining room, where the ever ready Fenn had a place
    laid for him.</p>
  <p align="left">Being gifted in social speech and manner, the detective said
    just the right things in just the right way and cautiously watched the faces
    of his hearers for reactions.</p>
  <p align="left">He learned little, not greatly to his surprise, for he knew
    them all for a self-controlled, self-reliant crowd.</p>
  <p align="left">He soon gathered, however, that the consensus of opinion was
    toward the guilt of the one who had written the message saying, &ldquo;As
    I am now, you soon shall be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no problem,&rdquo; declared Pauline, &ldquo;as
    that silly inspector says there is. There&rsquo;s no doubt the man who sent
    the skeleton is the man who shot my husband. Now, all you have to do is to
    find that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You speak as if that were no stunt at all, Polly,&rdquo; said
    Randall, looking at her seriously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It ought not to be,&rdquo; she flashed back, &ldquo;for
    trained investigators. Don&rsquo;t they have all sorts of ways of tracking
    a man down? Clues, evidence, finger prints, handwriting&mdash;oh, they must
    be able to find out who sent a great box like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It does seem so,&rdquo; said Peter Gregg, who in the
    absence of his somewhat austere master was blossoming out in a breezy and
    loquacious manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Kenneth Carlisle could find him,
    blindfold and with both hands tied behind him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I might find him if he was bound and blindfold,&rdquo; Kenneth
    said, and Gregg looked annoyed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course, I meant if you were blindfold and bound,
    Mr. Carlisle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes? Well, you see, I never work that way. I want full
    use of all my faculties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Gregg subsided, but a slight scowl remaining on his face told
    Kenneth that he need expect little help from the secretary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, I take it,&rdquo; he went on calmly, &ldquo;that
    you want me to look for the joker man first. By the way, who telephoned for
    me to come here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was silence, and blank faces looked from one to another.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pauline said finally. &ldquo;I
    didn&rsquo;t, did you, Violet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was a man&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; Carlisle told them. &ldquo;Was
    it you, Fenn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; came the prompt reply, as the butler
    hovered nearer. &ldquo;No, sir. I don&rsquo;t know who called you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Carlisle gazed
    quickly but intently at each face. &ldquo;I should probably have been summoned
    by the police as having been here last evening. They&rsquo;ll want to get
    us all together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Pauline. &ldquo;Shall we
    have to have the Mortlakes in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably. But what harm? Now, look here, Mrs. Carleton
    and Miss Violet. Do you want me to look into this affair or not? I can&rsquo;t
    ask Claude until he gets here. And if I take the case definitely I want to
    get right at it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t give you any such authority,&rdquo;  Pauline
    said a little stiffly. &ldquo;Of course, now, Claude is master here. He will
    take his father&rsquo;s position and authority and will handle all his affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; and Violet Carleton shook her
    handsome old head. &ldquo;As my brother&rsquo;s sister, I have a decided
    standing in this family, and until the lawyer dictates otherwise I consider
    myself the supreme authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; and Pauline smiled, her eyes looking
    more than ever like great purple pansies. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t quarrel about
    that, Violet dear. You can have all the authority you want until Claude comes,
    and then he and you can settle matters between you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you no interest in your husband&rsquo;s affairs,
    Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo; asked Kenneth gently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, so far as they concern me. But his people are
    far more capable of looking after such things than I am. I have no business
    qualifications. My clever little secretary attends to all my accounts as
    well as my correspondence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth&rsquo;s heart began to warm toward Pauline. He had
    thought her a heartless, brainless doll. Now she seemed more human and was
    showing decided tact in her treatment of her sister-in-law.</p>
  <p align="left">And Violet was accepting the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Carlisle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do want
    you to take over this case. I do want to see the mystery of my brother&rsquo;s
    death cleared up. If he was murdered I want his slayer discovered and punished.
    If it should prove to be&mdash;suicide, then I want to know it. To me the
    thing is inexplicable. How could Manning be shot in a locked room? How could
    the murderer get away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is a problem, Miss Carleton,&rdquo; Kenneth agreed. &ldquo;The
    conditions are the framework of a favorite plot of the fiction writers, but
    it is seldom that such a curious case of the kind occurs in real life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; contributed Randall, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    read yarns like it. And always a silly or impossible explanation as a wind-up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are only three solutions to the problem,&rdquo;  Carlisle
    told them. &ldquo;One is&mdash;and the most obvious one&mdash;a secret entrance
    of some sort. Concealed door, sliding panel, hidden staircase in the wall,
    or some similar plan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing like that in this house,&rdquo;  Pauline
    declared. &ldquo;In old English castles they have those things, but not in
    an ordinary everyday American house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At this speech the watching detective caught a most peculiar
    expression flash across the face of Violet Carleton, and at the same time
    he noticed that the impeccable Fenn, who was serving him a cup of coffee,
    set it down with such a trembling hand that some of the fluid spilled over
    in the saucer.</p>
  <p align="left">The cup was instantly removed and a fresh one quickly substituted,
    but the detective had food for thought, and his thoughts ran to the pleasing
    conclusion that the Carleton library had or might have a secret entrance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Professor Scott egged him, &ldquo;you
    said three solutions, my boy. What are the other two?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One is a mechanical contrivance,&rdquo; Kenneth stated. &ldquo;I
    mean some piece of mechanism that fires the gun and so kills the victim.
    You remember, in <em>The Greene Murder Case</em>, one of the queue of victims gets
    his by means of a contraption that the brother and sister had between their
    two rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; Peter Gregg cried, &ldquo;and
    in <em>The Gray Room</em>, that corker by Phillpotts, the fatal bed is really a mechanical
    killer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;<em>The Bradmoor Murder</em>, by Melville Post, is the best of
    that type,&rdquo; the old professor said, &ldquo;and <em>The Jigsaw</em> is one of
    the finest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re past grand master in the field of detective
    stories, I see,&rdquo; Kenneth said, looking at the old man. &ldquo;Well,
    then you&rsquo;ll at once recognize the third solution used in the story
    books. That is, to have the deed accomplished after the locked door is burst
    open, the criminal getting away in the rush and excitement of the moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; assented Scott, &ldquo;and the best
    example of that is of course&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The classic and inimitable <em>Big Bow Mystery</em>,&rdquo; Kenneth
    said. &ldquo;A masterpiece!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; agreed Randall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    read that book over and over. Another with that solution is <em>The Wrong Letter</em>,
    but that falls down ethically, though it&rsquo;s a gorgeous yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, just how do these solutions fit our case?&rdquo; asked
    Peter Gregg.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Kenneth promptly replied, of no mind
    to give out a lead. &ldquo;Mrs. Carleton assures us there is no secret entrance
    to the library. We have found no trace or sign of a mechanical contrivance,
    and we are sure that the crime was not committed after the door was broken
    in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all true,&rdquo; Z&eacute;lie said, breaking
    her long silence, &ldquo;and so, where does it leave us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hello, when did you wake up?&rdquo; Randall chaffed
    her. &ldquo;I thought you had lost interest in our little problem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle was annoyed at Randall&rsquo;s light tone and his
    way of referring to the tragedy in the house, but as no one else seemed to
    take any exception to his manner he dismissed it from his mind.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It leaves us, Miss D&rsquo;Orsay,&rdquo; he answered
    her question, &ldquo;just where we started. At the same time, there must
    be an explanation of the strange conditions, a solution of the blank mystery,
    and if it is something contrived and carried out by a human mind, then a
    human mind can discover what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly the work of a human mind,&rdquo; Peter
    Gregg announced didactically. &ldquo;Nobody here believes in the occult or
    the supernatural. Do we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He looked round the table, and Carlisle was more and more surprised
    at his attitude. Last night at dinner he had been quiet, modest, and unassertive.
    Now he was outspoken, and, too, he bracketed himself with the others, as
    if all of one family.</p>
  <p align="left">No one answered him, however, regarding a belief in mysticism,
    and Kenneth again took up the inquiry.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did no one hear the shot?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
    know these old walls are thicker than those built nowadays, but with several
    people all over the house it would seem as if it might have been heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear any shot,&rdquo; Randall said finally,
    for Kenneth was looking directly at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I went up to bed about three or a little after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you were in bed at three-thirty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; was the response, but the speaker did not
    meet Kenneth&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">Also a tiny smile curled the corners of Z&eacute;lie&rsquo;s
    mouth, and Emily Austen stared at Randall with an expression that plainly
    bespoke unbelief.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you hear anything like a shot, Fenn?&rdquo; asked
    Kenneth suddenly turning to the butler.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; came the direct reply. &ldquo;That is,
    not to notice, sir. You see, all night the streets had been full of popping
    noises, cap pistols, rattles, and all those heathenish noise makers that
    they flourish on New Year&rsquo;s Eve and Election Night. Of course, they
    grew less and less after midnight, but when I went upstairs some stray ones
    were still popping, and so I couldn&rsquo;t say whether one of them was a
    shot in this house or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At what time did you go upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With Carlisle&rsquo;s eye upon him Fenn seemed unable to repeat
    what he had said before regarding this. He looked helplessly at Miss Carleton,
    who laughed outright at his uncertainty.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell the truth, Fenn,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or, no,
    I&rsquo;ll tell it for you. At quarter after three Fenn was turning out the
    hall lights when I came downstairs. He paused, and I told him to go along
    to bed, I would take care of the lights that were still on when I went back
    upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Miss Violet. And then you were downstairs&mdash;how
    long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About a quarter of an hour. I smoked a cigarette in
    the drawing room, and I went back upstairs as the hall clock chimed half-past
    three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you go downstairs for the purpose of smoking a cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, no, I didn&rsquo;t. I can smoke in my own sitting
    room. I went down, if I must confess to my foolish fears, to see, young man&mdash;to
    see if you had kept your promise of taking that beastly thing home with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The skeleton!&rdquo; said Kenneth, breaking into laughter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly. The skeleton. I know how forgetful young people
    are, and I had to be sure. When I was satisfied the thing was gone I just
    sat down and smoked as a sort of expression of relief. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. And now, Miss Carleton, think carefully. Did
    you hear any sound from the library while you were downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When I first went down and passed rather near the library
    door on my way to the drawing room, I think I heard low voices in the library.
    But if so, it made no impression on me, for so often my brother is there
    late at night, either alone or with someone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who else, for example?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, his secretary, or his friends, or some business
    man on an errand, or some one of his many agents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t listen at the door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly not. Not but what I would feel free to do
    so, if I wished, but I have no knowledge of my brother&rsquo;s affairs and
    consequently no interest in them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have no idea who could have written the note of
    warning or who sent the skeleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly have not. That is the first thing you must
    find out. It can&rsquo;t be a hard task. In all probability it was some doddering
    old fool from that Pantaloon Club. They have a distorted sense of humor down
    there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You saw no one else downstairs, then, Miss Carleton,
    except Fenn, the butler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said distinctly, &ldquo;no one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Donald Randall squirmed in his chair. He wanted to be frank
    about having gone downstairs himself, but he did not want to drag Z&eacute;lie
    into the discussion.</p>
  <p align="left">However, he felt he couldn&rsquo;t face Miss Violet afterward
    if he let her statement go unchallenged, so he said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As this seems to be an experience meeting I&rsquo;ll
    have to take issue with Miss Carleton. She, in an angelic endeavor to screen
    my wayward ways, said she saw no one downstairs. As a matter of fact, I ran
    over her in the drawing room as she was finishing her cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you talked to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About two minutes, I should say. Then she went upstairs
    and I stayed down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what was your errand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Randall looked disappointed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You ought to be able to deduce that. I went down for
    a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To the drawing room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, what a fuss you are! No, I dropped in there because
    I saw Miss Violet there. Then, when she deprived me of her society, I sauntered
    off toward the dining room, from whence all blessings flow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s the blot on my scutcheon! I fell asleep
    in a dining room chair&mdash;the one Polly is now sitting in, to be exact&mdash;and
    I woke up about&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know, something after four. I scrambled
    upstairs and into bed, and next thing I knew they were banging around and
    saying terrible things had happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Randall&rsquo;s story was a little incoherent, because he had
    determined not to implicate Z&eacute;lie. If she wanted to tell on herself,
    all right, but he didn&rsquo;t propose to tell on her.</p>
  <p align="left">To his relief Carlisle asked no more questions of him but turned
    to Peter Gregg next.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were downstairs last night?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly,
    for he had begun to think the whole household had spent the small hours going
    up and down.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I was,&rdquo; replied Gregg, not quite surlily,
    but far from blandly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I had some work to do, and I&rsquo;d been up late with
    the festivities, so I concluded to look it over and plan it out and then
    leave it to do in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask me now, won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Carlisle?&rdquo; and
    Emily Austen gave one of her demure smiles.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well, Miss Austen,&rdquo; said Kenneth, gravely.  &ldquo;Tell
    me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will. There was nothing wrong. You see, Peter and
    I are engaged, but Mr. Carleton wouldn&rsquo;t let us get married, because
    he thought it would interfere with Peter&rsquo;s usefulness to him. Well,
    so we got very few chances to see each other alone. Well, we wanted to have
    a little time together yesterday, being a sort of holiday, but we couldn&rsquo;t
    work it. We were both busy all day long. So Peter asked me to see him for
    a few minutes after everybody had gone, and I did. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you, Miss Austen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In my room, my secretary&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Until what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Until about half-past four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you both went up to your rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, mine is on the second floor, Mr. Gregg&rsquo;s
    on the third.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, if you went upstairs about four-thirty, did you
    not see Mr. Randall in the dining room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, we did. He was asleep. We didn&rsquo;t think it
    was our place to waken him, so we went by on tiptoe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were the lights on then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the main lights. There are low lights in the halls
    all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You corroborate all this, Mr. Gregg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Absolutely, just as Miss Austen has told it. We were
    together something over an hour, and we felt we had a right to that much
    holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were in the drawing room when the skeleton episode
    took place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, and I think I may help you to track down the
    sender of that infernal piece of impudence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Gregg. When we get around to that phase
    of the problem I may be very glad to call upon you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth lapsed into a sudden silence, and Pauline, feeling
    she could stand no more of this sort of thing, rose from her chair.</p>
  <p align="left">They all followed, and Fenn, at the doorway, informed them
    they must all gather in the drawing room.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_6">Chapter 6</a><br>The Door Behind the Tapestry</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">OBEYING the summons, they found Inspector Gilbert waiting for
    them.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The case is so amazing,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;so
    mysterious, even, that I am obliged to resort to unusual proceedings. I know
    Mr. Carlisle has asked you all as to your whereabouts last night at the time
    the crime was probably committed. I should have been with him and heard your
    replies, but I had imperative duties otherwhere. Therefore, I shall have
    to ask you to repeat, in general, the accounts you gave him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This sounded straightforward enough, but more than one of his
    hearers had a feeling that this was a preconceived plan, the intent being
    to see if the stories told varied in any important detail.</p>
  <p align="left">Z&eacute;lie, especially, was annoyed, for she had not been
    quizzed before with the others, and she didn&rsquo;t care to be brought into
    the matter at all.</p>
  <p align="left">There was no escape, however, and after checking up on Miss
    Carleton, Mrs. Carleton, and the old professor, Gilbert turned to her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you, Miss D&rsquo;Orsay,&rdquo; he said in his suave
    way, &ldquo;you came downstairs after you went up with Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The girl hesitated so long before replying that the inspector
    waxed impatient, even drummed on the chair arm with his finger tips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Z&eacute;lie said finally, raising
    her chin to a defiant angle and flashing a resentful glance at him, &ldquo;yes,
    I went downstairs to get a book I had left down in Mrs. Carleton&rsquo;s
    boudoir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What was the name of the book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, it was&mdash;what was that book you were reading
    yesterday, Polly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, that one?&rdquo; Pauline wrinkled her lovely brows,
    obviously playing for time. &ldquo;Oh, yes, it was that new book of Maugham&rsquo;s,
    I forget the title.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; said Z&eacute;lie
    calmly; &ldquo;I forget the title, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will ask one of you ladies to get the book,&rdquo;  Gilbert
    said. &ldquo;It is definitely important or I wouldn&rsquo;t insist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Z&eacute;lie looked mutinous and quite evidently had no intention
    of going on the errand, so Pauline, who was always obliging, rose and went
    in search of the book.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You had the Maugham story in the boudoir last night?&rdquo; the
    inspector inquired, and Z&eacute;lie shook her head.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find it,&rdquo; she said sulkily. &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t see what it has to do with your work in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps nothing at all, perhaps a great deal. Who else
    was downstairs last night at the time you were down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose Mr. Carleton was in
    his library, and I think the secretaries were in their offices, and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I was dawdling about,&rdquo; interrupted Don Randall,
    who saw Z&eacute;lie hesitated to implicate him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I stopped in the boudoir a few moments to chat with
    Miss D&rsquo;Orsay, and then I went to the dining room to get a bit of refreshment.
    I asked the lady to have something with me, but she refused. And then, I
    grieve to state, the subsequent proceedings interested me no more. It was
    very late, and I was weary, and my potation was of a soporific nature, and
    without in the least intending to, I fell asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The two secretaries, who spoke after Randall, told of seeing
    him asleep in the dining room, when they went upstairs at half-past four.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And when did you go upstairs, Mr. Randall?&rdquo;  asked
    Gilbert, a trifle sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heavens! I don&rsquo;t know. The last thing I thought
    of was to look at the clock. But it must have been after four-thirty and
    before five. Simple arithmetic gives you that. For Gregg went up at four-thirty,
    and Polly came down at five, and I moseyed up somewhere in between.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Randall had a winning way, and a seraphic smile, but the inspector
    was not easily cajoled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That time &lsquo;in between&rsquo; is apparently of
    importance to our investigation. You noticed no one around as you went upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Inspector dear, I didn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s not
    to say there mightn&rsquo;t have been a whole regiment of folks all over
    the place. You see, I just wasn&rsquo;t in a noticing mood. I had but one
    idea, and that was almost an obsession. I thought only of getting to the
    haven best described by the dear old hymn: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left" class="note">&ldquo; &lsquo;Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,<br>Holy angels guard thy bed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Needless to say, I reached it finally and sank at once into
    oblivion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dressed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, I disrobed and donned correct and very expensive
    nightwear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Inspector Gilbert nodded his wise head and privately concluded
    that young Randall was not quite so far gone last night as he chose to pretend.</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector was worried.</p>
  <p align="left">Here he had the whole household gathered before him, all willing
    to answer his questions, all polite and courteous, and yet he felt there
    was much being held back.</p>
  <p align="left">Most of them had been up and down the stairs during the small
    hours, and it seemed to him that while they pretended to be entirely frank
    in their statements, he had no way of corroborating or checking up on them,
    and it gave him a feeling of helplessness that was foreign to his experience.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle came into the room. He had been absent during
    the inspector&rsquo;s querying, for he had gone through much the same thing
    in the dining room, and the two would compare notes later.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The photographers have gone,&rdquo; Kenneth said,  &ldquo;and
    the finger-print chap is through with his work. The man from the mortuary
    would like instructions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet and Pauline rose at once and left the room.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle followed them, in case he might be of assistance,
    but Pauline was entirely mistress of the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">She told the undertaker that no arrangements could be made
    for the funeral until the return of Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s son. She consented
    to the removal of the body, asking that she might see it first.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, Mrs. Carleton,&rdquo; Kenneth advised.  &ldquo;Why
    not remember him as he was in life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;I must see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">So she and Violet went together to take a last farewell, and
    Kenneth returned to the drawing room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, to Gilbert, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t
    we get at that room? I&rsquo;m crazy to go over it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said the inspector. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got to quiz the bunch some more. I think they&rsquo;re more or less trying
    to hoodwink me, and I won&rsquo;t stand for it. You know it&rsquo;s quite
    within the possibilities that one of these people here sent the skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Scripture text,&rdquo; Kenneth told
    him,  &ldquo;that says, &lsquo;And a man&rsquo;s foes shall be they of his
    own household.&rsquo; But it&rsquo;s too soon for suspects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never too soon to get a start. Well, just wait till
    they take away the body, and then spread yourself on your investigation.
    Those two men of mine in there are clever detectives, though not brilliant
    ones. But they&rsquo;ll do whatever you tell them. Go to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert returned to his somewhat futile questioning. He had
    all the staff of servants sent for, hoping to get some side lights on the
    various relationships, but it was uphill work. The whole crowd seemed to
    be in league to baffle his attempts at getting information.</p>
  <p align="left">Everybody answered him calmly and with seeming sincerity, but
    he was far from sure of their good will.</p>
  <p align="left">And it bothered him.</p>
  <p align="left">He was used to people resenting his intrusion on their fresh
    grief, but these people here made little or no protestations of sorrow, although
    the murdered man was in close relationship with two of them and friendly
    with the rest.</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector was stubborn by nature, and this inexplicable
    attitude of the household puzzled him, and therefore made him the more determined
    to seek the reason for it.</p>
  <p align="left">Deep in his heart there was, as he often had known before,
    a vague wonder, not a suspicion, as to whether anybody in the family circle
    could have any guilty knowledge or secret theories about the crime.</p>
  <p align="left">If so, he must ferret it out, and he must work quickly, for
    every hour made it more easy for a wrongdoer to hide his tracks.</p>
  <p align="left">He wanted to talk it all over with Carlisle, in whose judgment
    he had great confidence, but he dared not leave a stone unturned in his present
    endeavor to trip up someone who was or might be screening his own or another&rsquo;s
    guilt.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile Kenneth Carlisle was standing, with folded arms,
    looking round the big library. The two detectives, Stokes and Baker, watched
    him idly.</p>
  <p align="left">They were alert to do anything required of them, but it was
    routine work for them, and their interest was not deep.</p>
  <p align="left">The problem of a locked room, so thrilling to the young investigator,
    was an old story to them. Had they been asked, they would probably have said &ldquo;Oh
    there&rsquo;s a hidy-hole somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact, that was Carlisle&rsquo;s own theory.
    For he knew the shot had not been fired after the room was broken into, the
    medical evidence proved that. And he had seen no trace of a mechanical contrivance,
    though such might yet come to light.</p>
  <p align="left">But a secret entrance was a possibility, and if one existed
    he certainly proposed to find it.</p>
  <p align="left">He began by making notes of the articles nearest the exact
    spot of the tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">In his little book he entered a list of all the furnishings
    of the desk, the contents of the desk drawers, the chair, the rugs, the revolving
    bookcase, even the window curtains and shades.</p>
  <p align="left">This was not such a lengthy job as it might seem.</p>
  <p align="left">In shorthand, he jotted down: &ldquo;Inkstand, two wells. Pen
    rack, fountain pen, two plain pens. Two black pencils, one blue pencil. One
    cube eraser. Two letter openers, one larger paper cutter. One pair long clipping
    shears, one desk scissors. One reading lens. Two small trays with clips,
    rubber bands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In the same rapid but thorough fashion he went through all
    the library appointments, noting the position of chairs, books, and papers.</p>
  <p align="left">The telephone stood on one end of the desk, but the telephone
    books, four of them, as New York City provides, were on the bookcase.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle looked over them and paused as he came to the Brooklyn
    volume.</p>
  <p align="left">But he replaced it without a word and, rising, began to search
    the wall and floor.</p>
  <p align="left">The front windows he spent much time on, but he finally concluded,
    to his own secret disappointment, that they could not have been opened the
    night before.</p>
  <p align="left">The housekeeping in the Carleton home was as good as most city
    houses can boast, but even with careful parlormaids, the dust and grime of
    the metropolis would sift in at the joints, and the evidence of the sills
    and sashes was incontrovertible. Had anyone climbed in at either of those
    two front windows he must have left a trace in the film of dust that he had
    to cross to get in.</p>
  <p align="left">Moreover, the fastenings on the windows were not negotiable
    from outside. Carlisle tried to think how he could manipulate them, if he
    wanted to, and he could imagine no way. The fixtures were heavy and of complicated
    design, and, while not exactly rusted, they were hard to turn from long disuse
    and lack of recent oiling.</p>
  <p align="left">No, he decided, however the murderer got in, it was not through
    the window.</p>
  <p align="left">Unless, followed the thought, the old man let him in. But,
    granting that and even ignoring the undisturbed dust, how could the intruder
    get out again leaving the windows locked?</p>
  <p align="left">Of course the doors presented the same difficulties.</p>
  <p align="left">If the murderer came in through the door to the hall, how could
    he lock it behind him after his exit?</p>
  <p align="left">The other door, opening into the cloakroom, fell into the same
    category.</p>
  <p align="left">And that&rsquo;s all the doors and windows there were, at least,
    that were visible.</p>
  <p align="left">Hidden entrances must now be looked for.</p>
  <p align="left">The most likely was that some one of the heavy bookcases round
    the room swung out and revealed a door behind.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth called on the two aides, and together the three men
    searched for knobs or springs or hinges.</p>
  <p align="left">Their search was not haphazard, nor was it unintelligent.</p>
  <p align="left">The detectives were accustomed to this sort of investigation,
    and they knew the possibilities and probabilities of concealed entrances.</p>
  <p align="left">They didn&rsquo;t wander aimlessly about, knocking on the wall
    to find a hollow-sounding panel. They scrutinized the seams and joints of
    the woodwork and tested the bookcases and shelves one by one.</p>
  <p align="left">As a final result they announced that there was positively
    no secret entrance concealed by the paneling or bookcases, and Kenneth entirely
    agreed with them.</p>
  <p align="left">He looked hopelessly behind pictures and large plaster casts
    that decorated the walls, and finally his eye fell on a long and magnificent
    piece of antique tapestry.</p>
  <p align="left">This was perhaps eight feet long by about three feet wide and
    hung against the wall directly opposite the door that gave into the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle lifted the tapestry and to his surprise found that
    it concealed a door, an ordinary door, fastened with a heavy brass bolt.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where does that door lead to?&rdquo; he asked, looking
    out of the front window to note the proximity of the other house.</p>
  <p align="left">The man didn&rsquo;t know, having had no orders to look into
    any such matters.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Get that butler in here&mdash;or, no. Don&rsquo;t get
    him. Ask Miss Violet Carleton if she will be good enough to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes departed on the errand, and Kenneth waited.</p>
  <p align="left">He didn&rsquo;t hope for any startling revelation, as the door
    was not really a secret entrance. The tapestry was doubtless hung over it
    in ornamentation, not as concealment.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet came, dignified and far from urbane of demeanor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You sent for me?&rdquo; she asked, not hiding her surprise
    at such a presumptuous gesture.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sorry, Miss Violet, but I just had to.&rdquo; Kenneth
    smiled at her. &ldquo;I want you to tell me where that door leads to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He indicated the tapestry that covered the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Door? I see no door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Now he was sure he had touched on the edge of a mystery.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No? Here it is.&rdquo; He drew the heavy tapestry aside
    and exposed the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; she said with a forced carelessness.  &ldquo;That
    door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Miss Carleton, that door. Into what room does it
    open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, that door opens into the other house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought so. Into the Mortlake&rsquo;s house, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, of course. But it is never used. Never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, apparently not. But it could be used.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh no. There is no key, hasn&rsquo;t been any for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not? Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He drew a chair for her, and seating himself on a corner of
    the desk waited for her to speak.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little to tell,&rdquo; she said in a tired,
    dull voice. &ldquo;You see, years ago, Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s brother&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your brother, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course, my brother, lived in the other house.
    Roger, his name was. He was a bachelor, and the other house was big enough
    for him. A nice house it is, too, though much smaller than this. Living alone,
    he often came in to see Manning, or Manning went in there. That door opens
    into the front room of the other house. Library it was when Roger had it,
    I don&rsquo;t know what the Mortlakes use it for. That&rsquo;s all there
    is to it. Then, when Roger died, that was ten years ago, Manning locked the
    door, threw away the key, and had heavy bolts put on both sides. It has never
    been opened since. The Mortlakes have lived there eight years now, but they
    have never opened that door. There&rsquo;s no mystery about it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    only that Manning wanted to shut off all communication with the other house
    if strangers lived there. If any of our family had lived in it, Manning would
    have had the door opened again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Thank you, Miss Carleton. Now, I take it, you
    are as anxious as anyone can be to find and punish the murderer of your brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to get the wrong
    one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. That would be an awful thing. Now, in order to prevent
    anything like that, you will help in any way you can, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a blanket order, Mr. Carlisle. I can&rsquo;t
    promise blindly. But I&rsquo;ll agree to help in any way I can provided my
    judgment approves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can only hope, Miss Carleton, that your judgment will
    approve whatever is just and right. Now, you assure me there is no key to
    this door in existence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How can you be so sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Some things are borne in upon our knowledge by long
    and continued experience. I have lived in this house all my life. Until ten
    years ago, that door was in constant use, usually open, never locked. Then
    came Roger&rsquo;s death, and Manning told me he had locked the door and
    thrown away the key. He ordered that long tapestry on purpose to hang right
    there, and there it has hung. When the Mortlakes took the other house, eight
    years ago, Manning explained it all to them, told them the key was destroyed,
    and asked them to hang some drapery on their side of the door to fend off
    curious questions. They did so, or she said they did. I&rsquo;ve never been
    in there since their advent. I do not like them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Carleton made her last statement calmly, as one might
    disclaim a liking for China tea.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Carleton liked them?&rdquo; pursued Kenneth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, enough. They were landlord and tenant, that is
    all. She has tried to push her way in a little, but she understood discouragement
    and, I think, accepted the situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They were here last night&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My brother always invited them to the New Year&rsquo;s
    Eve dinner because they lived in the other house. He was very fond of the
    house, and it was a sort of tradition to ask them over here for New Year&rsquo;s
    Eve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Now, my dear lady, we have scoured this room
    from floor to ceiling to find some way the criminal could have entered last
    night. But there is no hint of any way unless we can postulate some theory
    by which this door could have been made use of. Do you think that impossible?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it to be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would all the rest of your people agree to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have no people but my nephew, Claude, and he is not
    here. My brother&rsquo;s wife I respect and admire, but she is not my blood
    kin. And she would know nothing about this door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would Claude know anything about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He would know of its existence, certainly. It has been
    here all his life. But he knows, as I do, that his father discarded the door
    when Roger died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He would remember his uncle Roger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. Claude is thirty. Roger died ten
    years ago. Of course Claude remembers him well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course. Well, please say nothing about this
    door until Claude gets here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Mr. Carlisle, I won&rsquo;t. But if you think
    you&rsquo;ve found a clue or whatever you call it, you&rsquo;re barking up
    the wrong tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe, Miss Carleton, but you know we detectives have
    to do a lot of barking in the hope of hitting the right tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Carlisle, why are you ignoring the man who sent
    the skeleton? He is the man who killed my brother. He is the one to look
    for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Granting that, Miss Carleton, we must also find out
    how he gained entrance. Mr. Carleton was killed right here in this room.
    Every evidence points to that. Now, whoever killed him had to get into this
    room. We are working to discover how he got in&mdash;and out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but if you get the criminal you can make him tell
    how he got in and out. And the criminal is one of those cronies of my brother&rsquo;s
    down at the Pantaloon Club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What sort of club is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, a lot of old gaffers who have nothing to do but
    sit around and swap stories like an old-fashioned cracker-box crowd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wonder Mr. Carleton belonged to a club like that.
    He wasn&rsquo;t really old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was sixty, and I call that old. But there are some
    men in the club he liked, and there are some who just hated him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Really hated him? Enough to murder him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Somebody did murder him. We have no reason to suspect
    a gunman or a hold-up man, or whatever they are called. It might have been
    such a person, but I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no evidence for or against, Miss Carleton.
    Now, I wish you&rsquo;d look at this, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He picked up the Brooklyn telephone book and held it quickly
    before her eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you explain that?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Explain what?&rdquo; she took the volume he held out.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That odd-looking mark on the cover of the book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;She studied it with interest. The gray paper cover had
    about the middle of it a round, rather deep depression about the size of
    a dime. This depression was made by something so heavy or so strong that
    the mark went through many pages, growing fainter on each one.</p>
  <p align="left">On the outside and for the first few leaves the paper was torn,
    and after, on successive pages merely the circular mark showed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t explain it,&rdquo; she said, and then
    they were interrupted by Pauline, who came in, waving a yellow paper.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Claude is on his way home,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he
    will be here between four and five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Miss Violet; &ldquo;then he can take
    all the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Except what I take,&rdquo; said Kenneth Carlisle, but
    prudently said it only to himself.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_7">Chapter 7</a><br>The Dent in the Telephone Book</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;ONE moment, Mrs. Carleton,&rdquo; Kenneth said, as Pauline
    was about to leave the room, &ldquo;will you look at this, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He held the telephone book toward her, and she stared at it
    without touching it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; she asked pettishly. &ldquo;I
    never touch the obnoxious things, I hate telephone books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh all right, but just look at it. Can you imagine what
    would or could smash into it like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Slightly interested, she came a step nearer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    imagine anything. Perhaps, if the book was on the floor and somebody jabbed
    a walking stick down on it hard and sort of screwed the stick round and round,
    the result would be something like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Carlisle. &ldquo;An ingenious
    supposition, and very likely the right one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you suppose the murderer did it?&rdquo; Pauline&rsquo;s
    eyes grew large and dark.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doubtful; you see murderers seldom carry a cane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It might have been an umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. The trouble is, I doubt if this mark could have
    been made by either a cane or umbrella. Get me one or other, Stokes, will
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The detective left the room and shortly returned with both
    the articles in question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good man!&rdquo; cried Kenneth. &ldquo;Now, put one
    of those other telephone books on the floor. Not the Manhattan one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes laid the Suburban volume on the floor and with great
    care and all his strength endeavored to make a depression in it with the
    cane.</p>
  <p align="left">Result, one broken walking stick,</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Umbrella next,&rdquo; Carlisle said, with a dogged look
    on his face.</p>
  <p align="left">This had no better effect, although the umbrella was not broken.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; Kenneth said decidedly. &ldquo;The
    umbrella ferrule is too small anyway. Whatever did the damage on that Brooklyn
    book was a trifle larger. And see how far the marks show through. They run
    into the D&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why it interests you so much,&rdquo; said
    Miss Violet, rising to go. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s clear to be seen that that
    mark on the book was made by somebody hammering something. If I wanted to
    hammer down a nail in the heel of my shoe I&rsquo;d rest the shoe on a yielding
    surface like the telephone book. Then hammer on it. Now, this mark on the
    book is too small for a shoe heel, but it must have been something of the
    sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle looked at her with admiration.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well thought out, Miss Violet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t see why&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Say, my brother,
    or maybe his valet, wanted to hammer a nail down in a shoe. Suppose he put
    the shoe on an upright stick, like this;&rdquo; she took up a short piece
    of the broken cane and rested it on the book. &ldquo;And like this,&rdquo; she
    went on, slipping off her own dainty suede pump and placing it upside down
    on the stick. &ldquo;There, if you hammered on that hard enough you&rsquo;d
    get a mark like the one you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, if you used a sledge hammer or a steam mallet!
    But you&rsquo;re right in theory, Miss Carleton, and I&rsquo;m much obliged.
    I like your clear-headed arguments. Look around the room, won&rsquo;t you,
    and see if anything strikes you as unusual or out of place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; said the old lady after her sharp
    black eyes had traveled round the library. &ldquo;Everything looks to me
    just as it always did. Though, to be sure, I seldom came in here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you, Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, almost never. I have my little boudoir for a sitting
    room, and Miss Violet has a suite upstairs. When we get together, <em>en famille</em>,
    we use the drawing room. No one ever came in here to sit around or chat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Claude didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, or seldom. Of course, if he and his father had any
    business to talk over it would be in here. But Claude isn&rsquo;t much of
    a business man. And he monopolized the smoking room, opposite my boudoir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then this was Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s own particular sanctum.
    It would seem, would it not, that he admitted the murderer himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He may have done so,&rdquo; said Miss Violet, &ldquo;but&mdash;he
    couldn&rsquo;t have let him out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am in favor,&rdquo; Kenneth said, after a pause,  &ldquo;of
    leaving further investigation until Claude arrives. He will be in authority,
    and I want some instructions from him before I delve too deeply into this
    mystery. Have you thought that it may bring to light some amazing disclosures?
    Some secrets, perhaps, or unexpected revelations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I had in mind,&rdquo; Violet said
    earnestly, &ldquo;when I hesitated to give you carte blanche to go ahead.
    Do wait for Claude. He will know just what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will wait, Miss Carleton, as far as I am concerned.
    I cannot answer for Inspector Gilbert. But I think he has enough routine
    work to occupy him for some time. The servants&rsquo; evidence must all be
    taken down and the house searched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The house searched!&rdquo; cried Pauline. &ldquo;Good
    heavens! What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is customary. Don&rsquo;t let it alarm you. It will
    be for the most part cursory. But it has to be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will you not stay here for the whole day, Mr. Carlisle?&rdquo; Pauline
    invited him. &ldquo;Stay to-night to dinner, and that will give you time
    for a long talk with Claude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to,&rdquo; Kenneth said, &ldquo;except
    that I haven&rsquo;t my dinner togs here. But I can run up home and dress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no. Let Louis go and get your things. Poor chap,
    he has nothing to do now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He will have when Claude arrives. But I&rsquo;ll telephone
    my man to bring down a suitcase, then I&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fine. Do it right away, for there&rsquo;s so much going
    on, it&rsquo;s hard to get hold of a telephone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use this one, thanks. The finger-print expert
    has attended to it. No results, whatever. I mean no prints on it except those
    of Mr. Manning Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then a sergeant came to summon them all to the drawing
    room, as the Mortlakes had arrived.</p>
  <p align="left">The ladies went at once, and Kenneth delayed only to telephone
    to his man.</p>
  <p align="left">He crossed over to the drawing room and found a seat placed
    for him near the inspector.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. and Mrs. Mortlake were very evidently in a high state of
    indignation.</p>
  <p align="left">They seemed to assume that they had been called in because
    they were under suspicion of being implicated in the tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know nothing about it,&rdquo; John Mortlake said over
    and over again. &ldquo;I tell you I know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We thoroughly understand that,&rdquo; said Gilbert patiently. &ldquo;And
    now, will you please answer some questions on matters that you do know about?
    At what time did you leave this house last night, or, rather, this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it was something after two, I can&rsquo;t say
    nearer than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That will do. Did you and Mrs. Mortlake retire at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We went upstairs at once. The house was cold, as it
    always is at that hour, but we turned on the electric heater in our upstairs
    sitting room and chatted for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is that sitting room on the street&mdash;on the Avenue
    front of the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, the front room on the second floor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you could hear or see if there was any disturbance
    in front of this house or your own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mortlake had regained his poise, relieved at hearing no word
    of suspicion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Disturbance, sir, is what there wasn&rsquo;t anything
    else but! The New Year&rsquo;s revelers were straggling along home and making
    a lot of noise about it. Not as much noise as they made at midnight, of course,
    but a lot of left over noise. Yelling and hooting, they were, most of &rsquo;em
    drunk, I dessay. And they had horns and rattles and all that. In fact, they
    were so annoying, my wife and I decided to retire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your bedrooms are&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At the rear of the house. We chose to have it so because
    there is always more or less noise on the street until two or three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then at what time did you go to your bedrooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, something before three, I&rsquo;d say. Wouldn&rsquo;t
    you, Nan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I guess so. I never know the time, none of our
    clocks go right. But it was &rsquo;long about three, I&rsquo;m pretty sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well. Now answer this carefully, Mr. Mortlake.
    After you were in your bedrooms&mdash;adjoining, are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Two rooms at the back of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well. Then did you hear any sound like a shot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we did, lots of &rsquo;em. We knew, of course,
    they were the hoodlums who were still straggling along home. So we paid no
    attention to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear one louder shot that could have
    been the shot in this house that killed Mr. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir, we didn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;ll tell you right
    here and now, if we had heard a shot that sounded as if in this house we&rsquo;d
    have told you about it without waiting to be questioned!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you would? But if you&rsquo;d heard a shot that
    you could presume to be in here, wouldn&rsquo;t you have come over here to
    see if you could be of assistance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mortlake looked at the inspector.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;no, I don&rsquo;t
    believe I would. Not without I was summonsed. You see there were to my knowledge
    plenty of men in here to take care of any accident, plenty of women to do
    the screaming act, and plenty of servants to render all the help that could
    be needed. No, I shouldn&rsquo;t have dreamed of intruding unless I was asked
    to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you heard nothing that alarmed you, Mrs. Mortlake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no. I went right to bed and to sleep. In our bedrooms
    we can&rsquo;t hear the street noises much, and I covered up my ears and
    went to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, Mr. Mortlake, you were awakened early this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was. I don&rsquo;t know the time, so you needn&rsquo;t
    ask me, but I heard a racket out in front&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How could you hear from your back bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well, by that time, you see, the hoodlums had
    all gone home, and the street was quiet as it always is at that hour&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, anyway, it was getting on toward morning. And
    I could hear voices, several voices, more or less raised, and they seemed
    to be right outside my front windows. Naturally, I went to look, and there
    was a bunch of people outside the windows of the Carleton house next door&mdash;this
    house. I asked them what was the matter, and as I received rather a short
    reply I shut the window and went back to bed. I had no reason to think there
    was tragedy of any sort over here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mortlake, &ldquo;he hadn&rsquo;t
    any reason to think anything had happened to Mr. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; said the inspector soothingly. &ldquo;Now,
    Mr. Mortlake, how did you hear of the death of Mr. Carleton this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Through the servants. Some of the Carleton kitchen people
    told our man, who was out cleaning the back steps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;May I ask a few questions?&rdquo; interrupted Carlisle,
    and after a glance at him the inspector nodded permission.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How lately have you used that door between the two houses,
    Mr. Mortlake?&rdquo; Kenneth said, and his crisp, challenging tones were
    in direct contrast to Gilbert&rsquo;s suavity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;W-what! What door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pull yourself together, man!&rdquo; Kenneth strongly
    advised, and the suggestion had only the effect of causing Mr. Mortlake to
    fall farther apart.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Jack?&rdquo; asked
    Mrs. Mortlake, by way of a tonic, but seeing his increasing nervousness and
    distress she took the helm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What door do you mean, Mr. Carlisle?&rdquo; she said,
    beaming at him. &ldquo;I can tell you about it, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well, Mrs. Mortlake. I mean the door that is between
    Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s library and the corresponding room in your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Corresponding room!&rdquo; she said archly. &ldquo;Is
    that a new term for a library? Book room, we call it. Why, yes, there is
    a door, I believe, between the Carleton library and our own humbler book
    room, but it is never used. It is locked and bolted and has been so ever
    since we lived in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But it could be unlocked and unbolted and used as a
    mode of ingress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doubtless, if one had the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. I never saw it. When
    we took the house it was with the proviso that we would never attempt to
    open that door. My Lord, we had no wish to open it! Why should we? We like
    our own privacy as much as the high-toned Carletons like theirs!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re welcome to it,&rdquo; burst out Miss
    Violet, who could never control her tongue if repartee seemed called for.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always noticed that was your kindly attitude,&rdquo; retorted
    Nan Mortlake.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth cut off possible further amenities by interrupting
    with:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me more about the door, Mrs. Mortlake. Do you have
    a curtain over it, as there is on this side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is on this side. I&rsquo;ve
    never had a chance to see. On our side there hangs a curtain, yes. A simple
    breadth of rep, not cloth of gold, as the Carletons doubtless have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then John Mortlake awoke from his lethargy. Whether spurred
    on by his wife&rsquo;s acrid speeches, or whether he had thought the matter
    out himself, he rose to the occasion and, with a scowling face, thundered
    out:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, young man, what about that door? Do you have an
    idea that I came through it in the night, shot my neighbor Carleton, and
    returned to my home, leaving the door bolted behind me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know the door is still bolted on this side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mortlake&rsquo;s jaw dropped. Though master of himself when
    the conversation was unimportant, he went to pieces in emergency.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;know. But isn&rsquo;t it?
    I assumed it must be, because mine is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know yours is? Have you looked at it this
    morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mortlake was in a quandary. If he said he hadn&rsquo;t looked
    at the door, he stultified himself. If he said he had, he might start up
    all sorts of trouble.</p>
  <p align="left">He took refuge in a sulky silence, and his more plucky wife
    fell gracefully into the r&ocirc;le of Gray Mare.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; she said helpfully to Carlisle.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    all kerflummoxed. He couldn&rsquo;t tell his own name. Ask me another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Kenneth gravely. &ldquo;Mrs.
    Mortlake, on your oath, has that door never, to your knowledge, been open
    since you lived in that house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she said quietly, and her straightforward
    gaze and level tone carried conviction.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You never raise your piece of drapery that hides it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only on cleaning days, Mr. Carlisle. Once a week it
    is raised and the door is dusted. When necessary, the drapery is taken down
    and shaken and put back in place. Other than that, the door is never touched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose that is practically the case in here, Miss
    Carleton?&rdquo; Kenneth asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Practically, yes. But our woodwork is dusted every day,
    and our draperies are shaken and cleaned every week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The righteous attitude of the perfect housekeeper could be
    plainly read on Violet&rsquo;s aristocratic old face, and Pauline, catching
    the eye of Don Randall, nearly disgraced herself by laughing out loud.</p>
  <p align="left">&#8220;And
    you too are sure the door is never opened?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; and Violet nodded her white head vigorously. &ldquo;Now,
    young man, don&rsquo;t build theories on that door. It won&rsquo;t hold up
    under &rsquo;em. I mean the theories won&rsquo;t hold up under the door.
    Oh, well, you know what I mean. I mean leave the door out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It looks as if we should have to,&rdquo; said Kenneth,
    smiling, and giving the Mortlakes back to Inspector Gilbert.</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector, however, felt that he was working in the dark,
    as he hadn&rsquo;t seen this door in question, and though he had all respect
    for Kenneth&rsquo;s wisdom and knowledge he was not the man to go far on
    hearsay evidence.</p>
  <p align="left">He dismissed the Mortlakes, warning them to hold themselves
    in readiness to be further questioned at some other time.</p>
  <p align="left">He told the rest of his audience they could leave the room,
    but must not leave the house until he gave permission. He explained he would
    have a further inquiry after Claude arrived, and when that was over, doubtless
    they would all be free to do what they pleased.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you find that book you were looking for, Miss D&rsquo;Orsay?&rdquo; came
    the inspector&rsquo;s silken tones as Z&eacute;lie was about to slip from
    the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why&mdash;oh, no, I didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know
    where it went to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know, Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. But it will probably turn up soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look here, Inspector, do you want all here for your
    next quiz who were here last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I do. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, because then I must arrange for Professor Scott
    to stay over night, if he wants to. You see, he had Claude&rsquo;s room last
    night, but Claude will be home to-night. I&rsquo;ll put him in a guest room&mdash;there
    are plenty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he go home after dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If he prefers, certainly. Mr. Carlisle will probably
    go after dinner, and he can take the old gentleman along with him. The professor
    doesn&rsquo;t go out alone in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle, overhearing this conversation, stepped up
    and offered himself as escort for the professor whenever he elected to go
    home.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nice young fellow,&rdquo; Gilbert said, as Kenneth ran
    after the professor and assisted him up the long stairs to his room.</p>
  <p align="left">Passing Fenn in the upper hall, Carlisle asked him to find
    out from Miss Violet what room was to be assigned to Professor Scott.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to be moved,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
    Claude is coming home and will want these rooms of his. Jolly suite, isn&rsquo;t
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle looked about, and then, in his helpful way, began
    gathering up the professor&rsquo;s poor and plain little belongings.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Anything of yours in the bureau drawers?&rdquo;  Kenneth
    asked, as he opened one after another.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mercy, no! Heavens, what whirlwinds you young people
    are! I&rsquo;ve nothing but a few odds and ends. Stuff &rsquo;em in that
    old suitcase. But why do you bother? Leave it to Fenn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; and after whisking
    open a few more drawers and cupboards Kenneth threw himself into an easy
    chair and lighted a cigarette.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a good logical mind, Professor Scott. Who,
    do you think, killed your friend Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The chap that sent the skeleton to him,&rdquo; said
    Scott promptly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think Carleton ever murdered anybody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never! That was to make the thing more dramatic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet if you omit that line you take all meaning from
    the thing. &lsquo;As I am now, you soon shall be.&rsquo; Doesn&rsquo;t that
    mean &lsquo;murdered&rsquo;? And Carleton is murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know. But that whole skeleton business was sent
    as a warning. Nobody knew it was a warning but Manning himself. The others
    thought it was a joke. They think so still. Violet is sure some member of
    the&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know. Club. I know all the facts. What I want now
    is theories. Have you any?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m satisfied to have the skeleton. You have
    it safe for me, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, indeed. I sure have. I&rsquo;ll send it to you
    as soon as you&rsquo;re home again. You&rsquo;re staying the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I shall stay as long as I&rsquo;m invited. That
    is, until the will is read.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re interested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very much. Manning promised to leave me twenty-five
    thousand dollars for my research work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t use any for myself, you see. All for
    my work. Oh, I do hope he left it so I can get it at once. Sometimes those
    things are so delayed in settlement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They are. But Claude&rsquo;s your friend, isn&rsquo;t
    he? He can put it through for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope so. Ah, here&rsquo;s Fenn. Now, you run along,
    Mr. Carlisle, Fenn will look after me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll just sit here while I finish this
    cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The ubiquitous butler and the elderly guest left the room,
    and, softly closing the door, Carlisle made a hasty search of Claude Carleton&rsquo;s
    desk.</p>
  <p align="left">Rapidly his sensitive hands felt around for secret drawers
    and concealed pigeonholes, and in two instances his industry was rewarded.</p>
  <p align="left">In one cleverly concealed space he found a small photograph&mdash;a
    snapshot&mdash;and half a dozen tiny trinkets of the sort given away at certain
    candy stores.</p>
  <p align="left">These little toys were of varying degrees of brightness, and
    comprised a heart, a star, a goblet, a Cupid, a parrot, and a dove.</p>
  <p align="left">He studied the lot but could see no coherence or meaning in
    them.</p>
  <p align="left">Quickly he replaced them, and then stumbled on the other secret
    receptacle. It contained a packet of clippings all relating to the successes
    of moving picture stars. There were pictures of film actors and actresses,
    mostly cut from newspapers. There were advertisements of the larger companies
    producing films, and there were lists of addresses in Hollywood, of both
    managers and actors, and also of boarding houses and restaurants.</p>
  <p align="left">Riffing them over quickly but attentively, Kenneth put them
    back where he had found them and, closing the desk, rose leisurely, stretched
    himself, and went downstairs.</p>
  <p align="left">He met no one in the halls, not even a servant, and he went
    on down and found Gilbert in the study waiting for him.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_8">Chapter 8</a><br>Claude Comes Home</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">IT was soon after four o&rsquo;clock when Claude Carleton arrived
    at the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline, in her own boudoir, had given orders he was to be
    brought to her there at once. Violet was with her and Z&eacute;lie, but no
    one else.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude was big and not especially graceful, but his own grief
    and his sympathy for the others were apparent in his manner and face as he
    strode across the room and greeted first his aunt and then his stepmother.</p>
  <p align="left">He shook hands politely with Z&eacute;lie, and then sat down
    beside Miss Violet.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the only Carletons left, Aunt Vi,&rdquo; he
    said, with a choke in his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me all about it,
    I&rsquo;ll get the details from the men. But is everything being done that
    can be done to track down the fiend who did this thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Claude,&rdquo; Violet told him, &ldquo;we have
    the police, of course, and also your friend Mr. Carlisle is on the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Kenneth? Fine! I&rsquo;m glad you got him. Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re all here. I mean the inspector and
    his men. Professor Scott has stayed over, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. And how are you, Aunt Violet? Brave as ever,
    I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He took her two hands in his own, and his big, comforting presence
    gave the little old lady a hope that now he was here things would straighten
    out.</p>
  <p align="left">He patted her shoulder and turned to Pauline.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you, Polly? I hope you&rsquo;re not bothered to
    death with all these horrid people in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh no, they are polite and nice enough. But they are
    everlastingly quizzing us, and it seems to me they go over and over the same
    ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get at &rsquo;em, Polly, and they shan&rsquo;t
    be allowed to bother you any more. Of course, we have to go through a regular
    routine, but I&rsquo;ll take the helm. I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t any
    farther away than I was. When&mdash;when did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The medical examiner said some time between three and
    four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Pauline told him. &ldquo;About five, I woke up,
    and when Manning wasn&rsquo;t in his bed I came downstairs to find out if
    he had dropped asleep at his desk. He never did such a thing in his life&mdash;but,
    well, Claude, I was worried about that horrid skeleton thing. You know it
    was a shock to Manning, and I feared it might have weakened his heart, or
    something like that. So I came down and tapped at the library door, but I
    could get no answer. I told him it was I, and never before has he refused
    me admittance. So, I knew something must be the matter, and I raised an alarm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo; Claude said kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    talk about it now. I&rsquo;ll get all the details from the inspector and
    Kenneth. Lucky you could get him. Who called him in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer thing,&rdquo; Violet told him.  &ldquo;Nobody
    seems to know who called him. I didn&rsquo;t, nor Polly, nor Fenn, nor Don&mdash;in
    fact, I don&rsquo;t know who did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Perhaps the police people did.
    Shall I have my own rooms? Where will you put old Scotty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been moved out,&rdquo; Pauline said. &ldquo;Yes
    take your own rooms, of course. Oh, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home, Claude.
    What did you do? Get off at Harrisburg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure. And had to wait till eleven o&rsquo;clock before
    I could get a train back to New York. I can tell you I fumed and fretted.
    It was a good train, though, in soon after half-past three, and here I am.
    Now, I&rsquo;ll run down to the police chaps, they&rsquo;ll be wanting to
    see me, and you girls take a rest. Don&rsquo;t worry your heads about anything
    now. Leave it all to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude looked very strong and capable as he swung out of the
    room. Thrust suddenly into the position of head of the house, he seemed determined
    to do his best to meet the situation. The responsibilities would be heavy,
    but they must be shouldered by somebody, and the task was waiting.</p>
  <p align="left">He made straight for the library, feeling sure that the inspector
    would be found there.</p>
  <p align="left">He was; also Carlisle, Randall, and the two sergeant detectives.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth rose and grasped the hand of the newcomer, and Don
    followed.</p>
  <p align="left">Only a few words of personal intent were spoken, and then the
    inspector was introduced.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is a sad turn of Fate that brings you back so soon
    after your departure,&rdquo; Gilbert said, a little embarrassed, and then,
    with a change of manner, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t want sympathy from me.
    Now, Mr. Carleton, how much do you know? I mean, how much do you want to
    learn from us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know only what I read in the early afternoon papers.
    I got the telegram at Harrisburg and left the train there. Of course, there
    was nothing in the morning papers. I took a train at eleven, and I hit Philadelphia
    about one, and there I saw a short notice in some enterprising journal. And
    as I neared New York they brought some city papers on board. But I was so
    near home then, I didn&rsquo;t care for reporters&rsquo; stories. Now, if
    somebody will give me a short, plain account of the facts, we can take up
    theories and evidence later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle was relieved at Claude&rsquo;s attitude. He had rather
    feared the young man would be so crushed with sorrow or excited with a desire
    for vengeance that he might be difficult to manage.</p>
  <p align="left">But this self-possessed, matter-of-fact demeanor was satisfactory,
    and Kenneth lighted a cigarette and settled himself to listen.</p>
  <p align="left">But he found himself drawn into the conversation and taking
    part in the narrative, until in a really short time the facts, as far as
    known, had been marshaled for Claude&rsquo;s benefit, and the son of the
    house knew as much as Inspector Gilbert himself knew.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth, too, stated frankly all the information at his command,
    save only the incident of his hasty search through the drawers of Claude&rsquo;s
    desk.</p>
  <p align="left">It could not be said, at this point, that the private investigator
    had any suspicion of Claude&rsquo;s implication in the crime, but Carlisle
    was an opportunity grasper, and he knew that unless he snatched his chance
    that morning, he might never be alone in Claude&rsquo;s room again.</p>
  <p align="left">When the recital was finished Don Randall, who hated to be
    left out of things, remarked blithely:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So you see, Claude, we have a real stock case. A murder
    committed in a hermetically sealed room! How did the murderer get in, how
    get out, and where&rsquo;s the weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish, Don,&rdquo; Claude said, not petulantly, but
    in a pained voice, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d be a little less blatantly unfeeling.
    I don&rsquo;t want maudlin sympathy, but do remember that we&rsquo;re speaking
    of my father, and you&rsquo;re rather flicking on the raw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sorry, old chap,&rdquo; Randall mumbled. &ldquo;No offence
    meant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. Now, Inspector, what about the skeleton?
    By the way, where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Up at my place,&rdquo; Carlisle told him. &ldquo;You
    see, Professor Scott wanted it, and your father gave it to him. Then Miss
    Violet declared she couldn&rsquo;t sleep with the horrid thing in the house,
    so I carted it home, to keep it for old man Scott till he can accommodate
    the fearful guest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That was good of you,&rdquo; Claude declared. &ldquo;Can
    you find room for his nibs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes; Carter, my man, is valeting him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Claude said thoughtfully, &ldquo;how do
    you all feel about it? Don&rsquo;t you think the man who sent that skeleton
    to my father is the man who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It would seem so, on the face of it,&rdquo; Gilbert
    agreed. &ldquo;And yet, how could an outsider get in this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Claude, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
    mean you&rsquo;re looking for an insider. Some member of this household!
    Man, you&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Take it slowly, Mr. Carleton,&rdquo; the inspector said,
    speaking seriously. &ldquo;We have to look at every angle of this case. And
    the first thing is, or ought to be, a consideration of motive. What can you
    suggest as a possible motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have heard there are only three motives for murder,&rdquo; Claude
    said, and the irrepressible Donald interrupted:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, only three. Lust, loot, and liquor.
    Cut out the first&mdash;this is no <em>crime passionel!</em>&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Cut out liquor, too,&rdquo; said Carlisle. &ldquo;Whoever
    engineered this murder needed all his wits and a clear head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Leaving loot,&rdquo; and Claude looked around.  &ldquo;&lsquo;Anything
    stolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not that we can discover,&rdquo; the inspector told
    him. &ldquo;But loot has a wider significance. Aside from immediate thievery,
    loot may imply the hope for future benefit, under a will, say. Do you know
    the terms of your father&rsquo;s will, Mr. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In a general way. There is a large portion left to Pauline.
    A smaller but substantial bequest to Aunt Violet. A number of other bequests
    and remembrances, sums to charity and to the servants, and after those things
    I am myself the residuary legatee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your father had a large fortune?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was a wealthy man, yes. But all that data will be
    furnished you by his lawyers and his secretary. By the way, how is Gregg
    carrying on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen little of him,&rdquo; Gilbert replied. &ldquo;He
    seems a quiet, even morose sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Too quiet,&rdquo; Claude frowned a little. &ldquo;Not
    morose exactly, but rather embittered. Well, we all know the reason for that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Inspector, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s no secret,
    so I&rsquo;ll tell you that Peter Gregg is most anxious to marry Miss Austen,
    but my father wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Could your father forbid a matter of that sort?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he could put serious obstacles in the way. Threats
    of dismissal without a reference; and, too, I&rsquo;ve had reason to think
    that Dad knew something about Peter that he held over him like a whiplash.
    I may be mistaken, but I think there is something in Gregg&rsquo;s past not
    altogether praiseworthy. And I think my father knew it and used it for his
    own benefit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re accusing your father a bit gravely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean to. Dad was selfish, his nearest
    friends will admit that. And any little thing he could use to improve on
    his own comfort or convenience he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to do. But, as I
    say, I may be wrong. Only it would explain Gregg&rsquo;s grieved outlook
    on life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. Now, Mr. Carleton, let&rsquo;s
    take up the subject of this locked room. As Mr. Randall, perhaps too baldly,
    stated, it is a problem not unknown to detectives. But in my experience there
    has always been a solution readily arrived at. In this case, I admit we are,
    so far, entirely at sea. Is there any other entrance to the room besides
    the obvious doors and windows? Any secret entrance or sliding panel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not those things, no. But there is another entrance,
    which I have no doubt you have yourselves discovered. I refer to this door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude rose and crossed to the hanging tapestry, which he drew
    aside, disclosing the locked and bolted door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It gives into the other house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    it has never to my knowledge been opened since my uncle&rsquo;s death. For
    further data I refer you to Aunt Violet. She knows all about it. I was a
    young fellow of twenty when my uncle died, and I paid little attention to
    household matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You remember your uncle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes; distinctly. He was fond of me, a somewhat lonely
    old bachelor. But I was heedless and didn&rsquo;t show him as much kindly
    attention as I ought to have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t subscribe to a theory of the murderer
    entering through this door?&rdquo; and the inspector dropped the tapestry
    again with a decided air of disappointment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly can&rsquo;t. Nor do I see how anybody can
    with that strong bolt shot into place. There&rsquo;s one like it on the other
    side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just like it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I think so. I remember when my father had them
    put on. And he said if any Carletons ever lived in the other house again,
    he&rsquo;d have them taken off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Granting, for a moment, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that
    the intruder did come through this door, he then had to come through the
    Mortlake&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course. Now, I don&rsquo;t know how securely
    the Mortlakes keep their place locked up at night, but I should think it
    difficult for even a clever murderer to get in the other house, come through
    into this one, kill my father, and then make his getaway, leaving this bolt
    as it is now&mdash;I assume it was found like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, just as you see it now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well, then he had to go back the way he came or
    out of one of these doors or front windows. None of which he could leave
    locked behind him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he did do something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, so far as we can see. But, Inspector, there must
    be some explanation&mdash;that we know, but I can&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
    any of these we have mentioned. Can you? Can you, Kenneth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Carlisle shook his head. &ldquo;No, I
    can&rsquo;t. But say it was someone who somehow came in through this bolted
    door. What price some of the people living next door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gosh, the Mortlakes!&rdquo; Claude&rsquo;s eyes flew
    open wider.</p>
  <p align="left">He was a handsome chap, his thick black hair wavy and a little
    unruly; his big dark eyes alert and piercing, except when partially veiled
    by his long curling lashes. His features were rounded and a trifle heavy,
    and Carlisle had warned him that unless he took off some weight he couldn&rsquo;t
    play star parts in the moving picture studios.</p>
  <p align="left">He was vigorous, sometimes abrupt of manner, but, as a rule,
    his speech and action were dominated by sound, hard common sense, and this
    he declared he would rather put his trust in than genius or brilliant originality.</p>
  <p align="left">And now his common sense balked at the idea of the Mortlakes
    being mixed up in this murder business.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why under
    the canopy should Jack Mortlake have it in for my father? Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps the servants, or guests,&rdquo; suggested Gilbert.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Servants or guests your grandmother!&rdquo; Carlisle,  &ldquo;you
    can do better than that, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get anywhere, Claude. I sit here and look
    around, and all I see is this sealed room. I know no one could get into it
    and get out again leaving it sealed. But somebody did do it. Which is, of
    course, a paradox.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I love that term sealed,&rdquo; said Randall musingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    so much more dramatic than locked or bolted or both. It has the tang of the
    French S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, or the Russian Constabulowski.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&#8220;Shut up, Don,&rdquo; said Claude. &ldquo;To put it no more
    offensively, your remarks are in bad taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, all right, I&rsquo;m tired of this conference, anyhow,&rdquo; and
    Randall rose and sauntered from the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How long is he staying?&rdquo; asked Claude when Randall
    had closed the door behind him. &ldquo;Or&rdquo;&mdash;a sudden thought
    struck him&mdash;&ldquo;are all these people detained?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; Gilbert told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
    been waiting for you. Now we must have some more inquiries, and then probably
    most of them can go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If they want to,&rdquo; supplemented Claude. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    bet old man Scott will hang on as long as he can. Randall won&rsquo;t go
    until Polly unmistakably invites him to do so. Z&eacute;lie will probably
    light out. I fancy she&rsquo;s fed up with this atmosphere. What about the
    melancholy Gregg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We must keep him on for a while,&rdquo; Gilbert decreed. &ldquo;We
    need him to tell us things about business matters and so on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You skipped me,&rdquo; Kenneth Carlisle said, smiling. &ldquo;I
    swear I was asked to come here and look into this case, but I&rsquo;ve no
    idea who asked me. Until I am officially invited, I hesitate to&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hesitate no more, fair sir,&rdquo; Claude smiled back
    at him. &ldquo;I, as head of the house of Carleton, ask of you that you abide
    with us and use your utmost endeavors to solve this very deep mystery. Yes,
    I know I&rsquo;m almost as frivolous as old Don, but&mdash;once in a while,
    a fellow has to&mdash;well, has to laugh or cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And it could easily be seen that Claude&rsquo;s emotions were
    impeding his coherent talk.</p>
  <p align="left">Inspector Gilbert came to the rescue in his matter-of-fact
    way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, ignoring the tensity of the moment, &ldquo;I
    think we must make careful search for the sender of the skeleton. I can&rsquo;t
    help thinking he and the murderer were working together, if not the same
    man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How are you going about it?&rdquo; inquired Claude,
    his poise reestablished.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tackle the Pantaloon Club first. Can you be of help
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably. I know several of the members. Goofy old chaps,
    but gentlemen of the old school, as the phrase runs. Yes, I&rsquo;ll see
    them, and perhaps Carlisle will go along to check up on points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They talked on, telling Claude what was known of the events
    of the night.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Seems to me the whole tribe was on the warpath,&rdquo; Claude
    said at last, his eyes troubled and his whole attitude weary and dejected. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
    pretty much everybody trapesing up and down stairs? Not that it&rsquo;s unusual.
    We often do prowl around and occasionally meet one another. I wish I&rsquo;d
    been here, and yet I can&rsquo;t see how it would have made things any different.
    Well, I&rsquo;ll go back and chin the girls a bit. Ken, you&rsquo;ll stay
    for dinner, and won&rsquo;t you stay the night?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dine with you,&rdquo; Carlisle said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    sent for my duffel. But, like the chickens or curses or whatever they are,
    I&rsquo;ll go home to roost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. Fenn or Louis will look after you. Make yourself
    at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude went off, and the inspector sat in glum silence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A lot of help we&rsquo;ll get from him,&rdquo; he said
    at last.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Inspector,&rdquo; Carlisle spoke slowly, &ldquo;we
    won&rsquo;t get help from anybody. We&rsquo;ve got a hard row to hoe, but
    we hoe it alone&mdash;if any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hullo, you discouraged, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been discouraged from the opening chime.
    It&rsquo;s the biggest, hardest case I ever heard of, in fact or fiction.
    It&rsquo;s impossible anyone should get in and out of this room, and yet
    someone did. There&rsquo;s the situation. The one glimmer of light is that
    someone <em>did</em>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you call that a glimmer of light! I call it Cimmerian
    darkness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there all the same. It&rsquo;s a fact, a
    truth, and, by Jove, it&rsquo;s the only fact or truth I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your favorite suspect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know. Whoever gets the most money.
    Claude, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did he get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, look here, Inspector, if you&rsquo;re going to
    fire that at me every once in so often I refuse to work with you. I&rsquo;ve
    told you I don&rsquo;t know how the murderer got in, and I spoke the gospel
    truth. But I&rsquo;m going to find out. Now, drop that argument. If you want
    my suspects in order, they&rsquo;re Mrs. Pauline, Miss Violet, young Randall,
    old Scott, Miss D&rsquo;Orsay, and the two secretaries, jointly or severally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think not. It isn&rsquo;t their motivation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the Mortlakes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how or why or wherefore the Mortlakes.
    Still, it may have been. Then there&rsquo;s the skeleton sender. How are
    we going to stalk him? He never saw the inside of the Pantaloon Club! Those
    old birds aren&rsquo;t up to such tricks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think that, too. But somebody sent the bones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True, O King. Now, what about the telephone book and
    its curiously marred cover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think it has anything to do with the case,
    for such a clever devil never would have left it behind if it meant anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Right again. But he couldn&rsquo;t carry everything,
    and he had his gun to tote, and he had his locking up to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What sort of gun do you deduce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t deducible. The med. ex. said it was a
    small or medium caliber, about .28, I believe. But I don&rsquo;t see what
    difference it makes what size or shape the weapon was. It isn&rsquo;t there.
    Do you know, Inspector, as I sit here and gaze around this room I feel I
    could kick myself for utter incompetency. I&rsquo;ve no doubt the truth is
    here, staring us in the face, only we&rsquo;re too blind or too dumb to see
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here except the things that belonged
    to Mr. Carleton. Everything has been listed and checked. The family and servants
    have sworn to all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving me frantic.
    Do you remember <em>The Purloined Letter?</em>&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course. Who doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I believe it&rsquo;s just like that. That letter
    was sticking up there on the desk under the detective&rsquo;s very nose,
    and yet he spent hours&mdash;days&mdash;in a futile search for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you think the clue is plain before us now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do. Only I don&rsquo;t care much for the word clue.
    I&rsquo;m silly that way. A clue, to my mind, is a patent, obvious thing
    that clumsily points the way. I mean a subtle or veiled hint that is the
    truth but is not to be discerned save by one who is looking for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, gosh, Mr. Carlisle, I&rsquo;m looking for it.
    But even so, I don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Name over everything on the desk and table and bookcase,
    will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The two sergeant detectives gave each other an expressive glance
    as Kenneth Carlisle lay back in his chair with eyes closed while Gilbert
    listed the appointments asked for.</p>
  <p align="left">There was no change. Even the number of pens, pencils, books,
    papers, and odds and ends were the same as Kenneth himself had listed them.</p>
  <p align="left">He sat up straight again. Then he sighed and said apologetically:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me utterly daft, but I&rsquo;ve got
    to find that Purloined Letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Mr. Carlisle, keep on looking. I&rsquo;m
    going home now, and I&rsquo;ll be back this evening for that further inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He went away, and Kenneth Carlisle sat staring at the library
    furnishings.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_9">Chapter 9</a><br>But The Clue Was Right There</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">NOW a Purloined Letter is not an easy thing to find.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course we are using &ldquo;Purloined Letter&rdquo; as a
    generic term for a thing hidden from the searchers by the simple device of
    placing it in the most conspicuous and easily seen position possible.</p>
  <p align="left">In the old game of Hide the Thimble the clever hider did not
    tuck the thimble under a sofa pillow or beneath the edge of a rug. He set
    it aloft on the chimneypiece or on the floor in a far corner of the room.
    In plain sight but unobservable because of more important objects near it
    which distracted the seeker&rsquo;s attention.</p>
  <p align="left">The Purloined Letter that the detectives so eagerly sought
    was in a letter rack in full view.</p>
  <p align="left">And just so, in the present instance, the clue that would have
    disclosed everything to Kenneth Carlisle was in front of his eyes. As his
    glance roved despairingly round the great room, noting, he thought, every
    object therein, the secret of the crime was entirely visible, the evidence
    of the dastardly deed right under his very nose.</p>
  <p align="left">But he was blind to its presence, deaf to its message. His
    vacant stare traveled from wall to wall, from floor to ceiling, and&mdash;remained
    vacant.</p>
  <p align="left">But, if he had seen, if he had caught on to the broad hint
    vouchsafed him by the freakish fate that guides the destiny of an inquiring
    detective, then&mdash;well, then this story could not have been written.</p>
  <p align="left">As it was, he stared about hopelessly, aimlessly, and at last
    told himself it was time to dress for dinner.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude passed through the hall, and seeing Kenneth still there,
    came in and snapped on a few lights.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fenn, I suppose, has had orders to keep out of this
    room,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Or he would have put on the lights. Well, old
    chap, we have a hard nut to crack, haven&rsquo;t we? Where do you stand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About where I did at first. It&rsquo;s a vicious circle.
    I never knew what that meant before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably not. But it runs round in my head like this.
    Nobody can get in or out of a locked room. Somebody shot Mr. Carleton. Therefore
    somebody did get in or out of a locked room. You&rsquo;ve put it in a nutshell.
    Now, can you crack the nut?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to. Look here, Claude, and don&rsquo;t
    answer unless you choose. Are you in love with Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and then the response
    came frankly enough.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s really why I was going away. I felt
    I wasn&rsquo;t playing the game with Dad to stay here. I don&rsquo;t say
    that Polly cares for me other than in a friendly fashion, but I&rsquo;m crazy
    about her. So I thought the change of scene and the diversions of Hollywood
    might be a good thing for me. There&rsquo;s no need to broadcast this, is
    there? I&rsquo;ve told you because you asked me, and I&rsquo;d rather you
    understood, but&mdash;well, I suppose you can see how it would impress old
    Gilbert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meaning that he&rsquo;d at once think I was instrumental
    in this murder business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you were on your way to California.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure I was. But he&rsquo;d cook up a plan whereby I
    could employ a gunman or somebody to do my dirty work for me. Oh, I&rsquo;m
    not a coward, but I&rsquo;ve read books where the obvious suspect is framed
    or railroaded or whatever you call it. And I&rsquo;m grieved enough at this
    awful tragedy without having the blame for it cast on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why call yourself an obvious suspect? I should think
    you were the only one who is scot-free from suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a thought! What about old Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In the r&ocirc;le of criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Somebody&rsquo;s got to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s consider him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s, but not now. It&rsquo;s getting on
    for dinner time. Run away and tog. I&rsquo;m going myself in a few moments.
    Come down a trifle early for a good old-fashioned cocktail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude seated himself at the library desk and pulled open a
    stationery drawer.</p>
  <p align="left">A backward glance showed Carlisle he was about to write a letter
    or note, but as he was now in every way his father&rsquo;s representative
    he had a right to use, even monopolize, the library.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish I could suspect him,&rdquo; Kenneth mused as
    he dressed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so obvious, and nine times out of ten the obvious
    suspect is the right one. I don&rsquo;t see how he could have managed it,
    but then I don&rsquo;t see how anybody could have managed it. And his motive
    is perfect. He wanted his father&rsquo;s fortune and his father&rsquo;s wife.
    Now he can have them both. But, hang it, he played the part of a man when
    he vamoosed because he feared he&rsquo;d trespass on his dad&rsquo;s preserves.
    And, incidentally, I don&rsquo;t see how he could shoot from a moving train,
    nor how his hired gunman could get into the locked room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But Kenneth Carlisle whistled softly as he completed his toilette.</p>
  <p align="left">He had a case after his own heart. Sympathetic by nature, he
    regretted the violent passing of Manning Carleton; but, after all, he was
    a detective, not a condoling friend, and what detective wouldn&rsquo;t welcome
    the problem of a sealed room?</p>
  <p align="left">And a problem that had to have a solution. It couldn&rsquo;t
    be a suicide, a possibility that often mars a sealed-room proposition.</p>
  <p align="left">The absence of a weapon proved a real murderer, a flesh-and-blood
    murderer, for there was no sign of a mechanical death-dealing instrument.</p>
  <p align="left">Except&mdash;well, what did that marred telephone book mean,
    anyway? A vague, hazy idea wandered round his brain which connected that
    queerly indented cover and successive pages with an explosive of some sort.
    Nothing else he could think of would have force enough to make that deep
    depression. Unless&mdash;a heavy hammer. Well it was very puzzling and very
    interesting.</p>
  <p align="left">He went downstairs to find most of the household already in
    the drawing room.</p>
  <p align="left">Cocktails were served, and the conversation, though in a subdued
    key, was in no way connected with the tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">The dinner hour was quiet but not uncheerful. Probably everyone
    present thought of the night before, when almost the same group sat round
    the table. Except for the two Mortlakes and Manning Carleton himself, it
    was the same.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude took his father&rsquo;s chair without question. Pauline,
    of course, retained her own at the head of the table, and Miss Violet sat
    at the side, as always.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude was a charming host. Kindly, affable, and courteous,
    he now and then made a little jest or smiling repartee that relieved the
    strain and brought about a feeling of camaraderie.</p>
  <p align="left">Clearly he felt it incumbent on him to fill his father&rsquo;s
    place well and capably, and he bent his energies to that end.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline, too, was sweet and gentle. She curbed her usually
    spontaneous outbursts of mirth and only smiled demurely upon occasion.</p>
  <p align="left">Violet was distinctly sad and heartbroken.</p>
  <p align="left">She said almost nothing and turned her sorrowful eyes on the
    speakers in turn, as if wondering how they could talk casually.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott, on the other hand, was in fine spirits. Carlisle
    was shocked at this, wondering if the old gentleman was pleased at thought
    of his forthcoming bequest.</p>
  <p align="left">One at the table who showed a distinct change of demeanor from
    the night before was Peter Gregg.</p>
  <p align="left">From a quiet, deferential, and rather shy secretary, he had
    blossomed out into an assertive, almost bumptious chap, who frequently stated
    his views without invitation and even at times interrupted other speakers.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude looked at him in a sort of amused bewilderment which
    Kenneth noted and set down to Claude&rsquo;s credit. He had feared Claude
    might openly resent the secretary&rsquo;s forwardness.</p>
  <p align="left">But Peter had had an extra cocktail and now was taking a second
    glass of the light wine that accompanied the dinner.</p>
  <p align="left">It suddenly dawned on Carlisle what the occasion was. The death
    of Manning Carleton had automatically raised the embargo on Gregg&rsquo;s
    engagement to Emily Austen.</p>
  <p align="left">For Pauline had no objections to this betrothal, and the young
    people were not likely to delay.</p>
  <p align="left">A glance at Miss Austen herself, who now sat next to Peter,
    confirmed this belief in Kenneth&rsquo;s mind, and also the whole circumstance,
    again automatically, pushed Peter into the r&ocirc;le of suspect!</p>
  <p align="left">Could he have so desired his employer&rsquo;s death as to help
    to bring it about? It meant fortune and happiness for the young pair&mdash;but,
    no, the very idea was absurd!</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth sighed at the hopelessness of his quest and let his
    glance go on round the table.</p>
  <p align="left">Z&eacute;lie and Don Randall sat side by side, and they seemed
    to have excluded the rest and were devoting their attention entirely to one
    another.</p>
  <p align="left">It was plain to be seen that they were bored with the situation
    and took no interest in the search for the murderer.</p>
  <p align="left">Moreover, they were both too sophisticated and worldly wise
    to waste too much sympathy on the beautiful and wealthy young widow.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline&rsquo;s sweet sad smiles and drooping eyelashes didn&rsquo;t
    hoodwink them, and they knew that, though she had been a devoted, faithful,
    and kindly wife, Manning Carleton was not a girl&rsquo;s ideal of a romantic
    lover.</p>
  <p align="left">If she cared for Manning Carleton&rsquo;s son she certainly
    had not shown it in word or in attitude. Her demeanor toward Claude was the
    perfection of friendliness, and now there seemed a trifle of new deference
    in her manner as was right and proper to be shown to the new head of the
    house.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth, knowing of Claude&rsquo;s affection for her, looked
    for any meaning glance or subtle smile from the lovely face, but in vain.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline, in soft, fluttering black chiffon, was very sweet
    and appealing. Her delicate white neck and arms seemed all the fairer for
    the enfolding black, and her golden daffodil of a head was upheld with a
    gentle dignity that she felt was due the House of Carleton.</p>
  <p align="left">She couldn&rsquo;t be suspected, anyway, Kenneth thought, gazing
    at the charming picture she made; and then, quickly rising with the rest,
    followed her to the drawing room.</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert and his aides awaited them, and Z&eacute;lie sighed
    afresh at thought of more of the eternal quizzing.</p>
  <p align="left">Not so Carlisle: he was keen to listen to the definite and
    final answers to the inspector&rsquo;s questions.</p>
  <p align="left">One of the first disclosures was the reading of the will.</p>
  <p align="left">The lawyers of the Carleton estate had sent a representative
    and a copy of Manning Carleton&rsquo;s last will and testament.</p>
  <p align="left">There was nothing surprising in the document.</p>
  <p align="left">One third of the estate was bequeathed to Pauline and one third
    to Claude.</p>
  <p align="left">Two hundred thousand dollars was left to Miss Violet, and also
    the house in which they were living.</p>
  <p align="left">The other house was left to Claude.</p>
  <p align="left">Fifty thousand dollars was the sum bequeathed to Professor
    Abel Scott, to be used as he should see fit, for his work or his pleasure.</p>
  <p align="left">Ten thousand dollars went to Fenn for faithful service.</p>
  <p align="left">Ten thousand dollars to Peter Gregg and instruction that the
    best of references be given him for future use in securing a position.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, to his old friend and distant relative Donald Randall,
    Carleton left the sum of ten thousand dollars.</p>
  <p align="left">And to Z&eacute;lie D&rsquo;Orsay, beloved friend of the testator&rsquo;s
    wife, also ten thousand dollars.</p>
  <p align="left">It seemed to Kenneth that there were many ten thousand-dollar
    bequests flying about, but he realized they were small fry compared with
    the main legacies. For the testator was many times a millionaire, and his
    wealth had to be parceled out.</p>
  <p align="left">Many minor gifts were listed, and at last Claude was named
    as residuary legatee.</p>
  <p align="left">Z&eacute;lie was ecstatic. She vowed she had no idea that she
    would receive anything, and she was like a child with an unexpected gift.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott was scarcely less jubilant. He rejoiced openly
    in his good fortune and speculated on how soon he could realize his capital.</p>
  <p align="left">The others said little or nothing about the matter.</p>
  <p align="left">Emily Austen, who received nothing, might be thought to look
    disappointed, but the girl usually looked a trifle melancholy, so one couldn&rsquo;t
    tell.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the inspector said at last, &ldquo;I will
    ask your attention, please. This is not a time for amenities or compliments.
    We are investigating a murder, a particularly brutal murder and a mysterious
    one. We must leave no stone unturned, no question unasked, to find the criminal.
    Therefore, when I put leading queries, do not, I pray, jump to the conclusion
    that you are suspected of complicity or guilty knowledge. These things must
    be probed into, and there is no way, at the present stage, but to inquire
    of you here before me. And let me state that in general, it is our custom
    to note who may have opportunity and who may have motive. To have either
    or both of these by no means calls for accusation or even suspicion. But
    the questions must be asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As to motive: It has frequently been stated that there
    are only a few certain motives for murder. This may or may not be true. It
    is aside from our present consideration. The principal motive for a premeditated
    murder is a desire for money. A murder inspired by love or hate, a so-called
    <em>crime passionel</em>, is more often done on the spur of the moment, seldom after
    long and careful planning. Now, all of you who are here before me have benefited
    or will benefit by the terms of Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s will. This gives each
    of you what may be called, in criminal parlance, a motive.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As I told you, you are not to be annoyed or offended
    at this statement. It is no aspersion or implication, it is a plain statement
    of fact. The next most important question refers to opportunity. It is this
    on which I will now question you. You will each be prepared to tell me exactly
    where you were last night after the party here was over, and especially at
    the hours between three and five o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The faces of those assembled showed blank looks, sour looks,
    puzzled looks, and haughty looks.</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn had been summoned, and with some of the other upper servants
    sat in the hall just outside the drawing-room door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will call on you, first, Mr. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude gave a start, as if surprised, but quickly recovered
    his poise and said, easily enough:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was on the train. I took the two o&rsquo;clock, all
    sleepers, on the Pennsylvania Railroad. I had made my reservations some time
    previously, and I had Compartment B on the car named Taormina. I retired
    as soon as possible, and at three o&rsquo;clock, I must have been&mdash;well,
    nearing Trenton. I can tell you exactly by looking at a time-table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Approximately will do, Mr. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we struck Philadelphia about five, I think, so
    I was along the road then. I slept pretty soundly, waking only when the train
    stopped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can prove this, Mr. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Inspector. I can give you my tickets,
    I have them still, because I didn&rsquo;t try to cash them in when I got
    the telegram telling me what had happened at home. I think the porter on
    the train would know me, also the conductor, but as I got on board at 2 A.
    M. and off at Harrisburg at 7 A.M. I didn&rsquo;t see any of my fellow passengers,
    nor did I go into the dining car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I understand, Mr. Carleton. Where did you receive the
    telegram?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At Harrisburg, about quarter after seven. I dressed
    and left the train there. I was not hurried as there is a long wait there.
    The porter will remember the incident, I am sure. He was a short, stubby
    chap, with two gold teeth, of which he seemed exceedingly proud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where did you go in Harrisburg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;First I went to the ticket office and learned that I
    couldn&rsquo;t get a train back to New York until nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock.
    So I went to a small hotel, the Aylesbury House, and took a room there. I
    had a bath and a shave, and then I had breakfast. It seemed long to train
    time, but it passed at last, and I took the train for home. I reached New
    York something after half-past three, jumped in a taxi, and came straight
    here, where I&rsquo;ve been ever since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector nodded his head and with a wave of his hand dismissed
    Claude.</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert then took the others in succession and learned from
    them, in a more or less accurate account, the comings and goings of the household
    throughout the night, a story with which the reader is already familiar.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle listened attentively to this, for in his opinion
    it was on these accounts there must hang all the law and the prophets. The
    prophets, of course, representing the theories and prognostications of the
    listening policemen.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet, the more the private investigator heard, the more he was
    bewildered, and the more he was amazed that the inspector would accept the
    garbled and contradictory narratives put forth, apparently in good faith,
    by the speakers.</p>
  <p align="left">Professor Scott declared he was not downstairs at all after
    he went up to bed about three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p align="left">Being confronted by Fenn, who timidly reminded the old man
    that he came down about ten past three and wanted to speak to Mr. Carleton,
    Scott still denied it and would not budge from his negative statement.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline denied that she had been downstairs from the time she
    went to bed, about three, until she came down at five to look for her husband.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet told in halting, uncertain phrases, of her starting
    downstairs right after Professor Scott came up. She told of Don Randall&rsquo;s
    coming down and joining her while they smoked. She said that he heard someone
    in the boudoir, and thinking it Pauline, he scooted in there. But it proved
    to be Miss D&rsquo;Orsay, and the young man was badly fooled.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude&rsquo;s face grew more and more distressed as Miss Violet
    ran on in this vein.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aunt Vi,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    gossip, just state plain facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The facts are plain enough,&rdquo; she retorted,  &ldquo;plain
    as the nose on your face. I know what I know. You keep still, Claude. You
    weren&rsquo;t here, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have seen what I saw if you had
    been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did you see, Miss Carleton?&rdquo; asked Gilbert
    suavely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said abruptly, and then cackled,
    like an old woman.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude knew her in this mood, and knew it was hopeless to try
    to do anything with her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lots of goings on, there were,&rdquo; she said, chuckling. &ldquo;A
    pair tucked away in the boudoir, and another pair back there in Miss Austen&rsquo;s
    little room. Then Don, here, making for the dining room and going to sleep
    there. Oh, yes, people all over the house last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They do seem to have been,&rdquo; and the inspector
    smiled indulgently at her. He understood gossipy old women, and the fact
    that they were wealthy and lived on Fifth Avenue made little difference,
    he opined.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, we must get seriously to work to set the hour more
    accurately. Miss Carleton, you saw most of the prowlers&mdash;was your sister-in-law,
    Mrs. Carleton, downstairs at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The old lady drew herself up stiffly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She says she wasn&rsquo;t, and we Carletons do not lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you, Miss Violet, at half-past three?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was hanging over the banisters,&rdquo; was the calm
    reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what did you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing but Don Randall going into the boudoir, where
    Z&eacute;lie was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sometime later I saw the two secretaries, Miss Austen
    and Mr. Gregg, coming along up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How late?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was about four,&rdquo; Peter Gregg informed him a
    little defiantly.</p>
  <p align="left">This sort of uncertain fencing went on for a long time.</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector&rsquo;s expert stenographer took it all down,
    with added remarks that fell in whispers from Gilbert&rsquo;s lips, to be
    considered later on.</p>
  <p align="left">Finally he concluded he could learn no more from his audience.</p>
  <p align="left">He called on Fenn, but he was as noncommittal as some of the
    others. He didn&rsquo;t refuse to answer, but his answers amounted to little
    or nothing.</p>
  <p align="left">Then the inspector told them that any who chose could go to
    their homes.</p>
  <p align="left">Z&eacute;lie and Don Randall declared their intention of going
    next day, and this left only Carlisle and Professor Scott to go at once.</p>
  <p align="left">The professor was by no means anxious to leave such comfortable
    surroundings and fished for an invitation to return. But he greatly wanted
    to get his treasure, the skeleton, and Kenneth had promised to get it around
    to him that night.</p>
  <p align="left">The two went off in a taxicab, Carlisle having agreed to see
    Gilbert early next morning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There you are, sir,&rdquo; Kenneth said, as he helped
    the old gentleman out. &ldquo;Now, you go and get a space cleared for your
    visitor, and I&rsquo;ll have him round inside twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He went home and bade the taxi man wait for him.</p>
  <p align="left">He went up in the elevator to his own floor and let himself
    into his apartment.</p>
  <p align="left">The faithful Carter was in waiting, and Kenneth stared blankly
    at the place where he had left the skeleton.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is the thing?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What have
    you done with it, Carter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The man stared at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They took it, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;About seven
    o&rsquo;clock, it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who took it? Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The men you sent for it, sir,&rdquo; declared the imperturbable
    Carter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I sent no men. What did they look like? Why did you
    give it up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One was from Headquarters, sir. In plain clothes, he
    was, but he had his badge and he said to hand it over. The other was a big
    fellow who helped move the box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you telephone me to see if it was all
    right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, I did suggest it, sir. But they said the telephones
    at Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s house was so busy and so congested, I couldn&rsquo;t
    get to you. And he said Headquarters ordered it, and for me to be quick about
    it. So I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_10">Chapter 10</a><br>Plenty of Suspects</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">THE next day Carlisle was down at the Carleton house early.
    None of the family was about, he saw only one or two housemaids and Fenn,
    who let him in.</p>
  <p align="left">He went into the library and found Stokes there, who said he
    expected Mr. Gilbert any moment.</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector came, and the two investigators looked gravely
    at each other.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot to be done,&rdquo; Gilbert said. &ldquo;Young
    Carleton&rsquo;s trip must be carefully checked, the Pantaloon Club must
    be looked into, the Mortlakes will stand further questioning, and I&rsquo;m
    not pleased with old man Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s none too well pleased himself this morning,&rdquo; and
    Kenneth shook his head.</p>
  <p align="left">It was when Carlisle grew puzzled or very serious that he looked
    like a movie actor. Unconsciously he fell into the poses he had used in the
    studio, and now he sat by the desk, his head resting on one hand and the
    other arm stretched out toward the writing paraphernalia. He was not in the
    swivel desk chair&mdash;by tacit consent they avoided that&mdash;and he sat
    in a small chair at the end of the big desk.</p>
  <p align="left">With a graceful gesture he drew his arms together, folded them,
    and laying them on the desk, dropped his chin upon them, his eyes rolling
    up to the inspector&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The skeleton got away,&rdquo; he said morosely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it was articulated,&rdquo; smiled Gilbert,  &ldquo;but
    I didn&rsquo;t know it was able to walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, it was carried off.&rdquo; Kenneth straightened
    up to tell his story. &ldquo;It was at my place, and two men came and took
    it away. They told my man I had sent them, and one of them showed a badge
    and said he was from Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Uniform?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, plain clothes. All fake, of course, they flashed
    any sort of badge, but it shows we&rsquo;re up against something outside
    these four walls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps. Perhaps not. They could have been emissaries
    of anyone here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but who here wants the skeleton? They all let it
    go most willingly. You don&rsquo;t think Miss Violet wants it back? Well,
    anyway, old Scott is pretty mad about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the only one, I think, who felt friendly
    toward the bony visitor. But does it really matter much? We have the written
    messages and the boards with the address on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. I don&rsquo;t want the thing, I&rsquo;m
    glad to be rid of it. But why do they want it? Whoever sent for it, I mean.
    To my mind it proves that it was no joke, it has something definite to do
    with the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; Gilbert looked puzzled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but nobody is going to the trouble
    and danger of impersonating a policeman except for some strong reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Something in that. Did you get a description of the
    men who went after it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As good as Carter could give it. The plainclothes man,
    as he calls him, was a slim, youngish chap, but of a wiry, strong build.
    The other was just a big husky fellow of the porter type. Carter couldn&rsquo;t
    say much about their features or faces. He refused to let the thing go until
    they said it was a police order; then he caved in. He wanted to talk to me,
    but they said he couldn&rsquo;t get me as the telephones here were over-busy
    and congested with waiting messages. Which was true, as you know. But how
    did those men know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, anybody trying to get this number would know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, but the people after the skeleton wouldn&rsquo;t
    be calling this house. Now, why do they want the skeleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Forty-&rsquo;leven reasons for that. Perhaps they merely
    borrowed it for their mad prank and had to return it to the doctor they borrowed
    it from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then they would have come here and frankly asked for
    it. If it wasn&rsquo;t the work of those Pantaloon fellows, it was the work
    of some wrong uns. I mean somebody mixed up with the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think how the murderer could be mixed
    up with the skeleton business.&rdquo; The inspector frowned thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
    mean I can&rsquo;t make any theory fit such a proposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor I. Also, I can&rsquo;t make any theory fit any proposition.
    I&rsquo;m sure there never was such a baffling case. I&rsquo;ve often sighed
    for a murder in a locked room to tackle, but I never shall again! I don&rsquo;t
    care for &rsquo;em at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your pet suspect to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; said Kenneth promptly. &ldquo;Claude,
    first, last, and all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all from you! If you say, &lsquo;How
    did he get in?&rsquo; I resign from the Force, pronto!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Claude is absurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it?&rdquo; Kenneth turned serious. &ldquo;But
    his trip must be checked and very carefully checked. You see he had a double
    motive. He&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t broadcast this, but he&rsquo;s decently
    in love with Mrs. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you mean, decently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He went away because of his growing interest in her.
    He told me so. Rather all right of him&mdash;if he didn&rsquo;t come back
    and bump off his old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In moments of stress Carlisle abandoned his more punctilious
    diction for the slang he had picked up in his studio days.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s easily settled. Stokes, take
    up the business. Here&rsquo;s a careful list of the trains he took, the hotel
    at Harrisburg he stopped at, and his Pullman reservations both ways. Now
    you must have a photograph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he take a compartment coming home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, he had a chair. And among his tickets and checks
    was a Pullman stub for the parlor-car seat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where can you get a photograph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can ask him, but there&rsquo;s no use calling him
    in here. I think I&rsquo;ll commandeer that one on the mantel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A good portrait of Claude was in a silver frame.</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector removed the card from the frame, handed it to
    Stokes, and told him to go to it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do I go to Harrisburg?&rdquo; asked the serious-looking
    detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Up to you. If you can do the business by telegraph and
    by seeing the porters and conductors at this end of the line, all right.
    If you have to go to Harrisburg, go ahead. I give you full discretion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With a grave salute the officer went away.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Splendid man,&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;I can trust
    him with any assignment. I shall miss him here, though. But I have Cooper
    to take his place, and he&rsquo;s good too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, that will settle Claude&rsquo;s hash. Next, I&rsquo;d
    greatly like to suspect the charming widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My hat, man! You&rsquo;re aiming high!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you for not saying, &lsquo;How did she get in?&rsquo;  But,
    aside from suspecting, we ought to turn our attention to that little problem
    of entrance. I suppose you realize that the murderer must have come in through
    the Mortlakes&rsquo; door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, no, I can&rsquo;t say I realize that. What about
    coming in at the hall door, or the door that gives into the cloakroom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve examined them very closely, and I&rsquo;m
    ready to stake my reputation that neither of them was opened by any sort
    of wire or clever instrument made for the purpose of turning a key from the
    other side of the lock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re staking a great deal. But Stokes agrees
    with you, and he&rsquo;s an old hand at picking locks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it looks that way to me. But if you ask how anybody
    came in from the other house and went back again with those massive bolts
    shot, then I give it up. I&rsquo;ve thought about a door, there are such,
    that is locked, but the whole frame swings on hinges.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know. A trick door. But you see this door was
    used for years as an ordinary door, and then, when the brother died and strangers
    came, the door was simply locked and bolted. There was no occasion to have
    a fake door built.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;ve examined closely for concealed hinges
    on the frame. There&rsquo;s nothing of the sort, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. And isn&rsquo;t it easier and simpler to think somehow
    these two other doors might have been manipulated, each having but one lock,
    than that door, with a heavy bolt on each side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course. But granting one of these doors, the
    murderer was one of the family. If he came in through the other house he
    could have been a rank outsider.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not Mortlake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to see Mortlake in this thing. What&rsquo;s
    his motive? And why cut up such a shindy about it? He could have got at Manning
    Carleton any day in the week, without troubling this bolted door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So could anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, a stranger would have been noticed. Mortlake was
    in and out of here a lot. He&mdash;he had business with Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aha! Holding out on me, are you, young man? Come clean,
    now, or I&rsquo;ll run you in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t proved it up to the hilt, but
    I have reason to think Mortlake was Carleton&rsquo;s bootlegger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A motive could be dug out of that, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, maybe. No evidence so far of same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you catch on to this missing link?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I noticed at supper on New Year&rsquo;s Eve that when
    the champagne was first served Carleton tasted it critically and then nodded
    at Mortlake. Not a nod as of drinking his good health, or that, but a nod
    of approval and satisfaction. I wondered then if Mortlake hadn&rsquo;t something
    to do with the acquisition of the wine, which was really very good. Then
    I found some memoranda in Carleton&rsquo;s desk referring to bootleg products
    and initialed J. M. Also, I tackled Fenn on the subject, and more from what
    he didn&rsquo;t say than from what he did, I am pretty well assured Mortlake
    is the good provider.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doubtless you&rsquo;re right&mdash;seems to me good
    evidence. But that doesn&rsquo;t make Mortlake a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True, worse luck! He&rsquo;d be an ideal murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, he&rsquo;s too fat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no prescribed weight for murderers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not officially, no. Now, let&rsquo;s get around to the
    professorial proposition. How about Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Inept, inapt, inopportune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too erudite for a detective, speak plain
    English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t erudition. It&rsquo;s characterization.
    Scotty is all those things. He couldn&rsquo;t engineer a murder to save his
    life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why save his life if he&rsquo;s going to get caught
    in a murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No murderer expects to get caught. They&rsquo;re an
    optimistic lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Scott wanted that money terribly. He&rsquo;s openly
    delighted at Carleton&rsquo;s death. But I can&rsquo;t see him going about
    shooting up people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. But he lied. He said he didn&rsquo;t come downstairs
    after he went up to bed at 3 A. M. But he did. Miss Violet saw him go down
    very shortly after he had gone up. She told me all about it. Also, Fenn admitted
    that the professor came down and tried very hard to make Carleton let him
    in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He talked to him, then?&rdquo; Gilbert looked surprised.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Scott begged for a few minutes&rsquo;  conversation,
    but Carleton told him he must wait until morning. So Scott rather peevishly
    dragged back upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know about the peeve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fenn said so. He was sorry for the poor old man, and
    yet of course he could do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does Fenn think the old chap returned later on and did
    the shooting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fenn is the most blissfully ignorant person on the footstool.
    He knows nothing, thinks nothing, surmises nothing. The Japanese monkeys
    have nothing on Fenn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid not. Fenn knows his place too well as the
    perfect butler, to shoot up his master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But butlers always do it in the story books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not nowadays. When did you read one last? Why, the butler
    hasn&rsquo;t been the criminal for years! Except in <em>The Tremayne Case</em>, and
    there were mitigating circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, I didn&rsquo;t take much stock in Fenn, anyway.
    Now, how about&mdash;as you were saying&mdash;the golden and beautiful Pauline?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush, breathe it not aloud! But, though hiding it well,
    she is relieved that her elderly spouse is gathered to his fathers, and when
    a decent interval is past she will console herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If she waits that long.&rdquo; Gilbert was frankly incredulous
    of it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s a stickler for the conventions.
    Now, I haven&rsquo;t been officially notified that she returns the regard
    in which Claude holds her, but I fancy she does. Claude&rsquo;s a personable
    chap, and she&rsquo;s a beauty. They each come into a large fortune by this
    death, and they may desire to consolidate those fortunes. On the other hand,
    she may have other plans for her own future. I don&rsquo;t know. But I searched
    Claude&rsquo;s desk drawers, up in his room. I had to do it hastily, very
    little time, but I found in a secret drawer a snapshot of Pauline. Very lovely
    and all that. I put it back where I found it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Find anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only some rubbishy toys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Toys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Those white metal trinkets the candy stores give away
    with purchases. There was a star, a goblet, a dove, a heart, a parrot, and
    a Cupid. Trucky lot, but, hidden there with Pauline&rsquo;s picture, they
    seemed to be souvenirs or keepsakes of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not till I&rsquo;ve wiped him off my list. My suspect
    list is a long one, and several must be scratched off, but not till they&rsquo;re
    proved ninety-nine per cent pure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. Is the stately though sharp-tongued Miss
    Violet on your list?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well, no. And I may have to eliminate Claude, for
    the same reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;<em>Noblesse oblige</em>, if that conveys anything to you. But
    Miss Violet talked to me about Claude and herself being the last of the Carletons.
    It seems the name is dying out. And also, she gave me to understand, and
    seriously, too, that a Carleton couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;positively<em> couldn&rsquo;t</em>
    do anything that would blot the scutcheon. She wasn&rsquo;t talking through
    her hat, she was in dead earnest. And also some things Claude said to me,
    before he went away, I mean, gave me an insight into his character, which
    makes it seem impossible he could commit a crime&mdash;in the family circle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet you suspect him.&rdquo; Gilbert frowned uncertainly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t. I want to, because of his double motive,
    but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, never mind him now. Stokes will see to his alibi.
    That will settle it. Now, Randall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hardly enough motive. To be sure, he got his bequest,
    but who didn&rsquo;t? We can&rsquo;t hang everybody who was mentioned in
    the will. But Randall is far from energetic, and I can&rsquo;t think he trumped
    up this ingenious scheme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he too is in love with the yellow-haired siren,
    and perhaps in love with her yellow ducats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your list is getting as long as my own. Well, I&rsquo;ll
    admit that mine takes in everybody in this house and nobody out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not even the Mortlakes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Only the immediate inmates of
    this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The two secretaries, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think they will bear some investigation. They&rsquo;re
    openly engaged now. Mrs. Carleton has sanctioned it, and they&rsquo;re basking
    in each other&rsquo;s smiles. But&mdash;did the Perfect Secretary help things
    along?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can hardly think it, for I can&rsquo;t see how he
    could. But he had what may be called the inside track. He knew all there
    was to know about Carleton, his plans, and his actions. He could have come
    down here that night after he went upstairs at four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They say the murder occurred at three-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not so close as that. They say between three and four,
    and there&rsquo;s always room for uncertainty either way. You know that as
    well as I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course. That finishes the list then, outside
    the minor servants, and&mdash;oh, yes, one more: Mademoiselle Z&eacute;lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Cut her out. She&rsquo;s a vamp, an adventuress, a hellcat,
    even, but she&rsquo;s no murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s too afraid of her own skin. She&rsquo;s
    wary, and she has secrets that she must guard carefully. She&rsquo;s a bit
    vague about her goings and comings that night, but she didn&rsquo;t kill
    Carleton. Why, she&rsquo;s a gold digger and she was prospecting in his mine.
    And she was making headway. Even with such a lovely and charming wife as
    he had, he let his gaze stray now and then to the luring Z&eacute;lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know a lot!&rdquo; Gilbert looked half scornful
    and half admiring. But he smiled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Carlisle, &ldquo;I do. I learned
    a lot at that supper New Year&rsquo;s Eve. But, by golly, man, if I&rsquo;d
    known what was due to happen later on I&rsquo;d have learned a whole lot
    more!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then we cross off Z&eacute;lie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As a suspect, I do, yes. But you hammer at her, if you
    like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve enough hammering to do. Now, let&rsquo;s
    check up. We must grill our suspects with what tact and skill we possess&mdash;if
    any. Stokes is off to check up on Claude. I&rsquo;ll set others on the trail
    of that skeleton business. Who will visit the Pantaloon Club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will, if you say so. I know some of the members.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one for that, then. I&rsquo;ll look
    into Scott&rsquo;s general standing, professional and social. I&rsquo;ll
    set sleuths on the Mortlakes. Also on the two turtledove secretaries as to
    their outside life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good Lord, you&rsquo;ll have the whole force on this
    case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So much the better. Then, suppose you take a hand with
    the three Carletons. I mean, you&rsquo;re by way of being friendly with the
    family, and if you&rsquo;ve any Machiavellianism about you, you can learn
    a lot of things while asking about something else. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see I&rsquo;m a dub at this game! I thought I knew
    something, but I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have originality, perception, and logic. Don&rsquo;t
    underestimate those qualities. You&rsquo;ll probably reach the solution of
    this thing before I do. Now, for a little more search of this baffling room,
    in hopes of unearthing a clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always boasted that I scorned clues,&rdquo;  Carlisle
    exclaimed, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d welcome the ash of a Trichinopoly cigar,
    or a bit of Irish tweed torn from the murderer&rsquo;s coat sleeve!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my best and most expert searchers go
    through this desk, and there&rsquo;s nothing in it to help us any. I&rsquo;ve
    had expert carpenters and joiners and locksmiths go over the walls and floors
    and woodwork, but they vow there&rsquo;s no chance of a hidden joint or lock
    or panel&mdash;in fact, nothing but what may be seen on the surface.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There never is, in a locked-room mystery,&rdquo; said
    Kenneth mournfully. &ldquo;I wish now it had been a plain, straight, bashed-on-the-head-with-a-blunt
    implement type. I thought I&rsquo;d love the locked-room angle, but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, come, now. Think of the credit you&rsquo;ll get
    when you find the solution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lead me to it, then. I say, what do you think of the
    queer smash on the telephone book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think it has nothing to do with the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But it must have. Both Fenn and Gregg say the book was
    in normal condition that evening, and I saw it next morning, and it was all
    fussed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector reached for the book and studied the cover.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t even theorize about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor I. But it holds the secret. If we can find out what
    it means, we can work out all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poppycock. Easy to say&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me names! It&rsquo;s a clue&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    why I spurned it at foist. But I humbly beg its pardon. It is a clue, and
    a good one. Now, Inspector, it mustn&rsquo;t be spirited away. It will be,
    sure as shooting, unless we prevent it. The criminal must know he left it,
    he must know we will find it, and unintelligible though it looks now, I shall
    yet read its cryptic message.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle&rsquo;s eyes were glowing, and Gilbert saw how much
    in earnest he was, and forbore to chaff.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well he said quietly, &ldquo;I will give orders
    that the guard in here shall watch it specially. It can&rsquo;t get away
    then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. Now for a squint at the bolt of that pesky
    door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They went together and stood staring at the heavy but simply
    made brass bolt. It was a trifle ornate, having an embossed edge and knob.
    But it worked in ordinary fashion. The long end of the slot was on the door,
    the short end on the jamb. The bar slid easily enough, though not loosely.</p>
  <p align="left">It showed no trace of scratches or marring of any sort. There
    was no trace or smell of oil nor any sign that it had been used recently.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet, of course, there was no sign that it hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle knelt down on the floor and tried to look under the
    door. There was the merest crack of space between the door and the sill,
    but the soft pile of the carpet choked it, and anyway there was not room
    enough to slip a key under, or anything of that sort.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth got a thin-bladed paper cutter from the desk and found
    that it would slip under an inch or so, and then the nap of the carpet choked
    it and stopped further progress.</p>
  <p align="left">He rose disgustedly, brushed off his knees, and declared he
    was going to indulge in a fit of sulks.</p>
  <p align="left">He prepared for his indulgence by selecting a comfortable armchair,
    providing himself with a roomy ash tray and plenty of matches, and went into
    the silences.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_11">Chapter 11</a><br>Pretty Polly</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">NEW YEAR&rsquo;S EVE had been on Tuesday.</p>
  <p align="left">It was now Saturday morning, and though the police detectives
    and our own private investigator had worked faithfully and continuously,
    they had little if anything to show for it.</p>
  <p align="left">To be sure, they had eliminated some suspects and had solved
    some minor problems, but the great questions were still unanswered and the
    real criminal as yet unknown.</p>
  <p align="left">They had been somewhat hampered in their work in the house
    by reason of the preparations and ceremonies of the funeral. A man of Manning
    Carleton&rsquo;s standing could not be unceremoniously bundled back into
    the bosom of Mother Earth, he had to be accorded the pomp and circumstance
    that was his due.</p>
  <p align="left">And so on Friday, the day of the funeral, the great drawing
    room was filled with flowers, crowded with chairs, melodious with sweet music,
    and solemn with the intoned service.</p>
  <p align="left">But by Saturday the house was normal again, all traces of the
    elaborate function had disappeared, and Claude Carleton, with an air of quiet
    dignity, came to the library where those in charge of the case awaited him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A report is due you, Mr. Carleton,&rdquo; the inspector
    said slowly, &ldquo;and then we must have a conference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That suits me, Inspector. I want to get the matter along
    now, as expeditiously as possible. What are your latest developments?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, to begin with, Mr. Carleton, we have checked up
    on your own movements while you were out of town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; and Claude gave a good-natured smile.  &ldquo;And
    does my alibi hold water?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Not a leak in it. You took that 2 A. M.
    train as you stated, and the gateman here in New York remembered you, as
    did also the porter who carried your bags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you mean, remembered me? Excuse my curiosity,
    but I&rsquo;m interested to know how you work this game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, we had a photograph of you, a good one, see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Out of that silver frame,&rdquo; and Gilbert coolly
    pointed to the empty frame.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blowed! But it&rsquo;s all right.
    May we have the picture back? I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s another one
    left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can have it back. Well, then, the Pullman
    porter on the train remembered you distinctly. I fancy you gave him a generous
    New Year&rsquo;s tip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I daresay I did. Don&rsquo;t remember exactly, but
    I&rsquo;m not a niggardly traveler. Any more guarantees of my identity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, the conductor who has, of course, a record
    of your tickets recognized the photograph at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, that wasn&rsquo;t the result of a bribe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hardly. Then the porter told how he brought you a telegram
    at Harrisburg and had to knock loud to waken you. He helped you a little
    with your dressing and put you off the train. Also, he advised you to go
    to the Aylesbury House for breakfast. And you did, and you stayed there until
    time to get your train for New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t tell a straighter story if you had
    been along with me. All that is just what I did do. Now, you hit those trainmen,
    I suppose, when they were in the station here. But how&rsquo;d you check
    up on the hotel and all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Telegraph and telephone, sir. The hotel clerk gave an
    accurate description of your appearance and also of your signature on the
    register.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And he said, too,&rdquo; put in Kenneth, &ldquo;that
    you met a man you knew in the lobby and chatted a little with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All to the good. Did he tell you what I ate for breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; returned the inspector, &ldquo;bacon
    and eggs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My heavens! I never heard of such meticulous attention
    to details!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may well be glad of it, Mr. Carleton: it gives you
    a clean bill and removes any chance of suspicion of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you, Inspector.&rdquo; Claude looked grave. &ldquo;It
    is hard for me to realize that there ever was any chance of suspicion of
    me, but I suppose you except nobody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nobody at all, sir. Everyone must be put under severest
    scrutiny. Now you are freed we must take up the next in turn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Am I entirely freed, Inspector? I mean is there any
    lingering doubt in your mind about me? I&rsquo;m queer that way. I have to
    have a thing completely finished, signed and sealed, as you may say, before
    I&rsquo;m satisfied to leave it. If you say so, I&rsquo;ll go back myself
    over my tracks and check up personally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Mr. Carleton, no, sir. We&rsquo;re convinced that
    you were on that train, and therefore could by no possibility have been in
    this house during the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then where does that land us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With the rest of the crowd as suspects,&rdquo;  Carlisle
    said quickly. &ldquo;You see, old man, every inmate of this house that night
    had equal opportunity. They all had motive&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you mean, motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Everyone was a beneficiary under your father&rsquo;s
    will. Some more, some less, but all, except some of the minor servants, had
    substantial bequests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t think that for a few paltry thousands
    anyone here that night would commit murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Someone did. It may have been someone from outside&mdash;that
    we have to find out. But the murderer is yet at large. Do you want to help
    us to track him down&mdash;or would you rather not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude looked at him for a moment in silence. Then he said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hard position. But here&rsquo;s how I
    feel about it: You say all in this house are suspect. Now, as to the ones
    who are nearest and dearest both to me and to my late father I most certainly
    do not want to be a partner to your &lsquo;tracking down.&rsquo; But if it
    comes to a question of casual friends, or neighbors, or servants, then I
    say, yes, I want the murderer found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you willing to be more definite as to the nearest
    and dearest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am. I refer to my aunt, Miss Carleton, and to my father&rsquo;s
    wife. As bearers of the Carleton name they are both above suspicion, but
    since you have raised the question it must be met. Do you propose to look
    upon them as suspects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, with the rest. And I must remind you that
    it was Mrs. Carleton who was the first to raise the alarm and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait a moment, Inspector. Are you telling me seriously
    that because Mrs. Carleton became anxious about her husband&rsquo;s absence
    from his room and came downstairs to see about it&mdash;are you seriously
    implying that that is a point against her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well&mdash;it is customary to question pretty closely
    the one who first shows interest in the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A stupid custom! But I cannot expect to deter you from
    your routine. Are you paying no attention to the real problem, the locked
    room? Are you ignoring the wretch who sent that gruesome skeleton to my father,
    knowing, doubtless, that he had a weak heart and the shock might kill him?
    Are you forgetting the people next door, who have been jealous and envious
    of us for years?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I want you to come in with us, Claude,&rdquo; Carlisle
    exclaimed. &ldquo;You know a lot that we don&rsquo;t know. Now, see here.
    I don&rsquo;t for a minute believe they&rsquo;ll bother Miss Violet and Mrs.
    Carleton much. It will be routine work, just a few further inquiries. Then,
    when they&rsquo;re wiped off the slate, will you join in with us and help
    us ferret out the secret of the locked room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be glad to, only, as I said about myself,
    I want a clean slate for those two women. No harking back, no nagging at
    them afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unless there is new evidence,&rdquo; prudently suggested
    Gilbert.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; and Claude shook his head
    sternly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, as to the skeleton,&rdquo; Carlisle said, &ldquo;I
    went myself to the Pantaloon Club. I know two or three of the members, nice
    old boys, too. I told them the story frankly, no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t,
    and they were sure none of the crowd did it. However, they engaged to find
    out, and yesterday they put the whole membership&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t very
    large&mdash;through a grilling. Of course, they may be mistaken, but they
    are ready to swear that none of the Pantalooners cut up that trick. And I
    think they&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; the inspector agreed. &ldquo;For
    one thing, they&rsquo;re too old. That was a prank of the younger generation.
    I don&rsquo;t mean flappers, but men of fewer years than the old chaps we&rsquo;re
    talking about. Do you think, Mr. Carleton, that the incident of the skeleton
    and the crime itself are in any way connected?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t form any opinion as to that. I can&rsquo;t
    see any connection between the two, but there may be. By the way, I hear
    the skeleton disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; Kenneth admitted. &ldquo;I suppose it
    was my fault, but how could I foresee such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Gilbert told him. &ldquo;However,
    we may get it back yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Claude curiously. &ldquo;Do you know
    who took it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite that, but we&rsquo;re on a trail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look here, I want to make a stipulation. If I come into
    this close corporation and join forces with you two, I must insist on being
    told things. I&rsquo;m not going to be put off with stray bits of information
    and half truths.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing like that, sir,&rdquo; the inspector smiled.  &ldquo;But
    you&rsquo;re not in with us yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, and I shan&rsquo;t be. Not until you&rsquo;re all
    through badgering those two ladies, who, as you perfectly well know, had
    no more to do with my father&rsquo;s death than you had!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they had,&rdquo; Gilbert said
    slowly.  &ldquo;But you must realize that there were eight people, at least,
    who spent that night under this roof. Each of these had ample opportunity
    and a definite motive. Now, you must see that my duty forces me to investigate
    every one of these possibilities, however improbable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I do see that, Inspector, and I don&rsquo;t mean
    to put a straw in your way. But I must reserve my own efforts, which may
    not be of any use after all, until you have convinced yourself of the innocence
    of my two kinswomen. They and I are the only remaining Carletons, and I must
    have the name cleared beyond all shadow of a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert sighed. &ldquo;Even then we&rsquo;d have six left,&rdquo;  he
    said dejectedly. &ldquo;And no way to look for clues or evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Kenneth here doesn&rsquo;t care for clues,&rdquo; and
    Claude smiled. &ldquo;He says they&rsquo;re rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I want evidence,&rdquo; Carlisle cried. &ldquo;Or
    something to work on, if it&rsquo;s only gossip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t give you that. I will not listen
    to discussion of the murder. When the talk gets around to that I leave the
    room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Claude told him seriously, &ldquo;they
    don&rsquo;t talk logically or thoughtfully. They just mull over the mystery
    of it and the horror of it and give no heed to the solution of the problem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Could it be expected of women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps not. But I don&rsquo;t have to listen to their
    meaningless babble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was a light tap at the door from the hall. Then the door
    was pushed slowly open, and Pauline&rsquo;s golden head appeared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is Claude here?&rdquo; she said, coming in herself.  &ldquo;May
    I come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are in,&rdquo; said Claude, smiling at her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, so I am!&rdquo; and without further invitation
    she took a chair.</p>
  <p align="left">Very lovely she looked, and almost childlike in a little white
    house frock of soft material, black stockings, and black suede pumps.</p>
  <p align="left">Her yellow mop of hair was a bit tousled and her lovely face
    a trifle pale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m here, Mr. Inspector, couldn&rsquo;t
    you ask me those questions you&rsquo;ve saved up for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Saved up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. The ones Claude wants you to get off your chest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What makes you think there are any such, Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo; Gilbert
    tried his best to frown at her but found himself smiling instead.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I heard all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just now. I was listening outside the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think that is an honorable thing to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! Get along with your quiz. But
    we&rsquo;ve been all over it before, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meaning you have nothing to add to your other statements?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;First, whether you are sincere. Whether you want to
    help us or hinder us. I think you are quite capable of either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline threw back her pretty head and laughed aloud.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, old top! I can do either. Take your
    choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I choose your help.&rdquo; The inspector well knew
    he ought to frown harshly and put this impudent baggage out of the room.</p>
  <p align="left">But few ever wanted to put Polly Carleton out of a room. She
    was enchanting to look at, bewitching to listen to, and just about the farthest
    removed from looking like a murderer that anyone could be.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the yellow head nodded sagely. &ldquo;I
    thought you would. But I won&rsquo;t give you my valuable assistance until
    you assure me that you don&rsquo;t think I shot my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think you did, Mrs. Carleton, but I&rsquo;d
    be glad of any proof you may have of your innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s just the devil of it!&rdquo; she screwed
    up her red lips. &ldquo;How can I prove it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, can you prove that you were in your own room from
    three o&rsquo;clock, when you went upstairs, till five in the morning, when
    you came down again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, no, because I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In my room all that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hanging over the banisters.&rdquo; Pauline gave her
    little rippling laugh. &ldquo;I was eaten alive with curiosity about something,
    and I was trying to find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector was getting interested.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude Carleton was getting worried.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle was getting information.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what were you so curious about?&rdquo; Gilbert said
    suavely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About the carryings on of those two precious secretaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Gregg and Miss Austen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Those are the very two!&rdquo; Polly smiled as blandly
    as if there were dozens of secretaries all over the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And why were you so interested in them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because&#8212;&rdquo; Polly shook a dainty pink
    forefinger at him&mdash;&ldquo;because the she-secretary, Miss Austen, was
    getting&mdash;was getting too gay with my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude looked incredulous, but Polly went on:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, they were sweeties, and&mdash;well, to tell
    you the truth, I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded much, only it seemed hard on
    old Peter&mdash;Peter Gregg, you know. He&rsquo;s too nice a chap to be treated
    like that. So I was snooping around to see what I could see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At what time was this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I never heed the time. Maybe between
    three and four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any proof, anybody who saw you in the upper
    hall. I suppose you mean you were in the upper hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly there, my bucko! But while there was a first-class
    A number-one witness right at my elbow I don&rsquo;t think she noticed me
    at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And who was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My sister-in-law, Miss Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What was she doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hanging over the other side of the banister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, she was curious in another direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And who was she spying on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On my dear friend Miss D&rsquo;Orsay and her dear friend
    Mr. Randall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The upper hall was a general coign of vantage, then?
    Did you both have your curiosity gratified?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;More or less, but if you make fun of me I shan&rsquo;t
    tell you things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Polly&rsquo;s pout was even more provocative than her smile,
    and the three men present were reduced to a state of abject imbecility, though
    bravely struggling to look judicially severe.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not make fun of you,&rdquo; said Gilbert, &ldquo;but
    I want to ask you to be careful to tell the exact truth. It is so easy to
    exaggerate and so hard to stick to facts. Now, it may be that you and Miss
    Carleton can be witnesses for each other and so clear you both from suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, if she saw me.&rdquo; Polly look distressed and
    the pansy eyes were dark and troubled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, of course, I kept dodging behind the curtain because
    I didn&rsquo;t want to be seen. I didn&rsquo;t know I was going to be a clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did Miss Carleton dodge, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but of course I saw her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, never mind her. What did you see going on downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, upon my word, it was a continuous performance!
    As soon as one person or one pair of persons would flit through the hall,
    another would follow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then everybody was downstairs that night, some time
    between three and four?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just about everybody, except me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go down at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not until five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t dodging behind the curtains for two
    hours, were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, my Lord, no! I was back and forth to my rooms, you
    know, and out again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you see Professor Scott in the hall?&rdquo; asked
    Kenneth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, about the first one, he was. He went down and begged
    Manning to let him in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you suppose he wanted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Money. He was always trying to borrow money from Manning.
    He has tried to borrow from me, but I never have any to spare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your husband was a generous man?&rdquo; asked the inspector.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Lord, yes. But I like to spend it, I don&rsquo;t
    want to lend it to people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then Professor Scott didn&rsquo;t get an audience with
    your husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not then. But I daresay he went down later and tried
    again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. Don&rsquo;t glare at me so, Inspector! You
    scare the wits out of me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; and Gilbert smiled again.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you&rsquo;re almost handsome when
    you smile. Well, when old Scotty came up I heard him grumbling and mumbling
    and saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get him yet!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he meant he&rsquo;d kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mercy, no! He meant he&rsquo;d get an audience with
    him. You see, if he once got hold of Manning he could wheedle something out
    of him. He was soft-hearted, my husband was, and that&rsquo;s why I think
    old Scotty tried it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you imagine Professor Scott killing Mr. Carleton?&rdquo; This
    from Kenneth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, I can imagine it, of course. I can imagine &rsquo;most
    anything. I can imagine you killing him, or the inspector. If I shut my eyes
    I can imagine anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, tell about the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lemmesee. Z&eacute;lie trailed herself down in her best
    Paris n&eacute;glig&eacute;. She pretended she went for a book&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you backed her up,&rdquo; said Gilbert quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; Pauline giggled. &ldquo;I wanted
    to help her out. You see she doesn&rsquo;t know the name of one book from
    another. You never nailed that Maugham book, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Was there any?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not to my knowledge. Well, anyway, Z&eacute;lie trailed
    down and parked herself in my boudoir, and along came Don Randall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been in the drawing room, I believe, smoking
    a cigarette with Violet. They&rsquo;re rather cronies, those two. Then Violet
    ambled upstairs again, and Don rolled through the hall and was caught in
    Z&eacute;lie&rsquo;s net. But he made an escape later and went out to the
    dining room and imbibed a few.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Too many?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. He&rsquo;s always pretending
    he&rsquo;s a roustabout, but he isn&rsquo;t really. However, he went to sleep
    in the dining room, or says he did. And at that time the two secretaries
    that I was hunting for were cosy and comfy in Miss Austen&rsquo;s room. They
    came up about four-thirty, I believe, and after fond good-nights went decorously
    to their rooms. So I went to bed, too, and went to sleep for a short nap,
    but at five I was wide awake again. I toddled into Manning&rsquo;s room,
    and he wasn&rsquo;t there. What do you think I thought? I thought he was
    somewhere with that slyboots Emily, and I raced downstairs to see if they
    were in her office. But they weren&rsquo;t, so I decided they were locked
    in the library. I banged and banged on the door, but nobody answered. That
    made me mad, for that was Manning&rsquo;s way. He would just refuse to speak
    or open the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t make sure of Miss Austen&rsquo;s whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t go bumping into her bedroom,
    and I had looked in her office. Anyway, I got madder and madder because Manning
    wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me. Well, then Violet came down, and Don butted in,
    and all of a sudden I came to my senses. I realized Manning would never sit
    still like that after the people had begun to flock about, so I knew something
    had happened to him. And it had. I guess I&rsquo;ll go away now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">No one essayed to stop her, so she quietly slipped through
    the hall door, and the three men were left alone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is her slate clean?&rdquo; demanded Claude.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Gilbert and Kenneth in unison.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_12">Chapter 12</a><br>As to Old Scotty</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I TRUST,&rdquo; Claude said, after Pauline had left
    them, &ldquo;you will not find it necessary to badger that poor girl any
    more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must object to the use of that word badger,&rdquo;  Inspector
    Gilbert said sternly. &ldquo;As you know, Mr. Carleton, I have my duty to
    do, and it must be done even at the expense of annoying the family. I am
    ready to state that there is now no reason to suspect or to question further
    yourself or your aunt or Mrs. Carleton. But other lines must be taken up.
    Other sources of information must be found and investigated. This may necessitate
    further questioning of the Carleton ladies. If so, it must be accepted as
    a necessary burden. I am assuming you want the mystery of the death of your
    father cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Claude&rsquo;s handsome face looked irresolute, &ldquo;and
    yet, I am willing to let the matter drop. Since you have ceased to suspect
    me and my family of guilty knowledge I am not so keen to keep up the man
    hunt. Where would your suspicions turn next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have reason,&rdquo; Gilbert spoke slowly, &ldquo;to
    think they would turn toward Professor Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Old Scotty!&rdquo; Claude seemed surprised. &ldquo;Why,
    how in the world would that old chap engineer such a clever and complicated
    crime as this one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Clever, yes. Complicated, no.&rdquo; The inspector&rsquo;s
    face was glum, and his manner was that of a man at the last stage of exasperation. &ldquo;Once
    find the means the murderer used to get in, and the rest is an easy problem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You mean to get out,&rdquo; Claude said quietly. &ldquo;My
    father could have let him in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and if it was Scott, your father did let him in.
    Mrs. Carleton said she thought it likely the professor came down again and
    begged for admission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, supposing he did,&rdquo; Claude said slowly,  &ldquo;just
    supposing Professor Scott begged my father to let him into the library, until
    Dad consented and opened the door. Then supposing the old man shot my father&mdash;that
    would mean that he had to have a gun with him. Improbable on the face of
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whoever shot Mr. Carleton had to take his gun with him.
    We have heard nothing of a gun already on the premises. Was there any such?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not to my knowledge,&rdquo; said Claude promptly.  &ldquo;And
    I&rsquo;m sure I should have known of it had there been. I&rsquo;ve always
    had free run of the library, and I&rsquo;ve often rummaged around in the
    desk drawers for one thing or another. I never saw or heard of a weapon of
    any sort belonging to my father, nor, indeed, any in the house at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Speaking of rummaging,&rdquo; Carlisle said, smiling,  &ldquo;you
    will not be surprised to learn that your own room was searched, though not
    really thoroughly. However, we&rsquo;re going to ask you to explain a few
    foolish little toys in a drawer of your desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Toys?&rdquo; Claude looked at him blankly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Those little souvenirs that come with candy purchases
    at some shops.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Souvenirs?&rdquo; Still Claude seemed not to understand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tiny silver-looking things, a bird, a heart, a dove&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; and Claude smiled broadly, at the same
    time looking a little sheepish. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, they are souvenirs.
    Just what they are. Do you want them for clues or anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, only an explanation. Why did you save them&mdash;in
    a secret drawer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude looked serious again. &ldquo;Because I have a foolish
    fondness for them. You see, long ago Polly used to scatter the little trinkets
    round the table, appropriate designs for different guests. Well, when she
    was kind enough to give me one remindful of her own dear personality, I saved
    it. The Cupid, the heart, the star, all mean Polly to me. The dove, too,
    and the parrot&mdash;a polly, you know. The little goblet was one we drank
    a toast from one night. I had no right to keep souvenirs of my father&rsquo;s
    wife, but they were innocent little jokes, and&mdash;well, I make no secret
    of my admiration for the lady. After a decent interval I shall ask her to
    marry me, though I have no reason to hope for a favorable reply. Never by
    word or deed has Mrs. Carleton shown more than a mere friendly interest in
    me, and I am telling you men all this frankly but in confidence. I am well
    aware that it might seem to turn suspicion in my direction, yet I can&rsquo;t
    believe you can really think me guilty of the crime of parricide!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We do not,&rdquo; said the inspector heartily, &ldquo;and
    I am glad you have been so outspoken about the matter. It was not difficult
    to read your feelings toward Mrs. Carleton, but I can also state I have never
    seen any hint of her response to them. You may rest assured we will not betray
    your confidence. But we do want your help. Now, as to the old professor.
    I agree that it seems unlikely he went seeking audience with your father,
    in his library, armed with a gun, but whatever the truth of the matter is,
    it will be something unlikely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have your experts discovered what sort of gun was used?&rdquo; Claude
    asked, his heavy black eyebrows beetling over his deep-set eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. That is, their opinions are at variance. One stands
    out for an ordinary revolver, the other insists on an air gun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Air gun!&rdquo; Claude looked amazed, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
    heard that before. Why air gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because, though it seems the shot was fired at close
    range, there were no powder marks or burns. None at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, how do they know the shot was fired at close range?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is where the controversy comes in. You see, we
    deduce from the position of the chairs when found, that Mr. Carleton, sitting
    in his desk chair, was turned toward the murderer, who sat close by and facing
    him. The shot went through the body horizontally, indicating that the assailant
    was sitting down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was the bullet found?&rdquo; Claude asked. &ldquo;I
    haven&rsquo;t heard these details, Inspector, I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want
    to&mdash;but perhaps I ought to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I think you should know. Well, the bullet was smallish,
    a twenty-eight, and it was found in the woodwork of that bookcase behind
    you. It was so out of shape it was of little use as evidence. However, it
    was the death missile, and there is no question as to the manner or means
    of death. Except that the type of firearm used is not agreed upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose it makes little difference,&rdquo; said Claude
    musingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering whether old man Scott could have got
    hold of an air gun more easily than a regular pistol. But that I don&rsquo;t
    know. If he came here to this room with the intent of killing my father,
    then we can understand the gun. But I can&rsquo;t think it. Why, the old
    chap didn&rsquo;t expect to stay the night when he came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Kenneth Carlisle&rsquo;s
    calm voice broke in, &ldquo;if he planned this thing, and it surely must
    have been planned, he would come all prepared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then cut out Scotty,&rdquo; cried Claude. &ldquo;It
    couldn&rsquo;t have been his work. What about your skeleton man? Have you
    found him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about Professor Scott being the skeleton sender
    himself?&rdquo; Gilbert spoke moodily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh now you&rsquo;re romancing.&rdquo; Claude smiled
    a little. &ldquo;Why, I heard he wanted the skeleton given to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course, so he could return it to its owner from whom
    he borrowed or abstracted it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My heavens! What an idea! And why the skeleton, anyway,
    if he was even then planning to shoot my father? I don&rsquo;t follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is my theory, Mr. Carleton. And it may be right
    or not. I think Professor Scott sent the skeleton thinking it might bring
    on a sudden heart attack and thereby cause your father&rsquo;s sudden death.
    As I understand it, your father was shocked and somewhat overcome, but quickly
    rallied. This frustrated the plan, and the indomitable professor was forced
    to a more definite method of achieving his criminal intent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why did he want to kill my father?&rdquo; Claude looked
    perplexed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To get his inheritance. I think he meant to urge Mr.
    Carleton to advance a goodly share of the money without waiting until his
    death. When your father refused to agree to this, might not the professor
    have taken the matter into his own hands and forced the issue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Scotty! That blundering old fossil&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a blunderer,&rdquo; Carlisle told him. &ldquo;And
    old fossil only in the eyes of young people. Professor Abel Scott is one
    of the most brilliant thinkers of his generation. I&rsquo;m not ready to
    say I suspect him of this crime, but I will say that I believe he could have
    planned it and carried it through, if he desired to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Kenneth, if you feel that way about it, and since
    the Inspector agrees, I must be influenced by your statements. Now, where
    does that lead us? I mean can we explain away all the contradictory circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;First of all, where is the gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We searched the professor&rsquo;s belongings thoroughly
    and found nothing of the sort. That is the weakest point in our case. Still,
    a man of his ingenuity could manage to hide the gun successfully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then how did he get out of the room, leaving it locked
    and bolted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That, too, must have been some piece of legerdemain
    which we haven&rsquo;t discovered as yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bah! You could say all that of anybody. So far you&rsquo;ve
    not pinned anything definite on the old man. You could say of anyone,  &lsquo;he
    hid the gun&rsquo;, and &lsquo;he got out of the room in some ingenious but
    unknown fashion.&rsquo; Rubbish!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know that, Claude,&rdquo; Carlisle said slowly,  &ldquo;but
    who else had opportunity and motive both? There is always the chance that
    an outsider came in, some intruder we know nothing of. But in ignorance of
    that, whom can we suspect as logically as Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lots of people. There&rsquo;s Mortlake, for one. He
    could get in and out through this door between, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Leaving it bolted after him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t pretend to explain that. And maybe
    he didn&rsquo;t leave by that communicating door. But the murderer had to
    get out some way. He wasn&rsquo;t here when you broke in, was he? Oh, I say,
    now! There&rsquo;s a thought! Suppose the murderer was here when they crashed
    in the cloakroom door! Suppose he was in hiding, and when the crowd rushed
    in he made his unnoticed escape or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, or?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or, just mingled with the crowd&mdash;being one of the
    members of the household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve considered that theory. Mr. Carleton,&rdquo;  the
    inspector said. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t see things as
    we do, but I know how hard it must be for you to turn your suspicions toward
    one whom you&rsquo;ve thought of only as an old friend of your father&rsquo;s.
    But, there are so many bits of evidence against him, each small in itself,
    but cumulative as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His great desire for a large sum of money immediately.
    His marvelous ingenuity for ballistics&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hold on there. I haven&rsquo;t your unlimited vocabulary.
    What was that word you used?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ballistics?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yeah. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The science of firearms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was such a science. And Scotty
    is up on it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Perhaps science is not quite the word. Let us say
    the study of the principles of projectiles and firearms in general.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. You&rsquo;re sure meticulous. Then, if he
    was so up in shooting irons, would the professor choose an air gun for his
    weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We are not sure an air gun was used.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My mistake. Thought you said so. Well, go on with the
    counts against Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He had motive. Being here in the house, he had opportunity.
    He went downstairs as soon as he could and tried to get in the library. He
    was greatly angered at Mr. Carleton&rsquo;s refusal to let him in. He could
    easily have slipped downstairs and gained admission to the library within
    the hour assumed to cover the time of the crime. That is, from three to four
    o&rsquo;clock. As to his getting out of the library, that is the problem
    that must confront any and every theory that can be advanced. But the professor&rsquo;s
    cleverness and skill give him a chance of escape that ordinary minds would
    know nothing about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you broached the subject to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did, Claude,&rdquo; Carlisle said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    want to startle or frighten him, and so I started in by asking him to help
    us. To my surprise he flatly refused to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What reason did he give for his refusal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He said he was afraid to. Said he felt sure that the
    criminal was somebody in this house or the other house&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    just the way he put it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The other house! That could mean only the Mortlakes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think he meant Mortlake. He didn&rsquo;t
    seem to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Is there any old servant in there
    who could be suspected?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea, but Aunt Violet could tell you that.
    No, I can&rsquo;t suspect a servant. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It does seem so, when there are so many around who are
    not servants. What about Gregg? Is he the faithful, efficient super-secretary
    that he seems?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve described him to a T! Yes, for aught I
    know Peter is all to the good. Yet within the last day or two I&rsquo;ve
    noticed he is acting queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Jumpy. Springs up if you come upon him suddenly, and
    cringes a little, begging to know if there&rsquo;s anything he can do for
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you going to keep him on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide. I don&rsquo;t want to, because
    I don&rsquo;t like him. Yet it seems unjust to turn him away. He was with
    Dad five years or so, and he knows all the ropes. He&rsquo;d be invaluable
    to me that way, but&mdash;oh, well, I guess I&rsquo;d better let him stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Austen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point. If Polly keeps her on, I&rsquo;d
    have to keep Gregg. Can&rsquo;t separate those two turtledoves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know what I think?&rdquo; Carlisle smiled as
    he looked at Claude. &ldquo;I think those two are married already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do, and what&rsquo;s more, Mrs. Polly knows it and
    helped matters along, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Miss Violet was
    in the secret too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s going on in my house without my knowledge!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, does this give you any reason to suspect Mr. Gregg
    of&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of killing Dad? No! And yet&mdash;hold on. Suppose Dad
    was sweet on the demure Emily, as Polly suspects. Might old Gregg, in a moment
    of fury, shoot his employer, thereby freeing the girl from his attentions
    and incidentally securing his legacy without further waiting? There&rsquo;s
    food for thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; Carlisle spoke sadly, &ldquo;there is
    almost nobody in this house who hasn&rsquo;t that motive of wanting to realize
    at once the legacy that he might expect in the future. It is a powerful motive,
    and yet, is it strong enough in every case to induce suspicion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in my case,&rdquo; Claude returned. &ldquo;Dad
    gave me a rattling good allowance and let me do exactly as I pleased in every
    particular. I know he hated to have me go off to Hollywood, but he was a
    regular brick about it. Said I&rsquo;d better go and get it out of my system.
    He thought I&rsquo;d soon come trapesing back. Like as not, I should have,
    too. Well, then, of course, your motive doesn&rsquo;t hold for Polly or Aunt
    Violet. They had all the money they wanted. Dad was a most generous man with
    his family, and usually with his friends. I don&rsquo;t know why he persisted
    in his refusal to finance Scott&rsquo;s projects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What are his projects?&rdquo; asked Kenneth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly. But some sort of scientific
    research that takes lots of initial outlay for paraphernalia. Dad has advanced
    large sums several times, and I suppose he grew tired of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doubtless. Now, granting that as a scientist Professor
    Scott has not only knowledge but personal skill and cleverness regarding
    gadgets and contrivances of various sorts, may we not assume that he could
    invent a way in and out of a locked room, and also, knowing his proficiency
    in ballistics, that he could invent a gun of some unusual or unknown type
    that would shoot at close range without leaving powder stains?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good enough in theory,&rdquo; the inspector said slowly, &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;ve seen no evidence of such as facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then we must turn up some evidence,&rdquo; said Kenneth
    shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of mulling these things over. I want action
    of some sort. Here are three of us, with unusually clever minds and ingenious
    brains. Let us put our attention on this locked-room business and see if
    we can&rsquo;t at least be as ingenious as an elderly professor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; Claude exclaimed. &ldquo;I
    wish Scotty were here now, we&rsquo;d have him in to work with us. But he&rsquo;s
    gone home&mdash;at least, he&rsquo;s gone from here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s at his home,&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
    keeping him shadowed, but so far he&rsquo;s done nothing suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably knows he&rsquo;s shadowed,&rdquo; said Kenneth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably. Now, my young friends, how are you going about
    this rather Herculean task of finding out the puzzle of the locked room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the matter of locks that troubles me,&rdquo;  Kenneth
    said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the bolts. Locks, you know, can be manipulated by
    certain instruments that the enterprising burglar has invented. But bolts&mdash;now,
    they&rsquo;re something else again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The three men stood before the closed door and regarded the
    bolt in question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Remember the bolted door in <em>Big Bow Mystery</em>?&rdquo; asked
    Kenneth, looking from one to the other of his companions.</p>
  <p align="left">But neither of them did.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The plot hinged on that bolt,&rdquo; he told them.  &ldquo;So
    everybody tried to think how a bolt could be shot from the other side of
    a door. One of the most ingenious suggestions, I remember, was to use an
    enormous magnet and, holding it the other side of the door, make it draw
    the bolt pin along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; cried Claude. &ldquo;Was that the way
    it was done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. You see the strongest magnet they could get wouldn&rsquo;t
    work at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Claude said, &ldquo;that wouldn&rsquo;t
    argue that the professor couldn&rsquo;t get a magnet that would work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Kenneth said, shaking his head.  &ldquo;Anyway,
    that&rsquo;s one way we can theorize, whether it&rsquo;s true or not. Now
    think of another, somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My theory,&rdquo; Claude said, &ldquo;is that he didn&rsquo;t
    come in by this door into the Mortlakes&rsquo; at all. I mean, he didn&rsquo;t
    go out that way. We must concede that in any case the murderer may have been
    let in by my father. What we are puzzling over is how he got out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They agreed to this, and Claude went on:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, suppose the killer to have been here and
    accomplished his dreadful errand. Then he listens for absolute quiet in the
    hall outside. You know all those people who were stampeding up and down stairs
    all night were not at all careful to make no noise. Of course, the rugs are
    thick and soft, but there are many good-sized stretches of bare polished
    floor. Our criminal in here could hear a step on the wood floor and in some
    cases steps on the rugs. Anyway, I think he could pretty fairly judge when
    he had a clear field and could slip out. Say, then, that he had a contraption
    such as you&rsquo;ve mentioned, a jigger that unlocks or locks doors from
    the other side, with the key still in the keyhole. Well, say he unlocks the
    door into the cloakroom and slips into the cloakroom. If there were any coats
    hanging there he could hide behind them. Also, there is a small closet for
    towels and brushes. He could have crept into that. Really, I don&rsquo;t
    think you people half exhausted the possibilities. Well, say he stayed there
    until such time as he could slip out and use his clever dodge for locking
    the library door from that side. Then he goes out at the front door and makes
    his getaway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re assuming an intruder from outside!&rdquo;  exclaimed
    Gilbert.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, or next door. If our man was staying in this house,
    so much the easier for him. He had only to walk upstairs openly, as Gregg
    did, or Randall, or&mdash;unseen&mdash;Scott. Or, of course, Fenn, though
    I don&rsquo;t suspect Fenn for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We must suspect everybody available,&rdquo; the inspector
    declared. &ldquo;Fenn had the same motive as the others. His legacy, to him,
    was as great as the professor&rsquo;s was to <em>him</em>. We must take that into
    account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, but I don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t suspect
    him. You may, if you like, but I don t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They continued their search until luncheon was announced. Claude
    invited them both to stay, but neither Kenneth nor the inspector was free
    to accept the invitation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going up to see the professor this afternoon,&rdquo; Gilbert
    said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like one of you chaps to go with me.&rdquo; The
    result of this was that all three decided to go and see what they could learn
    from Scott without letting him suspect he was being grilled.</p>
  <p align="left">They agreed to meet at Kenneth&rsquo;s apartment at four o&rsquo;clock
    and go on together.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude said he would telephone the professor that he was coming
    up, so that the old man would be at home.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking Polly out for a little drive this afternoon,&rdquo; Claude
    added. &ldquo;Poor child, it&rsquo;s dull for her. But I&rsquo;ll be back
    in time to meet you fellows at four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He was, and the three met, as appointed, at Kenneth&rsquo;s
    rooms. The efficient Carter looked after them, and at his master&rsquo;s
    request, rehearsed for Claude&rsquo;s benefit the story of the men who came
    to take away the skeleton.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Listen, Claude,&rdquo; Kenneth said, &ldquo;for we may
    want to refer to this at the Scott session.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Claude listened attentively to
    the tale of the fake detective and his companion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A big, husky feller, one of &rsquo;em was,&rdquo; Carter
    informed, &ldquo;but the other was a wimpsey little runt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And supposed to be a detective?&rdquo; queried Claude.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; asseverated Carter, &ldquo;but all
    he had like a detective was his badge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carter was loquacious, but Kenneth cut him off, and the trio
    started.</p>
  <p align="left">They reached the professor&rsquo;s apartment and went up in
    the elevator.</p>
  <p align="left">Repeated rings at the bell brought no response, and Gilbert
    tried the door knob. It turned easily and, opening the door, they went in.</p>
  <p align="left">Leaning back in a big easy chair was the dead body of Professor
    Scott, shot through the heart.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_13">Chapter 13</a><br>The Suburban Telephone Directory</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;ANOTHER!&rdquo; the inspector cried, in a tone more
    of utter exasperation than of horror at the deed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor old Scotty,&rdquo; Claude murmured, going a step
    nearer to the still figure of the old man.</p>
  <p align="left">The apartment was but meagerly furnished, the room they were
    in being a combination of living room and bedroom. It opened into a much
    larger room which was a laboratory, well fitted with the apparatus and paraphernalia
    of a scientist. Here things were neat and tidy, but in the first room everything
    was in a general state of disorder.</p>
  <p align="left">But after a quick look into the laboratory Gilbert turned back
    to the death chamber.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Shot through the heart,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;Much
    the same way Mr. Carleton was. A connection between the two crimes seems
    to be indicated, but we cannot be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Claude wonderingly, &ldquo;why would
    anyone want to shoot old Scotty? A most inoffensive chap. Maybe he did bother
    Dad for funds now and then, but who would murder him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With a scientist, you never can tell,&rdquo; the inspector
    told him. &ldquo;Maybe he had secrets the scientific world yearned for. Some
    invention or formula that they feared might die with him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Looks as if it had,&rdquo; put in Carlisle, who thought
    the inspector was a little rambling. &ldquo;But I see what you mean. Say
    thieves came for the precious formula, or whatever it was, and Scott put
    up a fight, and this is the result.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; Gilbert agreed. &ldquo;But
    that&rsquo;s not my business. I must call Headquarters and get the medical
    examiner and some more help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we sure have a clear field this time,&rdquo;  Kenneth
    said, almost happily. &ldquo;Nothing, apparently, has been touched. How long&rsquo;s
    he been dead, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell that sort of thing. Maybe a few hours,
    maybe less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth was darting about the room, touching nothing but scanning
    everything.</p>
  <p align="left">One thing caught his eye that the others seemed not to see.
    This was a telephone book marred in precisely the same way as the one in
    the Carleton library.</p>
  <p align="left">It was the Suburban volume, in this case, a thick, heavy book,
    and showing on its back cover the same small round depression and the same
    scratched and torn leaves.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth hesitated. Should he call their attention to it, or
    keep it to himself for the moment. It was as visible to them as to him. The
    incoming detectives would, of course, find it. But somehow he didn&rsquo;t
    want to exploit it.</p>
  <p align="left">He had no desire, no need to touch it. He saw plainly that
    whatever had made that deep mark, those torn fragments, was without doubt
    the same agency that had made similar effects on the other book.</p>
  <p align="left">Could it be the death-dealing instrument? Some sort of ingenious
    contraption invented by the scientist? Yet there seemed no rational way of
    linking up those scarred telephone books with a death-dealing shot. Why look
    for anything more or different than a simple pistol, revolver or automatic?
    There was nothing unusual or peculiar about the wound, so far as he could
    see.</p>
  <p align="left">The professor was fully dressed, though in old and worn garments.
    His working clothes, of course.</p>
  <p align="left">A hole could be seen in his loose, baggy vest, and though there
    was some but not much blood, there was no sign of powder marks.</p>
  <p align="left">Hit at very close range, Gilbert said, with seemingly no thought
    of any unusual weapon. &ldquo;Let him alone till Doane gets here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we find out a little something?&rdquo; begged
    Kenneth. &ldquo;Get the elevator boy up, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The elevator boy was summoned, and his black face seemed to
    pale as he stared at the still figure in the chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A deader?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Lawzy me, a deader!
    And ole Scott! Yessir, ole Scott! Who done it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want to know,&rdquo; Gilbert said
    sternly.</p>
  <p align="left">But the lad was in no way intimidated and said cheerfully:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, de feller w&rsquo;at come up wid de load
    of stuff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo; went on the inspector casually.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout three o&rsquo;clock, I sh&rsquo;d say, suh.
    A wu&rsquo;kman, sorta. Anyway, he wo&rsquo;e a rummicky ole suit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mejum sized, black hair, sorta bushy like, an&rsquo;  dat&rsquo;s &rsquo;bout
    all I noticed onto him. He said he had a lot o&rsquo; stuff for de perfessor,
    and I telled him to hike along wid it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What sort of stuff? What did he carry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He had some Ginger Ale and some W&rsquo;ite Rock. De
    ole man liked dose beverridges. Nen he had a lot o&rsquo; stuff like delikertessen
    or groceries. I saw some boloneys and some cheese. Looked mighty good, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t think a delivery boy would shoot
    the old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Looky here, mister, dat wasn&rsquo;t no ornery deliv&rsquo;ry
    boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&mdash;he jes&rsquo; didn&rsquo; seem lak one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Make believe, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yassah! Dat&rsquo;s it. Make belief. He was de mudderer!
    He sho&rsquo; was. He had mudderer&rsquo;s eyes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The speaker&rsquo;s own eyes rolled so far around that they
    were ghastly in their gleaming whiteness, and he shook with the intensity
    of his convictions.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, Sambo?&rdquo; asked the inspector
    good-naturedly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nossah, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t Sambo a-tall. My name&rsquo;s
    Hopper&mdash;Mistah Joe Hopper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Joe. Now, did you see this makebelieve grocer
    boy go down again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, dat I didn&rsquo;. An&rsquo; I don&rsquo; jes know
    how de debbil he got down nohow. Seems lak he musta walked down de stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What floor is this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fo&rsquo;th flo&rsquo; suh. Yassah, dat chap, he done
    walked down. Ef he&rsquo;d a gone in de elevator I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; seed
    him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And nobody else has been up here&mdash;for how long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, de perfessor, he went out to his lunch  &rsquo;long
    about twelve. Den I went out myselluf &rsquo;bout ha&rsquo;-past twelve.
    I got back fust, and soon &rsquo;long came de perfessor, smilin&rsquo; lak
    he was mighty pleased &rsquo;bout somepin. He gimme a quartah, w&rsquo;ich
    is onusual fer him. Well, he come along up, and dat musta been &rsquo;bout
    two o&rsquo;clock, mebbe. An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think dere&rsquo;s been
    anybuddy else up to dis flo&rsquo; de hull endurin&rsquo; aft&rsquo;noon, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; dat
    makebelief deliv&rsquo;ry boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you sure, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah. De mo&rsquo; I ponders it ober, de mo&rsquo; shuah
    I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Further questioning failed to bring out any more definite information,
    and after cautioning the boy to keep his mouth shut Gilbert let him go.</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector threw himself on a chair with a look of utter
    despondency.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I had all I could do with that other case,&rdquo; he
    growled, &ldquo;and now this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth went into the laboratory and from there on into the
    little pantry. He was looking for the supplies the delivery boy had brought.</p>
  <p align="left">He found them, too. Half a dozen each of White Rock and Ginger
    Ale. A paper parcel of Bologna sausage, another of cheese, some rolls, and
    a small pat of butter. But there was no bill or statement, no name of the
    grocer or delicatessen store who had supplied these things.</p>
  <p align="left">To be sure, the professor probably had a charge account, but
    even so it was customary to put in a slip memorandum of the goods sent.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth scrutinized all the appointments and furnishings of
    the little pantry but could see no evidence of anything wrong or peculiar.</p>
  <p align="left">He went back to the laboratory. The big room was full of queer-looking
    apparatus, most of which he could imagine no use for. He scurried about,
    peering under tables and benches, hoping to find some bit of evidence before
    the police came and gave him their unspoken but quite visible disapproval.</p>
  <p align="left">But he found nothing. So far as he could see, there was everything
    for the professor&rsquo;s working experiments, and that was all. No litter,
    no rubbish&mdash;all was clean and orderly, in total contradiction to the
    untidy living room.</p>
  <p align="left">When he was again back in the living room, he found the police
    were already there.</p>
  <p align="left">The medical examiner made short work of his job, pronounced
    the cause of death a shot through the heart, fired at close range, from a
    pistol or gun of some sort. Impossible to be more definite until more complete
    examination could be made at the mortuary.</p>
  <p align="left">He called an ambulance and prepared to take the body away.</p>
  <p align="left">The detectives and finger-print men and photographers were
    busy at their appointed tasks, and Kenneth saw at once that, while not actively
    antagonistic, the police would willingly see him depart.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course, in the Carleton case, being invited and engaged,
    he had his rights, but here he was a mere intruder, without leave or license.</p>
  <p align="left">He whispered to Claude that he was going home, and Claude said
    he would go too.</p>
  <p align="left">They said good-bye to the inspector and left without further
    remark to the men from Headquarters. Of course, Gilbert would vouch for their
    arrival with him and would detail the conversation with the elevator boy.</p>
  <p align="left">They went down in Joe&rsquo;s car, and as they reached the
    ground floor Claude exclaimed impatiently:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hang it, I&rsquo;ve left my overcoat&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, did you think it was summer time?&rdquo; jeered
    Kenneth. &ldquo;Here, you, Joe, run up and get the gentleman&rsquo;s coat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go myself. Run me up, Joe. Come along,
    Kenneth, or wait for me here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here,&rdquo; Carlisle replied, not caring
    especially for the close atmosphere of the small and old car.</p>
  <p align="left">In a few moments Claude returned, his overcoat on his arm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so warmish to-day, I don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how I came to forget it. Now, old chap, I want
    a talk with you. Will you come on down to the house for dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, unless you&rsquo;ll come to dinner with me.
    I have a good cook&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, you come to us this time, and next time it&rsquo;ll
    be on you. I say&mdash;I forgot my coat on purpose, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought you did.&rdquo; They were in Kenneth&rsquo;s
    car now, going down the Avenue.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I wanted to see&mdash;oh, well, here&rsquo;s your
    place in a minute. I&rsquo;ll tell you to-night. Shan&rsquo;t I get out here
    and taxi on home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, Henry will take you down. So long. I&rsquo;ll
    blow in about seven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do. We&rsquo;ll have our talk after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth went up to his apartment in a troubled mood.</p>
  <p align="left">He told himself he was neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring,
    meaning that he was <em>persona non grata</em> to the police, yet he had no way of
    getting at the cases he wanted to look into, save through the police.</p>
  <p align="left">To be sure, the inspector was his friend, and he had an idea
    that clever chap Stokes rather liked him. But he couldn&rsquo;t go ahead
    and work with them, for they didn&rsquo;t want him and they thought they
    didn&rsquo;t need him.</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact, Kenneth told himself, they did need him,
    only they didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
  <p align="left">Not one of them&mdash;he had watched&mdash;had noticed that
    scarred telephone book, and yet, on that he was sure the whole mystery hinged.
    Those two books, similarly dented and torn, proved the two murders were by
    the same hand.</p>
  <p align="left">Or, there was another theory. Supposing the queer gun that
    did the killing, whatever that gun might be, was some heathenish invention
    of Professor Scott&rsquo;s ingenious brain. Then, suppose someone else, knowing
    about it, had turned the killing instrument on its own inventor.</p>
  <p align="left">Without quite knowing why, Kenneth imagined an infernal machine
    of some sort.</p>
  <p align="left">To be sure, an ordinary shooting iron of any sort would answer
    the same purpose, it being quite possible to avoid powder burns by shooting
    at close range.</p>
  <p align="left">And, try as he would, he could think of no possible way to
    tie those marred books to any manner or means of shooting&mdash;from a popgun
    to a catapult.</p>
  <p align="left">No, he was too visionary to work with the police. They could
    see not an inch beyond their noses, but they didn&rsquo;t need to, because
    what they looked for was always close at hand. They weren&rsquo;t looking
    for a weird, diabolical contraption to kill people with.</p>
  <p align="left">The Devil&rsquo;s Gun, he called it to himself.</p>
  <p align="left">It was this weapon that bothered him even more than the problem
    of the locked room. Once he understood what weapon did for Mr. Carleton,
    then he could take up the other mystery and make short work of it.</p>
  <p align="left">At least, that&rsquo;s the way it seemed to him.</p>
  <p align="left">Also, it seemed to him that he wasn&rsquo;t making much headway
    in the whole matter. And yet, he had an idea, a mere sprout of an idea, but
    sound at the root. If he could get a little more data, unknown to anyone
    else, he might get the thing started, and once started, he was sure&mdash;well,
    he was sure it was worth trying, anyhow.</p>
  <p align="left">He began to think that Claude Carleton was going to be of real
    help to him. He had taken a liking to the Carletons, Miss Violet and that
    flower-faced Pauline&mdash;well, he was rather pleased to dine with them.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a family dinner, simple from the Carleton point of view,
    rather elaborate from Kenneth&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p align="left">Z&eacute;lie and Don Randall were still at the house, though
    they had declared their intention of leaving. The two secretaries were still
    there, too, and, watching them closely, Kenneth came again to the conclusion
    that the pair were married.</p>
  <p align="left">He couldn&rsquo;t have said why he thought this, it was not
    at all that they were over-affectionate or demonstrative. On the contrary,
    they were rather formal with each other and said little to anyone. But this,
    Kenneth argued, meant that they looked forward to hours alone together, and
    they could afford to be silent now.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a queer state of things. If they were married, why keep
    it secret? Kenneth determined to find out.</p>
  <p align="left">He had never entirely eliminated the possibility of Peter Gregg
    as the murderer, unlikely though he admitted it to be.</p>
  <p align="left">Deep in his thoughts, he was suddenly roused by Polly&rsquo;s
    voice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wake up, Mr. Carlisle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want
    to talk to you, and I know after dinner you&rsquo;ll hide away with Claude
    and we shan&rsquo;t see you at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s make the most of the present moment,&rdquo; he
    said, rallying quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you want to talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me what you think about poor old Scotty&rsquo;s
    death. Who could have wanted to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A scientist, Mrs. Carleton, has many enemies, or rather,
    perhaps, jealous and envious colleagues or rivals. It scarcely seems possible
    these people would go so far as to kill him for his formulas or scientific
    secrets, but&mdash;he has been killed, and, so far as I know, he has no personal
    or social enemies. Though, of course, he may have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor old man,&rdquo; said Miss Violet, &ldquo;we mustn&rsquo;t
    speak ill of the dead, but do you know, Mr. Carlisle, I always thought he
    killed my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Kenneth. &ldquo;I mean why should you
    think that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because he was the only one who could get into a locked
    room,&rdquo; Violet declared, her handsome old head nodding her emphasis.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And how could he do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, that I can&rsquo;t say. But he was a scientist,
    and he made all sorts of amazing contraptions. I&rsquo;ve been to his laboratory,
    and he has shown off some things you couldn&rsquo;t believe possible. Queer
    things, you know, that blew up or gyrated around or parachuted across the
    room and exploded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exploded?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and annihilated themselves. Oh, there was the devil
    to pay up in his workroom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you think he could have invented a way to get in
    and out of a locked room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he could, at least, he&rsquo;s the only
    one who could. No one without his powers of invention could do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But, Aunt Vi,&rdquo; Claude said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    too bad to accuse poor old Scotty of Dad&rsquo;s death when he isn&rsquo;t
    here to defend himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, Claude, you know yourself he&rsquo;s the only reasonable
    suspect. He wanted his money. He knew Manning was leaving him a big legacy,
    and he wanted it for his work. He begged and begged for it in advance, but
    Manning wouldn&rsquo;t give it to him. I didn&rsquo;t blame my brother, for
    he had already given the old man a lot of money at different times. And we
    know how the professor acted that night. Pounding on the library door and
    begging to be let in, and going off in a huff when Manning told him no. Then,
    what more likely than for him to go down again, much later, after everybody
    else had settled down quietly, and once again beg Manning to let him come
    in. Perhaps by that time Manning was through with what he was doing and ready
    to talk to the old man. Perhaps he let him come in, and then, when Scott
    made exorbitant demands, and Manning refused, perhaps Scott shot him and
    managed by his own hocus-pocus to get out of the library and leave it locked
    and bolted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good for you, Aunt Violet,&rdquo; Claude said,  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
    a born detective. Now, no more of this sort of talk at table. I forbid it.
    Other subjects, if you please!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude was obeyed this time, and the chat was on pleasanter
    matters for the rest of the dinner hour.</p>
  <p align="left">But directly afterward Kenneth and his host went in the library
    and shut the doors.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are your two secretaries married?&rdquo; Carlisle asked
    casually.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Why did you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They act that way. Are you keeping them both on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Both or neither. I don&rsquo;t care much about having
    Gregg, but Polly wants Emily, so there you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they announce the marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sheer funk, I guess. They seem to think if they tell
    they will at once be accused of having put Dad out of the way so they could
    be married. You see, it meant money for Peter and freedom to marry for both.
    Father was dead set against their marriage because he felt Peter would be
    no good as secretary if a married man. Foolish, of course, but Dad often
    had foolish whims. Now, I don&rsquo;t suspect Gregg at all. And of course
    I don&rsquo;t suspect Emily. That would be absurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you do suspect&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Old Scott. As a matter of fact Aunt Violet pretty much
    voiced my views at the dinner table. And here&rsquo;s another thing. Has
    it ever struck you that the gun that shot Dad was some peculiar sort of weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Peculiar, how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Only I don&rsquo;t believe Scott
    came here to the New Year&rsquo;s party with a revolver in his pocket. I
    believe he had some little gadget that he could use that was deadly and yet
    small enough to be inconspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all. But if he did have such a thing,
    and if he could invent a way to leave the room locked after him, and if Dad
    did let him in later, after he had refused him before, why, then, we have
    Scott with motive, means, and opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all so,&rdquo; Kenneth agreed, speaking
    slowly. &ldquo;But, somehow, it doesn&rsquo;t ring true. What did you go
    back upstairs for at the apartment, this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just that very thing. I imagined Gilbert had the gun
    contraption or whatever the shooting was done with and was holding out on
    us. I thought he would exhibit it as soon as we were out of sight and hearing.
    So I left my coat purposely and went back for it softly, hoping to catch
    them out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Claude looked disappointed. &ldquo;They were
    all in the laboratory poking about among the half-finished models and inventions.
    I think it&rsquo;s a shame to allow it. They might easily spoil a whole important
    model, or interfere with an unfinished experiment. Gilbert ought not to let
    them do it. But I didn&rsquo;t say anything. I picked up my coat, threw it
    over my arm, and stalked out. It&rsquo;s strange how the police resent the
    presence of laymen, even though they might be helpful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They not only resent it, in many places it is forbidden.
    And to be sure, lots of times the outsiders make more trouble than their
    suggestions are worth. Very few civilians are as clever as we are, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle&rsquo;s eyes twinkled, and if Claude suspected a bit
    of irony he gave no sign.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Has the old man any people?&rdquo; Kenneth asked.  &ldquo;Who
    will get his inheritance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea, I think he has some relatives down
    East or somewhere. If not, I hope the money will go to further his scientific
    research work in some way. That&rsquo;s what he would have wanted. Likely
    he left a will. Now, there&rsquo;s no use, as I can see, in our broadcasting
    any suspicion of Professor Scott as a murderer. We&rsquo;ve no proof, and
    besides, the man is dead. Neither justice nor vengeance could overtake him
    now, and it seems useless to raise the question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I agree to that, unless the police raise it themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I went back. I wanted to see by their
    attitudes if they had discovered anything definite or anything pointing to
    Scott&rsquo;s guilt or guilty knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you saw nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing at all. You can tell, you know, by the attitude
    of the men, whether they are interested or whether they are just blankly
    searching for something to turn up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I think you can. Well, then, what&rsquo;s your
    idea of our next proceeding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing, just nothing at all. If Scott killed my father,
    I am willing to let his death wipe out the crime. If he didn&rsquo;t, we
    surely don&rsquo;t want to drag his name in the dirt. My one desire now is
    to drop the search, hush up the whole matter, call off the police, and try
    to forget it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will the police consent to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to, if we drop it all. They may stick
    to it for a time, but it will soon be relegated to the limbo of unsolved
    mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_14">Chapter 14</a><br>Joe Gets a Chicken Dinner</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">LIKE many men who are energetic and efficient when working,
    Carlisle was given to indulgence and luxury when idle.</p>
  <p align="left">The next day being Sunday, he concluded to devote his day of
    rest to a comfortable r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the Carleton-Scott case or
    cases, as they might prove to be.</p>
  <p align="left">His bright and cheerful living room, with large windows on
    two sides, a cozy wood fire burning, and various easy chairs with attendant
    tables or smoke stands, was an ideal place to loaf about and ruminate.</p>
  <p align="left">Carter brought a breakfast tray and the Sunday papers, but
    these were rapidly though thoroughly dealt with, and Kenneth settled down
    to smoke and think.</p>
  <p align="left">Naturally, his thoughts centered round Professor Scott. To
    go back to New Year&rsquo;s Eve, there was a possibility that the professor
    had sent the skeleton. His motive was doubtless one of two. Either it was
    merely a silly prank, the playful gesture of a doddering old man, or it was
    a deep-laid and wicked plot to give Manning Carleton such a shock that it
    would affect his weak heart and bring about a stroke or a sudden heart failure
    that would be fatal.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle didn&rsquo;t just think of these things and then forget
    them, he studied their possibilities and probabilities, and he finally decided
    that it was a plausible theory that Scott was implicated in the skeleton
    matter.</p>
  <p align="left">The fact that the old professor asked for the skeleton seemed
    to prove that he was nervously anxious to get it, and that seemed more like
    the anxiety of an evildoer than the desire of a poverty-stricken scientist
    to get a skeleton to experiment with.</p>
  <p align="left">Besides, Scott had no line of research work, so far as Carlisle
    knew, that called for anatomical investigation. His line was scientific invention
    and research, and especially in that field Gilbert had mentioned. What was
    it, now? Ballistics. It had to do with firearms and projectiles. A strange
    science that! Why did it make him think of popguns and catapults?</p>
  <p align="left">His old college tasks flitted through his mind.</p>
  <p align="left">Yes, he remembered. A ballista was a catapult. To be sure,
    a catapult was a far cry from a popgun, but they had their propulsiveness
    in common.</p>
  <p align="left">Still he was haunted by the two scarred telephone books.</p>
  <p align="left">Try as he would, he couldn&rsquo;t make his cogitations run
    along prescribed paths. He gave up trying and let his fancies have free range.</p>
  <p align="left">And as he thought and imagined, he seemed to see a diabolical
    contraption or device that had shot Manning Carleton and that had also shot
    the old professor, and that in each case, for some reason, had torn the cover
    of the telephone book.</p>
  <p align="left">That argued, then, that the device, whatever it was, stood
    on the thick book when it was used.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, Carlisle was seized with a wild desire to possess one
    or both of those torn books. Surely they held the secret. Surely he could
    wrest that secret from the torn pages if he had them at his home, alone,
    to think over slowly.</p>
  <p align="left">He called up the old apartment house where the professor had
    lived.</p>
  <p align="left">He asked for the elevator boy, Joe Hopper.</p>
  <p align="left">At last he heard a very faint and somewhat frightened voice
    saying:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yassuh&mdash;yassuh&mdash;here I is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Joe, don&rsquo;t be scared. You remember
    me yesterday? I was with the inspector when he first came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, shuah! Cert&rsquo;nly. Was you de man whut lef&rsquo;  his
    obercoat or de odder one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the other one. My name&rsquo;s Carlisle. Now,
    you listen. Can you get into Professor Scott&rsquo;s apartment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo; spec&rsquo; so. De perlice locked it all
    up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but how about a pass key, or a back way, or a pantry
    window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Golly! You wants me do dat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I sure do. I&rsquo;ll see you through. I&rsquo;m a detective
    myself, you know. I want you to help me. When are you off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In &rsquo;bout halluf a nour now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. As soon&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re off, you get
    into that apartment somehow, no matter how, and get the Suburban telephone
    book. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;De big fat one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I guess it is the fattest one nowadays. Anyhow,
    I want the Suburban, no other. And I want that one from the professor&rsquo;s
    room. Don&rsquo;t bring me one from any other place. No matter if it is torn.
    And don&rsquo;t tear it any more. Handle it carefully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You wants me to tote it down to your place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lordy! How&rsquo;ll I get my dinnah? I only has a nour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You get the book and hike yourself down here, and I&rsquo;ll
    give you a chicken dinner&mdash;a good one. Here&rsquo;s my address, got
    a pencil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah. Did you say chicken dinnah, sah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did. But you be careful of that book. Wrap it in a
    newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah. Be dar d&rsquo;reckly, sah. Reck&rsquo;n I c&rsquo;n
    get off little ahead er time, sah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth laughed as he heard the eagerness in the boy&rsquo;s
    voice, and calling Carter he bade him tell the cook to hustle a perfectly
    good chicken dinner in short order.</p>
  <p align="left">And then he set his thoughts in order, even making a list of
    points he wanted to ask Joe about.</p>
  <p align="left">About noon the boy came, carrying a large parcel, obediently
    wrapped in newspaper.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hello, Joe,&rdquo; said Kenneth cordially. &ldquo;Come
    along in. I see you have the book I wanted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yessah, I hab. But lemme tell yo&rsquo;, it wasn&rsquo;t
    in de perfessor&rsquo;s room a-tall. Dat it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I wanted the one that was in the professor&rsquo;s
    room. I don&rsquo;t want any other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An&rsquo; yo&rsquo; don&rsquo; get no odder. Lissen
    here. In Perfessor Scott&rsquo;s room, his settin&rsquo; room, you know,
    dere was all de odder tellyfone books, but not de Subbubban. I knows &rsquo;em
    all. Course I do. De Manhattan and de Bronnix and de Brooklyn and de Red
    Book, dey was all dere, but not de Subbubban. Nossir! Well, what to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When did you look?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Right after you tole me to. Dis mawnin&rsquo;. I tell
    you trufe, it jes&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t dar. Well, I s&rsquo;picioned sumbuddy
    had frowed it away,  &rsquo;cos you said it was tore like. So I hops outside,
    an&rsquo; in de rubbish can I done found it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">By this time Kenneth had the newspaper cover off and saw at
    once it was the book he wanted. At least, it was a Suburban book with the
    indentation and marring he had seen on the book in the professor&rsquo;s
    room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was the rubbish can?&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In de janitor&rsquo;s cubbid. Dere&rsquo;s one on each
    flo&rsquo;  where anybody kin frow trash. Dere wasn&rsquo;t much in it to-day,
    but dat book was right on top. Whut time does you have dinnah, suh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth smiled and summoned Carter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This chap&rsquo;s chicken ready?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, just about. Mortimer says he can come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go to it, Joe,&rdquo; said Kenneth. &ldquo;Eat all you
    can, and then come back here prepared to answer a lot of questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah, okay, sah,&rdquo; and the boy went jubiliantly
    away.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dirty work at the crossroads,&rdquo; murmured Carlisle,
    as he stared at the book. &ldquo;I left it there, with its good side up,
    when I came away. Now, either those fool policemen saw it and thinking it
    was in disreputable shape threw it in the trash barrel, or, sometime last
    night, the murderer went there and disposed of it himself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced these two torn telephone books have
    something to do with the two murders. I&rsquo;m sure the two crimes are connected.
    But I can&rsquo;t puzzle out how or why. I believe I&rsquo;ve a helper in
    Joe. I&rsquo;ll give him a chicken dinner as often as he&rsquo;ll give me
    as good a return for it as he has to-day.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet, after all, this may mean nothing. Gilbert may have
    chucked it out, thinking it an old one. Yet he saw the marred book at the
    Carleton house, can&rsquo;t he put two and two together? Stokes wouldn&rsquo;t
    pitch it out, he&rsquo;s too clever. Must have been one of those dumb policemen
    who only serve by standing round and waiting. Well, I have it, anyway. And
    I observe it is precisely the same banged-up, scratched-up, torn-up affair
    as the other one. Why? And what a narrow squeak that I did get it! I suppose
    only because it&rsquo;s Sunday and the trash wasn&rsquo;t emptied to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He was still pondering over his puzzle when Joe returned.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lawzee, Mr. Callile, dat was shuah one bang-up dinnah!
    I&rsquo;m mighty obligated to yo&rsquo;, I shuah am!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Joe. Now, sit down there and talk. Was there
    anything else in that trash barrel from the professor&rsquo;s rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Guess not. &rsquo;Cos de book laid right on top of a
    lot of rags of ribbin an&rsquo; lace dat musta come from some lady&rsquo;s
    was&rsquo;e basket. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah, I am. &rsquo;Cos de book was flopped right into
    de lot of rags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who do you think put it there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, anybuddy mought &rsquo;a&rsquo; done dat.
    I s&rsquo;pose de perlice, mebbe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps. Now, tell me more about the chap who brought
    up the White Rock and stuff. Describe him again. Was he about my build?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nossah.&rdquo; Joe eyed Carlisle. &ldquo;Not so tall,
    I&rsquo;d say, an&rsquo; mo&rsquo; weightier. Sumpin&rsquo; like the heft
    ob dat man w&rsquo;at I took up wid you later. De one w&rsquo;at went back
    fo&rsquo; his obercoat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes? That&rsquo;s Mr. Carleton. Was your chap as good-looking
    as Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, nossah. He was po&rsquo;ly dressed&mdash;no, mo&rsquo; to
    say, ca&rsquo;lessly dressed. He looked like he didn&rsquo; care whut he
    wore a-tall. His collah wasn&rsquo;t so awful fash&rsquo;nable, an&rsquo; his
    tie wasn&rsquo;t tied ve&rsquo;y proper. But his eyes dey kep&rsquo; dah&rsquo;tin
    roun&rsquo;, and he saw ebberyting dey was to see. Yessah, he didn&rsquo; miss
    nuffin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think he was a regular delivery
    boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nossah, I don&rsquo;t. An&rsquo; he wasn&rsquo;t no
    boy, he was a man. Growed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How old?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I dunno. Say, &rsquo;bout thutty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-looking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sorta. &rsquo;Cept his eyes. Dey was sorta glassy like,
    de way mudderer&rsquo;s eyes is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You never saw a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, de way mudderer&rsquo;s eyes oughta be, den. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
    seed &rsquo;em in de movies. An&rsquo; dis guy was jes&rsquo; lak &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you really think he killed Professor Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Co&rsquo;se I do, fer sartin. Kem up p&rsquo;tendin&rsquo; to
    be a deliv&rsquo;ry fella, and den, once he was inside, he kilt de ole man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think he had any evil intent when you
    took him up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Co&rsquo;se not. How could I? But w&rsquo;en I heard
    de ole man was dead, den I knowed. Yassah, I knowed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t know, Joe. You mean you imagined
    or surmised&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dunno &rsquo;bout dose highfalutin&rsquo; wo&rsquo;ds,
    but I knowed. De Spi&rsquo;ts tole me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The boy looked very solemn, almost weird, as his great eyes
    rolled around and his voice fell to a low whisper. He had the look most of
    his race put on when they refer to death in any form or in any connection.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get off any foolishness about spirits with
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t foolishness, Mistah Callile, hones&rsquo; it
    ain&rsquo;t. But w&rsquo;en I seed dat glassy-eyed fellah I jes&rsquo; knowed&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look here, Joe, did you ever see anybody who took drugs&mdash;dope,
    you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yassah, I hab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did this chap look like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, sah, he mought. But mo&rsquo; lak a beginnah,
    sah, not w&rsquo;at dey calls a addick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Not an addict, that is, not far gone in the vice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s it. He didn&rsquo; seem lak he was a drinkin&rsquo;  fella,
    yet he was sumpin&rsquo; funny. I guess you hit it wid de dope racket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me more about him. What did he say to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nufin&rsquo;. Nuffin&rsquo; a-tall. Jes&rsquo; asked
    whut number was de perfessor&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Had no peculiarity, no tricky little habit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not dat I noticed. &rsquo;Cept, well, yessah, he did
    snap his fingers de hull endurin&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Snap his fingers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah. In a cu&rsquo;ous way. I&rsquo;se been tryin&rsquo; to
    do it ebber since. Dis way, see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Joe snapped all four of his finger tips against his palm, but
    in succession, not simultaneously. It was a crude gesture, but Kenneth could
    see that done by an expert it would be an intriguing little trick.</p>
  <p align="left">He tried it himself, but quickly decided it would need practice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of thing I mean, Joe,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;Now, do you think of anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But Joe&rsquo;s memory had run its course, and he could only
    repeat what he had already told.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His voice, Joe, what was his voice like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I on&rsquo;y heard it de once w&rsquo;en he asked fo&rsquo; de
    apahtment numbah, so I dunno much &rsquo;bout it. But it was high up like,
    sorta squeeky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a deep chest voice, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, nossah. Not dat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Concluding he could learn no more from the lad, Carlisle gave
    him a douceur that sent him on his way rejoicing.</p>
  <p align="left">After Joe&rsquo;s departure Kenneth stalked up and down the
    room, lost in thought. He took slight interest in luncheon and finally decided
    he must learn more about ballistics or his education was far from complete.</p>
  <p align="left">He telephoned Inspector Gilbert and inquired as to Professor
    Scott&rsquo;s friends or relatives.</p>
  <p align="left">There were no relatives, it seemed, in New York City, and the
    only friends known about were two or three elderly professors, probably dry-as-dust,
    like Scotty himself.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle took a couple of their addresses and went to see them.</p>
  <p align="left">He was fortunate in finding the first one in, a wizened old
    man with bright eyes and an alert air.</p>
  <p align="left">He seemed pleased to see Kenneth, doubtless being ill equipped
    in the matter of friends.</p>
  <p align="left">After some discussion of Professor Scott&rsquo;s prowess in
    his chosen lines, Kenneth introduced the subject of ballistics.</p>
  <p align="left">To his satisfaction he found this a favorite topic of the old
    man, whose name, Hemmingway, was well known among his confreres, if not to
    the world at large.</p>
  <p align="left">He explained, without too much technicality, the general principles
    of firearms and projectiles.</p>
  <p align="left">When Kenneth described to him the peculiar marring of the telephone
    books at the scene of both murders, Hemmingway grew deeply interested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No powder marks,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;of course
    not. It was probably an air gun.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth smiled. &ldquo;I had popgun in my head all along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say popgun, although that is, of course,
    a simple type of air gun. But, you see, a real air gun has a terrible back
    kick. Your murderer would want something to absorb and protect him from that,
    and what better than a thick, soft telephone book? And the resultant condition
    of that book would be just what you describe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the air-gun shot would be fatal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Assuredly. It is a weapon not often used nowadays, but
    deadly in its work. Moreover, it may be tiny. They are made not much bigger
    than a lead pencil. Well, yes, larger than that, say the size of a carpenter&rsquo;s
    lead pencil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And if one did not use the telephone book or something
    equally resilient and receptive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then one would be severely wounded. There must be a
    shock absorber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you can think of no other way to shoot at close
    range, without leaving powder burns?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is no other way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And where would one get this air-gun arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That would be the difficulty. I can think of no way
    to get one but to make it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what knowledge must I possess to make it myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Full and complete knowledge of firearms and projectiles,
    working experience in the manufacture of the same, and a well equipped laboratory
    with capable assistants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not so easy to come by,&rdquo; commented Carlisle.  &ldquo;Could
    Professor Scott have made one of these infernal machines?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, easily. And they are not infernal machines.
    That phrase connotes gunpowder or some other explosive. An airgun needs only
    an air cap and there you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And a bullet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course. Or a lead slug. Or a dart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, a dart wasn&rsquo;t used. Well, Professor Hemmingway,
    you&rsquo;ve been very kind, and I&rsquo;m grateful for your courtesy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not at all, young man. Come in again, if I can help
    you further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Leaving there, Kenneth went down to the Carleton house.</p>
  <p align="left">He was always sure of a welcome there. Even if Claude should
    be out, Miss Violet or the fair Pauline invariably received him kindly and
    had time to devote to his entertainment.</p>
  <p align="left">Sunday afternoon meant the probability of other guests, but
    Kenneth chanced it and walked all the way down from the high-numbered streets
    where professors have their haunts.</p>
  <p align="left">There were some other callers there, and Miss Violet was entertaining
    them in the drawing room, so Kenneth sauntered on through the hall to Polly&rsquo;s
    pretty boudoir.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;come in, Mr. Carlisle.
    I&rsquo;d like you to meet my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was the first Kenneth had heard that Polly had a brother,
    which, however, was not surprising, as heretofore the private investigator
    had called only in a business way.</p>
  <p align="left">Egbert Warren, Polly introduced him, and her manner betokened
    a pride as well as a deep affection in this relative of hers. The affection
    Kenneth could understand, as most sisters are fond of their brothers, but
    the pride was not so easily explained.</p>
  <p align="left">For Egbert was far from impressive in looks or manner.</p>
  <p align="left">Pale brown hair, a thin, smooth-shaven face, hazel eyes with
    little animation in them, and a limp, lackadaisical handshake summed up the
    physical effects of Egbert Warren.</p>
  <p align="left">But, noting Polly&rsquo;s admiration of him in her eyes, Kenneth
    bestirred himself to take the cue.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hobnobbing with the wise and learned,&rdquo; he
    began, by way of opening a conversation. &ldquo;An old professor must have
    a thin time of it, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Professor Scott did,&rdquo; and Polly suddenly looked
    saddened. &ldquo;Think of that poor man dying there alone, and so far as
    I know he&rsquo;s alone yet. I mean they can&rsquo;t find any relatives or
    people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about death all the time, Poll,&rdquo;  said
    her brother pettishly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have come here, and you know
    it, except you promised not to harp on the murder. And here you go on another
    one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Eg, I did promise that. Mr. Carlisle,
    tell us something not in any way connected with tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Comedy, then?&rdquo; he said lightly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll
    tell you about Joe. Black Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Old Black Joe?&rdquo; asked Polly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, about seventeen, I should say. I had him to dinner
    to-day, and though I didn&rsquo;t sit with him at table I&rsquo;m told he
    ate a whole chicken of goodly size.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With trimmings?&rdquo; inquired Polly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes. And mince pie and nuts and raisins and cider.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; commented Egbert. &ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d
    been there myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My cook is a marvel at cooking chicken,&rdquo;  Kenneth
    told him. &ldquo;Come round some day and try for yourself. You live in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Egbert doesn&rsquo;t go about much,&rdquo; his sister
    said quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I can,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;You let me alone,
    Sis. If Mr. Carlisle is asking me in earnest, I&rsquo;m going. I love chicken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stay here to dinner to-night, and we&rsquo;ll have it,&rdquo; Polly
    said placatingly. &ldquo;So Black Joe had the time of his life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kenneth went on. &ldquo;I rather think he
    doesn&rsquo;t have a groaning board to sit at every day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who is he? A prot&eacute;g&eacute; of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no. He&rsquo;s an elevator boy in the house where
    Professor Scott lived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle had no more than uttered the words when he remembered
    that any mention of death or murder was taboo in the presence of brother
    Egbert.</p>
  <p align="left">Hastily he changed the subject and apropos of nothing said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is Miss D&rsquo;Orsay here still, or has she gone home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still here.&rdquo; Polly seemed to welcome
    the change. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone for a drive with Don. You see, I&rsquo;m
    a born matchmaker, and I&rsquo;m trying to bring about a romance there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you find obstacles in your path?&rdquo; Kenneth
    smiled at her, for Randall&rsquo;s worship of the lovely Pauline was an open
    secret.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; She blushed a little.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know he adores you, Poll,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;Why
    don&rsquo;t you take him, now you&rsquo;re free?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush, Egbert, don&rsquo;t talk like that. Be good, now,
    or I&rsquo;ll send you home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t send me home. I won&rsquo;t go.
    You can&rsquo;t boss me round like you used to. You know that as well as
    I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He snapped his fingers at her, and Pauline playfully caught
    his hand in both her own roseleaf palms.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_15">Chapter 15</a><br>The Mortlakes and Their Theory</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;GO into the drawing room, Mr. Carlisle,&rdquo; Pauline
    said,  &ldquo;and Violet will give you tea, or whatever you want. I&rsquo;m
    coming in directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The merest shadow of a nod of dismissal made Kenneth obey immediately,
    and he went out into the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">But instead of the drawing room he drifted into the smoking
    room, where Claude sat, talking with the two secretaries.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Claude cordially. &ldquo;Sit chap.
    Glad to see you. I&rsquo;m having a gabfest with our two turtledoves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The secret&rsquo;s out, then?&rdquo; and Kenneth smiled
    as he shook hands with the newly-weds.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It seems so,&rdquo; and Emily made a little grimace.  &ldquo;And
    I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t really
    half the world shaker we anticipated. I find very few people care whether
    we&rsquo;re married or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very few people care about anything that doesn&rsquo;t
    immediately concern themselves,&rdquo; Kenneth said. &ldquo;Have you planned
    your future?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just talking it over,&rdquo; Claude told
    him.  &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t really need a secretary. Gregg is ideal,
    but I couldn&rsquo;t keep him busy. Dad had outside lines. I haven&rsquo;t.
    There&rsquo;s nothing to do but draw checks to pay the bills I run up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Mrs. Carleton wants her efficient helper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, you see, Polly won&rsquo;t be entertaining or
    going out much just now. We&rsquo;re thinking of going round the world, with
    Violet along as chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going away, then, I must see to some
    matters in this house that I&rsquo;ve left unattended to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good heavens, man, we&rsquo;re not starting right off
    now!&rdquo; cried Claude, but Kenneth had already gone through the little
    cloakroom to the library.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude followed him, and the two Greggs came also.</p>
  <p align="left">They found Carlisle seated in Manning Carleton&rsquo;s desk
    chair, idly swiveling back and forth and then sideways.</p>
  <p align="left">He was looking very thoughtful and gazed up at the intruders
    with a slight frown.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doing the super-sleuth act?&rdquo; said Claude, with
    the first trace of ill-natured sarcasm he had ever flung at the detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; returned Kenneth gravely. &ldquo;You
    see, sitting here in your father&rsquo;s chair, I may get&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you believed in the supernatural,&rdquo; Claude
    jeered. &ldquo;Aura is the word you want, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; Kenneth smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
    cultivating the spooks. No, I mean that I may see something that I&rsquo;ve
    missed before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then let me help,&rdquo; said Claude, evidently entirely
    over his burst of ill temper. &ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;ve looked over
    everything on the desk a hundred times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it, but there&rsquo;s always the hundred and
    first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As he spoke Carlisle was writing on a paper pad with a pencil
    he had taken from the pen rack before him.</p>
  <p align="left">Replacing it, he took another pencil and wrote a few words
    with it. Then the third, the blue pencil, and after that he took up a pen.</p>
  <p align="left">Dipping it in the inkwell, he wrote again, and then used a
    fountain pen that lay there.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You skipped that other pen,&rdquo; said Claude, seeming
    amused at the performance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; and Kenneth took up the pen in question,
    inked it, and wrote once more on his page.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joy to write in here,&rdquo; he said casually.  &ldquo;The
    ink is always fresh, the pens clean, the blotter new, and the pencils sharp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Carleton was meticulous about such things,&rdquo;  Peter
    Gregg said. &ldquo;I always looked the desk over before he came in of a morning,
    but I never found a thing to criticize. Fenn has the under people trained
    to perfection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were married before Mr. Carleton died?&rdquo;  Carlisle
    asked suddenly, looking at Gregg.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and if he hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;departed
    this life, I don&rsquo;t know what we were going to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have had to depart from here yourselves,&rdquo;  Claude
    told him. &ldquo;Dad would never have forgiven you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I suppose not. And he would have cut me out of his
    will. But as it is, the outlook is rosy. Even if we don&rsquo;t stay on here,
    I can get a job, I&rsquo;m sure. You&rsquo;d give me a reference, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He looked at Claude with a gay impudence, and Kenneth marveled
    at his lack of tact and taste.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid you&rsquo;ll be a suspect if
    you&rsquo;re so openly pleased at the death of your benefactor?&rdquo; he
    said seriously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Gregg replied airily. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m
    innocent, and they don&rsquo;t suspect innocent men. Also, he wasn&rsquo;t
    my benefactor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, after leaving you that generous bequest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a generous bequest, it was hush money.
    I knew something Mr. Carleton didn&rsquo;t want told, and he paid for my
    secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you tell it now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can, but I don&rsquo;t propose to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Has it any bearing on the tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not so far as I know. Now, if you&rsquo;re through asking
    me questions, Mr. Carlisle, I think we&rsquo;ll go out for a walk. How about
    it, Emily?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The pair departed, and Kenneth and Claude looked at each other.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A queer Dick,&rdquo; Claude said. &ldquo;I think he
    has a kink in his mind. Also a superiority complex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not the criminal,&rdquo; Kenneth responded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why are you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too bold and daring. Even his superiority
    complex couldn&rsquo;t carry him through like that. What is his secret? Do
    you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he has any. Or if he has, it&rsquo;s
    some foolish, insignificant thing. And that speech about hush money is absurd.
    My father wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to anything of that sort. What have you written
    with all the pens and pencils? You know what people scribble thoughtlessly
    is an index to their characters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My character is very unoriginal, then,&rdquo; and Kenneth
    laughed as he showed the scribbled page.</p>
  <p align="left">Every entry was the same, merely the present date. Sunday afternoon,
    and the month and year.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unoriginal intentionally?&rdquo; Claude smiled as he
    scanned the page. &ldquo;But it tells something. You&rsquo;re not conceited,
    or you would have written your own name, with flourishes beneath. You don&rsquo;t
    suspect anyone who was here when you wrote, or you would have written their
    names. You weren&rsquo;t absorbed in some outside matter, or you would have
    written some reference to it. Your mind was an utter blank, and so you wrote
    the first thing you saw, which was the date on that calendar in front of
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A good bit surprised, Kenneth looked at the calendar and saw
    that the date was there, arranged precisely as he had written it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on Claude, &ldquo;I think you emptied
    your mind on purpose. Left it blank for any passing impression to register.
    You knew we&rsquo;d look at what you wrote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Kenneth cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re clever
    enough to have committed this murder yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course I am&mdash;so are you. But here&rsquo;s what
    bothers me. Even if I am clever enough to have done this thing, I&rsquo;m
    not clever enough to ferret out who really did do it. For I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;truly,
    old man, I didn&rsquo;t. We Carletons are not murderers, and&mdash;well,
    I can&rsquo;t conceive of the villain who could kill his own father! I assure
    you I did not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle&rsquo;s experience had taught him much as
    to recognizing the truth when it was handed to him, and he knew that Claude
    spoke absolute truth. The ring of his voice and the straight, boring glance
    of his eye carried entire conviction to the detective, and Kenneth&rsquo;s
    answering nod was one of complete agreement and belief.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Claude went on, &ldquo;I really think
    we&rsquo;d better give up the search. I fear that Scott&rsquo;s death has
    complicated matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I think maybe there were episodes in my father&rsquo;s
    past life that Scott knew about. Things I, of course, knew nothing of, but
    things not entirely creditable to my father. This would explain Scott&rsquo;s
    sending that skeleton with its implication of&mdash;of wrongdoing on Dad&rsquo;s
    part, long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meaning murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t put it so bluntly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sorry, old man. But I&rsquo;m in dead earnest now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no more in dead earnest than I am. And,
    by the way, Carlisle, I didn&rsquo;t engage you on this case, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;ve always wondered who did. Somebody
    telephoned me to come right down here. My man took the message&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know all that. And you don&rsquo;t know who telephoned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course I do. I asked a few questions when I got home
    the next day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I asked questions too, but I got no satisfactory answers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, you see, everybody was afraid to speak out. Well,
    the man who asked you to come down here was Professor Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certain. Fenn knew it, but he&rsquo;s a most secretive
    chap. However, old Scotty himself told Aunt Violet that he sent for you because
    he wanted your talent on the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he got it&rdquo;&mdash;Kenneth looked chagrined&mdash;&ldquo;and
    much good it has done him or anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re discouraged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All of that and then some! Discouraged, disheartened,
    disgruntled, disconcerted&mdash;discombobulated generally!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor boy! But it&rsquo;s not surprising. It&rsquo;s
    an insoluble case, I&rsquo;ll say. Though I&rsquo;ve heard that the harder
    a case seems, the more easily it is solved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s always true. Anyway,
    who could imagine how the murderer got out of this room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look here, Carlisle. Take that thing practically. Don&rsquo;t
    look for concealed exits or supernatural causes, but try it like this. Suppose,
    just for sake of argument, it was old Scotty, after all. Suppose he came
    down here and persuaded Father to let him in. Suppose he meant to beg for
    the money he wanted and if he didn&rsquo;t get it he meant to do him in and
    get the legacy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, wait a minute, hear me through. Suppose, then,
    that Dad was obdurate and wouldn&rsquo;t give in an inch. Then Scott, who
    is an inventive genius in the matter of firearms, outs with a gun of some
    sort, most likely an ordinary pistol, and shoots Father through the heart.
    Then, of course, comes the getting-out stunt. Well, he doesn&rsquo;t get
    out until the crowd breaks in. He knows this is bound to happen sooner or
    later, and he just waits. When he hears the noise out in the hall and hears
    them get a policeman and all that, he is on the alert and follows all their
    movements. He knows when they try to get in at the window, when they find
    they can&rsquo;t and when they decide to break in the rear door. Then he
    gets behind that door, you see there&rsquo;s room enough, and when they do
    break in, they&rsquo;re all so intent on looking at Father, who is in the
    bright lights, of course, that they pay no attention to anything else, and
    old Scotty slips out unnoticed. Then he can hide behind the coats hanging
    in the cloakroom, or go at once up to his own room, or mingle with the others
    as they come downstairs&mdash;he has everything his own way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth, who had listened attentively, nodded his head, was
    silent for a minute, and then said slowly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then who killed Scott and why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think that was a different matter altogether. I don&rsquo;t
    believe the two crimes were in any way connected. But I do believe Professor
    Scott was the one and the only one implicated in the death of my father,
    and now that he is dead I can&rsquo;t see any purpose in going any farther
    into the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; Kenneth said after a pause.  &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re not. But I do ask permission to pursue the matter
    a little farther. I won&rsquo;t consider myself engaged, as you call it,
    I won&rsquo;t bother anybody, but I do want to satisfy myself on a few points.
    To change the subject, I was surprised to learn that Mrs. Carleton had a
    brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why? Brothers are not unusual phenomena.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;d never heard of him before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a great deprivation. Egbert is a good enough chap,
    but&mdash;well, nutty. Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean really lacking, but
    just&mdash;odd, queer, anything you choose to call it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking him round the world with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heavens, no! Why would I do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He seems so devoted to his sister and so dependent upon
    her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well&mdash;as I have hinted to you before, I&rsquo;m
    hoping that when we come back from our trip Mrs. Carleton will be dependent
    on me, and Brother Egbert will take a back seat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope so, I&rsquo;m sure. Mrs. Carleton is charming
    and lovely, a decided contrast to her less attractive brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Now, Carlisle, old man, I don&rsquo;t want
    to be insistent, but you understand, don&rsquo;t you, that I&rsquo;d rather
    you&rsquo;d lay off this matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I do. And I&rsquo;ve promised not to bother or
    annoy you. By the way, Inspector Gilbert is on a new trail. He&rsquo;s thinking
    of Mortlake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s right, but he may be.
    Mortlake had a lot against Dad. I don&rsquo;t want to go into it, but you
    and Gilbert can do so if you like. I just want to get away from it all. Pauline
    and Aunt Violet feel the same way&mdash;that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going
    on our trip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And this house will be shut up while you are gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, naturally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, of course. I don&rsquo;t care, only, as I said,
    I&rsquo;ll make my little investigations, and they are little, before you
    go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, go to it. Report any developments to me,
    will you&mdash;if any?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I will. I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Claude left the room on that, and Kenneth sat there alone,
    gazing about him. He took a fresh sheet of paper and again scribbled some
    dates, but this time he used no pencils, only the various pens.</p>
  <p align="left">He folded the paper and was about to put it in his pocket when
    he paused and changed his mind. Rising and going to the bookcase, he took
    down an old French dictionary. He laid the paper carefully in this and returned
    the volume to its place on the shelf, taking care to preserve the previous
    alignment of the books.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, after a little more silent thought, he opened the door
    and went out.</p>
  <p align="left">He went out through the cloakroom, and noted that what Claude
    had said was perfectly true. Scott, or anyone else, could have hidden behind
    the door in the library until the door was broken in, then could have slipped
    out and hidden in the cloakroom.</p>
  <p align="left">It looked easy, but&mdash;was it? Was it likely that the eager
    investigators, the burly policeman, Fenn himself, would let anybody slip
    through?</p>
  <p align="left">Moreover, he was under the impression that Scott had been with
    the investigating party. Claude might easily have misunderstood this, for
    he had only a hearsay account of the whole affair.</p>
  <p align="left">So Kenneth went in search of Fenn and found his recollection
    was right. The professor had been with the group outside the front windows
    and with them when they broke in the door. Fenn was positive on these points
    and referred Kenneth to the patrolman Garvin.</p>
  <p align="left">Still, the detective ruminated, Claude&rsquo;s theory was sound
    enough, only it must be tied up to some other suspect than Professor Scott.</p>
  <p align="left">This made him think of Mortlake, and he concluded to go to
    see that somewhat retiring individual.</p>
  <p align="left">As there was no one in the drawing room he bade Fenn make his
    adieux to the ladies and went to call at the other house.</p>
  <p align="left">Even as he went, he felt surprise at himself that he had not
    been there before.</p>
  <p align="left">Though no believer in the supernatural, he sometimes felt premonitions,
    and occasionally they turned out to be true ones.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, he had an inexplicable conviction that he was about to
    learn something, and, as he told himself emphatically, he could do with that!</p>
  <p align="left">The two Mortlakes received him coolly but not in a really unfriendly
    manner. It would be hard for anyone to be unfriendly with a chap so genial
    as Kenneth Carlisle normally was.</p>
  <p align="left">They sat in the front room of the house, a living room which
    lived up to its name, showing, as it did, the work basket of Mrs. Mortlake
    and the smoking stand of Mr. Mortlake on either side of the fireplace.</p>
  <p align="left">Both his hosts were calm and composed, and Carlisle saw at
    once it was not going to be an easy matter to bring up the subject of the
    murder casually.</p>
  <p align="left">So he plunged into it without waiting for opportunity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I called,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;to ask your
    opinion regarding the death of Professor Scott and how it affects your opinion
    regarding the death of Mr. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know our opinion regarding the death of Mr. Carleton?&rdquo; asked
    Jack Mortlake, speaking for himself and his wife, since the question had
    been addressed to both.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Kenneth. &ldquo;Do you care to tell
    it to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only theory,&rdquo; Mortlake began,
    but as he seemed quite ready to go on, Kenneth merely nodded and waited.</p>
  <p align="left">It had been said of Carlisle that his nod was enough to make
    the deepest-dyed criminal unburden himself freely. It was a nod that conveyed
    sympathy, understanding, and encouragement, and finding it useful, Kenneth
    frequently employed it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We think Fenn was the criminal,&rdquo; Mortlake proceeded
    in a narrative way. &ldquo;You know, the butler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kenneth agreed, &ldquo;I know him. I&rsquo;ve
    wondered why nobody ever suspected him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we do. You see, he&rsquo;s the only one, outside
    the Carletons themselves, who would know all about the communicating door.
    Of course, he would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we cut the three Carletons out of it. We don&rsquo;t
    think Miss Violet or Claude would commit murder, being Carletons, and having
    great pride of family and all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Mortlake sniffed, as one having had experience with the &ldquo;pride
    of family&rdquo; her husband mentioned.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; Mortlake went on, &ldquo;those
    guests knew nothing about the door. But Fenn did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, he wanted his legacy. He is getting old and he wants
    his little place in the country while he can enjoy it. And he and old man
    Carleton had been rather at odds of late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes. Servants&rsquo; gossip&mdash;than which there
    is no more reliable evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth gasped at this: he had been wont to believe of all
    things servants&rsquo; gossip was the least dependable.</p>
  <p align="left">But Mrs. Mortlake&rsquo;s vigorous nods of acquiescence made
    him think perhaps they knew better than he did.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, say Fenn planned to do this thing. He could easily
    manage to get into this house while we were asleep and unfasten the door
    on our side. Then, having unfastened the Carleton side before he came here,
    he could merely walk in, kill the old gentleman, and come back into this
    house. He could do it so quietly we wouldn&rsquo;t hear him, in our rear
    bedrooms. Then, he locks the door on this side again and bolts it, and goes
    back home, and awaits developments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But the door on the Carleton side is now unlocked and
    unbolted both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What of it? The curtain hangs over it, and when they
    break in and find the dead body, they are so interested and excited, they
    pay no attention to the door between. Indeed, I heard it was not mentioned
    till some time later, when, of course, Fenn could have locked and bolted
    it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle pondered on this, looking Mortlake straight in the
    face as he did so.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As a theory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it certainly holds
    water. You can&rsquo;t get away from that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t get away from that. And, as you
    know, I told you at first it was merely a theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Kenneth followed up, &ldquo;as I asked
    you at first, how does the death of Professor Scott verify or alter this
    theory of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mortlake took occasion to ponder over this question, and Mrs.
    Mortlake threw herself into the breach.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are two answers to that,&rdquo; she said, speaking
    slowly and very precisely; &ldquo;either Scott knew of Fenn&rsquo;s guilt,
    and Fenn killed Scott to save himself, or else&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or else?&rdquo; prompted Kenneth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or else the two murders are not connected at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Logical, Mrs. Mortlake, entirely logical. And which
    theory do you favor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think Fenn discovered that Scott knew his guilty secret,
    and he killed him or had him killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But this too is all theory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack Mortlake waked up again, &ldquo;yes,
    theory, but sound good sense. I can&rsquo;t think some outsider came in and
    did for Carleton, or for Scott either. Now, Fenn, a man of deep passions,
    as we have reason to know,&rdquo; he glanced at his wife, &ldquo;is quite
    capable of crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You ought to explain that, Jack,&rdquo; Mrs. Mortlake
    said. &ldquo;You see, Fenn was in love with a housekeeper of ours, years
    ago. And he almost killed her. So we know he is of the killer type.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Long after Kenneth Carlisle reached his home and sat thinking
    in his own rooms, he mulled over that speech, &ldquo;of the killer type.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For it seemed to him that all the Mortlakes had said, except
    that, referred just as definitely to Jack Mortlake as to the butler Fenn.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_16">Chapter 16</a><br>When Polly Wept</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">NEXT morning Kenneth Carlisle found his subconscious brain
    still obsessed by those words, &ldquo;the killer type.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Now Carlisle was one of those practical individuals who didn&rsquo;t
    believe in types to any great extent.</p>
  <p align="left">He held that one recognized a clergyman by his garb and not
    by his cast of countenance or manner of moving about. A restaurant waiter
    could be dressed to look like an artist or a musical composer made up to
    represent a gunman.</p>
  <p align="left">It was, of course, Carlisle&rsquo;s Hollywood experiences that
    had given him these convictions, and he had learned that, actors or not,
    some men had an innate talent for putting themselves into other people&rsquo;s
    skins.</p>
  <p align="left">He was clever at it himself, but not nearly so much as others
    he knew.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet, in this Carleton case he could see no reason or occasion
    for impersonation or imposture, and so he was thinking about this killer
    type.</p>
  <p align="left">He realized that when Mrs. Mortlake had used the phrase she
    had not meant that Fenn&rsquo;s looks betokened a murderous nature, but that
    their personal knowledge of him justified the accusation. Idly he wondered
    just what the killer type did look like.</p>
  <p align="left">The first idea would be a bludgeon-bearing caveman. But that
    was absurd for a present-day murderer.</p>
  <p align="left">No, to-day one must look for a clever, sleek, and capable sort.</p>
  <p align="left">He could not deny Fenn was all of that. But there was almost
    no evidence against Fenn. He ran over all the people he knew of in any way
    connected with the tragedy. Not one of them answered to his notion of what
    a murderer ought to look like, and Fenn least of all. Surely that correct,
    efficient, and important personage never dared step so far out of his routine
    and environment as to become a killer!</p>
  <p align="left">He had had motive and opportunity&mdash;yes, but who hadn&rsquo;t?</p>
  <p align="left">Everyone in that house that night had had motives and opportunity.
    That is, everyone was a beneficiary under the victim&rsquo;s will, and everyone
    seemed to be more or less on the rampage around the house during the important
    hours.</p>
  <p align="left">No use in running over the list again, he&rsquo;d been over
    it so many times.</p>
  <p align="left">Violet and Pauline were too absurd. Claude wasn&rsquo;t there.
    Scott was still wavering in the balance. Z&eacute;lie and Don Randall, not
    at all probable. The two secretaries didn&rsquo;t fill the bill.</p>
  <p align="left">Remained the two Mortlakes and Fenn.</p>
  <p align="left">Well, the Mortlakes said they suspected Fenn. That was a score
    against the Mortlakes. When one is guilty he always accuses another.</p>
  <p align="left">And the Mortlakes had it all their own way. They could open
    the door in the exact manner they had described Fenn doing. They had all
    the opportunity in the world, and they had motive, according to somebody.
    Who was it said Mortlake was Carleton&rsquo;s bootlegger and all that?</p>
  <p align="left">Queer, as a whole, the theory didn&rsquo;t appeal to Kenneth
    at all. He couldn&rsquo;t suspect Jack Mortlake; why, he&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t
    the killer type!</p>
  <p align="left">Smiling to himself, again he tried to conjure up in his mind
    the killer type. It was easier to say what it shouldn&rsquo;t be than what
    it should.</p>
  <p align="left">For instance, it ought to mean a furtive eye, not a clear,
    straightforward look like Fenn showed or Claude.</p>
  <p align="left">Scott, now, he had been a little shifty as to eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">And that brother of Pauline&rsquo;s. Ah, there was a killer
    type. Egbert what was his name?&mdash;Warren&mdash;surely was the very one
    to pick for a murderer.</p>
  <p align="left">Wherefore the picker might be certain he wasn&rsquo;t the one!</p>
  <p align="left">What was that the colored boy had said? Murderer&rsquo;s eyes.
    Could a killer have murderer&rsquo;s eyes, really? If so, Warren&rsquo;s
    would fill the bill. But it was sheer stark idiocy to suspect him. He had
    no motive, he wasn&rsquo;t remembered in the will. He had had no opportunity,
    how could he get into the house at all?</p>
  <p align="left">To be sure, he was dependent on Pauline, but, Lord, she had
    plenty of money to support a wastrel brother. He didn&rsquo;t look as if
    he required much. Pale, listless, he looked a little like a drug addict&mdash;&ldquo;addick&rdquo; as
    Joe called it.</p>
  <p align="left">Would Joe say Egbert had murderer&rsquo;s eyes?</p>
  <p align="left">But a chap can&rsquo;t murder with his eyes, and there was
    no way any other part of Mr. Warren&rsquo;s anatomy could have been introduced
    into the Carleton house that night.</p>
  <p align="left">Unless&mdash;Pauline let him in!</p>
  <p align="left">Heavens, his imagination was going bad. Time he gave up guessing
    about people and came down to solid facts.</p>
  <p align="left">He&rsquo;d better look up those dates he wrote down yesterday.</p>
  <p align="left">He called Carter and asked him to get some slips of paper from
    the waistcoat pocket of the suit he had worn the day before.</p>
  <p align="left">But the man soon returned from his quest with the announcement
    that there were no papers in the pocket in question, nor in any other pocket
    of the suit.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle sat up in surprise.</p>
  <p align="left">Had they been abstracted?</p>
  <p align="left">No, that was nonsense. He had lost them, probably dragged them
    out himself when he pulled out his watch.</p>
  <p align="left">But the uncertainty persisted. He wasn&rsquo;t the kind of
    man who pulls out papers unconsciously. Kenneth Carlisle always knew what
    he was doing.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet the other alternative was too ridiculous. Who could want
    to steal that paper? Who knew he had it? No one but Claude, and perhaps Fenn,
    who was in and out of the room all the time.</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn! Why did the butler persist in cropping up? Well, he had
    provided for this emergency, anyhow.</p>
  <p align="left">He must, then, have expected it!</p>
  <p align="left">No, not that, but he did make a second lot of scribblings with
    the pens on Manning Carleton&rsquo;s desk, and he did hide them where they
    would doubtless be safe.</p>
  <p align="left">Fenn! Oh, pshaw, Fenn wouldn&rsquo;t snake that paper from
    his pocket&mdash;and yet, when he held his overcoat, when he buttoned it,
    when he pulled him straight and proper, he could have deftly possessed himself
    of that paper&mdash;but why?</p>
  <p align="left">There was the important point.</p>
  <p align="left">Why would Fenn or anybody else want that paper Carlisle had
    scribbled?</p>
  <p align="left">Well, the next thing to do was to get the duplicate paper.
    If of such value to someone else, it was of value to him.</p>
  <p align="left">As Kenneth dressed for the street, his doorbell sounded, and
    then Carter announced two ladies to see him.</p>
  <p align="left">They were Violet and Pauline Carleton!</p>
  <p align="left">To say that Carlisle was surprised would be putting it very
    mildly. He assumed at once that something had happened. Perhaps another murder!</p>
  <p align="left">He went into the living room and found his two visitors idly
    standing about, looking at the pictures and books.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do sit down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How do you do? I&rsquo;m
    greatly honored. Do sit here, Miss Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They were both in a state of nervous embarrassment, but they
    showed it differently.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline was flutteringly beautiful, her little hands clasped
    and unclasped her bag; she took out her handkerchief and put it back again;
    she took out a tiny compact and put it back without using it.</p>
  <p align="left">Then she snapped her bag shut, dropped into a chair, and burst
    into tears.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle was neither alarmed nor dismayed at this show
    of emotion.</p>
  <p align="left">Since there was another woman present, he felt no responsibility
    beyond that of host.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What shall I get her?&rdquo; he said to Miss Violet.  &ldquo;A
    glass of water or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing, said the elder woman grimly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
    stop when she finds it isn&rsquo;t making a hit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Crown salts?&rdquo; pursued Carlisle, his hand hovering
    over the bell.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pauline herself, meeting the situation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    all right, I was just a little&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, we know,&rdquo; Violet said soothingly. &ldquo;Mr.
    Carlisle, my niece and myself are both nervous and distraught. It makes her
    emotional, it makes me calm. We are unlike in temperament, you see. But we
    have common cause. We are here to ask you to drop your investigation of our
    recent tragedy. We urge you, we beseech of you not to carry on your search
    for the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And just why?&rdquo; asked Kenneth, not coldly, but
    in a voice replete with interest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, because&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Violet came to a full stop, leaving her sentence provokingly
    unfinished.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell him why,&rdquo; broke in Pauline,
    who seemed to have quite recovered her poise. &ldquo;No I&rsquo;ll tell him.
    It is because, Mr. Carlisle, we all feel sure that it was Professor Scott
    who shot my husband, and we feel that further mulling over the case can do
    no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But who killed the professor?&rdquo; Kenneth asked in
    his quiet way that always seemed to demand an answer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t want to know.
    Moreover, as the professor had no near relatives, no one who wants to pursue
    the investigation, we want you to desist from your connection with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But, Mrs. Carleton, even if I should do this, the police
    will carry on, and the case will be kept open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh never mind that!&rdquo; Miss Violet broke in.  &ldquo;They
    won&rsquo;t find out anything in a thousand years! It&rsquo;s your activities
    we want to stop. Please promise us to drop the case. We will&mdash;we will
    pay&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;More than if I kept on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes. Much more. Oh, do say you&rsquo;ll consent
    to quit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you two ladies realize that you&rsquo;re putting
    yourselves in a most dangerous, even hazardous, position?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not unless you betray us,&rdquo; said Pauline, with
    one of her enchanting smiles. &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t do that, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you are showing me that there is someone you yourselves
    suspect! Someone you want to shield. You are compounding a felony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; and Pauline shook a rosy
    forefinger at him. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk that highfalutin&rsquo; stuff
    to us and get away with it! Well, supposing&mdash;just make-believe supposing&mdash;that
    there was somebody I wanted to shield, would you then feel more inclined
    to do as we ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should feel inclined,&rdquo; said Kenneth, truthfully
    enough, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. You must know, you must realize
    that a man in my position can&rsquo;t do whatever his inclinations dictate&mdash;he
    must listen to the voice of duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, if there&rsquo;s a word I hate, it&rsquo;s duty!&rdquo; and
    Pauline frowned pettishly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Duty is often hateful,&rdquo; Kenneth agreed, &ldquo;but
    it is there, and it must be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Even if I beg you, Pauline coaxed prettily,  &ldquo;even
    if Miss Violet begs you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Suppose you tell me whom you are shielding or trying
    to shield,&rdquo; Kenneth suggested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s nobody you know,&rdquo; and Pauline smiled
    carelessly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admit we are trying to shield anybody,&rdquo;  said
    Violet sternly. &ldquo;I only ask you to let up on this persecution of quiet,
    peaceful people. You are in and out of our house all the time, digging around
    here and there for clues or evidence. Quizzing the servants, poking about
    the library, we never have a moment to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, come now, Miss Carleton, surely you&rsquo;re exaggerating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, what if I am! I don&rsquo;t want you there at
    all&mdash;as a detective. If you&rsquo;ll drop that horrid business I&rsquo;ll
    always be glad to see you as a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;l thought you were all going away.&rdquo; Kenneth suddenly
    changed the subject.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let us go!&rdquo; cried Pauline. &ldquo;Now,
    see what a horrid man you are! We want to go, but we can&rsquo;t go while
    there is any cloud hanging over our house or our home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Kenneth. &ldquo;You
    Carletons are not under any suspicion. Look here, Mrs. Carleton, you&rsquo;re
    not worried about your brother, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The sudden panic in her eyes told him he had hit on the truth,
    but as her long lashes quickly fell she exclaimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Egbert? Oh, mercy, no! What an idea! He&mdash;he scarcely
    knew Mr. Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not? Your own brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Manning was a little peculiar. He took violent
    likes or dislikes. And&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t care for Egbert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I see. Well, we all have favorites among our friends.
    Now, I don&rsquo;t want to be ugly and hateful and horrid, but I simply can&rsquo;t
    abandon this case as it stands. I have pledged my assistance to some members
    of the police force, not exactly officially, but in a friendly way, which
    is more exacting than a business bargain. I have to carry on, but of course
    I will not come again to your house or in any way intrude upon your home
    life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t enough!&rdquo; Pauline wrung her hands
    and let two big tears roll down her cheeks.</p>
  <p align="left">She couldn&rsquo;t believe that any man could be utterly impervious
    to tears, but she forgot that Carlisle&rsquo;s experiences with the glycerine
    kind made him less susceptible to the genuine article.</p>
  <p align="left">The detective was never impressed by mock sentiment and very
    seldom by the real thing.</p>
  <p align="left">Not that he disbelieved in Pauline&rsquo;s sincerity. She certainly
    was in earnest when she begged him to give up the chase. But her excessive
    emotion, her stifled sobs and picturesque tears, he sized up as definite
    attempts to work on his sympathy&mdash;and, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
  <p align="left">There was more conversation of the same or similar sort, but
    they got nowhere.</p>
  <p align="left">Finally Carlisle told them that unless they were inclined to
    make a clean breast of their fears he could do nothing for them.</p>
  <p align="left">Whereupon they flounced out of his apartment in a state of
    mind which can only be expressed by the term &ldquo;high dudgeon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then Kenneth sat down and thought.</p>
  <p align="left">And his thoughts were of the revelation in Polly&rsquo;s eyes
    when he suggested that she might be shielding her brother.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course she was, whether she had any reason to or not.</p>
  <p align="left">For it didn&rsquo;t seem to Carlisle that the lackadaisical
    Egbert could have engineered such a clever and complicated murder as Manning
    Carleton&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet, after all, was it clever or complicated if there was a
    friend at court?</p>
  <p align="left">If Polly had left doors unlocked or had given Egbert keys and
    had acted as spy and watchman, mightn&rsquo;t the pliable young man have
    been an ideal tool?</p>
  <p align="left">He adored his sister and would obey her lightest word. He craved
    money and mayhap had already drained his indulgent benefactor dry. It could
    be plainly seen that Pauline worshipped him, loving him far better than she
    had her husband.</p>
  <p align="left">Just how Miss Violet came into this Kenneth couldn&rsquo;t
    quite see. It must be that she was fonder of her sister-in-law than he had
    thought. For surely Miss Violet couldn&rsquo;t have any great interest in
    Egbert save that he was Polly&rsquo;s brother.</p>
  <p align="left">He thought over the Egbert person.</p>
  <p align="left">He remembered his eyes. They could be called what Joe described
    as &ldquo;mudderer&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps they were.</p>
  <p align="left">He rose suddenly and made for the telephone stand.</p>
  <p align="left">He riffled the pages of the Manhattan book until he found his
    quarry.</p>
  <p align="left">Yes, there it was. Egbert Warren, and an address far over on
    the West Side. Surely, where else would one expect to find him?</p>
  <p align="left">Then he called up the number of the apartment house where Professor
    Scott had lived and went into conference with the manager.</p>
  <p align="left">The result of this was that a blissfully happy colored boy
    scurried down to the home of the donor of a certain chicken  &ldquo;dinnah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">On arrival Joe was ushered to the kitchen and pleasantly fed,
    then taken into the presence of the private investigator.</p>
  <p align="left">And it seemed he was wanted to do a little private investigating.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; Kenneth began, &ldquo;you remember the chap
    who brought the White Rock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do, sah,&rdquo; but he wondered if the man before
    him had gone a bit nutty on that White Rock question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you seen him since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nossah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would you know him if you did see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yessah, shuah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. Here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re to go. Just
    get in this locality, do you see? and stick there until you see a man go
    in or out that seems to you to be that same man. The White Rock man. But
    on no account let him spot you. He&rsquo;d remember your taking him up in
    the elevator, perhaps. And I may be mistaken. He may not live here after
    all. Anyhow, will you go and watch? All day, if necessary, but make sure.
    Don&rsquo;t make yourself conspicuous, keep out of sight, yet don&rsquo;t
    appear to do so. Go round the block or up and down the street. If a policeman
    bothers you, tell him you&rsquo;re working for me. But don&rsquo;t let the
    man we&rsquo;re after get onto you. Can you do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You betcha, boss. I kin do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, go to it. And as soon as you see him, at a window
    or going in or out, make sure there&rsquo;s no mistake, and then come back
    here to&mdash;a chicken dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lawzee! Hones&rsquo;, Mistah Callile? well, I&rsquo;ll
    be jiggahed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On your way, then. Mind now, I&rsquo;m trusting you
    to make a good job of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An&rsquo; yo&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t put a bettah man
    on de job, sah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With a bob of his kinky head he was gone.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle gave orders to have a savory chicken fricassee on
    tap all day and told Carter to hold the boy if he returned before he himself
    did.</p>
  <p align="left">Then he went out and went straight to the inspector&rsquo;s
    office.</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert looked harassed but spoke alertly enough.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, the net is closing in, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Around whom?&rdquo; asked Kenneth, a bit startled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mortlake, of course. Open-and-shut case now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Lord, and I was just beginning to like him. But,
    say, what about Fenn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fenn! Nobody suspects him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mortlake does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Another nail in Mortlake&rsquo;s coffin, then. I suppose
    he&rsquo;d catch at a straw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t, suspected of murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, anyhow, we find Mortlake is in it up to his neck.
    He rowed with Carleton and even threatened to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A reliable witness. And, too, Mortlake was deeply interested
    in those projects of Scott&rsquo;s, and he knew they never could be perfected
    without a lot of money. And he knew that the death of Carleton would mean
    a lot of money for Scott right away. So there you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And Mortlake had all the opportunity in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just right he did! Why, he could leave
    that door into his house unbolted on the Carleton side when he went home
    that night. Then, when he got ready, he could unlock his side and come through,
    kill his man, lock up properly, and go out through the Carleton kitchens
    into his own house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just how did he lock the library door after him? I mean
    the door he went out of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, how did anybody do that? It was done, wasn&rsquo;t
    it? Or else the murderer stayed in and busted out when the crowd entered.
    But, you see, Mortlake had exceptional facilities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose he did. Then, later, he killed Scott?
    How come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. He wouldn&rsquo;t kill
    the goose that was going to lay the golden eggs unless somehow Scott had
    the goods on him and threatened to peach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit hazy, to my mind. I&rsquo;m not a Mortlake
    fancier. I mean I don&rsquo;t fancy Mortlake as a murderer. I like him better
    as a detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lost your mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not more&rsquo;n usual. Here&rsquo;s another thing.
    Miss Carleton and Mrs. Carleton have been to see me, to ask me to drop the
    case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, then they can&rsquo;t suspect Mortlake, they&rsquo;d
    have no reason to shield him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, of course not. I say, wait a minute, I want to telephone
    up home. You go on with your work. Give me five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, there&rsquo;s a booth, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle went to the booth and shut the door and soon got his
    own number.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That you, Carter? Has my young guest returned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carter was used to blind talk on the telephone and replied:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, he arrived a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Put him on the wire, will you?&mdash;but first warn
    him to say mostly yes and no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This you, Sambo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you see the exhibit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle decided that Joe was a chap after his own heart and
    ventured a bit deeper.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you ever seen that specimen before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Behind the Rock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de ve&rsquo;y place, sah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure, Sambo? Positive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah,&rdquo; and there was as much assurance in that
    last word as Kenneth had ever received from an affidavit.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Sambo. Go to the powers that be and claim
    your barbecue. Then ask Mr. Carter, and he will give you your honorarium.
    Are you on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then get off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yessah, thank you, sah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Laughing, Kenneth returned to the inspector.</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_17">Chapter 17</a><br>They Don&rsquo;t Like Egbert Warren</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;WHAT&rsquo;S the joke?&rdquo; asked Gilbert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    like a good laugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Serious matters first,&rdquo; Kenneth said. &ldquo;What
    do you know about Egbert Warren?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind, Oscar, you will. Well, he&rsquo;s the unbeautiful
    brother of the beautiful Pauline.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes. I&rsquo;ve heard she had a brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, so did the blind beggar. But that brother died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too funny. I don&rsquo;t want to laugh
    all the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. This Egbert Warren, to make a long story
    short, went to Scott&rsquo;s apartment in the guise of a delivery boy the
    day the professor was shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did the Warren shoot him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To my thinking, yes. Now, I have business out of town.
    Can you take care of Warren?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, certainly. You&rsquo;re telling us where to find
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course. Here&rsquo;s his street address and his telephone
    number. But watch your step, he&rsquo;s a shy bird to lay hands on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What are you talking about, anyway? Spill it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then Kenneth Carlisle told the inspector all he knew about
    Egbert as Pauline&rsquo;s brother, about Egbert as pseudo delivery boy, about
    Egbert as a resident of the given address, and declared that to be the extent
    of his data concerning Egbert.</p>
  <p align="left">The two men talked it over and concluded an interview with
    Egbert was desirable.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You take it in charge, will you?&rdquo; Kenneth asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got to go out of town, and I won&rsquo;t be back till evening. I&rsquo;ll
    see you first thing in the morning. Oh, and see here. Will you do an errand
    at the Carleton house for me? I&rsquo;m <em>persona non grata</em> there just now,
    and I can&rsquo;t cut up this trick. It&rsquo;s only to go into the library
    alone and get a paper you will find tucked into a French dictionary on the
    third shelf from the top, near the door that goes into the other house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Keep it dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Better so. But if you can&rsquo;t get in there alone,
    say you must hunt up a French word, nonchalantly take down the dictionary,
    palm the paper, and let your quick wit take care of the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Consider it done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t arrest Mortlake before I see you again.
    If all goes as I hope, things will be popping to-morrow, and the end will
    be in sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Leave Fenn lay, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Leave everybody lay. Believe me, Inspector, this is
    no idle boast! I had a streak of good luck, and I&rsquo;m playing it for
    all it&rsquo;s worth. Now, you hang on to Warren. But don&rsquo;t arrest
    him. Interview him as if you wanted his help or advice. He&rsquo;s Mrs. Carleton&rsquo;s
    brother, you see, and you can trump up a yarn that will flatter him and keep
    him safe in the fold. How late will you be here tonight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Till you come, if you&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope to hit New York at eleven o&rsquo;clock. If so,
    I&rsquo;ll telephone you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be here at eleven. You come right along,
    and if you can&rsquo;t make it, I&rsquo;ll wait till eleven-thirty and then
    give you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;m pretty sure to be here. Get the
    paper from the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will. So long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle left the building and hurried a taxicab to the railroad
    station in time to take the one o&rsquo;clock train.</p>
  <p align="left">Inspector Gilbert finished up his desk business, called his
    trusty man Stokes, and the two set out for the Warren inquiry.</p>
  <p align="left">They didn&rsquo;t telephone, lest they should frighten their
    quarry away.</p>
  <p align="left">Egbert Warren was at home, and though his face blanched when
    he opened the door to his visitors, he soon recovered his poise and invited
    them in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said politely, offering chairs.  &ldquo;Now,
    what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert was a little taken aback, for he had expected a frightened
    bunny of a man.</p>
  <p align="left">But he had much yet to learn about Egbert Warren.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We are hoping,&rdquo; the inspector began, &ldquo;that
    you can be of some help to us in our investigation of the shooting of Professor
    Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">If this roused any guilty feeling in his hearer&rsquo;s mind,
    there was no sign of it on his face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said, with an air of general interest,  &ldquo;and
    how can I help?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We have been told,&rdquo; Gilbert went on, &ldquo;that
    you were in the building, indeed, on the professor&rsquo;s floor, at the
    time of the shooting. So we&rsquo;re wondering if you heard the noise of
    the shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;You
    say it happened while I was there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We have reason to think so. Just what was your errand
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Warren hesitated an instant and then said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will tell you. I am not in robust health, but the
    doctor says I need outdoor exercise. So, for a few hours a day, I deliver
    groceries for dealers. This gives me the exercise I need and, incidentally,
    adds to my income, which is not large.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He glanced round the poorly furnished room and shrugged his
    shoulders.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what you were doing for Professor Scott?
    Taking him his groceries?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What was the order that day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let me see. I know there was a half dozen of White Rock,
    because it was heavier than I thought it would be. Also some cheese and crackers
    or bread. I forget exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s near enough. Now, when you went in
    to leave the things, where was the professor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In his living room. He opened the door for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you went in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Went right through to the kitchen. Left the stuff on
    the table and went back the same way and out the front door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is there no rear entrance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, there is. But I&rsquo;m not an ordinary delivery
    boy, and I use front doors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Always?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Except where they forbid it; then I have to go to the
    back. I don&rsquo;t really mind, I&rsquo;m a philosopher, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Incidentally, you&rsquo;re the brother of the wealthy
    Mrs. Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I have that honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she make you sufficient allowance so that
    you needn&rsquo;t work so hard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Warren looked at him steadily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I told you I wanted the exercise. I told you I wanted
    the extra cash. The matter of my allowance is in no way your business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Warren. Now I&rsquo;ll come to what
    is my business. Do you know Jack Mortlake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Is he the man who lives next door to my sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I do know him slightly. I have met him once or
    twice at the Carleton house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You visit there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by visit. I am there
    now and then to luncheon or dinner, or perhaps to tea with my sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The inspector marveled at the man&rsquo;s lightning changes
    of manner. Now he would be a man of blunt, almost uncouth ways, and suddenly
    he would drop into the air and tone of a member of society.</p>
  <p align="left">Gilbert could only think he was a gentleman who had come down
    in the world but occasionally lapsed back into his former atmosphere of culture.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you know Mortlake only slightly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Scarcely that. I&rsquo;ve met him perhaps three times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You knew Professor Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">One of the lightning changes passed over Warren&rsquo;s face
    at this question. He paled, and then a sudden air of bravado seemed to permeate
    his whole being.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am proud to say I did. Though to him only a delivery
    boy, he was kind and gracious to me and sometimes let me have a peep into
    his laboratory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you saw his queer inventions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As a whole, yes. He never showed me one or explained
    any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you shoot a gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I? Oh, no, they make me nervous, I hate noise!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you shoot an air gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is an air gun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Warren, you&rsquo;re overdoing it. You&rsquo;re a good
    actor, but &lsquo;What is an air gun?&rsquo; is &rsquo;most too much! I&rsquo;ll
    put it to you straight. We accuse you of being the one who shot Professor
    Scott with one of his own air guns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you do? Well, you&rsquo;re all wet! I&rsquo;ve never
    shot a gun in my life, air gun or any other kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t? And what are you going to do about
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to arrest you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me laugh. You haven&rsquo;t a shred
    of evidence, and you know it. Also, what is your suggestion as to motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Robbery. There was money taken from the professor&rsquo;s
    bureau.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No? Well, we think you did. And, here&rsquo;s another
    thing. What did you do with the skeleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This shot told.</p>
  <p align="left">Egbert Warren, with another of his quick changes, became like
    a paralyzed man.</p>
  <p align="left">His clenched hands, on either knee, were a pasty white, and
    his drawn face was pallid to the very lips, which trembled in a vain endeavor
    to speak.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;W-what skel-skeleton? I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The skeleton you took by fraud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But the redoubtable Warren had come into his own once again.</p>
  <p align="left">He rose, entirely his own man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You will go away now,&rdquo; he said, with the air of
    a courtier dismissing his lackeys. &ldquo;I know nothing of any skeleton.
    I lost my nerve when you said the word, because a skeleton is the one thing
    I am afraid of. Foolish, I know, but some people are afraid of a cat or a
    snake. Mine is a skeleton. The mere word gives me a cold chill. Go now, and
    don&rsquo;t come again without more right or reason than you had this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They went, for, in a way, Warren was right. They had no real
    accusation but they intended to find one!</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He knows something about the skeleton,&rdquo; said Stokes,
    as they walked along.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. And he&rsquo;s a suspect of Carlisle&rsquo;s. So
    we must keep him covered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish we could trace that skeleton. I believe it would
    be a help. And there&rsquo;s another thing. That fellow is somehow mixed
    up with the Carleton murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the brother of Mrs. Carleton&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. He&rsquo;s mixed up in my mind
    with it in some queer way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As a rule, Stokes, I like your queer hunches, but you&rsquo;ll
    have to be a bit more definite, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s just a glimmer, a haunting
    memory&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well, wait till it comes out in the open. Now, look
    here, you go down there and get those papers Carlisle wants, won&rsquo;t
    you? I&rsquo;ve a lot to do this afternoon, and you can attend to it as well
    as I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just how&rsquo;ll I work it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go in with a businesslike air, if you can compass such,
    and say that you have to get into the library to take some measurements.
    Then measure a wall space or floor space, or any space you see. Then, if
    you can&rsquo;t manage any other way, and there are eagle eyes upon you,
    take down several books, including the French dictionary&mdash;you heard
    where it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, take down that and two or three next it. Then,
    as you return them to the shelves, manage to extract the paper and stuff
    it in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Guess I can manage that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. Here&rsquo;s another errand for you. After
    you&rsquo;ve fixed up the paper business, go and get Sam Mullins&mdash;here&rsquo;s
    his address&mdash;and take him with you around to Mortlake&rsquo;s, next
    door to Carleton&rsquo;s, you know. Come from the other end of the block,
    don&rsquo;t pass the Carleton house. Mullins is to make a key for that communicating
    door. He can do it without opening the door. Tell him it must be ready for
    us by six or seven o&rsquo;clock to-night. He&rsquo;ll do it, if you make
    it imperative enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will Mortlake raise any objections?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, but go ahead, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Carlisle gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He said something about a sick uncle
    in Buffalo, but I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s it. I think he&rsquo;s
    on the trail of something connected with the Carleton matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. No further remarks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. So long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes went off well pleased with his orders. The chief was
    giving him more and more important errands, and he was duly grateful.</p>
  <p align="left">He went into the Carleton house, wearing his best superiority
    complex, and Fenn received him obsequiously.</p>
  <p align="left">A few brief words brought about his admission to the library,
    and he produced a folding yardstick and a notebook.</p>
  <p align="left">Meticulously he measured the shelf that held the French dictionary,
    quite awake to the fact that Fenn was closely watching the performance. Nor
    was Fenn the only watcher.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude Carleton had come into the library and stood looking
    on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-morning, Sergeant,&rdquo; he said civilly.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve orders to measure the shelves in this section,
    sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I assume it&rsquo;s in connection
    with the search for a secret entrance to this room. Most interesting work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it? I suppose you&rsquo;re one of those detective
    story hounds&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to be. Get all I want of it in the
    day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t often get a sealed-room mystery like
    this, I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, no. That we don&rsquo;t. Now, if I can prove there
    is a shorter shelf somewhere&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes gazed at the shelves in deep contemplation.</p>
  <p align="left">Then he took down a handful of books and peered at the space
    behind where they were. He laid them on the table and took down a few more.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not going to take all the books off the shelves, are
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, no, sir. But I want to&#8212;Well, there&rsquo;s
    certainly no discrepancy here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes picked up the books from the table to restore them to
    the shelf. Picked up too many and dropped with a bang one of the most ornately
    bound volumes.</p>
  <p align="left">With an exclamation of dismay Claude stooped to pick up the
    book and Stokes took the occasion to secure the paper from the dictionary
    and put it among the leaves of his notebook.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude upbraided him for his clumsiness, but the sergeant took
    it calmly, remarking that the book wasn&rsquo;t really harmed.</p>
  <p align="left">He studied the shelf closely, whistled to himself a little,
    and then, snapping an elastic band round his notebook, he prepared to depart.</p>
  <p align="left">Claude stopped him with an upraised finger.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;why the camouflage?
    What were you after? Did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes was angry, not at the question, but at himself for not
    doing better acting.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I always get what I go for,&rdquo; he answered shortly. &ldquo;I
    was after measurements. You saw me get them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Measurements my eye! You were on a still hunt for something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always on a still hunt for something. That&rsquo;s
    my business. And a hard life it is. At first, you know, I went on a still
    hunt for you. Didn&rsquo;t I trail you to Harrisburg and back, only to find
    you had done exactly what you said you did and went just where you said you
    went?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That was a wild-goose chase, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite that. It proved your alibi. By the way, will
    you answer one question regarding it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure. Fire away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who was the man you met in the lobby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What lobby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The hotel lobby. At the Aylesford, where you had breakfast
    in Harrisburg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes. That was Jim Patton. I hadn&rsquo;t seen him
    for years, but I couldn&rsquo;t talk to him then. The inspector said I chatted
    with him, but that was exaggeration. I felt little like chatting just then,
    I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course. And Mr. Patton. Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he lives now. He used to live
    in New York, then he went West, and I lost track of him. Under different
    circumstances I&rsquo;d have been glad to talk with him. Why this sudden
    interest in him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Carleton, it&rsquo;s this way! If we don&rsquo;t
    get a steer in the right direction very soon we&rsquo;re going to shelve
    the Carleton case. Especially as you have expressed a desire that we should.
    But, if so, I want my part of the work cleared up. I had charge of that check-up
    on your alibi, and it was so unimpeachable that I wanted to find out the
    one name missing. Patton, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you want his verification, I daresay I can get his
    address for you. But it might take some time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will be necessary. Since you
    didn&rsquo;t talk with him, he couldn&rsquo;t be anything of a witness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, surely not. Well, come in when you feel like measuring
    shelves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The twinkle in Claude&rsquo;s eye was not a merry one, but
    it gave no reason for offence, and Stokes went away, satisfied that though
    Claude might suspect a secret errand he did not know what it was.</p>
  <p align="left">The sergeant went round several blocks before he approached
    the Mortlake house from the other direction.</p>
  <p align="left">He found the Mortlakes ready to receive him and the locksmith
    already there.</p>
  <p align="left">It was easy to inform the Mortlakes that steps were being taken
    to solve the mystery of the bolted door, and the first step, naturally, was
    to get the door open.</p>
  <p align="left">The entire Carleton household had denied all knowledge of a
    key, and the Mortlakes likewise.</p>
  <p align="left">The skilled craftsman, Mullins, undertook to make a key, not
    only without opening the door, but without making any sound at his work.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course, there was the heavy tapestry on the Carleton side,
    which was helpful in deadening the sound, but the work was so cleverly done
    that it seemed to the eager watchers like magic.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t made a key to this door for anyone
    else lately, have you?&rdquo; Mortlake asked the locksmith.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No I hain&rsquo;t. How could I git in to do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Could you make a key from a wax impression of the keyhole?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not fer this here lock. It&rsquo;s too deep in. There
    now. There&rsquo;s yer key. Shall I turn it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will it make any noise?&rdquo; asked Stokes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A leetle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you sure it will turn all right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, it sure will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t try it. I&rsquo;ll take the key to
    the inspector, and he&rsquo;ll do the rest. Mind you don&rsquo;t mention
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not me. I wasn&rsquo;t born yestiddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The ingenious mechanician departed, and Stokes sat a moment
    talking with the Mortlakes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do tell us, has something turned up?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
    Mortlake.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not that I know of. In fact, I&rsquo;m told the affair
    is to be turned down,&rdquo; Stokes informed her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then why this fuss about the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dying gasp, I suppose. But what will it prove if they
    do get the door open? You don&rsquo;t think the murderer came through this
    house, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack Mortlake, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
    they&rsquo;ll think the murderer came <em>from</em> this house. They&rsquo;ve had
    it in for me from the start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But their sending Mullins here on that key business
    is pretty good proof you&rsquo;re not a suspect,&rdquo; Stokes said decidedly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell by that,&rdquo; Mortlake gloomed. &ldquo;And
    I&rsquo;m not taking much stock in what you say, either. No offence meant,
    but you&rsquo;re of the police, and you have to stand by them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course, and you&rsquo;re a citizen and have to take
    what&rsquo;s handed you. But could anybody get into this house and not waken
    you at night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed they could,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Mortlake.  &ldquo;We
    sleep in the back rooms, we have our doors closed, and we both sleep very
    soundly. We feel safe because we&rsquo;re really well locked up, but now
    that I&rsquo;ve seen how expert locksmiths do things I don&rsquo;t take much
    stock in ordinary keys and bolts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And anyhow,&rdquo; Mortlake declared, &ldquo;key or
    no key, the bolts on that door between the houses would baffle even Mullins.
    A lock is easy, if you have a key. But a bolt is another story.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><strong><a name="Chapter_18">Chapter 18</a><br>Kenneth Carlisle Explains in Full</strong></h2>
  <p align="left">KENNETH CARLISLE returned to New York City at eleven o&rsquo;clock
    that evening as he had hoped to do.</p>
  <p align="left">From the railroad station he went directly to the inspector&rsquo;s
    office.</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes was there, and he handed Kenneth the key made by Mullins
    with the ceremonial air of one bestowing the freedom of the city.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good work,&rdquo; was Carlisle&rsquo;s comment as he
    slipped the key in his pocket. &ldquo;Now, did you get the paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; and Stokes proudly produced the paper
    he had retrieved from the French dictionary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you compare inks, Stokes?&rdquo; Kenneth asked,
    knowing the sergeant had ability in some unexpected lines.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, if not too nearly alike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. Take the sheet and see if the dates are all
    written with the same ink. Look sharp, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All over but the finish,&rdquo; Carlisle said, turning
    to Gilbert. &ldquo;But my story will keep. Tell me about Egbert, the brother,&rdquo; and
    he listened to Gilbert&rsquo;s report.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fine! Splendid! We&rsquo;re in deep, but we&rsquo;re
    riding on the crest of the wave. Give me the telephone, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Late as it was, he called the number of Egbert Warren&rsquo;s
    rooms.</p>
  <p align="left">A sleepy voice responded at last, and Carlisle said, in a disguised,
    scarcely audible tone, &ldquo;Egbert? Hush. Don&rsquo;t speak. Come out at
    once and meet me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who are you? Is this you, Claude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush! Use no names. Are you in bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course; let me alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Danger. Keep still. Dress and come quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The usual place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course. Hurry. How long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Say twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a minute longer, then. Come right along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth put the instrument back in its cradle and looked at
    his watch.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We must be at Brother Egbert&rsquo;s in twenty minutes,
    but not sooner. We&rsquo;ve a bit of burgling to do. But we&rsquo;ve a few
    moments before we start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle utilized the few moments in giving the inspector a
    brief and sketchy account of his afternoon trip.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And so you see,&rdquo; he wound up, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    no time to lose. We must rush everything. Come on, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They hurried out, caught a taxi, and alighted a block away
    from Warren&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p align="left">The house was dark, and after a moment&rsquo;s reconnoitring
    they rang the bell.</p>
  <p align="left">A head poked itself out of an upper window and was bidden to
    appear downstairs in haste.</p>
  <p align="left">Objections were overruled, and the head next appeared in the
    doorway.</p>
  <p align="left">Brief explanations made it possible for the two visitors to
    go quietly upstairs and into Warren&rsquo;s rooms, opened with a pass key
    by the frightened cicerone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stay in the hall,&rdquo; ordered Carlisle. &ldquo;We
    won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They weren&rsquo;t. Kenneth rummaged only in the desk and bureau,
    and when he had collected two checks for luggage left in the check room of
    a railway station and a fountain pen which was carefully hidden beneath a
    pile of underclothing, he announced himself ready to go.</p>
  <p align="left">He had looked into several boxes and cupboards, but he took
    nothing else away with him.</p>
  <p align="left">Enjoining the scared caretaker not to tell of their visit,
    they left as silently as they had come.</p>
  <p align="left">Then the two parted company until the next morning, but Kenneth
    had yet one more errand to attend to.</p>
  <p align="left">He went over toward the Carleton house and strolled about until
    he found the policeman on the beat.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Garvin?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and the officer saluted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One question. You remember New Year&rsquo;s Eve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How late were you around here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Till after the inspector and the medical examiner and
    all that bunch arrived. Then I was excused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Now cast your memory back to the hours before
    you heard the alarm or saw any commotion around the Carleton house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you&mdash;think carefully now&mdash;did you see
    anybody go in or out of the Carleton house or the house next to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The Carleton house, no, sir; the house next to it, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who was it, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t recognize him, sir. It was a man, a gentleman,
    in a dark overcoat and a black soft hat, with a widish brim. That&rsquo;s
    all I noticed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About what time was this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;&rsquo;Long about quarter or, say, twenty minutes to
    four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know so surely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my business to know. But there was nothing
    unusual or suspicious about him, sir. A quiet-behaving gentleman. I&rsquo;d
    no reason to notice him at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, of course not. Yet I think he was the murderer of
    Manning Carleton.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The saints preserve us! What was he doing in the Mortlake
    house, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he didn&rsquo;t come out of the Carleton
    house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure and certain. I thought he was a New Year&rsquo;s
    guest like, going home, and as he was sober and proper acting, I didn&rsquo;t
    pay any more attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t describe him any more fully? Was he
    tall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Average or a bit more. Mejum build. No cane or stick,
    as I noticed, nothing out of the ordinary to make me give him a second look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re sure he came out of the Mortlake house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Positive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Mortlake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, I know him. It wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Mortlake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Garvin. Remember it all, just as you&rsquo;ve
    told it to me. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then Kenneth Carlisle called it a day and gladly sought
    his own pleasant home and the comforting administrations of Carter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">It was the next day, and it was eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle had had a busy morning already, but he showed
    no trace of it as he walked calmly into the Carleton house and found a number
    of people gathered in the library.</p>
  <p align="left">They were all there on the urgent invitation of the police,
    and as their hearts were filled with varying emotions, so their faces showed
    varied expressions.</p>
  <p align="left">There were several outsiders, besides the inmates of the Carleton
    household.</p>
  <p align="left">Of these, a casual observer could have stated that the most
    miserable one was Egbert Warren and the most ecstatically pleased one was
    Mister Joe Hopper.</p>
  <p align="left">Joe was all unaccustomed to these halls of the rich and great,
    but he was undaunted by their splendor and deeply interested in the place
    and the proceedings.</p>
  <p align="left">Warren, on the contrary, seemed possessed of but one idea,
    that of escape. He looked furtively about with glances that seemed to implore
    the walls to open and let him through and reclose immediately.</p>
  <p align="left">No such miracle happened, however, and if it had, there were
    stalwart policemen who would have thwarted the design.</p>
  <p align="left">Pauline, chalky white save where spots of rouge glowed, sat
    between Claude and Violet, all three seeming to be in a state of blank bewilderment
    and wonder.</p>
  <p align="left">The Mortlakes, though quiet and composed, were quite evidently
    unhappy, and indeed, nobody present looked really cheerful except Joe.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth Carlisle, without introduction or preamble, took charge
    of the assembly and addressed them in his cultured, well trained voice. He
    had left Hollywood just before the wave of talkies swept the land, and so
    still had his natural and pleasing tones.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am a detective,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as such
    I am entitled to your attention to my report on the Carleton case. I have
    been asked to resign from the matter and to sever all connection with the
    investigation of the tragedy. This I agree to do after the present conference
    is concluded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As a detective, I am supposed to base my deductions
    on evidence, clues and the statements of reliable witnesses. This I have
    done to the best of my ability. But there is one method, usually adopted
    by detectives, that I have not yet tried. So I propose to do so now, in your
    presence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I refer to the use of the lens. As you doubtless know,
    the great detectives of fiction are represented as being really dependent
    on the magnifying glass. So, having provided myself with a new one, I shall
    now, for the first time, put it to use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">From his pocket Carlisle brought out a medium-sized glass with
    a narrow silver rim and laid it on the table.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As you all know,&rdquo; he went on, and as he proceeded
    his voice took on a graver tone, one less like a lecturer and more like an
    accusing judge, &ldquo;Mr. Carleton was killed in this room. When his dead
    body was found here, it was necessary to break in, as all entrances were
    locked. This made the crime what is spoken of as a murder in a hermetically
    sealed room. The phrase &lsquo;hermetically sealed&rsquo; is, of course,
    figurative, for it means airtight, which no normal room is. However, we know
    that every egress or ingress of this room was locked or bolted or both.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The first task, then, was to find out how the murderer
    got out of the room. As to getting in, it was perfectly possible that Mr.
    Carleton himself admitted the criminal. But he could not let him out, and
    that problem had to be solved. We shall now try to solve it by means of our
    lens. Or, rather, prove our solution by the lens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At this point Carlisle nodded to Stokes, who stood by the door
    into the other house, and that functionary slowly drew back the tapestry
    that covered the communicating door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As there is no one here unfamiliar with all points of
    the investigation,&rdquo; Carlisle resumed, &ldquo;it is unnecessary to do
    more than indicate our procedure. In thinking it over, it seemed to me that
    the murderer must have come in through that door. To do so, he must have
    had a key. To get a key made would be a difficult but not impossible task.
    Granting the key, then, he still had the bolts to negotiate, a much harder
    problem. But let us use our lens. First, we unlock the door with the key.&rdquo; Coolly
    taking a key from his pocket, Carlisle unlocked the door. He then drew the
    bolt, and the door easily swung open into the library. Down on his knees
    went Kenneth Carlisle, and peering through the lens at the thick soft pile
    of the carpet he nodded and murmured, &ldquo;Just as I thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was not a rug, but a velvet carpet that went to the very
    door itself. And on the other side the Mortlakes&rsquo; carpet also came
    to the sill.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will ask Inspector Gilbert to look through the glass,
    and also Sergeant Stokes. No one else at present. What these men see is two
    parallel impressions in the nap of the carpet perhaps a quarter of an inch
    apart. That is all. One impression is a little deeper and more distinct than
    the other. I have not seen these before, myself, but I knew they must be
    there. Left by the murderer after he went.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, as you have seen, it was easy enough for the murderer
    to lock the door after him, but what about the bolts? They were attended
    to by a clever dodge. Not entirely original, as it has been told of in crime
    stories, both true and fictitious. I will show you how it was done. First,
    we will use our lens once more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Leaning over the bolt of the door on the library side, having
    pushed the door nearly shut for the purpose, Carlisle gave his satisfied
    nod again and handed the glass to the inspector.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you see right there?&rdquo; he asked, as Gilbert
    leaned over to look at the bolt.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see a small bit of red fluff&mdash;silky-looking fluff,&rdquo; was
    the reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Carlisle said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just
    what it is. It came from a piece cut off this ball.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Opening one of the desk drawers he brought out a ball of red
    silk cord, a pretty material, used for tying up Christmas gifts.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A strong cord, you see,&rdquo; Carlisle proceeded,  &ldquo;but
    a fine one. Not like fishline, hard and firm, but pliable, yet very strong.
    A piece of this cord was used, as I shall show you by experiment. Remember,
    however, I have not before tampered with this bolt. The fluff there now,
    is the fluff left by the murderer. Perhaps you&rsquo;d better take it, Stokes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The sergeant did so, and Kenneth went on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What I am about to show you is not difficult, but it
    must be done carefully. I take a longish piece of cord and double it in the
    middle, looping it over the knob of the bolt itself. Then the double string
    is carried along the bolt and hangs loosely to the floor. The bolt is large
    and loose, not a tight-fitting shaft. Now, one may tuck both ends of string
    beneath the door, go through himself, and, holding the strings carefully,
    pull the door shut. Then&#8212;but we&rsquo;ll try it. Joe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The colored boy, not grinning, but solemn-faced with the gravity
    of the occasion, came forward.</p>
  <p align="left">At Kenneth&rsquo;s command he stepped through the door, gathered
    the ends of string carefully, and slowly closed the door after him. Then
    the watchers could see the cord drawn slowly taut, then a harder pull brought
    the bolt sliding along into place, and the cord hung from the handle of the
    bolt and disappeared under the door.</p>
  <p align="left">Then one side of the cord was slowly pulled on and was eventually
    pulled all the way through, dragging after it the other side of the cord
    until all had disappeared.</p>
  <p align="left">The deed was done. The door was bolted on the library side,
    but the bolting had been done from the Mortlake side.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth reopened the door, Joe slid quietly back to his seat,
    and winding up the cord, Kenneth laid it on the desk.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The mystery of the sealed room is now explained,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;It remains to learn who did this thing. There can be no doubt
    that the door was shut and bolted in the way I have shown, for the red silk
    fluff is proof positive, and the tiny parallel grooves in the thick carpet
    show where the cord was dragged through. Those we saw before my experiment
    began.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But as to the identity of the murderer, I wish to say
    one thing before I begin to talk on that subject. Please do not jump at conclusions.
    I have no desire to make this report unnecessarily long, but there are some
    problems that must be stated in their entirety and their solutions in proper
    sequence. I will ask you to believe that Mr. Carleton was not murdered by
    his son, or by his sister, or by his wife. He was not killed by any guest
    visiting in his home or by any guest invited here for the New Year&rsquo;s
    Eve celebration. He was not killed by any servant in his employ. Nor by any
    relative of his wife or his wife&rsquo;s family.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Further than that I will not at this moment declare.
    Now, as to the weapon. This is a strange and very interesting puzzle. When
    I noticed a peculiar mark on the cover of one of the telephone books, I felt
    certain it was in some way connected with the weapon of death. It was. The
    weapon was a clever and strange one. It was nothing more or less, in appearance,
    at least, than a fountain pen. This instrument had been made by a diabolical
    genius and is one of the deadliest short-range weapons ever devised. I will
    show it to you.</p>
  <p align="left">He took from his pocket and laid on the desk what seemed to
    be an ordinary fountain pen, albeit a large one. Yet only a trifle larger
    than many now in common use.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is fired by an air cap, and its bullet has tremendous
    power and force. Indeed, so dangerous is its back kick that the cautious
    murderer used this telephone book as a buffer to save his own skin.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, having shot Mr. Carleton, he had the coolness
    and nerve to lay the pen on the pen rack of the desk and leave it there.
    I stared at it with unseeing eyes, little dreaming I had the weapon of death
    before me. It was a similar case to <em>The Purloined Letter</em>, where the object
    sought for was in plain view all the time! But after a day or two the murderer
    realized this danger and exchanged the gun pen for one of the usual sort.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That, then, explains the method of exit from the locked
    room, and the weapon used.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Before going on, I will pause to state that the diabolical
    mind of the criminal had another scheme at first. He tried, by sending a
    frightening gift to Mr. Carleton, to throw the poor man into a state of nervousness
    that would affect his weak heart and cause sudden death. Had that plan succeeded,
    this other wickedness would not have been carried out.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Mr. Carleton, though shaken by the ghastly surprise,
    did not collapse, and the plan of the more violent death was carried out.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now we come to the identity of the murderer. As you
    may remember, Mr. Claude Carleton left the party before it broke up, to go
    to Hollywood. He took the two o&rsquo;clock train, for which he had his tickets
    and reservations previously bought. Now, as a matter of fact, Mr. Claude
    Carleton did not go on his trip that night. I do not say what he did, but
    he did not go to Harrisburg, as was thought. What he did do was to take the
    train in the Pennsylvania Station and leave it at Market Street Station,
    Newark, N. J., at 2:53. Here he exchanged identities with a friend who was
    waiting for him. This other man looked enough like Claude to put it over.
    Claude handed him his tickets, suitcase, changed hats with him, and attended
    to all necessary details of the changed identity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This pseudo Claude Carleton went on to Harrisburg, received
    the telegram sent to Claude, went to the Aylesbury House, took the train
    back for New York, and this time changed with Claude Carleton once more at
    Philadelphia. They again exchanged tickets, the impersonator gave Claude
    the telegram and a memorandum of the details of the trip. I will state right
    here that the item about meeting an old friend in the hotel lobby was a fabrication
    of my own. It was a trap, and Mr. Claude fell into it, even telling me the
    name of the imaginary friend.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;However, it was Claude himself who came home from Philadelphia
    in his own likeness, and came here to his home, where he has been ever since.
    This exchange of identities was not a difficult matter at all. Claude took
    his place in the Pullman compartment reserved for him in the night train,
    and the colored porter made his acquaintance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A discreet demeanor and generous <em>pourboire</em> will make
    a Pullman porter think as he is desired to think. Then when the false Claude
    came along, it was late at night; bedtime, the aftermath of a gay holiday,
    and all tended to help along the scheme. Coming home next day from Philadelphia,
    the real Claude had a chair in the parlor car. Of this he kept the number
    stub, a detail that first drew my attention to the peculiarities of the trip.
    One doesn&rsquo;t ordinarily preserve the stub of a chair in a parlor car.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The next step was to learn who had impersonated Claude
    Carleton and why. An odd bit of evidence told me who it was. In fact, it
    was this same bit of evidence that told me several things. Mr. Egbert Warren
    has a peculiar and fascinating way of snapping his fingers. Anyone can snap
    one finger or two, but Mr. Warren snaps all four in such rapid succession
    that they make a strange, even weird sound.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Most men or boys who hear it take notice at once. I
    did myself, while young Joe Hopper is almost fanatical about it. Now it seems
    that the man who was in the Pullman compartment when the train in question
    reached Harrisburg that morning did this finger-snapping stunt. The man in
    the Aylesbury House did too, and thus we are forced to tie the identity of
    the false Claude Carleton to the person of Egbert Warren.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This takes us over into another chapter, which we may
    not delve into at present. But I will say that the man who shot Professor
    Scott, who used the same diabolical engine of death, the fountain pen, and
    left behind him in the professor&rsquo;s room a telephone book marred just
    as this one is, is the same man who brought some groceries up to the professor&rsquo;s
    room, and&mdash;snapped his fingers as he came up in Joe Hopper&rsquo;s car.
    Have you the suitcases, Stokes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Carlisle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bring them in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As the sergeant went outside and returned with two suitcases,
    Egbert Warren gave a shriek, covered his face with his hands, and collapsed.</p>
  <p align="left">Dr. Landon, who had come in unobserved, assisted by Stokes,
    took the stricken man away, and Kenneth went on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In these suitcases are the bones of the skeleton that
    was sent here to Mr. Carleton on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. As you all know, it
    is articulated and so goes easily into these receptacles. I will merely open
    them to show you that it is so, and close them again to spare the feelings
    of the ladies.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Egbert Warren, in the guise of a plain-clothes policeman,
    went to my rooms and got the skeleton from my man by fraud. But Egbert Warren
    was not acting for himself; he was a tool of another.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Going back for a moment to the fountain pen, because
    I am reminded of it by seeing one before me, I would say that Mr. Carleton
    never used a fountain pen. So, when my suspicions were aroused, and this
    was after the gun pen had been removed from this desk and the present pen
    you see there was substituted, I tried the fountain pen and the ordinary
    pens, intending to carry away the paper for analysis. But <em>en route</em> the paper
    was stolen from me, giving me another reason to suspect chicanery. However,
    I had a second paper hidden in a book on the shelf, and this, analyzed, proved
    that the fountain pen was not filled with the same ink used in the inkwell.
    A suggestion, if not a proof, that the fountain pen had never belonged to
    Mr. Manning Carleton and was fraudulent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Touching on the death of Professor Scott, I am in a
    position to prove that he knew the truth about Manning Carleton&rsquo;s death
    and was intending to denounce the murderer. Whereupon the murderer added
    a second crime to his list, and using Egbert Warren as his tool, he had the
    old professor put to death.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is all of my report. If I have left any small points
    unexplained it is because of their relative insignificance or because I have
    long enough imposed upon your patience. There is the story. The murderer
    sits among you. Will he confess, or must I denounce him by name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Carlisle looked at no one in particular, and a silence fell
    on the room.</p>
  <p align="left">Stokes and his aides were alertly on guard. Carlisle looked
    white and stern as he frowned into space. The women were in tears, and the
    men all deeply moved.</p>
  <p align="left">After a moment Carlisle said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you mean to confess your crime, or shall I say that
    Manning Carleton was murdered by&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">There was a spring like that of a wild animal, and Claude Carleton
    landed beside the desk. He snatched the fiendish weapon, turned it on himself,
    and fired.</p>
  <p align="left">The backfire was fearful, and the resultant death a terrible
    spectacle quickly removed by the gathering group of police.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Pauline, rushing on Kenneth like a
    mad woman, &ldquo;you said at the outset that Claude didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Mrs. Carleton,&rdquo; and Kenneth held her by the
    arm and tried to soothe her, &ldquo;no I didn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You said Manning Carleton wasn&rsquo;t killed by his
    son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And he wasn&rsquo;t. Claude was no relation to him.
    He was adopted in infancy from an asylum. He only learned that fact of late,
    and he acted so unfilially that Mr. Carleton decided to cut him practically
    out of his will. Claude learned of this and planned his diabolical schemes.
    The gun, I am told, he obtained from some of the Chinese bandits who are
    also responsible for the drug habits of Egbert Warren.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Kenneth knew this would bring even more sorrow to the stricken
    Pauline, but he thought it better to let her know the worst. Warren was sure
    to be tried for the murder of the professor, and it must be faced.</p>
  <p align="left">Violet came forward and, putting her arm round the girl&rsquo;s
    quivering form, led her from the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Kenneth added to his report, &ldquo;Claude
    planned a very clever alibi. He was seen by trainmen to take that two o&rsquo;clock
    train. But, of course, when he stepped out on the platform as the train stopped
    in Newark, neither porter nor conductor paid any attention to him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, to all appearance, he returned to his compartment
    before the train went on, and though it was really Warren who did this, the
    resemblance had been looked to, and it was assumed to be the same man. Both
    Warren and Claude were adept in the arts of making up, and it was an easy
    disguise. Everybody was unobserved too, because late New Year&rsquo;s Eve
    is not a time for careful consideration, nor was there any known reason for
    it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The checking up of Claude&rsquo;s trip was careful enough
    in a general way, but when I went myself to Harrisburg yesterday, I soon
    learned the truth. The photograph I carried of Claude was one in which he
    was wearing a hat and overcoat&mdash;by the way, it was the only one available,
    doubtless on purpose. The trainmen and even the hotel men were ready to say
    it was the man whom they had seen. Which proves how unobservant the average
    looker-on can be. I went to Harrisburg yesterday on the one o&rsquo;clock
    train. I reached there at quarter to five and managed to catch the six-twenty-three
    back to New York, getting here at eleven last night&mdash;with the knowledge
    of Claude Carleton&rsquo;s crime in full! You see, when he got off at Newark
    he hired a car and drove to New York, parking near this house. These points
    have all been checked up. He walked along, watching his chance to elude Garvin,
    and going into the Mortlake house with a night key which he had stolen or
    had made, he went through the door into the Carleton library. He had left
    the bolts on the Carleton side off before he started. The tapestry hid the
    fact, and no one thought of investigating them. But what actually occurred
    between him and Manning Carleton, we can never know. We do know that the
    murder was done with the fountain-pen gun, and that Claude went away leaving
    the pen on the pen rack. I suppose he thought that was safer for him than
    trying to dispose of the weapon. He left this room in the way I showed you,
    bolting the door after him, going through the Mortlake house and back to
    his parked car. Garvin saw him leave the other house. Then he went back to
    Newark, and the next morning went to Philadelphia, where he met Warren, rechanged
    identities with him, and came on home, sitting in the same Pullman chair
    Warren had bought. Incidentally, he preserved the number stub, which was
    a strong factor in helping my search.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course, when Claude fixed up the skeleton matter
    he drew on his imagination for the accusation of murder against Manning Carleton.
    There was never any such thing happened. Claude hoped that the shock would
    cause death by heart disease, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Egbert Warren was merely a tool in Claude&rsquo;s hands.
    By promises of providing the drug he craved, Claude could make him do anything.
    He will, of course, be tried for Professor Scott&rsquo;s murder, but it must
    be remembered he was but a tool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His recital finished, Kenneth Carlisle sighed wearily. At the
    moment he was quite ready to give up the new profession he had chosen for
    himself. He looked about him for some face not drawn with sorrow or horror.</p>
  <p align="left">He could find only that of Mistah Joe Hoppah, so, beckoning
    to him, the detective went out for a walk in the cold winter sunshine.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
