<h2><a name="foreword" id="foreword"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="first">THE following study is one of a very few, as far
as the writer's knowledge goes, full-length lives of Maurice de
Saxe in English.</p>

<p>Much of the material is new to English readers; the
translations are, all of them, taken direct from the originals
and have not, as far as can be ascertained, been translated
before.</p>

<p>There is no fiction or invented romance in this biography; the
life and character of the hero, his contemporaries and his
background have been kept as close to fact as possible; legends
and picturesque embroideries have been avoided&mdash;the subject
needs none.</p>

<p>Besides the books given in the bibliography, much material has
been gathered from articles in French periodicals and the
journals of learned societies. This is especially the case with
regard to Adrienne de Lecouvreur and Madame Favart. Some use has
been made of an early study of the same subject by the present
writer now long out of print.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George R. Preedy</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="proem" id="proem"></a>PROEM</h2>

<p class="first">IT is easy to fix a label on an age, or period,
and not so easy to justify it; the eighteenth century has been
termed the age of reason, the age of prose and the age of
adventurers. It was probably no more full of reason, prose or
adventurers than any other epoch, and with the broad movements of
thought and action that marks this century from others in the
judgment of historians, this study has nothing to do.</p>

<p>The subject of it, however, does appear not only to fit into
an age singularly prolific in adventurers of all types, but to be
himself the foremost of all of them and their epitome.</p>

<p>This mercenary soldier, a prince by the left hand, who more
than once missed a throne, and who through his mother was
descended from a stock that had produced warriors so ferocious
that they were rebuked even by their contemporaries, men neither
nice nor sensitive, led a life typical of all that is best, and
all that is worst, in these eighteenth-century adventurers whose
names and exploits, both in love and war, formed plentiful
material for the flatterer, the satirist and the hack-writer of
spurious memoirs.</p>

<p>Their names were freely used to paint spurious tales and stock
anecdotes and to give lustre to refurbished scandals, and it is
not easy always to discover the real men behind their gaudy
fabrications.</p>

<p>The world in which they live is, in every sense, a vanished
world. We have changed in everything, in nothing more than in our
conception of a hero, and the meaning that we attach to the word
glory. And we shall find these words used very frequently in this
age that seems in so much dry, cynic and disillusioned. The
soldier, if brave and successful, was a hero, and war, however
purposeless, useless and incompetently conducted was glory if it
allowed an opportunity for a display of courage, even if this did
not lead to victory.</p>

<p>The army, the church and politics were the only professions
open to the nobility of every country; they often overlapped; the
general who like Marlborough had "saved" his country in the
field, might without difficulty be allowed to guide the national
destiny in the cabinet, and found equal opportunities for plunder
in both spheres. The churchman, like Cardinal Fleury, whose
modest abilities would scarcely have sufficed for the duties of a
parish priest, might find himself, through rank influence and
expediency, chief minister of a great nation for many disastrous
years. Princes and their favourites and the friends and relations
of their favourites, might pick and choose between Church, Army
and Politics and often tried each in turn, but the favourite
pursuit of royalty and the aristocracy, and one that they felt
was closely interlinked with their caste, their honour and their
pride, was war.</p>

<p>In their eyes war meant power, possible aggrandisement,
undoubted chances of plunder and a life that was much to the
taste of an eighteenth-century patrician. Their campaigns were
conducted like hunting parties, leisurely and after lengthy
preparations. Few of the luxuries supplied by the great cities
were missing in the camps and with the first touch of winter
weather the armies went into winter quarters and the officers, at
least, enjoyed several months of extravagant idleness, feted,
pampered and praised. Each war, therefore, consisted of one
campaign and a truce each year and so dragged on, to the misery
and often the ruin of all concerned, save the soldiers, who found
this manner of life so acceptable that they looked upon a peace
as a vast misfortune.</p>

<p>But there was never, during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, a universal peace; the War of the Empire against the
Turks, a conflict in which the Republic of Venice was often
involved, only ceased for periods so brief as to be negligible,
and aristocrats, bored by the intervals between the European
clashes, volunteered in large numbers to join the struggle on the
plains of Hungary, under the walls of Belgrade or among the
islands of Greece, Cyprus and Crete.</p>

<p>This was the school that produced the mercenary soldier,
though they would not have cared for that term; men, often of
royal birth, nearly always of noble birth, who, finding that
their own countries could not employ them, went where there was a
chance to win fortune by the sword and the exercise of wit,
cunning or intrigue. They cared nothing for the cause for which
they fought, though a fantastic echo of the crusades ran through
the call for volunteers against the Porte and served only for
their pay and the luck that might come the way of an unscrupulous
man during the anarchy of a warfare that accepted but a few of
the rules of any civilisation and usually ignored these.</p>

<p>It is difficult to acquit the two great generals who, at the
opening of the century, were in the front of their profession,
and models for all the younger men, of being essentially
mercenaries.</p>

<p>Prince Eugene of Savoy, who wrote his signature in four
languages, was by birth a Frenchman, possibly the son of Louis
XIV, but owing to being passed over at the French court, spent
his life serving against France; Marlborough certainly fought for
his native land, though he commanded troops of various
nationalities, but it would be a very enthusiastic admirer who
would suppose that patriotism greatly inspired him or that the
invincible Duke did not relish war for its own sake and what it
brought him in profit and glory and that he did not prolong war
when it was possible to do so.</p>

<p>Large fortunes, diamond belted swords and grandiose piles like
Blenheim and Bellevue rewarded these men who possessed the
genius, the character and the opportunity to raise themselves
solid fortunes out of the chaos of war. They were in this,
different from the free-lances of earlier centuries, from whom
they were in a sense descended; the <i>condottiere</i> of whom
<i>Giovanni delle Bande Nere</i> is the most famous example, or
Sir John Hawkwood, with his roving bands, in that they were far
more highly rewarded, lived, even in the midst of war, more
softly, and mostly died, not like the young Medici or Charles de
Bourbon, shattered on the "bed of honour" but comfortably if
miserably of old age.</p>

<p>Among the notable generals of the eighteenth century,
Marlborough's nephew, the Duke of Berwick, was the only one to
meet a fate similar to that of Gustavus Adolphus and be slain in
action, though many, Saxe and Cumberland among them, suffered
from flesh wounds that primitive surgery allowed to torture them
for the rest of their lives, perhaps even to shorten their
days.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, for these mighty ones, the profession
was, despite their personal bravery, as safe as it was lucrative,
and their greatest danger arose from their own self-indulgence or
the insanitary nature of the camps and forts over which they
ruled. True that many battles were massacres, and all accounted
for many lives; true that comparatively few of the wounded
survived, that disease swept off large numbers and that grim
privation and suffering was the lot of those in besieged towns
and forts, but most of these evils fell upon the rank and file,
and few of the higher officials and none of the generals abated
anything of their comfort and splendour because they were
conducting a campaign. Some disasters were, now and then, beyond
control and reduced all to a common level of misery; such was the
dreadful retreat from Prague, an emergency measure, adopted
against the rules of eighteenth-century warfare and taking place
in mid-winter. The officers then shared, perforce, the agonies of
the men, and some of them, like Vauvenargues, whose sad and noble
essay "On Glory" may have been inspired by this disaster, never
recovered from their suffering. But even then, the snow-bound
passes were strewn with the silver plate, damask hangings and
rich camp furniture that the lackeys of M. de Bellisle had tried
in vain to drag in the wake of their general.</p>

<p>But such miscalculations were rare, and for the most part a
quinsy from an infected camp, sore eyes from the dust of the
march, a touch of putrid fever caught from the ill-lodged, ill-
fed, dirty soldiers, was the worst that the general and his staff
had to fear, and even these perils were balanced by the constant
attendance of physicians and surgeons who offered their small
skill and their abundant flattery to the masters who fee'd them
generously for such palliatives as medicine could offer against
ignorance and filth.</p>

<p>Is it not this luxury, this extravagance, this softness even
in the midst of war that marks these wigged and powdered heroes
as of a smaller make than their predecessors of the earlier
centuries? Or is it merely that it is easier to cast a dark
romance over those whose characters and actions one knows only in
outline, than over those whose careers are so well documented
that one can follow them into the closet and watch them at their
toilet?</p>

<p>But those earlier men of war, Princes and mercenaries alike,
seem to possess an austerity, a dignity, a virtue wholly lacking
to the later military adventurer. Bloody-minded, violent,
corrupt, bandits, pirates, thieves these earlier warriors may
have been, but we can at least persuade ourselves that there
lingered about them some gleam of the fabled chivalry men had at
one time invented, if never practised, some sparkle of antique or
"Roman" virtue. If there was a Gaston de Foix among the generals
of the eighteenth century, his fame has not survived, nor was
there any commander comparable to Bayard or Du Guesclin, even
allowing that these famous knights have been over-praised.</p>

<p>Giovanni dei Medici was, no doubt, in all essentials, not
superior to Otto von Königsmarck, Maurice de Saxe or any other
eighteenth-century mercenary of whom one cares to think, but it
is impossible to imagine that any of their followers could have
written of them as Pietro Aretino wrote of the leader of the
Black Bands.</p>

<p>Even such a corrupt and cunning character as François I had,
at least in his youth, ideals of chivalry and honour that were
totally lost two hundred years after Paria, and, with one or two
exceptions, the last great leader to evoke passionate and blind
devotion from his men was Gustavus Adolphus, who commanded his
own subjects and who did not, in any crude or obvious sense,
fight for gain.</p>

<p>The sports and pastimes of these earlier soldiers have more
beauty and dignity, also, at least in the imagination. The great
ruby that Charles the Bold kept on his camp bottle, the string of
diamonds that looped the shabby hat of Maurice of Orange, the
heavy jewels the great constable pledged at Turin to pay his
troops, these have a more manly air than the modish trifles that,
straight from Paris and Vienna, decked the luxurious tents of
later warriors. And the song of the minstrel after the battle,
the energetic games that passed the time for besieger and
besieged, the reading from rare and precious books tending to
encourage and exalt, these were poorly replaced by the berline
full of easy actresses, the travelling stage that provided the
coquettish comedies, and the private <i>gazette</i> that brought
all the scandals of the city and the court to the garrison and
the camp.</p>

<p>Can we argue that these later mercenaries seem hollow and
tawdry even for their fierce and dreadful profession because they
lacked a God, even a God of Battles? The captains of an earlier
age had a grimly sincere belief in some manner of Deity; the
priest who accompanied them during their campaigns had often a
real power over them, and the confessions, the absolutions, the
bequests for masses, the endowment of church and convent, charity
and hospital, were not wholly hypocritical. Shakespeare put a
prayer into the mouth of Harry of Monmouth on the eve of his
great fight, even though it was a plea that his fathers sins
might be forgotten, and even Count Tilly, as late as the mid-
sixteenth century, had his supplication&mdash;"Oh God, if there
is a God, save my soul, if I have a soul."</p>

<p>But by the eighteenth century belief had gone with
superstition, and with them the last vestige of the knightly
ideal. A zeal for "the common cause," i.e. the upholding of
Protestantism, animated William III, and both he and his
followers were able to persuade themselves that he was raised up
by God, like David, to fight the Lord's battles, but he was the
last great captain to do more than make a pretence at devotion to
an hereditary faith and with the progress of the century even the
pretence was dropped.</p>

<p>True, there were the <i>Te Deums</i>; the favour of the
Almighty was claimed by every combatant, and He was duly praised
in St. Paul's Cathedral or Notre Dame de Paris as the tide of
success flowed this way and that; true that hymns of praise rose
after every victory and that the word "God" was bandied about
very freely. All this was a necessary part or the formula to
which warfare had been reduced&mdash;"without the <i>Te Deums</i>
we should not know that there had been a victory," wrote Madame
de Sévigné.</p>

<p>But if there were some pious Roman Catholics, some fervent
Huguenots, some sincere Lutherans or Calvinists among the common
soldiers or the officers of lower rank, there were none among the
generals, and the mercenaries served any prince of any faith, no
matter what their own creeds were supposed to be. The wars of
religion were over; these were wars of aggression, of pride, of
national vanity; Maréchal de Noailles, after pointing out to
Louis XV that the country was in fact on the verge of ruin, yet
declared that a costly purposeless war must be undertaken "for
the honour of France."</p>

<p>Frederic of Prussia read Voltaire, the Comte de Bomeval became
a Mussulman, the Comte de Guibert wrote dramas full of barren
heroics and essays on tactics that were enervated by the "<i>a
quoi bon?</i>" of the <i>"philosophes"</i> whose fashionable
incredulity penetrated even the camps.</p>

<p>When men fought thus openly for gain, without even a pretence
of a cause, an ideal, or obedience to the will of a higher power,
without even a sense of nationalism or a gleam of patriotism,
they became the soulless men of brass and iron, of whom Maurice
de Saxe was the most splendid and successful example. True, Count
von Schulenburg, himself a specimen of the better type of
mercenary soldier, instructed the young Maurice with lofty
ideals, and tried to inculcate into him some of the antique
virtues. But these were not taken seriously by his pupil, who
remained all his life "<i>sans coeur</i>" to an extent that
impressed an age beginning to indulge in that sentimentality that
shows a lack both of spirituality and sentiment.</p>

<p>It might be said that he was without honour also, save in the
sense that he never took bribes to betray his master, and was
certainly without real religion of any kind, a fact that he
admitted with a frankness that startled Madame Pompadour, herself
no fanatic in matters of faith.</p>

<p>It was to her that the successful soldier said: "I've never
seen the woman whom I would care to call my wife, nor the man
whom I would care to call my son." And he might with truth have
added: "Nor imagined any spirit whom I would care to call my
god."</p>

<p>Born on one side of noble freebooters with a strain of
insanity in their blood, and on the other side of the Albertine
line of Saxon Electors, princes noted for their indolence, their
luxury and their physical strength, Maurice resembled the hardier
ancestor after whom he was named, Maurice of Saxony, who had also
bequeathed his military genius and his name to another great
soldier, Maurice of Orange, his grandson.</p>

<p>The name was suggestive of Pagan fortitude and Christian
faith, for St. Maurice, the patron Saint of these warriors was
that stalwart, Roman soldier, who, converted, and converting his
legion, perished, the legend says, amid the Alpine snows,
together with his men, rather than renounce his belief in Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>For such as Maurice, who early understood his position, there
was but one possible career. The profession of arms promised well
for younger sons and royal bastards, even though the great prizes
might be seized by dispossessed princes like the Duke of
Lorraine, or ruling potentates like Louis of Baden, or the
landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.</p>

<p>The affairs of Europe were in flux and the struggle for the
balance of power kept the great nations constantly at one
another's throats.</p>

<p>Consider the period covered by the life of Maurice de Saxe; he
was born the year that the peace of Ryswick concluded a war that
had lasted from 1689, a war that had indeed begun in 1672, and in
which the peace procured by the treaty of Nymegen had been in
reality but a truce; during his early childhood the third phase
of this war between the Allies and France, that of the Spanish
succession, broke out, and Maurice, in his thirteenth year was
present with Marlborough and Eugene at the bloody day of
Malplaquet.</p>

<p>Contemporary with this struggle was that of Augustus, Elector
of Saxony and father of Maurice, for the throne of Poland, that
involved him in a long war with Sweden, with Russia first as ally
and then as masters, and when the battle of Patona put an end to
this struggle and the treaty of Utrecht to the other, there was
still the struggle against the Turks in progress and Maurice was
able to gain another taste of bloodshed serving under Eugene
before the walls of Belgrade.</p>

<p>Entering the service of France he found the interval of peace
too long for his taste and his purse and was able to raise a war
on his own by competing for the Dukedom of Courland. He was
hardly through with this adventure when France was again engaged
in a war that lasted until the peace of Vienna, 1736, but that
was renewed again in 1740 and continued until two years before
the death of Maurice, only to break out again a few years
later.</p>

<p>Such a state of continual universal warfare&mdash;besides
these European conflicts, the French and English were fighting in
India&mdash;with the ideas, standards, mentality and ambitions
they gave rise to, caused the rogue and the adventurer, the
charlatan and the ruffian to flourish exceedingly. And none was
more valuable to these warring princes&mdash;and the struggles
were between princes&mdash;not between peoples&mdash;than the
bold, talented mercenary, who knew how to make himself obeyed,
how to hold or take a fort, how to throw up a demilune or a
ravelin, how to accept or offer, with conventional grace, the
keys of a city, and how to spend, with lavish ease, when the army
went into winter quarters, the pay and the plunder gathered
during the summer's campaign.</p>

<p>The extravagance of these military leaders passed all bounds,
an eye-witness relates, seeing the Elector Max of Bavaria, hero
of the siege of Belgrade, give his hat full of gold to a male
acrobat whose performance had pleased him; another German prince
was said to have traded a regiment for a pair of perfect blue
Chinese vases, and even the officers of lower rank went into
action wearing diamonds and with their pockets full of money.</p>

<p>A foot-pad who held up the King of Poland, John Sobieksi, and
his staff, as they went out at night to view the Turkish lines,
made a haul of jewels alone that brought him 8,000 ducatoons,
when sold in Venice.</p>

<p>The troops of the Sultan went into battle superbly equipped,
while their tents were furnished with a profusion of rich objects
so that every time they were defeated, even in a brush, or
skirmish, the Christians carried away costly plunder and the
treasury of the Green Vaults, in the fantastic palace of Augustus
II at Dresden contained many a priceless ruby and emerald, many a
costly plume, aigrette or scimitar, picked up on the Eastern
frontiers where the Turkish janissaries struggled so long and so
obstinately to penetrate into the West.</p>

<p>Rich opportunities for plunder were also offered by the wars
in which Venice engaged the Porte and those where Naples, under a
Spanish Viceroy, fought off the Algerian corsairs.</p>

<p>Among the isles of the Mediterranean and along the coasts of
Africa many a raid might be made, many a well-laden galley sunk
and much treasure brought home.</p>

<p>Maurice's maternal fortune that he never touched owing to the
dishonesty of the bankers at Hamburg, came largely from this
source, for Otto von Königsmarck, his grandfather, had long
commanded the forces of the Venetian Republic, a post after held
with distinction by Maurice's first instructor in the art of war,
General von Schulenburg.</p>

<p>Another field of action for the adventurer and the mercenary
was that vast half-barbaric country that even the efforts of
Peter the Great had not brought much into touch with Europe.
Riches and power that might well be regarded as fabulous awaited
the lucky fortune-hunter in Russia, especially when the seven
Imperial Crowns were worn by a woman, and clever scoundrels like
Count Biron, afterwards Duke of Courland, and reputable soldiers
like Marshal Keith and Field-Marshal Count Peter Lacy, "the
Eugene of Muscovy," found it well worth their while to penetrate
to the splendours of Moscow or the new brilliancy of St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>The hope of the sombre, remote and alluring throne of the
Romanoffs was one that frequently dazzled and tempted Maurice de
Saxe during his gaudy career, but successful as he was with
women, he failed to secure either the Empress Anna or the Empress
Elizabeth, but more through lack of tact than of opportunity, so
near to an Empress's diadem could a bold, comely adventurer come
in those days of moral anarchy and the chaos carved in all human
institutions by absolute monarchies continually at war with one
another.</p>

<p>As these adventurers lived so they died, without remorse,
repentance or hope; most of them were disabled and diseased by
self-indulgence; even the almost legendary strength of Augustus
II and his son, Maurice, only resisted continuous and excessive
debauchery until early middle age; their last years were pitiful
exhibitions of premature decay only redeemed by the fiery courage
of Maurice and the cynic courtesy of Augustus. Their monuments
were arid, their epitaphs were formal; scribblers and pensters
got to work on their reputations as soon as their bodies had been
placed in their gilded coffins.</p>

<p>Favart, the charming actor, who had good cause to know the
base side of Maurice, wrote of him, with reluctant good nature,
that "He had too many faults to be praised, and too many virtues
to be blamed."</p>

<p>So the godless soldiers passed to the dust, having taken
greedily all they wanted from life and leaving the jobber, the
pander, the flatterer and the lackey to put on mourning cloaks
and creepers while they looked out for another master.</p>

<p>To be fearless in face of death was part of the adventurer's
code, and some, like Maurice, could face the prospect of
annihilation without blanching. "I've lived without a priest, and
I'll die without one," he declared.</p>

<p>But he died reluctantly&mdash;a fine play was over but he went
out into a starless night. Not for him, or his like&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
Death is a port where all may refuge find,<br>
The end of labour, the entry into rest&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p>but a grim cutting short of lust, pleasure and excitement, for
them the pagan admonition rather than the Christian hope:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
Lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti;<br>
Tempus abire tibi est.</p>
<br>

<p>Boldly, or with indifference, they bade farewell to the feast,
the wine-cup, the concubine, to the gilt laurels of victory, and
their bleak atheisms seem to chill even their tombs, that have
more the air of chill ornaments of the charnel-house than that of
memorials charged with the hope of immortality, an affirmation of
the belief in the <i>janua vitae</i> into eternal life and
perfect knowledge.</p>

<p>And being thus dead without hope they seem doubly dead.</p>

<p>Are they, then, of sufficient interest for anyone to revive
the outlines of their portraits and fill them in with fresh
colours, if only transiently and with little skill?</p>

<p>If they are worth so much attention, it is because there must
always be a curiosity about any human being who rose above his
fellows and left a name remembered beyond his own day, and
because for many people that engrossing emotion, best described
as nostalgia for the past, extends, with peculiar force to what
is strange and remarkable in modern eyes, and to all that had its
roots in a past not two centuries ago in point of time, but has
vanished as utterly as the fabled splendour of Babylon and
Tyre.</p>

<p>It cannot be a study without fascination to trace the life of
another human being who lived under circumstances to us so
strange, and in times that to us are lost save in echoes, day-
dreams, or what we may find in the pages of all books, between
the frames of old pictures, or in some other relic, a dusty tomb,
an exhibit in a museum, or a room in a palace long since disused
and shut away.</p>

<p>The background of the eighteenth-century adventurer is
splendid; even those who pay willing tribute to the beauties of a
purer art and the canons of a finer taste, must admit the
peculiar attraction of the baroque period, the style of sweeping
curves, the twisting movement, the dramatic emphasis, the heavy
over-ornamentation that, influencing everything from churches to
clothes, adorns, like the violent colours on the standing pool, a
century of decay in art, manners and costumes that, a mode heavy
with languid over-ripeness, fell finally into ridicule and were
swept away.</p>

<p>The keynote of eighteenth-century baroque art was luxury; it
never belonged to the people, or sprang from the soil, it was the
drop cloth behind the sports of princes, the enrichment of the
pageantry of kings, the excuse for men like Maurice de Saxe to
spend their plunder and increase their fame. Never was there an
art so costly, so exclusively the plaything of the wealthy and
the powerful; never was there such a vast difference between the
surroundings, the clothes, the habits of the poor, the middle
classes and those who were, in every sense of the word, their
masters. The mingled frivolity and magnificence of such a
hunting-box as Poppelmann built for Augustus the Strong at
Moritzburg, or the same monarch's palace at Dresden, had hardly
been seen before in the West. For it was a wanton splendour, it
had no roots in deep feeling, or strong taste, or the desire to
leave a proud monument behind; it was touched by the grotesque,
it was perverse, it had a superb foolishness akin to that which
sent the princes who owned these palaces into battle, wearing
flowing perukes tied in silk bags, or pearl ear-rings, or plaits
fashioned with silk ribbons; the same kind of dainty, hysterical
silliness as made the fine ladies tear the gold braid off the
coats of the fine gentlemen, and wind it into balls for tatting,
so that the Duke of Orleans once escaped from such a mêlée with
his coat falling to pieces at the seams.</p>

<p>There was the atmosphere of a fairy tale about these palaces,
the fairy tales of Madame d'Aulnoy, Charles Perrault or Carlo
Gozzi; the ogre, the princess, the faithful lover, the dwarf, the
witch, were well at home in their scenes. But these were not
kindly fairy tales, having their roots in folk-lore or the sweet
fancies of children. They were unwholesome, even wicked, such
stories as might have been invented to amuse the idle women who,
glutted with jewels, thought it amusing to wear a kitchen cloth
as a head-dress, garnished with carrots and onions, or, weary of
the costly flowers in golden vases, enjoyed thrusting a hyacinth
bulb through a turnip, placing both into a common pot and
watching the nymph reluctantly blooming in the arms of the satyr.
This lovely and brilliant decoration made the crimes and vices of
the age the uglier by contrast; the pretence of an exquisite
courtesy showed up the heartlessness beneath.</p>

<p>An eye-witness of the Neapolitan massacres of 1799, who by an
odd chance escaped the slaughter, noted one of the assassins, a
handsome young man with his hair in a blue net, and with a large
crimson rose between his lips. This ruffian advanced his face
towards the prisoners under his charge and left deep wounds on
their cheeks, for in the centre of the rose was a small
stiletto.</p>

<p>So these men wounded through beauty and with a smile; lying,
betraying, murdering without hesitation or remorse when it suited
their interests to do so, yet always offering the rose, the
charming word, the seductive look. The women, as the sex then
truly helpless, save for their own powers of intrigue, were the
principal victims of their heartlessness, as witness the dealings
of the father of Maurice with his mother, and the hero's own
dealings with Justine Favart.</p>

<p>The women had to take the men as they found them, and being of
the same age and breed, managed well enough, even sometimes to
best the triumphant male until their hearts were involved, and
then they had to burn themselves out before the sentimental
cruelty of a charming egotism as did Adrienne de Lecouvreur and
Julie de Lespinasse. And they, too, died without hope, with the
name of a mortal on their lips and their faces turned from the
priests. And who were there to comfort anyone? They, too, had a
baroque outline, a modish air; "I hope," said a great lord on
engaging his chaplain, "you do not expect me to listen to your
sermons."&mdash;"I hope," responded the cleric, "that monseigneur
does not expect me to give any."</p>

<p>Thus French wit, and in England, Queen Caroline, the mother of
Cumberland, defeated at Fontenoy, retired into her closet while
her chaplain said prayers, in order to gossip with her
women&mdash;"But, pray ladies, let us leave the door ajar and
converse in whispers, lest he thinks we are not listening." So
breeding and cynicism go hand in hand, and "everything is
supportable save boredom," declared Voltaire.</p>

<p>Here the adventurers, the mercenaries, the paid captains, like
Maurice de Saxe, were true to the spirit of their age; they were
never bored; not for them the cynic weariness that made Louis XV
sigh&mdash;"What would the world be without coffee?" and then
added: "After all, what <i>is</i> the world&mdash;with
coffee?"</p>

<p>Disappointed in much, frustrated in much, was the Saxon
adventurer, and he was typical of all the eighteenth-century
adventurers&mdash;never admitted to boredom, save for the
briefest periods. To the last he remained full of zest, and the
sole complaint that he had to make of his life was that it was
too short.</p>

<p>It had certainly been remarkable, full of strange episodes,
bombastic triumphs, touching on flamboyant tragedies and violent
dramas, played out against bizarre backgrounds and with strange
companions.</p>

<p>By no standard could this famous soldier be said to be a
great, a good, or an important man, but his career has the
fascination of yesterday's comet; the flaming thing is gone, it
has left no trace, it has made no difference to anyone, but it
was there and will not lightly be forgotten. A recent French
biographer of Maurice de Saxe has claimed that, with all his
faults, he was "a man."</p>

<p>The following study attempts to depict what manner of man was
he of whom it was written:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
Th' eternal juryman of Fate<br>
When Saxe, unconquerably great<br>
Approached within his ken,<br>
Scowl'd at his freight, a trembling crowd,<br>
And "Turn out, ghosts!" he roar'd aloud,<br>
"Here's Hercules agen!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1.1" id="ch1.1"></a>I. "A VAPOUR SOMETIME LIKE A
LION OR A BEAR"</h2>

<p class="first">ON an autumn day in the year 1696 an elegant
carriage passed through the valleys of the Hartz Mountains
towards the ancient city of Goslar, which lies on the north side
of the famous range and at the foot of the Rammelberg, the
towering mountain that is honeycombed with an extraordinary
variety of mines, which produce copper, lead, zinc, sulphur,
vitriol, alum and silver in prodigal abundance.</p>

<p>The handsome berline, a capacious family conveyance, proceeded
with discretion and swung gently on the leather straps. Two
footmen stood behind and a third was seated beside the coachman;
four stout greys drew the equipage. There was an outrider in
front and a manservant on horseback behind. All this betokened a
careful and luxurious traveller, but there were no arms on the
panels of the carriage and no distinguishing marks about the
liveries of the servants.</p>

<p>This romantic air of mystery, wealth and pomp was heightened
by the appearance of the occupant of the carriage&mdash;a lady,
wrapped in a costly cloak of glossy sables and wearing a black
mask under her beaver hat, from which hung plumes of ostrich to
mingle with her fashionable curls. Her sole companion was a
quiet-looking woman, who appeared to be a chambermaid of the
better sort; she sat opposite on the padded seat, holding upon
her knee a handsome casket, which she guarded with anxious
care.</p>

<p>The sun had for some time disappeared behind the high peaks of
the mountains, when the lady, impatient after the long, tedious
journey, let down the blinds at the window and putting her head
out of the carriage, looked keenly at the prospect before her
tired gaze.</p>

<p>She was a foreigner; though she had been resident for some
time in Saxony, she had never seen these beautiful mountains
before. She gave them, however, but one glance of dry curiosity,
then stared ahead at her destination.</p>

<p>The little city of Goslar was already in sight; the stout
ramparts, the numerous towers showed in dark outline against the
blue-green spaces of the mountains beyond. Goslar, still
possessing a remote and solitary dignity, had once been a place
of considerable importance, the residence of Emperors, one of
whom, Henry IV, had been born there nearly nine centuries before
this elegant stranger stared through her mask at the imperial
spires.</p>

<p>The handsome greys brought the carriage to the ancient gates;
the outrider showed his papers, and the equipage passed into the
streets of Goslar.</p>

<p>A chill and colourless light lay over the old houses rich with
heavy wooden carvings, the Romanesque church, the formidable
towers of the strong fortifications, the market-place now empty
save for a few idlers, who gossiped round the metal fountain
basin in the centre of the square. These and such passersby as
remained in the streets of the quiet town glanced with some
curiosity at the handsome carriage and at the lady whom they
could glimpse, in her sables and travelling-mask, through the
open window.</p>

<p>She seemed to disdain their scrutiny, and, indeed, she was not
troubled by such impertinent interest. Though Goslar had lost
much of its former magnificence, it still contained some fine
residences of nobles and wealthy Saxons, and the existence of the
very valuable silver mines near by, which belonged to the Elector
of Saxony, brought a certain number of wealthy and important
people to the old imperial city in the Hartz Mountains.</p>

<p>The streets were well paved, and it was still at a discreet
pace that the carriage passed the Kaiserhaus, the remains of the
Imperial Palace, the cathedral with the statues of the Emperors
in the portal, a square that gave a glimpse down a side street of
the river Gose, where the washerwomen were kneeling on the flat
stones and beating their linen, until at a sign from the outrider
it drew up before a fine house set in a handsome quiet
street.</p>

<p>The establishment, however, seemed to have no pretensions to
nobility but rather to be that of a wealthy merchant.</p>

<p>The fair traveller had been, it seemed, expected, for the door
was opened instantly, even before the footman could set down the
carriage steps.</p>

<p>The lady was quick to alight; wrapped to the chin in her
sables and leaning on the arm of her attendant with the casket,
she passed with a rapid but heavy step into the house. The doors
closed upon her and the equipage, sombre, costly, not to be
identified, with its footmen and riders in plain livery, passed
rapidly out of the streets of Goslar without a pause to bait the
horses or refresh the men.</p>

<p>The house was empty of host or hostess, but well supplied with
servants. A comfortable suite of apartments with maids awaited
the stranger's commands.</p>

<p>She gave no explanation of her visit and none was asked; an
air of complete discretion ruled in the opulent household. It was
tacitly understood that the lady was a young widow, a relative of
the master of the house, but it was also tacitly understood that
this assumption, necessary to gloss over a scandal, was only a
civil fiction.</p>

<p>When the lady took off her mask and her cloak of sables, she
showed herself well worthy to be the heroine of a romantic
adventure. She was young, she was elegant, she was well-bred; she
had a quantity of lustrous long hair, fine grey eyes and small
features. Her beauty was not of the type that fascinates or
astonishes; it was gentle, sweet, and veiled in melancholy, yet
her most salient characteristic was that self-control which is
hardness or fortitude according to the mood or opinion of the
observer. She had the air of one who would never betray her own
feelings, or assail those of others by emotional or passionate
appeal. Delicate as her features were and tender as was the look
in her eyes, yet underlying the delicacy and tenderness was
something implacable, disdainful. She had the resignation and the
air of authority of one who understood her world, her
circumstances and herself.</p>

<p>She was at present in a difficult situation, one that had
spelt defeat for so many women of her type.</p>

<p>The arrival of a doctor and a wet nurse left no doubt of the
reason for this secrecy and the object of the sojourn of so
bright and so sumptuous a lady in so secluded and unworthy a
residence.</p>

<p>Within a few days of her arrival in the old city of Goslar,
with its rich associations of dead Emperors, long dust, and mines
of precious metals, haunted by goblins, the brave and resigned
lady, Aurora von Königsmarck, gave birth to a male child.</p>

<p>The father was Frederick Augustus, Elector of Saxony, who had
thus resourcefully and lavishly provided for the security and
comfort of his latest mistress.</p>

<p>Not all his troubles, however, availed to save Aurora von
Königsmarck from the distress and agony of a most painful
confinement. It was believed by her well-paid but disinterested
attendants that she would die and it was thought that, if she did
not recover from the effects of the birth of the Elector's son,
it might be convenient for His Highness.</p>

<p>Aurora at last struggled back to languid life and, lying
exhausted and forlorn in the strange bedroom with the unfamiliar
faces about her, considered the uncertain future and her dubious
circumstances. She required for this task all the pride and
reckless courage she had inherited from her famous house, which
had produced bold warriors and unscrupulous adventurers who might
be termed heroes or criminals with equal propriety.</p>

<p>For generations the Königsmarcks had been professional
mercenary soldiers; the family was Swedish, ancient, and noble.
The men had fought with fiery distinction and conspicuous success
all over Europe; Germany, Bohemia, Silesia, Corinth, and Italy
had been the scenes of their ferocious exploits.</p>

<p>John Christopher von Königsmarck was one of the generals of
Gustavus Adolphus, and present at the coronation of Christina,
who gave him the title of count and the rank of Field-
Marshal.</p>

<p>His son, Otto William, had been ambassador from Sweden to the
court of Charles II, then to that of Louis XIV. He had entered
the French service, rose to the rank of Maréchal de Camp, served
under Turenne and was present at the battle of Seneffe and the
siege of Maestricht.</p>

<p>His younger brother, Conrad Christopher, Count of Westermark
and Skegholm, had taken the other side in this war, served under
the Prince of Orange, and was killed at the siege of Bonn that
ended the campaign of 1673.</p>

<p>Count Otto adopted the children of Count Conrad; they were
brought up partly on the Königsmarck estates at Agattenburg, near
Stade, and partly at Hamburg, in their mother's charge. These
children were Count John Charles, Count Philip Christopher,
Amalie Wilhelmina, married to Count Löwenhaupt, and Maria Aurora,
born the year of her father's death.</p>

<p>Otto von Königsmarck afterwards distinguished himself when in
the service of Venice by blowing up the Parthenon of Athens,
which the Turks were using as a powder magazine. Though the times
were not nice or fastidious, and though all Europe was used to
senseless and bloodthirsty wars, the ruthless behaviour of this
Königsmarck was not considered worthy of noblemen or professional
soldiers, and Sweden and France had led the way in formal
complaints of his lawless and reckless actions.</p>

<p>It had been, however, impossible in the confusion of the
various conflicts that split civilisation to bring this lusty
warrior to account. More, he had amassed a large fortune from the
hire of his services to warring states. The children of Conrad
Christopher had all helped to spread the fame of the name of
Königsmarck, but not in a favourable sense.</p>

<p>The two men were conspicuously handsome, gifted, charming and
romantic; they enjoyed money, position, the <i>entrée</i> to all
the courts in Europe. Yet they had not made good use in any sense
of these remarkable and manifold gifts. For gentlemen of their
name and quality there was but one profession open&mdash;that of
arms, but neither displayed military talent of any kind, though
both were able to show a dashing, spectacular gallantry in court
and camp.</p>

<p>Count John Charles had come to England and been involved in an
adventure that is still obscure. All that is known for certainty
is that in a foolish attempt to gain the hand of the Lady
Elizabeth Ogle, one of the richest heiresses in Europe, he had by
means of hired assassins caused to be murdered in Pall Mall,
Thomas Thynne, the wealthy and good-natured Wiltshire squire who
had secured the hand of the red-haired heiress.</p>

<p>John Charles had escaped the consequences of this crime,
though his accomplices were duly hanged. It was admitted, even by
his admirers and friends&mdash;and he had many at the court of
Charles II&mdash;that he had cut but a poor figure in the affair.
He left England, joined one of the tedious campaigns against the
Turks that was usually the last resource of discomforted
adventurers, and was killed, creditably enough, in some skirmish
before Angos in 1686.</p>

<p>The fate of the other brother was even more curious and
dreadful.</p>

<p>Philip von Königsmarck was considered handsomer and more
brilliant than his brother; he was acceptable everywhere for his
grace, wit, refinement and amiability. He was also reckless,
boastful, unstable, a heavy drinker, a light lover. Indeed,
despite their outward brilliancy, there was much that was
superficial and tawdry about the two Counts von Königsmarck. Some
believed that they were tainted with madness, but it might on the
other hand be argued that their defects were very commonplace and
rather the attributes of men whose essential weaknesses
overbalanced their obvious graces and good fortune than symptoms
of insanity.</p>

<p>Philip von Königsmarck was in the service of the Prince
Elector of Hanover, George Louis. The Elector's son was unhappily
married to the charming and vivacious Sophia Dorothea, and after
a brief and impetuous siege she became the secret mistress of the
charming and ardent young Swede.</p>

<p>This intrigue, at once dangerous and tawdry, could not be
expected to endure long. The old Elector's mistress, the Countess
von Platzen, was also enamoured of the dashing soldier and in a
fit of jealousy betrayed the lovers, and Königsmarck disappeared,
when leaving Sophia Dorothea's chamber on July 1, 1694.</p>

<p>The whole truth of this tragedy is not known and probably
never will be. There can be little doubt that Philip von
Königsmarck was murdered; Sophia Dorothea, of whose adultery
there is now no question, was soon afterwards divorced and sent
to lifelong imprisonment in the Castle of Ahlden. There was no
enquiry concerning the disappearance of Königsmarck, though much
outcry was raised by his relatives and friends.</p>

<p>The remaining representatives of the House of Königsmarck were
then the two young women&mdash;Wilhelmina and Aurora.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina, Madame von Löwenhaupt, shared the family talent
for intrigue, imprudence and recklessness. She was, however,
plain featured and of haughty manners; her brother's tragedy was
in part to be put to her account for she had been the confidante
of the two lovers and encouraged them in their dangerous
folly.</p>

<p>This lady was married to a Swedish nobleman employed at the
court of Saxony, who had been her brother's friend. She
determined to discover if Philip had disappeared into a
mysterious imprisonment or gone to a secret death and she was not
inspired only by affection and indignation. The bold and amorous
soldier had been possessed of a considerable fortune, the bulk of
which was in the hands of certain Hamburg bankers, and his
sisters and brother-in-law thought that even if his fate could
not be ascertained and avenged, they might at least augment their
own revenues by obtaining possession of the large properties that
had been in his possession when he disappeared. Besides the title
deeds to various properties there was said to be five hundred
thousand <i>écus</i> in cash, jewels, and a portion of the
philosophers' stone.</p>

<p>Before Count Philip von Königsmarck had taken service with the
Elector of Hanover, he had been in that of the Elector of Saxony
and had made friends at the court of Dresden. It was, therefore,
to Dresden Madame von Löwenhaupt summoned her young, unmarried
sister Aurora, who possessed all the famous Königsmarck charm,
grace, and reckless courage. The scheme was for this fair
creature to second the efforts of the Löwenhaupts to obtain the
favour of the young Elector.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus of the Albertine line came of a family
whose history was no less stormy and remarkable than that of the
Königsmarcks; the Electors of Saxony were among the most powerful
and wealthy princes in the Empire.</p>

<p>Their country was fertile as well as beautiful; the Saxons
were warlike, industrious, and passionately devoted to the
Reformed Religion, which they had been among the first to
embrace. Saxony was the veritable home of Lutheranism and the
great Reformer's patrons had been John George, Elector of Saxony,
and his son Maurice, one of the most famous soldiers of his
age.</p>

<p>The Prince to whom Wilhelmina and Aurora appealed had not long
enjoyed his honours. He had succeeded an elder brother, whose
brief history had been as gloomy and remarkable as that of Philip
von Königsmarck. At the same time as Sophia Dorothea had involved
herself in so reckless a manner with the charming young Swedish
soldier, John George, the young Elector of Saxony, had fallen
under the spell of a young woman who had been put under his
notice by her unscrupulous mother. This lady, Madeleine Sybilla
von Neichschutz, possessed little intelligence, a good deal of
cunning and rapacity, and certain coarse charms that appealed to
the gross taste of the young Prince. Though he was married to the
Princess Bernardine, a woman of his own age and rank, and of
considerable personal attractions, the infatuation of the Elector
for Madeleine Sybilla soon became notorious.</p>

<p>He created her in her own right a Countess of the Imperial
College under the name of Rocklitz, and so influential did the
favourite become that the foreign envoys and residents had to
approach the Elector through her; she and her mother were greedy
and corrupt even beyond what is usual to such adventuresses and
the maladministration of the finances of Saxony, the sale of
offices and commissions, became an ever-growing scandal.</p>

<p>So complete was the young man's subjection that the story went
round that he was bewitched. The domination of Madame von
Rocklitz had to be endured, and the King of England, William III,
had to stoop to sending her messages and presents, including one
from his wife, Queen Mary, in order that the Elector should
continue in the services of the Allies, while the rumour was
spread that Madame von Rocklitz was working for a divorce and a
marriage with the Elector.</p>

<p>The infatuation came to a tragic end; Madame von Rocklitz
caught smallpox and died. She was buried with full honours in the
Electoral vaults of the principal church in Dresden.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the young Elector, who had watched by her
bedside during the progress of her malady, caught the disease
himself. And he, too, died. Popular indignation and private
malice then broke loose.</p>

<p>The Rocklitz's mother was arrested on a charge of corruption
and witchcraft and the Rocklitz herself dragged from her grave. A
small bracelet found on her arm and supposed to be a gift from
the Elector was destroyed; this was believed to be the talisman
that had held him in subjection.</p>

<p>To the Electoral throne, thus suddenly vacant, Frederick
Augustus, John George's younger brother, succeeded.</p>

<p>He, too, was married to a princess of whom he was not
enamoured, but, though completely amoral, he was not dominated by
one mistress. As he was handsome in a florid fashion, of
prodigious strength, with courteous manners, sumptuous taste and
gay conversation, he became at once exceedingly popular among the
cheerful, prosperous Saxons.</p>

<p>He had enjoyed his honours only for a short time, when the two
Swedish ladies presented themselves before him with their appeal
for help. He listened to them with sympathy; he had much in
common with Philip von Königsmarck and but for an accident of
birth might have shared his fortunes and his fate. He promised to
look into the horrible disappearance of the Swedish noble whom he
had himself known and do what he could to elucidate the mystery
by stern representations at the neighbouring court of
Hanover.</p>

<p>Count Königsmarck's guilt, or at least his indiscretion, had
been extremely flagrant, and the public disgrace of Sophia
Dorothea made it a difficult if not an impossible matter to
enquire into the fate of her lover.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus did not, really, greatly concern himself
with this aspect of the affair. He was from the first fascinated
by Aurora von Königsmarck, her breeding, her grace, her high
birth, and the romantic history of her famous family appealed to
the idle and sensuous young prince, who was a giant in stature,
of superb physique and remarkable strength. Like all the German
princes of his time he had always imitated the superficial graces
and elegances of the magnificent court of Louis XIV, and his
first act on entering into his honours was to build and furnish
palaces that should be at least passable copies of
Versailles.</p>

<p>Family treasures he already possessed in plenty, his revenues
were considerable, the resources of his Electorate appeared, at
least, inexhaustible. The long reign of his gifted forebears and
the brief reign of his reckless brother had left his coffers well
filled. The plunder filched by Madame von Rocklitz and her
relations was soon retrieved and Frederick Augustus found himself
in a favourable position to conquer the hearts of ladies, even of
the beauty and rank of Aurora von Königsmarck, and to impress the
Empire with his superb taste and prodigal expenditure.</p>

<p>The seduction of the young supplicant was easy, but not to be
done in any vulgar or obvious manner. In honour of the fair
Swedes the Elector, in accordance with the fashions of the times,
held a festival at his hunting palace in Moritzburg. This
entertainment was on the most extravagant scale and well suited
to be the background to the suit of a prince who had already
acquired the reputation of an invincible lover.</p>

<p>Moritzburg was originally a Royal shooting-box built by the
great soldier Maurice, which gave the name to the place. It was
situate on a rocky island in a large lake near Eisenberg, a few
miles outside Dresden.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus, who shared to the full the fashionable
conception that there was no nobler passion for a prince than
that of building, had already begun to adorn the island and the
castle with every resource of wealth, art and taste.</p>

<p>During the summer, which had now ended for Aurora von
Königsmarck in the remote and ancient city of Goslar, she had
been the heroine of fairy-tale magnificence in the romantic
island that was adorned with statues, fountains, grottoes and all
the attractive artificialities of the baroque age, as expressed
by Poppelmann, the Elector's architect.</p>

<p>There were gorgeous hunting parties in the near-by forest,
dainty masques of Amazons and shepherds under the trees in their
full summer foliage, glidings over the lake in agreeable
gondolas, curious pantomimes of Turks and monsters, and at the
conclusion of these diversions, apartments of peculiar richness
in the hunting-box were provided for the Swedish beauty, who
reclined upon a bed of yellow damask adorned with silver Cupids
clasping roses. Here the Elector, on his knees, presented her
with a nosegay of jewels and declared himself her languishing
slave.</p>

<p>In short, the affair was conducted with the greatest elegance
and very much in the manner of the French fairy-tales by Charles
Perrault and Madame d'Aulnoy, then so fashionable. And the
surrender of Aurora was conducted with a dignity and a meekness
that amounted to decorum.</p>

<p>Certainly, so far there had been nothing scandalous or sordid
about the affair. Aurora received more than the usual tenderness
lavished on Royal favourites and had even contrived by tact and
charm to win the sufferance of the young Electress, Princess
Eberhardina of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, who had proved herself not
altogether divorced from the affections of her charming husband
by giving him an heir a few weeks before the birth of Aurora's
son in Goslar.</p>

<p class="first">These were the memories of Aurora von
Königsmarck as she lay in her weakness and loneliness in the
obscure comfort of the merchant's house in the remote old city in
the Hartz Mountains.</p>

<p>She knew what to call the child; the Elector had no intention
of disavowing his son, and he was to be named Maurice, after the
stout old warrior who had built the shooting-box on the isle near
Eisenberg.</p>

<p>The future looked less agreeable and certainly less stable
than the past had been. Aurora had nothing but promises, and she
knew what the promises of a prince and a man like Frederick
Augustus were worth. She could hardly hope to retain her
ascendance over him; for all his frivolous pastimes and romantic
love-affairs and fairy-tale like entertainments, she knew well
enough that he had a fund of obstinacy, selfishness and lazy
vanity that it would be almost impossible for her keen wit to
control; the young man was also spoilt by too much power, too
much splendour, too much adulation&mdash;impossible material for
any woman to handle to her own profit.</p>

<p>At present this fickle prince was out of her reach; he had
gone to Belgrade to take command of the army of the Emperor in
Hungary. There he would be the guest of Joseph, King of the
Romans and heir to the Imperial throne, and Aurora suspected that
it was more likely than not that when he returned to Dresden he
would have a new favourite in his train.</p>

<p>She had reason to smile a little cynically at the result of
her mission to the Elector of Saxony. She had not obtained the
fortune of her dead, her probably murdered, brother, but as much
money as Philip von Königsmarck could have left behind in the
hands of the Hamburg merchants had been spent on her
entertainment at Moritzburg. While, if her brother had not been
returned to her, if she had not even any inkling of his fate, the
Elector had given her a son who might very well be another Philip
von Königsmarck, seeing that he should inherit beauty, strength,
courage and dubious fortune from two famous families.</p>

<p>Aurora had no voice in the destiny of this child; the
Elector's commands were obeyed and the sturdy infant, having no
other name but Maurice, was taken at his father's orders by the
wet nurse and the attendants to Hamburg. And thus a fortnight
after the birth of her son Aurora was again alone.</p>

<p>She was slow in gaining her strength, and this considerably
depressed her spirits. Her sumptuous and fickle lover was out of
her reach, for ever as she might reasonably fear, and her own
destiny and that of her son were equally dubious.</p>

<p>The winter was well advanced and she still remained in
seclusion in Goslar, living a dull life that might have seemed
one of penance for the frivolous and wanton pleasures that had
preceded this monotonous seclusion.</p>

<p>But Aurora was not penitent nor even conscious of wrong-doing.
In the corrupt, hurried and adventurous world in which she lived
her life appeared not virtuous only, but almost correct. She had
never had any lover besides the Elector, and she had won the
sufferance, almost the friendship, of the Elector's wife.</p>

<p>Not shame, therefore, but worldly cares, absorbed Aurora von
Königsmarck. Her financial affairs were in great confusion and
Frederick Augustus, for all his lavishness, was hardly the man to
set them right.</p>

<p>But he did not entirely fail her; her worst doubts were set at
ease, before the mountain roads became impassable, by the return
of the handsome, discreet equipage from Dresden and a letter from
the Elector; after some delay she was given the position of
coadjutress of the Protestant Abbey of Quedlinburg, an almost
regal fief and one that brought with it privileges that had
remained unabated since before the Reformation. Quedlinburg had
also sufficient revenue to maintain Aurora with decorum and
dignity, and to it the Elector added a pension that would provide
the means of educating Maurice as the Prince he might have
been.</p>

<p>There was, however, no invitation to Aurora to return to
Dresden. So she accepted the bounty offered her and left Goslar
for Quedlinburg, which was also situated in the Hartz Mountains;
it was understood that later she was to be made Abbess.</p>

<p>The gift was princely, the provision ample, if&mdash;and here
Aurora confessed to a doubt, perhaps even to a
suspicion&mdash;they were punctually paid. However, she had
higher hopes than Quedlinburg and even the resumption of her
love-affair with the Elector; and that was the recognition of her
Maurice as a son of Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>The town of Quedlinburg in the eastern Hartz Mountains was
larger than Goslar but had some of its ancient imperial
splendour, for it had once been a favourite residence of the
German Emperors of the Saxon line.</p>

<p>Aurora, again peering from the window of the discreet
carriage, saw another fortified town with walls, towers and moat,
and on the west the old Castle and Abbey Church that was to be
her fief and residence.</p>

<p>In the market-place was a stone figure of Roland, and an air
of romance and legend lingered over the old mountain town that
had been founded by Henry I, and had once been a fortified town
of the Hansa League.</p>

<p>Aurora saw that her residence as Abbess of Quedlinburg was the
Castle or Schloss rising from a lofty sandstone rock on the site,
an independent convent founded by Mathilda, mother of Otto the
Great, nearly a thousand years before Aurora von Königsmarck
found her refuge there.</p>

<p>The ancient retreat was lonely, if bleakly magnificent; it did
not seem to Aurora as in the same country as Moritzburg or
Dresden. It did, however, provide a dignified if melancholy
residence; but Aurora had never been a religious woman; she did
not appreciate the proximity of the Church, which was over a
large burial vault where the sandstone had preserved the bodies
of former Abbesses from decay.</p>

<p>The buildings had recently been modernised and they were
commodious and comfortable if not of much splendour.</p>

<p>The first part of Aurora von Königsmarck's residence there was
marked by a long and painful illness. The beauty, the gaiety, and
the high spirits that had captivated Frederick Augustus at
Moritzburg were gone for ever; she realised with poignant dismay
that she was a sick and feeble woman, her grace and beauty
diminished, her spirits sunk.</p>

<p>Her courage was not daunted, and when the Elector returned
from the Eastern Campaign Aurora von Königsmarck went to Dresden
and presented herself before the hero of the Moritzburg idyll as
the mother of his son.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus was never anything but gracious and
charming towards women; but Aurora was fine enough to observe at
once that she had lost all favour with him and that he even
regarded her with repugnance. To one of his sensuous temperament
sickness was repellent. The physical aspects of Aurora's ill-
health filled him with disgust. Besides, he had brought with him
from Belgrade a lady whose singing had captivated him during a
banquet given by the King of the Romans, at which she had
performed, clad in nothing but gauze and roses.</p>

<p>The concern of the voluptuous Prince, therefore, was to free
himself from Aurora von Königsmarck as quickly and easily as
possible; and also, as the unfortunate lady soon discovered,
cheaply. She had the truth when she suspected that the revenues
from Quedlinburg and the pension for Maurice were most
irregularly paid. Neither Frederick Augustus nor his Ministers
offered her any help in gathering together her own fortunes, the
remnants of the properties still held by the Hamburg bankers who
demanded proof of the death of Philip, or of the Königsmarcks
scattered all over a Europe then at war.</p>

<p>In spite of these disappointments Aurora behaved herself with
dignity, and not without irony put her own grief in the
background to condole with the slighted Electress, faced once
more with the open infidelity of her husband; sight of the young
Prince Augustus, almost exactly the same age as her own Maurice,
was another incentive to Aurora to endeavour to secure the future
of her boy.</p>

<p>On this point the Elector was easy and prodigal of promises,
but impatient of any pressure for the performance of
them&mdash;Maurice should be educated as a Saxon, a prince, a
soldier, a good Lutheran too; his father, despite his gross
vices, was staunchly Protestant; and, in his own estimation,
religious. A tutor should be provided for the boy, in fact
everything that was his due should be given him. And with these
carelessly given assurances Aurora had to be content and return
to Quedlinburg as soon as she had been confirmed in her
appointment as Abbess in 1702.</p>

<p>This was a splendid, if somewhat remote retreat, and Aurora's
anxiety was gilded with dignity.</p>

<p>As a secular Abbess of the Protestant Convent, she enjoyed a
position of some distinction and a residence comprising more
apartments than she could well furnish or staff. But these cool
courtyards and cloisters, these quiet chambers, were fitted more
to be the background for philosophical discussions or religious
meditations than for such thoughts and schemes as agitated the
new Abbess.</p>

<p>Distracted by worldly anxieties, the forlorn woman could
scarcely have found consolation or entertainment in the
loneliness of the old towered, moated town, from the terrace of
her residence, nor in the ancient mortuary chapel containing the
royal tombs deep in the sandstone rock, nor in the Treasury that
contained such curios as the beard combs of Henry I and one of
the water-pots that had served at the marriage feast at Cana.</p>

<p>Mountains, basilicas and convents dating from days of imperial
splendour bounded the horizon of Aurora von Königsmarck, when she
gazed from the windows of the Schloss or paced the walks that
gave so wide a prospect of the romantic, haunted scenery of the
eastern Hartz mountains, but her inner vision was circumscribed
by nervous calculations that had nothing to do with natural
splendour or ancient glories.</p>

<p>Fear, anxiety and distress had formed her portion, since,
banished to the remote town in the Vorhartz, she had given birth
to the son of a gay, licentious and fickle prince. The dark
wooded ravines of Germany's northernmost mountains, these cold
peaks and deep-sunk mines where fabled dwarfs worked at the task
of picking precious metals from granite and sandstone, shut the
nymph of Moritzburg away from all that had formed her life, her
ambitions, her hopes.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck was dismayed but not daunted; her task
had changed. She had now given up hope of rousing the courts of
Europe into enquiring into the fate of her beloved brother, the
charming and brilliant Philip. This dark and sordid tragedy
would, she now realised, remain for ever obscure, shut away from
the knowledge of men, as was Sophia Dorothea in her dreary
provincial castle, where her sole occupation was to dream of her
romantic youth.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck's object now was to see that her son
had some assured place in the world. She preserved an affection,
where a tenderness had taken the place of passion, for Frederick
Augustus. The young Elector of Saxony had something beyond and
beside his obvious attraction as a Prince, a handsome youth, an
athlete, a gracious nobleman, something more than the obvious
seduction of the dominant male, crowned and adorned with all
worldly attractions set off by a court, a gorgeous background,
authority and pageantry. Beneath all this gilded show the young
Saxon Prince was a pleasant fellow and one, as the sensitive
Aurora soon suspected, not well armoured against Fate. He was one
to blaze when the luck was in, but to dim when the luck was
out.</p>

<p>For her son, who had been taken from her when he was aged
fifteen days, Aurora could have no personal affection, but he was
all that was left to her in the way of human relationship save
her sister, to whom she was not greatly attached. There was now a
male survivor of that family of Königsmarck of which she had been
so passionately proud. Her two brothers had died unmarried and
childless, and she herself had little prospect of and little wish
for marriage or other children.</p>

<p>There remained Maurice, and she had resolved from the first
that he was not to be merely another of the nameless bastards of
a careless prince. She had her claims and she enforced them.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus, always good-natured when his interests
were not crossed, was willing to admit that Aurora of the
Moritzburg festival had been a high-born maiden, delicate and
pure, not merely a tawdry mistress to be taken up, caressed, and
cast down. The Elector, therefore, was prodigal of both promises
and expenses; another charge on his treasury was but little to
him and Aurora had no difficulty in obtaining assurances that her
son should be as handsomely educated as the young Prince
Electoral, heir to Saxony, who had been born within a few weeks
of her own confinement at Goslar.</p>

<p>Moreover, Frederick Augustus was inclined to eye Aurora's
child with favour, even with a touch of Nordic sentimentality.
Had not the gallant Philip von Königsmarck been of his own
acquaintance? Might the world not see in this robust infant the
resurrection of the lost gallant, a true heir, not only to the
famous Moritz of Saxony but to the formidable Otto von
Königsmarck? The easy Elector saw no difficulties in the
situation, but Aurora had her own private bitterness. She had
hoped, perhaps, that her wit, her dignity, and what passed in
that age for her goodness of heart and elevation of soul would
have made a lasting impression upon her only lover. She had to
discover that he had merely desired her for the beauty and charm
that had vanished with her health. On the boy, then, she
concentrated all her ambition and all her art. But it was not
considered expedient that she should live with her son; the
curious decorum of the period, while recognising and condoning
the fault, would not have it openly acknowledged; the Abbess of
Quedlinburg could only supervise her son's education from a
distance.</p>

<p>This she did thoroughly, keeping up a careful correspondence
with the tutors who were set over the child as soon as he was
four or five years of age.</p>

<p>The first was a M. Lorne, a Saxon gentleman who was well
qualified for his post. He was soon joined by a M. d'Alençon, a
Frenchman, brother of an officer garrisoned at Dresden; Aurora
von Königsmarck had insisted on a French preceptor; French was
the language of princes as well as the political tongue of
Europe.</p>

<p>The Abbess of Quedlinburg passed the next few years in
continual anxiety, frequently leaving her retreat in the Hartz
Mountains for visits to Dresden, to Leipzig, to Hamburg, to all
the places where her funds or the funds of the Königsmarcks were
invested, trying with what feminine dexterity she possessed to
put some order into affairs, petitioning with delicacy and pride
the Elector to pay the arrears of her revenues and the pension,
with which to educate his son.</p>

<p>The forlorn woman made some attempt to regain at least the
friendship of her former lover, but though his attitude was
always generous she could not mistake the repulsion he showed
towards her faded person or ignore the succession of favourites
who occupied his time if not his heart. She was sent, in 1703, on
a mission to Charles XII who refused to see her, leaving her the
chance of saying that she was the only person on whom he had
turned his back.</p>

<p>Maurice received a princely education in the literal sense of
the word. He was taught what it was considered useful for a
prince to know&mdash;his native language and French, geography,
the use of the globes, celestial and terrestrial, the names of
the principal towns of Europe, and the names, titles, genealogy
of the Princes of Europe. He was instructed in all the matters
that his tutors considered suitable for one of his
rank&mdash;fables and stories, founded, at least, upon history,
of great men who had achieved great actions, of warriors and
leaders who had covered themselves with glory. He learnt some of
the heroic speeches put by Racine in the mouths of his lofty and
impossible characters.</p>

<p>The boy's sports were also princely, that is to say, he
learned to ride, to fence, to dance. As he was healthy, strong,
eager to excel and had the best of teachers he soon became
proficient in all these exercises. He had occupations of his own,
equally satisfying to his governors who saw in them traces of his
famous ancestors.</p>

<p>He loved to dominate his small companions, and as his lessons
and the talk of his teachers were always of war and heroics, it
was at war and heroics that the child played, always seizing, by
right both of his rank and of his strength, the place of leader
in these rough games, and engaging in realistic combats from
which he usually emerged with his clothes torn, his face
scratched and bruised, his temper excited to fury.</p>

<p>The spiritual and sentimental sides of his education were not
neglected. As soon as he could understand anything, he was told
that he was Count Maurice, son of the Elector, Frederick
Augustus. He also understood that his mother was not the
Electress, but Aurora von Königsmarck, the tender Abbess of
Quedlinburg who wrote to him so frequently and with such
exquisite interest in his welfare, and whom he addressed as "Ma
chère Cadan."</p>

<p>To encourage his softer feelings he was presented with a
medallion, on one side of which was painted, in the finest style
of the miniaturist's art, the delicate features of Aurora, as
they had been when she was at the height of her charms, with
roses and pearls in her silky blonde locks, and on the other the
robust, comely features of Frederick Augustus, crowned with the
lustrous curls of a monstrous periwig.</p>

<p>The child was taught that there was something very noble in
such parentage and that he might hope to receive great benefits
as well as to inherit remarkable gifts from the splendid Prince
who had conceived him.</p>

<p>It could not be disguised from a worldly child of ten years of
age, that the baton-sinister on the arms of Saxony had a
decidedly unfortunate meaning, and Maurice had very early his
fits of gloom and dissatisfaction with his destiny.</p>

<p>He never saw this father of whom he was told to be so proud,
and but seldom and for brief visits his affectionate and anxious
mother.</p>

<p>Of home life he had none and the women in his existence were
confined to his laundress, his chambermaid and his cook.</p>

<p>Yet the Elector was not wholly indifferent to his promising
son. He received with some complacency the flattering reports of
the governors who wrote in this tone of their lively young pupil:
"His glance is bold, his face handsome, his forehead high, his
walk is like that of the Elector. His ear is very good and when
he hears music he beats the time quite correctly. This shows a
good character. He has given proof of taste and of tact..."</p>

<p>And as if these were not sufficient virtues for a child of
seven years of age (as he was when this was written), the tutors
added that the young Maurice had a gentle temperament, thought
much of honour, spoke well and easily, had a keen observation,
was frank, loyal and affectionate though occasionally given to
melancholia.</p>

<p>This brilliant boy was kept well informed of the history of
Europe in as far as this consisted of the exploits of kings and
princes. He had been born in the year before that which, by the
signing of the Peace of Ryswick had given a brief peace to a
Europe that had been for so long distracted by wars of
aggression, ambition and self-defence.</p>

<p>That year, 1697, had been of great importance to Frederick
Augustus; Elector of Saxony since 1691, he had joined the Allies
against the French but, refusing to serve under Louis of Baden on
the Rhine, had been sent by the Imperial Court of Vienna against
the Turks to assist in that siege of Belgrade that had occupied
him when Maurice was born.</p>

<p>John Sobieski had died, and the throne of Poland had thus
become vacant; the Kings of Poland were elected by the Diet,
therefore the throne went to the highest bidder. The prize had
attracted and dazzled Frederick Augustus. After a year's
strenuous intrigues and expenditure of millions of ducats of
Saxon treasure in Warsaw, where he had to compete with the French
claimant, the brilliant and amiable François Louis, Prince de
Conti, the Saxon Prince had been elected King of Poland. He had
been helped not only by the treasures of his ancestors and by the
skill of his emissary, Count Flemming, but by the powerful aid of
Peter the Great, Czar of all the Russias, who saw in him a useful
puppet, perhaps a cat's paw.</p>

<p>There had been spiritual as well as material sacrifices to be
made; the Elector, hereditary champion of Lutheranism in Germany,
had forsworn the Protestant faith and made public confession of
Romanism at Baden on Whit-Sunday 1697.</p>

<p>The Polish adventure proved altogether unfortunate for
Frederick Augustus. It revealed what might never have been
discovered had he remained a German prince, that he was
incompetent, lazy in everything save backstairs intrigues and the
frivolous pastimes of a corrupt society.</p>

<p>The Saxon King's physical gifts, his notable strength, his
brave appearance and fashionable attire, though he nearly fainted
with shame at the costume he was forced to wear at his
coronation, pleased the Poles at first.</p>

<p>That he was incapable of exercising any of the arts of
government, and had no Ministers to supply the deficiency would
have proved perhaps defects not greatly troublesome to his new
subjects, for the Poles were used to chaos and even anarchy in
their affairs, and, for his part, Frederick Augustus asked for
nothing better than to be allowed to live his amiable, opulent
life of gracious leader of fashion and generous art patron. He
had already dignified Dresden with splendid buildings, adorned
and furnished in sumptuous taste; he was prepared to do the same
in Poland; he had a child's pleasure in his new dignity. It
sounded well to be termed the King Frederick Augustus, money was
plentiful and flatterers numerous.</p>

<p>The monarch was, however, soon involved, despite his own
inclination, in a war with Sweden, into which he was drawn as an
ally of the Czar, who had wrested south Poland from the Sultan. A
wanton and ill-considered attack on Sweden roused the young King
Charles XII. This sovereign, who had been despised on account of
both his youth and his inexperience by both Peter and Augustus,
proved, most unfortunately for both Czar and King, to be a
fanatic patriot and soldier endowed with military genius,
remarkable powers of endurance, and that ferocious enthusiasm
which inspires nations to perform seemingly impossible feats.</p>

<p>In the first year of the new century Charles of Sweden
advanced on the <i>Düna,</i> where he defeated the Polish and
Saxon armies and forced Frederick Augustus to abandon the
capital, Warsaw. After another defeat at Pultowa, Augustus
abandoned the kingdom that he had enjoyed only three years and
returned alarmed and discomfited to Dresden.</p>

<p>Charles XII, then the hero of the North and admired and feared
all over Europe, caused Stanislas Leczinski to be elected King of
Poland in July 1704. Augustus had taken an oath of abdication,
but still continued to call himself and consider himself King of
Poland; this barren title was all that he had obtained from
exhausting intrigues and the expenditure of nearly all his
immense fortune.</p>

<p>These were the particular affairs of Europe that occupied the
mind of Maurice until his tenth year. They had their practical
effect upon his own career; his tutors were forced to take him
from place to place as the tide of war flowed here and there; the
little party fled to Breslau, to Utrecht, to Leipzig, to The
Hague, where Maurice and his household resided in furnished
houses on such money as his distracted mother could contrive to
send for his support.</p>

<p>He naturally imbibed from those about him a keen hatred for
his father's enemies, who were incidentally causing him so much
humiliation and discomfort. In particular the child's fury was
directed against Charles XII and the Swedes and on one occasion
in Holland he attacked with his fists two strangers whom he saw
in the street and who were reported to him to be Swedish.</p>

<p>Dutch society was then one of the most opulent and elegant in
the world. The great King Stadtholder, William III of Orange, who
had been the linch-pin of the affiance against France that
Frederick Augustus had joined, had lately died, and his successor
to the British throne had appointed her most brilliant general
and statesman, John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, to be her
plenipotentiary at The Hague.</p>

<p>The stately Englishman with the classic features, weak eyes
and silken manners, resided in the beautiful house on the
Vyverberg, where another famous general, Count Maurice of Nassau,
had formerly lived.</p>

<p>Marlborough, who was a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire with
the title of Hindelheim, was Commander-in-Chief of the army of
the States General as well as Generalissimo of the British
forces, and his constant presence at The Hague gave a magnificent
lustre to the ancient, patrician and comely town.</p>

<p>Into the society, English, German and French, that made The
Hague brilliant, the exiled Saxon child was welcomed. Apart from
his royal birth (he was now a king's son), he was in himself
interesting and accomplished.</p>

<p>The boy had matured early in this exciting and stormy
atmosphere, the background of which was two wars&mdash;that of
the Polish succession, and that of the Spanish succession. The
whole of Europe was engaged in one or other of these incoherent
and miserable conflicts, and, placed as he was, Maurice could not
do other than long to engage himself in the ruinous struggles
that were represented to him as so heroic and splendid.</p>

<p>A struggle of another and more sordid kind occupied those
responsible for him; the harried Frederick Augustus ceased to
send supplies for his son's maintenance; Aurora von Königsmarck
had to take the costs of his poor establishment on to her own
shoulders. The distraction of the Polish war had ended her hopes
of settling her own affairs. Neither the revenues of Quedlinburg
nor her private pension was paid. She had to humiliate herself by
continual solicitations of her one-time lover. Augustus II had
other things to think of than paying the three thousand dollars
he had promised for the education of his illegitimate son, fruit
of a chance intrigue by now forgotten.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck, like many another heroine of romance,
parted with her jewels; those glittering souvenirs of her youth,
of the days at Moritzburg went one by one into the hands of the
Jews of Hamburg and Leipzig. When she had no more treasures to
pawn she ventured once more to approach the court of Dresden for
means whereby to redeem these pledges of a long-dead love, as she
continued to call the Moritzburg episode. She did not receive any
reply. General Count Flemming was the Minister of Frederick
Augustus and her enemy; James Henry, Count and Field-Marshal,
came of a noble Pomeranian family; his uncle, Heine Henry, had
distinguished himself in the Saxon service, and Count Flemming
had been early in the confidence of Frederic Augustus. Shrewd,
able, extremely industrious at business and magnificent in
pleasure, it was largely to the address and exertions of Flemming
that his master owed the Crown of Poland. For, as emissary of
Saxony in Warsaw, he had outbidden and outfaced the Abbe de
Polignac, who represented the Prince de Conti, at every turn.</p>

<p>Maurice and his tutors were meanwhile reduced in their
expensive Dutch hotel to a strict economy, often to little more
than bread or soup; de Lorne and d'Alençon at last left their
unpaid and troublesome charge and were succeeded by a Dutch
officer, M. Stoterogen.</p>

<p>Maurice began to show qualities that were very out of place in
his dubious and miserable condition of life. Apart from wild
pranks, an ardour for street fights and for duck-shooting on the
Dutch meres, which showed the brutal, dominating side of his
character, he began to discover a great love of finery and of all
kinds of extravagances, of everything that glittered or glowed.
And though he thought nothing of tearing to pieces in some mimic
battle the clothes that his tutor found it so difficult to
procure, one of his greatest pleasures was to hang round his neck
the handsome diamond that in happier times his father had sent
him and that he refused to sell or pawn.</p>

<p>With the opening of the campaign in 1708 the incoherent
fortunes of Augustus II took on a brighter turn. Sweden and
Russia held each other's attention and the King-Elector, as he
still termed himself, entered into a treaty with the Allies,
which seemed to promise a return of some of his lost prestige and
honour.</p>

<p>While the armies of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough
were moving towards Oudenarde and Lille and the stout Saxon
troops were marching towards the Rhine, Augustus sent to M.
Crasmar, then Maurice's tutor (he succeeded M. Stoterogen), and
asked him to bring the boy to Dresden.</p>

<p>The harassed monarch's languid interest in this child of a
long-forgotten idyll was heightened when he considered the robust
lad before him, full of ardour, zeal and eagerness.</p>

<p>Maurice was then in his twelfth year, exceptionally tall,
robust and well-made. Handsome he was not, save on the lips of
flatterers. A neck and shoulders already massive supported a
heavy-jowled head, as compact in the skull and as narrow in the
temples as the Farnese Hercules. The nose was short and thick,
the eyes prominent and double-lidded, the brows straight and
heavy, the upper lip was too long and too straight, the lower lip
protruding above the heavy jaw lent a ferocious expression of
pugnacity. A high forehead gave an air of candour and sparkling,
lively eyes, intelligence and vivacity to the child's rather
brutal physiognomy. Moreover, the mouth had a humorous if self-
confident curl.</p>

<p>Augustus II (the title commonly used by the King-Elector) was
weary and disillusioned by the reversal of his fortunes, but he
had learnt nothing from the chain of circumstances that had
exposed his incompetence to Europe; he took no blame to himself
and could not see his own mistakes. He brightened, therefore, at
the sight of his son, in whom he thought he saw another
self&mdash;most of all he was pleased at the boy's physical
strength&mdash;a young giant, one who ought to be able to perform
prodigies of valour and endurance!</p>

<p>The faded man examined the eager boy on conventional lines and
the well-trained lad had all his answers pat. He knew what a
prince of the type of his father meant by the words "Honour,
glory, courage."</p>

<p>Maurice was eager to be a soldier; in all sincerity he longed
for all the trophies and rewards that might fall to the lot of a
Eugene or a Marlborough.</p>

<p>Augustus II patted the ardent youngster on the back and sent
for General von Schulenburg. Maurice showed lively satisfaction
at the sound of this name; it was that of one of the best
soldiers of the day, the worthy antagonist of Charles XII, the
future saviour of Venice, the companion-in-arms of Prince
Eugene.</p>

<p>Johann Mathias, Count von Schulenburg, was a mercenary soldier
of the better type, a man something after the same mould as his
fellow-countryman, Marshal von Schomberg, so warmly described by
admiring Protestants as eminent for virtues, polished manner and
bravery.</p>

<p>Count von Schulenburg had began his military career in the
Danish service and had since fought under John Sobieski in
Poland, then from 1704 he had been in command, nominally under
Frederick Augustus, of the Saxon troops; assisting Russia against
Sweden, his present position was that of commander of an army of
nearly 10,000 Poles in the service of the States-General. He was
approaching his fiftieth year, ten years older than the King-
Elector, a man of grave presence, austere manners, refinement and
intelligence, all of which admirable attributes might appear
strange in a man who was little better than a soldier who hired
out his sword. But men like von Schulenburg were not uncommon in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The young Maurice was delighted at being put in the charge of
such a famous and applauded general and, if possible, still more
delighted at being freed for ever as he believed from the
jurisdiction of a tutor or governor. In the midst of the
excitement attendant on his preparation for departure he found
time, however, to write to his mother the joyous news that the
King had ordered Count von Schulenburg to take him to the
camp&mdash;the scene of war. Maurice was equipped with a Saxon
uniform, high boots, full-skirted coat, sash, sword and periwig
and again brought before his Majesty; Augustus II received him
with complacency and invited him to his table, where he
entertained his officers and where he watched with genuine
satisfaction his twelve-year-old son drinking heavily. The boy
would make a good soldier if well trained, the easy father
decided; he could already swagger, tipple, boast and he had a
torso like a young bull.</p>

<p>Von Schulenburg was given his instructions, Maurice the brief
command:</p>

<p>"To test how hardy you are, you must walk on foot to
Flanders."</p>

<p>Maurice knew what this meant; he was being given a commission
in the infantry. He summoned up the courage to stammer out his
request for a pair of colours in that infinitely more attractive
branch of the army&mdash;the cavalry.</p>

<p>Augustus II disdained to answer this presumptuous request and
addressing Schulenburg, bade him see that the young
soldier&mdash;"whose shoulders are certainly broad enough," added
the King drily&mdash;carried all his own equipment during the
march. Neither through favour nor through bribery was he to avoid
any of the more arduous duties of the only career fit for the son
of a King.</p>

<p>Augustus II then parted from his son without any word of
advice, favour or comfort. He had examined the tutor as to the
progress Maurice had made in his studies. M. Crasmar had
dutifully repeated his orthodox phrases of the gay, fierce,
robust young giant. No matters of sentiment or piety were raised
between father and son. Maurice had been trained as a Lutheran,
but his father had not asked him about the state of his soul; the
subject was a delicate one. Maurice had been strictly bred in a
hereditary and prized faith, and the spectacle of his father's
abjuring that faith for the sake of a crown might have been
likely to encourage native cynicism in the soul of one who seemed
a born materialist. The boy's thoughts were wholly of this world
at least when he took his place beside von Schulenburg in the
berline for the seat of war.</p>

<p>That well-trained soldier, however, gave him good advice,
according to his own experience and his own code, but the boy's
thoughts were more occupied with the handsome equipage, a present
from the King, which met him at Leipzig.</p>

<p>Four saddle horses, a carriage, a dozen baggage mules,
servants, and a major-domo who appeared after all to be nothing
but a tutor under another name. Maurice grimaced at this threat
of control, but recovered his spirits when on the plain of Lutzen
he was received into the Saxon army with the rank of Ensign and
given a pair of Saxon colours.</p>

<p>The Count von Schulenburg tried to improve the impressive
occasion by drawing the lad aside after the excitement of the
review and showing him the tomb of the great Lion of the
North&mdash;Gustavus Adolphus&mdash;predecessor of that Swedish
king who had been Frederick Augustus's most dangerous enemy. The
professional soldier who had passed his life among scenes of
anarchy, chaos, and misery had preserved some ideals. He advised
the young Ensign to be as severe, as just, as gentle as had been
Gustavus Adolphus. For the rest, he was to practise absolute
obedience to his military superiors, to be always and to all
people unwaveringly courteous.</p>

<p>"This," emphasised the Count, "will be an indestructible
foundation of your power&mdash;through that you will dominate
men."</p>

<p>He added that the other qualities necessary for a successful
career would reveal themselves to Maurice "as the presents of
Nature or the fruits of experience."</p>

<p>This exciting day was concluded with a banquet given by the
officers of the regiment to the son of their King, where the wine
was abundant, the talk free and the air one of lusty bravado.</p>

<p>Maurice had no sleep that night; as soon as the banquet was
ended the camp broke up; it was January and piercingly cold. The
road towards Flanders was covered with frozen snow, a wind like a
razor cleared the fumes of the merrymaking from the heads of the
Saxons.</p>

<p>The regiment to which Maurice was attached was in the First
Battalion; he took his place with the Colonel, M. Preuss, and the
other officers. For the first few miles of the hard bleak way the
boy marched easily, when he began to droop with fatigue the
Colonel helped him by placing at the head of the column a bagpipe
player and some soldiers who sang marching tunes. However, the
severe cold, the rough road, the weight of the bayonet on his
shoulders, his blistered feet in the harsh boots began at last to
tell even on the stout frame of Maurice. He stumbled and sagged
at the side of the Colonel. But when a horse was brought up he
refused to take advantage of the preference accorded to him
because of his age and rank and continued to march with the
infantry across the snowy, sombre landscape towards Flanders,
then already for long the cockpit of Europe.</p>

<p>Count von Schulenburg's army made a junction with that of the
Allies commanded by Prince Eugene of Savoy and the Duke of
Marlborough, whose haggard, beautiful face with the narrowed
short-sighted eyes and misleading expression of lofty nobility
was familiar to Maurice from his childish days in The Hague.</p>

<p>Lille, a citadel of considerable importance with a garrison
commanded by Maréchal de Boufflers, was the objective of the
Allies. Warfare then consisted mainly in taking and re-taking
forts and cities; very little else was regarded. An entire
campaign would turn on the siege of one citadel, the actual
possession of which made perhaps little difference to the issue
of the war. Most of the great battles of the period were fought
for the possession of one of these coveted cities.</p>

<p>The country that Maurice saw about him when with curious and
eager eyes he observed the Allied troops making trenches before
the elaborate fortifications of Lille had been devastated by a
long war, broken only by a few years respite after the Treaty of
Ryswick.</p>

<p>This war had commenced with the aggression of Louis XIV in
1672, when, eager to use the magnificent and efficient army that
Louvois had created and to spend the money that Colbert had
raised by economy and talent, he entered upon a brutal and
senseless war of aggression with the United Provinces. Roused,
once and forever, by this invasion, without provocation or
excuse, of the Netherlands, William of Orange had patiently,
throughout years of disappointment and fatigue, knit together the
great Alliance that, constantly augmented and renewed, now, after
its originator's death, faced the decaying forces of France who
no longer had a Turenne or a Luxemburg to lead them.</p>

<p>Louis XIV was still on the throne of the Bourbons, but he was
old, disappointed, feeble, almost bankrupt, his country
exhausted, his finances in a desperate state. Already the rumour
was going round the garrison of Lille, and other French
strongholds in Flanders, that the King had begun negotiations for
a peace&mdash;one more humiliating in its terms for France than
had been Ryswick, one perhaps that the aged monarch would not
find so easy to flout.</p>

<p>The French, however, arrogant, overbearing and vainglorious in
the intoxicating splendour of their long-drawn out triumph,
showed finer qualities in the time of their defeat. The
inexhaustible and unconquerable spirit of the nation showed in
the large number of volunteers, who strengthened the thin ranks
of the regular soldiers serving under the Maréchal de Villars,
who attacked Eugene and Marlborough when they advanced towards
Malplaquet after the capture of Lille.</p>

<p>This battle proved a victory for the Allies, but the highly
prized quality, glory, was allowed to rest more on the side of
the vanquished. The French under Villars made a brilliant retreat
and took with them more colours than they had lost. They had
fought at a disadvantage, having been without food or sleep for
twenty-four hours, and numbered 80,000 against the 120,000 of the
Allies.</p>

<p>Boufflers was able to write the pompous phrase that was not
untruthful: "Sire, never has a misfortune been accompanied with
more glory."</p>

<p>Maurice was in the midst of this battle with his line of Saxon
infantry. He smelt the smoke, saw the balls and bombs, the dead,
the dying, heard the groans of man and horse. The boy of 13 was
neither alarmed nor squeamish; timidity and delicacy were not in
his composition.</p>

<p>The battle went according to tradition: it was one of the
lessons of his history books come alive. The charging cavalry,
the less dashing advance of the infantry, the dragging up and
discharging of the artillery, hand-to-hand struggles for a pair
of colours, for victory, for life itself.</p>

<p>The bloody day over, he was complimented by his superior
officer on his courage and zeal. A good report should be sent to
his royal father.</p>

<p>The Saxon boy, in spite of bravado and flamboyant vanities,
was a born soldier and possessed magnificent personal courage. On
this day of hideous carnage he received the adulation of the
accomplished, brilliant Marlborough and the praise of the
intrepid and cool Eugene, both judges of warlike qualities,
though both perhaps prejudiced in favour of the son of Augustus
II.</p>

<p>Maurice had also already acquired a professional insensibility
that appeared brutality in one of his age. At the end of the
combat in which twenty thousand men were slaughtered and as many
wounded, a combat in a cause that was of no personal interest or
matter to him, he was able to exclaim with the unspoilt pleasure
in his achievement and the victory of his side that he was "well
content with the day's work."</p>

<p>Count von Schulenburg, tutor and mentor of the young Ensign,
marked him with great approval. Maurice was fortunate enough to
be of the right type, for his surroundings, his chosen profession
and the period in which he lived. These veterans admired the
fortitude with which this high-spirited and ambitious youth had
directed his attention to the profession of arms and to nothing
else since he had been in the cradle. They too in their young
days had derived no pleasure or profit from the studies directed
by pedantic scholars; they too had wilfully insisted on indulging
a love for kettle-drums, pistols, swords, horses, and marching
with youthful companions in the troops of soldiers.</p>

<p>Maurice was greatly applauded for his ignorance of everything
but manly exercise and the rudiments of the science of war.</p>

<p>The boy, too, possessed some of those qualities that made
Marlborough one of the most fascinating and successful men of his
age, something of that grace and tact, taste and generosity,
which exercised by Augustus II had made Dresden one of the most
luxurious courts in a luxurious Europe.</p>

<p>After Lille and Malplaquet, Count Maurice, as he termed
himself, might consider that he was a professional soldier. At 13
years of age he had been in the earthworks with the most famous,
glittering generals of the day, panting for his share in the
perils and glories of war, the pastime and opportunity of
princes; all those around him considered it but natural that the
attention of the high-spirited and ambitious youth should be
directed to military glory and nothing else.</p>

<p>There had been war in Europe in the lifetime of all men living
and in that of their fathers before them. For generations
professional soldiers of every rank and every nation had found
fame, power and wealth in quarrels with which they were little
concerned and in fighting for causes in which they had no
interest.</p>

<p>The balance of power in Europe and the ancient struggle
between France and the rest of Europe were still, when Maurice
trudged to Lille, being fought out in the long leisurely
campaigns that the people had begun to take for granted and that
the aristocracy undertook as if they were hunting parties and
that appeared as a usual occupation not lacking in gain or
excitement.</p>

<p>The tedium of this slow warfare was relieved by considerable
licence and loose conduct, by continual diversions of every kind,
by the lofty pleasure of personal encounter with the enemy and by
the hope of definite victories with their accompanying honours
and rewards.</p>

<p>All the armies were served with all the luxuries to be
obtained in the capitals of Europe, and at the first touch of
cold they went into winter quarters in the largest city
available, postponing the war and living in idleness until the
following spring.</p>

<p>It occurred to no one that these wars were futile and
wasteful; they were accepted as part of existence and absorbed a
vast number of men, many of whom would have detested any other
existence; men who were bred to and existed for war; men who
loved the camp, the march, the siege, and who were only uneasy at
the prospect of peace and only at a loss when away from the
theatre of action.</p>

<p>It was customary for all youths of noble birth to become
soldiers, and it was considered almost the only profession worthy
of the finest blood. It was then a matter of course that the
young Maurice, eagerly commanding in Flanders, should decide to
become a professional soldier and this without any thought of why
or when or for whom he should exercise his prowess.</p>

<p>The same might have been said of most of the generals of that
age; those who were fighting to keep their crowns on their heads
or their provinces together were the only captains fighting with
a sincere attachment to a cause. The others fought for the sake
of fighting and the possible rewards of possible success.</p>

<p>Maurice had neither crown nor land to contend for; apart from
the bounty of his father he possessed nothing and as the
illegitimate son of a king he knew that to himself only could he
look for the advancement his ambitious character so passionately
craved.</p>

<p>It was decided then by all who knew the lad that he was well
suited for the showy career he had chosen so early and so
definitely; moreover, it was noted with approval that he
distinguished himself not only in the exercise of arms but proved
equally apt in those jovial and tender distractions that have
always eased the warrior's labours, showing that he had inherited
the romantic and voluptuous nature of Augustus II together with
that monarch's robust constitution and admirable address.</p>

<p>It was noted, a pretty story runs, that when the Allies were
before Tournay the young Saxon, when dining in the tent of Prince
Eugene, was attracted by the budding beauty of a girl from
Tournay&mdash;one Rosetta Dubusan, who had come to the camp to
sell a head-dress of elaborate lace worked by her dead mother,
which constituted her sole dowry.</p>

<p>Neither Eugene nor Marlborough was remarkable for prodigality,
and the lace went unpurchased, but the young Comte de
Saxe&mdash;as his dubious title ran&mdash;followed the sweet
pedlar from the tent and recompensed her for her disappointment
by an accomplished tribute to her charm, for the son of Aurora
von Königsmarck already possessed the arts of a successful
lover.</p>

<p>The little maiden, who was his own age, was as innocently won
as wooed, and the idyll continued to the sound of Boufflers's
desperate fire and the fierce reply from the Allies'
trenches.</p>

<p>And when after the fall of the citadel the army retired to
Brussels, Maurice, like a seasoned soldier, enjoyed his leisure
with his little mistress, whom he now boldly snatched from the
guardianship of her father.</p>

<p>The little love-story continued throughout the campaign; when
they were separated tender letters in the true romantic and
sentimental style of the period were exchanged, for, although
children in years, the lovers were accomplished in all the ruses
and expedients of their voluptuous and corrupt world. Maurice
already knew how to contrive matters so that Rosetta could go
into decorous retreat in Brussels for the birth of his child,
just as his father had contrived that he should be born in the
respectable seclusion of Goslar.</p>

<p>The daughter of the young soldier and the little lace-maker
was named Julie and died a few months after her birth. Soon
after, the unfortunate Rosetta was enclosed in a convent by her
father, and neither Maurice nor anyone else ever heard anything
more of the first love of the hero who was to have so many
loves.</p>

<p>Despite the air of licence given to his career by this
episode, Maurice, in winter quarters in Brussels or in the camp
with Eugene and Marlborough was pursuing his studies under the
careful direction of Count von Schulenburg.</p>

<p>He learnt first military discipline; to rise at six o'clock to
the sound of the bugle, to spend half an hour upon a precise and
elaborate toilet, to say his prayers, to refresh himself at
regular intervals with cups of tea. The morning was given up to
studies&mdash;history, French, arithmetic, military science. Two
hours were allowed for the midday repast, then there were lessons
in dancing, fencing and horsemanship.</p>

<p>Von Schulenburg saw that an hour-glass was always on the desk
of Maurice so that he might mark how the precious time was
passing and that several moral maxims in French, Latin, and
German were always before his eyes, hanging on the wall above his
desk, in his tent, or his billet.</p>

<p>These moral sentences the young soldier learnt by heart and
repeated them to the Count every week.</p>

<p>He continued to be regarded favourably by the elegant
Marlborough, who called him "the youth who did not know what
danger was," and by the yellow-faced Eugene who, with less
geniality, rather drily warned him that foolhardiness was not the
same as courage.</p>

<p>Von Schulenburg's advice was loftier&mdash;"Avoid bad company.
Remember you are a man of honour. Honour the King and fear
God."</p>

<p>Amid all these excitements, Maurice had kept in touch with his
mother, who was again at the Court of Dresden, endeavouring to
attract the attention of Augustus II, for financial, not amorous
reasons. This monarch had returned to Warsaw after the battle of
Pultowa, the Pope having absolved him from his oath of
abdication. He might again call himself king, but it was only a
shadowy royalty he enjoyed; he was in reality the vassal of
Russia and left all business and all real power to his minister,
General Count Flemming, a bold and able man who had, however, a
reputation for ambition, cunning, avarice and parsimony. This
minister was the avowed enemy of Madame von Königsmarck, who had
endeavoured to undermine him with the King.</p>

<p>When she had an opportunity, and this was rare enough, of
speaking to Augustus II, she complained of the harsh exactions of
the unpopular minister, of the country's groaning under his taxes
and of the barbarous fashion in which he raised them.</p>

<p>She was not, perhaps, altogether disinterested, because it had
been Flemming's influence that had prevented her pension and that
of Maurice from being regularly paid. But whether her complaints
were just or no (and Flemming was considered by many a patriot
and an upright man), they made no impression on Augustus.</p>

<p>This prince was then in the prime of life but already weary in
mind and body, exhausted by excesses, disillusioned by
misfortune, bored, melancholy.</p>

<p>He spent his time in searching for diversions, frivolous,
gross or stupid, to amuse the vacant days that had become
insupportable. His charming good looks and his superb strength
had alike left him. His continued sensual indulgence had ruined
even his superb constitution; his face had become bloated, his
figure unwieldy. He viewed the world through the veil of disgust
produced by satiety in every vice, a ruined digestion and an
empty heart.</p>

<p>With such a man Aurora von Königsmarck, herself an invalid,
could do nothing. At last he refused even to see her, and when
Maurice reached Saxony his mother had been banished from Dresden
to Quedlinburg.</p>

<p>The King, however, received his son with some pleasure; an
exploit of personal bravery already adorned the young soldier's
rising fame.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Allies secured Tournay than they hurried to
reinforce Mons, threatened by Maréchal Villars. A large body of
horse under the Prince of Hesse-Cassel was dispatched for this
purpose and among his cavaliers was Maurice de Saxe already, at
13 years of age, an accomplished soldier who had had horses
killed under him and felt bullets whistle through his thick blond
hair.</p>

<p>He now crossed the river with a drawn sword in his hand and a
foot soldier sharing his saddle&mdash;the very picture of an
eighteenth-century Mars, one of those heroes with flying curls
and cravat, gold-laced coat and embroidered sash, whom the
baroque taste of the period represented on a thousand florid
canvases, crowned by a plump Venus and attended by simpering
nymphs.</p>

<p>This was the sort of action that Augustus II could understand
and admire. He entertained and feted his son and sent him to Riga
for the sole purpose of making the acquaintance of the great
Peter, Czar of all the Russias, and presented him with the
coveted Order of the White Eagle of Poland; his father raised his
rank to that of Aide-adjutant before he sent Maurice back to the
bloody field where Marlborough and his motley forces were still
engaged in the tedious task of battering down the stubborn pride
of France.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, Count Flemming had succeeded in
working upon the laziness and apathy of the King to cast Aurora
von Königsmarck into disgrace, which her son to a certain extent
shared.</p>

<p>Augustus II was too flexible and too easy to withstand the
importunities of his formidable Minister and Maurice found
himself for no good reason banished to Meissen. Neither this town
nor Quedlinburg, stately as they might be, spelt anything but
tedium for Maurice; he soon escaped from there and spent his
winters amid the elegant festivity of Dresden and his summers at
the camps, first, in Flanders, then, in Pomerania, where Augustus
II, as King of Poland, had been obliged by an old alliance to
march to the assistance of the Czar, then attacked by the Sultan
of Turkey at the instance of the indomitable Charles XII of
Sweden.</p>

<p>In this war Maurice displayed uncommon resolution and heroism
and his gratified father rewarded him by raising for him a troop
of horse. He eagerly accepted and drilled and exercised with a
delight that showed him to be no mere knight-errant but a
considerable commander with marked talents for organisation and
discipline. He preferred the choosing of men and horses, the
instructing of men and officers, to all the winter delights of
Dresden, and was impatient until he could rush his troops to
Bremen and test their mettle in the obstinate fight of Gabusch
where, however, despite the valiant young Colonel's efforts the
day was gained by the terrible Swedes.</p>

<p>The next occupation of young Maurice was to recruit his
beloved regiment that had suffered severely in this fierce
engagement, and this task, anxiously fulfilled, took him a year
during which he permitted himself no amusement but a few trifling
amorous adventures too transient to be called love-affairs and
too light to be called distractions.</p>

<p>In 1711, Augustus II had formally acknowledged him and given
him a small estate. In 1713 the peace of Utrecht put an end to
the war in Flanders; Maurice Comte de Saxe was 17 years old and
in every way come to full manhood.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck, now utterly out of favour in Dresden,
seeing that little or nothing was to be hoped for from the King-
Elector so completely under the influence of General Count
Flemming, and that Maurice's fortunes were more than ever dubious
now that there was no war in which he could earn wealth, power,
and distinction, looked about for a wealthy heiress for him to
marry.</p>

<p>She had achieved one great satisfaction, when two years
previously her son had been recognised by Augustus II and given,
if not royal rank and legitimate status, yet one raised above
that of mere casual bastardy.</p>

<p>He had also been presented by his father with the property of
Skoehlen, which represented six thousand <i>écus</i> of revenue;
Aurora was proud to know that he was entitled to call himself son
of a king&mdash;in truth Count Maurice of Saxony. But this seemed
the limit of his father's generosity; Aurora believed that
nothing more was to be obtained from that 'quarter, though
Maurice had distinguished himself fighting beside his father in
the East, where his cavalry regiment that he had commanded since
the age of sixteen years had done good service at the battle of
Stab.</p>

<p>A wealthy wife. That, in the opinion of Aurora von
Königsmarck, anxious and harassed as she was, was the only means
of consolidating the fortunes of the Comte de Saxe. She thought,
too, so little did she know her own son, that not only his
fortunes but his character might be greatly improved by
marriage.</p>

<p>She did not see much of him, but she kept in touch with his
movements and he did little that was not reported to her. She was
alarmed at his dissipation, his extravagance and his idleness. He
took no account at all of the smallness of his revenues, of the
paucity of his resources, but spent as royally as if he was
indeed a prince.</p>

<p>Disheartened by the peace that had meant the disbanding of his
beloved regiment to which he had given all his time and attention
(he recruited the men and selected the officers himself) the
young soldier was, at 17 years of age, disillusioned and
frustrated.</p>

<p>His sole hope of the active, authoritative life he desired lay
in the chance of another war. But for the moment, oddly enough,
there was no war, the Peace of Utrecht having brought some
measure of repose to Europe, while the strange and stormy figure
of Charles XII was no longer greatly troubling either the Czar or
the King-Elector.</p>

<p>"The Comte de Saxe," wrote Aurora sadly to a confidante, "is
fast sinking into a state where he will lose not only his manners
but his reputation. He can only live by means of loans and when
these come to an end he will be in a state of poverty and exposed
to all manner of unworthy temptations. What can the end be but
despair!"</p>

<p>If Aurora von Königsmarck had thought more deeply, she would
have seen that a marriage also could only end in despair, when
the bride had been selected solely for her wealth and when the
groom himself was 18 years of age, dissolute, headstrong,
reckless, already used to full liberty and the command of men,
quite unused to any aspect of family life and without any of the
gifts or virtues that might make domestic existence
supportable.</p>

<p>However, Aurora von Königsmarck's chief object was money.
Where could it be found, and how large a treasure might be
obtained by the bait of her son's birth, presence and
prospects?</p>

<p>Augustus II, daily sinking deeper into the lassitude produced
by physical exhaustion, took at first no interest in the
settlement of his son, and the drab intrigue fell to Aurora von
Königsmarck.</p>

<p>She selected as Maurice's bride an heiress named Johanna
Victoria, sole child of a provincial nobleman, Ferdinand Adolph
Loeben. This gentleman, though not of the highest rank, possessed
one of the largest and most fertile estates in Saxony, and though
his money at first came from the land, he had, by prudent loans
and investments, increased it, until it was a fortune that had
caused many ambitious matchmakers to cast longing eyes on the
young Johanna Victoria.</p>

<p>This young lady had soon been disposed of; when she was aged 8
years, in 1706, she had been betrothed to Comte Henry Frederick
de Friesen. While this gentleman was waiting for his betrothed to
become of marriageable age, the prize was snatched from him; M.
Loeben died and his widow married a M. Gersdorff, who seemed to
have espoused the mother in the hope of obtaining a hold on the
fortunes of the daughter.</p>

<p>This he soon succeeded in doing. The contract of M. Friesen
was broken under the excuse that the death of M. Loeben had made
it invalid and M. Gersdorff secured Johanna Victoria's fortune
for his own family by contracting her in 1707 to his nephew, the
Lieutenant Gersdorff.</p>

<p>A betrothal, however, was not considered sufficient safeguard,
for Comte de Friesen was pressing his claim to the coveted
heiress. Uncle and nephew, therefore, contrived an elopement. The
child was taken to Neuendorf in Silesia, married to the younger
Gersdorff secretly and swiftly, and then returned to her family.
She was then 10 years of age.</p>

<p>This affair caused a scandal in Saxony; the Gersdorffs had
overreached themselves. Comte de Friesen went to Augustus II with
his legitimate complaint.</p>

<p>The scandalous rapacity of all the parties concerned in this
affair was considered, even by the easy-going King-Elector,
somewhat of a disgrace to his court. No kind of gloss could be
put on the conduct of any of the parties who had arranged the
hurried, clandestine marriage of the child-heiress in
Silesia.</p>

<p>Augustus II kept the affair on the <i>tapis</i> for some time,
partly through indifference and laziness, partly because he did
not know how to decide the matter best for his own credit and
advantage.</p>

<p>At the same time Aurora von Königsmarck was plaguing him to
find an heiress for his son. Combining, therefore, honour with
profit, Augustus II commanded Madame Gersdorff to come to
Dresden.</p>

<p>He then roundly accused her of selling her daughter to her
second husband's nephew in order that the three of them might
divide the vast fortune.</p>

<p>It was in vain that the alarmed lady protested her good faith.
Augustus II deprived her of her maternal rights, her husband was
forbidden to interfere in the least in the affairs of the
heiress, and his nephew only escaped a severe punishment by
solemnly renouncing all claim to Johanna Victoria.</p>

<p>There remained Comte de Friesen with his lawful claim to
placate. The King-Elector gave him a handsome indemnity and sent
him about his business.</p>

<p>Then, after a short interval, which Johanna Victoria, taken
from her mother's care, spent in the charge of an easy court
lady&mdash;Madame Trützschler&mdash;Augustus II announced his
intention to give the lady who was now his ward, to his son,
Maurice, that vapouring, tiresome young hero.</p>

<p>For a lazy man His Majesty had taken a good deal of trouble
over this business and had reason to congratulate himself on the
intrigue that had silenced the maternal claims of Aurora von
Königsmarck, which were beginning to trouble him considerably,
eased him from the clamour of his son's creditors and secured one
of the largest fortunes in Saxony to the royal House.</p>

<p>There remained the task of persuading the two young people to
give at least a semblance of free will in their choice of each
other.</p>

<p>There was not much difficulty with Johanna Victoria. By the
time the complicated negotiations were concluded she was 14 years
of age and considered marriageable. Her governess and guardian,
Madame Trützschler, working in the interest of the King-Elector,
had not found much difficulty in dazzling the child with the
fame, the rank, the glory, the charm of the young Count
Maurice.</p>

<p>The young lady believed that she was quite old enough to know
her own mind and she enthusiastically agreed that here, in the
brilliant young soldier, was a better match than either Comte de
Friesen or M. Gersdorff.</p>

<p>It was not so easy to convince Maurice that the only way of
obtaining a fortune was to saddle himself with a wife. The very
thought of matrimony was odious to him; both by temperament and
by training he was a rover and adventurer, and it now began to
appear that he was also hard, without a trace of
sentiment&mdash;as the French say "<i>sans coeur.</i>" Aurora
might have thought these qualities valuable, since she had
suffered herself from too much sentimentality and tenderness, but
she was something appalled by the frank hedonism of her son.</p>

<p>The boy had grown up without affection, surrounded only by
efficient, indifferent people paid to do their duty towards him.
He had grown up, too, despite his protestations of loyalty to his
father and affection for his mother, with a seed of bitterness in
his proud heart. He could not forget that while his father was a
king and his mother came of one of the noblest and most famous
families in Europe, he was himself landless save for a miserable
estate that brought him in scarcely enough to pay his lackeys,
without prospects or hopes of ever attaining his royal position
that had secretly become his heart's desire.</p>

<p>When it was first suggested to him that he might marry Johanna
Victoria Loeben if the prize could be secured, he had shown
restlessness and an obstinate opposition to any marriage
whatsoever. The only attraction the lady possessed for him was
her name&mdash;Victoria.</p>

<p>"It would be a good omen," he said complacently, "to marry
Victory."</p>

<p>By this time the tedious affair had been finally arranged, the
desperate solicitations of Aurora had broken down her son's
obstinacy and he agreed to marry the heiress of M. Loeben.</p>

<p>As the King-Elector thought he might get some amusement, if
amusement was possible to his dulled satiety, as well as profit
out of the capture of the little Loeben heiress, fetes were
planned to celebrate the wedding of his son. And it was decided
that the background should be the royal hunting-box where Aurora
von Königsmarck had been so elegantly seduced nineteen years
previously.</p>

<p>The ill-advised, ill-conducted Polish adventure had nearly
emptied the Saxon treasury, which twenty years before had seemed
inexhaustible, but Augustus II was still able to provide a
sumptuous festival for the marriage of Maurice.</p>

<p>The park and the palace on the rocky island in the lake had
been, while Maurice was growing up, further embellished by the
rich and fantastic taste of Poppelmann, and Maurice's love of
display, if not his amorous passions, was satisfied with the
wedding whose background had a faint fairy-tale atmosphere; the
last lustre and glitter, dim enough and tarnished to the
perception of the sensitive, of that voluptuously romantic world
with which Mlle Scudéry had captured the tastes of Europe in
<i>Le Grand Cyrus.</i></p>

<p>So, a young Hercules in a horsehair wig and a flamboyant Saxon
uniform, the youth stood with his child bride before the altar
where they exchanged mutual vows according to the Lutheran
service, "to love one another as husband and wife in all honour
and all affection to the end of their days."</p>

<p>Johanna Victoria was an ordinary little person, at least, at
present, and no one would have taken the least notice of her, had
not her father chanced to be a very wealthy man.</p>

<p>She was, inevitably, owing to her bringing up, precocious,
self-important, pert, and vain, untrained in everything save a
sense of her own value. She had her own ambitions and her own
desires and she did not intend to give herself much trouble about
her young husband except in as far as he satisfied both ambitions
and desires.</p>

<p>Her immature charms and her provincial coquetry did not
fascinate Maurice. He accepted, almost with a condescending air,
her immense fortune, and noted as one of the most satisfactory
clauses of his marriage treaty that it acknowledged that he had
attained his majority.</p>

<p>Augustus II had indeed found it necessary to issue an edict
covering and excusing the tender ages of bride and groom by
declaring them both, she in her fifteenth and he in his
nineteenth year, as legally of age. This privilege was given, the
document ran, "in consideration of their good conduct."</p>

<p>The household of the young Comte de Saxe was set up with
prodigal, wasteful and tasteless extravagance. But easy as his
marriage was made, it was a galling condition for Maurice.</p>

<p>He stayed away from his wife as much as possible, spending the
summer hunting, the winter in sports on the frozen waters of the
Elbe, where his greatest delight was headlong and dangerous
sledge races.</p>

<p>Soon after the Peace of Utrecht Queen Anne died, and George
Louis, Elector of Hanover and husband of the Sophia Dorothea who
had been the lover of Philip von Königsmarck, was elected to the
throne of Great Britain despite an abortive attempt on the part
of the son of James II to regain the throne of the Stuarts.</p>

<p>Despite this Western Europe remained, to the disgust of
Maurice, sluggishly at peace, but there was excitement as usual
in the East and North.</p>

<p>And he soon received with undisguised delight a summons to
join his regiment in Pomerania, where the indomitable Swede,
Charles XII, having escaped from his long captivity with the
Turks, was again proving himself a thorn in the flanks of
Russia.</p>

<p>Maurice's early hatred of this hero had turned to an envious
admiration. He looked upon him as a man he was or might be
himself, and though the two soldiers had nothing in common save a
brutal courage and a passion for warfare, Maurice, in the
enthusiasm of his youth, regarded Charles as a demigod and as the
kind of demi-god he would like to be himself.</p>

<p>The young man's best chance lay indeed in achieving what the
world then called "glory"; he had no talents and no prospects in
any other direction.</p>

<p>Count Flemming remained his cool but bitter enemy, and the
marriage with Johanna Victoria had brought him nothing but money
that was fast slipping through his fingers. Of real friends he
had but few besides his mother, whose power was dependent on the
caprice of Augustus II, and his grandmother, a Danish Princess,
Ann Sophia, who had always quietly and, as it were, from the
background, done what she could for Aurora von Königsmarck and
her son.</p>

<p>Momentarily at least, Maurice now triumphed. Despite the
opposition of the powerful Minister he was allowed to raise his
regiment again and to depart with all the pomp of flags and
cavalry, drums and trumpets, to Pomerania.</p>

<p>The campaign did not lack opportunities for heroic exploits.
On one occasion he was besieged with a handful of men in a house
in Crachnitz by eight hundred of the enemy, and only escaped by
courage and stratagem, an exploit that was compared to that of
Charles XII at Bender. After defending the house until all his
ammunition was exhausted and without losing a single man, Maurice
made a sortie at night and brought off his little troop safe to
the Saxon lines with no other accident than a slight wound in his
knee.</p>

<p>Later in the campaign he was at the Isle of Usedom, fortified
and defended by Charles XII himself. He had a glimpse of this
almost fabulous hero as he sallied forth in the midst of his
Grenadiers to repel a Saxon assault.</p>

<p>When the rigours of winter made warfare impossible, Maurice
reluctantly returned with the other officers to Dresden.</p>

<p>Here he found fortune less flattering than it had been on the
field of battle. He certainly had enhanced his prestige and
acquired a good deal of brittle military glory. This, however,
had only served to irritate Count Flemming, and though it had a
little gratified Augustus II, the King-Elector was still
completely in the hands of his all-powerful Minister. For another
misfortune, the Electress-Dowager of Saxony had died, suddenly,
at Lichtenburg and Aurora was once more so unwelcome at court
that she had retired to Quedlinburg&mdash;permanently it
appeared.</p>

<p>The winter of 1715 saw another death in the family of Maurice,
one that affected him less than that of his grandmother. His
young wife had given birth to a child that lived even a shorter
time than his first-born, the offspring of poor Rosetta
Dubusan.</p>

<p>The young couple were already at variance; they had nothing in
common but their vices of laziness, extravagance and dissipation.
Maurice saw as little as possible of Victoria, who found means to
amuse herself with such of her large fortune as he allowed her to
handle.</p>

<p>A greater grief than either the loss of his grandmother or his
infant son was in store for him.</p>

<p>Augustus, edged on by Flemming, disbanded his regiment under
the excuse that it was a costly luxury. The young Colonel rushed
in a fury to upbraid his father and King and for the first time
used threatening words to his father, Augustus, declaring that he
would raise his regiment again "under his own authority and by
that maintain it, cost what it might."</p>

<p>"This tone," said the King-Elector, roused at last to anger,
"caused your mother to be sent to Quedlinburg."</p>

<p>To this remark the young man replied insolently that there
"were not enough Abbeys in Saxony to house in exile all the
discharged Colonels of cavalry."</p>

<p>Upon which his father reminded him that though it might not be
possible to send him to an Abbey, there was always the Castle of
Königstein, where the prisoners of state were detained and
sometimes punished by death.</p>

<p>Upon this Maurice thought good to beat a retreat to one of his
wife's estates near Dresden. He found neither peace nor happiness
there and a desperate letter to his mother imploring her to make
his peace with the King had some effect. Augustus permitted him
to return to Dresden and there was no more talk of
Königstein.</p>

<p>A nobler excuse to get rid of him was found in the war against
the Turks, and in July of that year, 1717, Maurice was serving
under Prince Eugene before the walls of Belgrade, which had
suffered so long and so tenaciously as the boss on the shield of
Europe against the Mussulman.</p>

<p>At this period Belgrade had been taken by the Ottoman troops,
who occupied it with two hundred and fifty thousand men commanded
by the Grand Vizier.</p>

<p>It was not until the sixteenth of August that the citadel fell
once more into Christian hands, and the Cross instead of the
Crescent was raised above the towers of Belgrade.</p>

<p>During this time Maurice had found ample opportunities of
displaying himself as a hero of those spectacular exploits then
expected of one of his birth and training.</p>

<p>He showed impressive courage, great resource, and that cool,
smiling daring which is most admired in leaders of men. He was
popular, too, with the volunteer princes who served under Eugene,
French princes of the Blood, like the Comte de Charollais and the
Prince of Lorraine, and aristocratic volunteers from England,
Italy and Germany.</p>

<p>And he held his own in the banquets and drinking bouts, the
extravagant licence and ribald amusements of the camp with as
much zest as he maintained his place on the ravelin, the demilune
or the counter-scarp.</p>

<p>It was the Countess Johanna Victoria's money that paid for all
this glittering display. And when he returned to Dresden he found
himself faced with her shrill reproaches. His creditors were
buzzing round her like gadflies, her revenues were depleted; she
was flouted, neglected.</p>

<p>Maurice did not make even promises of reform, and before
another year was out there was not enough left of the Loeben
fortune for the lady to live upon and she was forced to retreat
to Quedlinburg, where Aurora, as she put it piteously, was glad
to share with the young wife "the little fortune she had
left."</p>

<p>Augustus II, already completely weary of Maurice and his
domestic affairs, was importuned once more, by both Aurora and
Victoria. Could not His Majesty induce the young hero to put some
order into the moral anarchy of his life? Could His Majesty not
at least induce the demi-royal sprig to restrain his
extravagance, make some composition with his creditors and lead a
decorous, matrimonial life with his young Countess?</p>

<p>Augustus II knew too well that all interference on his part
would be flouted. His son was only himself over again, or so it
appeared, for Maurice's sterner qualities had not then shown
themselves. The King-Elector had done what he could for his son
in obtaining the Loeben heiress and now he shrugged his massive
shoulders and, weary to death of Aurora and her importunities,
left her petition and that of Victoria unanswered.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck had never particularly liked the
heiress whom she had sacrificed to her son's interests, but she
could not help feeling a certain sympathy for the betrayed and
plundered girl tied to a dissolute husband (whose infidelities
were almost numberless) and stripped of her revenues to pay for
his gross and boundless expenditure. The Abbess of Quedlinburg,
therefore, did what she could for the young Countess, sharing
with her the depleted and irregularly paid revenues of her
convent and giving her a house in the precincts of the Abbey with
what service and honour she could contrive.</p>

<p>Johanna Victoria stated her case in a letter to Augustus II.
She complained not only of Maurice's faithlessness but of his
brusque, brutal manner and the violent jealousy he showed if he
saw her "but speaking to another man." She merely wanted, she
declared, a little moderation in his expenditure, a little
courtesy in his behaviour; a little esteem, a little decency from
him, was what she demanded and she assured the King-Elector that
if she received that, no one would have reason to complain of her
behaviour. And the petitioning Countess asked, reasonably enough,
that her young husband should be commanded to make a home for her
out of the wreck of her fortune.</p>

<p>The Comtesse de Saxe did not obtain, perhaps had hardly hoped
for, any satisfaction. The King-Elector, Aurora von Königsmarck,
Maurice himself, had wanted nothing from the girl but her money.
That obtained, she might content herself, for all they cared,
with the barren glory of knowing that she was the wife of the
glittering young hero of Belgrade and Stralsund.</p>

<p>Johanna Victoria was not prepared, however, to sink into the
passive role of neglected wife weeping in obscurity. Even in the
seclusion of Quedlinburg she contrived to find distractions that
met with the disapproval of Aurora von Königsmarck and her life
in the Abbey soon became as disordered as that of Maurice in the
capital.</p>

<p>Without any object in her life save that of passing the days
in all the amusements she was capable of enjoying, without a
home, a protector, knowing herself exploited by the rapacity of
others, Johanna Victoria took her pleasures with cynic
carelessness, choosing her favourites, and as Aurora thought, her
lovers, from among the gentlemen and even the servants of her own
household.</p>

<p>Quarrelling violently on this score with her mother-in-law,
she went from Quedlinburg to one of the estates not yet seized by
her husband's creditors&mdash;Schönbrunn, in Lusatia. She went
into this retreat not only for the purpose of escaping from
Aurora Königsmarck's disapproving eye, but in order that she
might enjoy without espionage the society of a young man who had
taken her fancy. Had this lover been a nobleman or even a
gentleman, her behaviour would have been considered merely in the
traditions of the fashionable world and even Maurice himself
would probably not have found much to complain of; he might even
have been grateful that his wife's attentions had been distracted
from himself.</p>

<p>But Johanna Victoria's favourite was one of her husband's
servants&mdash;a page named Iago, who had, before he entered the
household of Maurice of Saxony, been a servant in the regiment of
Hammerstein in the Prussian Army.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck had her means of knowing of her
daughter's behaviour and she wrote indignantly to the King-
Elector that the Comtesse de Saxe had received this Iago
incognito both at Quedinburg and in Leipzig and added that at
Schönbrunn he lived with her openly, had a seat at her table, was
her companion in all her sports and diversions, and sat in the
carriage with six horses that she drove abroad in. The servants
at Schönbrunn were naturally much scandalised at this state of
affairs and the young adventurer, constantly fearing arrest, was
accompanied by a band of hired bravos.</p>

<p>Maurice, appraised of this state of affairs, delivered an
ultimatum to his young wife. She in her turn sent disdainfully to
the King-Elector.</p>

<p>The young husband cast back on Johanna Victoria all the
complaints she had made of him; he told her that "nothing she did
pleased him, that if she did not alter her life immediately he
would refuse to live with her again." He would consent, he added,
to a separation, even to a divorce.</p>

<p>But divorce in the Lutheran Church and under the laws of
Saxony was not easy; besides, there was the question of the
property. Maurice could not repay what he had spent of his wife's
dowry and did not intend to forgo what was left of it. Yet both
he and the young woman were avid of freedom from their despised
and tattered marriage ties.</p>

<p>Aurora and her son now commenced a warfare against Johanna
Victoria, whom they had begun by regarding as a foolish child, a
mere puppet in their hands, and who now had developed into a
determined young woman about whom there was something
sinister.</p>

<p>In choosing a servant as her lover, in living with him openly,
surrounding herself with the sabres and pistols of hired bravos
she had shown a cold and deadly spirit not unlike, in Aurora's
alarmed imagination, that which had inspired the terrible figure
of Madame von Platzen, who had murdered, or caused to be
murdered, as it was believed, Philip von Königsmarck twenty years
and more before.</p>

<p>This alarming view of the young Countess was, to the harassed
mind of the Abbess of Quedlinburg, confirmed by a mysterious
visit from a certain Mlle Rosenacker, one of the servants of
Madame de Saxe.</p>

<p>This intriguing chambermaid had a fantastic tale to tell. She
said that her mistress had given her a white powder, which had
been smuggled, in orthodox fashion, from an Italian living in
Venice. Showing it to her heavily bribed but faithless domestic,
the young woman had exclaimed tragically: "This is the sole means
for me to regain my liberty!"</p>

<p>She then gave the following instructions to the servant. A way
was to be found for introducing Mlle Rosenacker into the service
of Aurora von Königsmarck; there she was to take an opportunity,
when Count Maurice was on a visit to his mother, of introducing
the white powder into a cup of coffee, not&mdash;she was emphatic
on this point&mdash;into a cup of tea, where it would be
useless.</p>

<p>The result of drinking the slow poison would be that Maurice
would die at the end of about four months after what would appear
to be a lingering malady. Then would be the time, added Johanna
Victoria, when Aurora was smitten with grief at the death of her
son, to introduce the rest of the powder into some drink of hers;
she would then die in her turn and the world would think she had
perished of a broken heart.</p>

<p>According to her own tale, Mlle Rosenacker had refused to take
part in the lurid design, declaring that neither Maurice nor his
mother had done her any evil. She had then been cast aside by a
furious mistress, been sent out of her employment with the threat
that if she betrayed what had been told her, means would be found
to administer to her the fatal powder.</p>

<p>Such was the romantic and unlikely story to which Aurora von
Königsmarck listened with mingled incredulity and horror. Nor was
she altogether reassured by a letter from the young Countess
declaring that Mlle Rosenacker was a vulgar liar and intriguer
who had been turned out of service for dishonesty.</p>

<p>Maurice was saved, however, from any possible attempts on his
life instigated by his young wife through his decision to go and
seek his fortunes in France. Count Flemming had drily advised the
King-Elector that, unless he was fighting, the young Comte de
Saxe would come to no good.</p>

<p>"As we have no wars here, Sire, send your son where there are
or may be wars."</p>

<p>For once both Aurora and her son were prepared to take the
advice of a man whom they had long regarded as their most
powerful enemy. It was obvious that there was nothing for Maurice
to do in Saxony, where his position was dubious, his talents
wasted, and where he had almost exhausted the vast credits
brought him by the Loeben fortunes.</p>

<p>Leaving the question of his divorce from Johanna Victoria in
the hands of his mother and of his lawyers, he prepared to travel
to Paris. He had the best of introductions&mdash;a personal
reputation for bravery and gallantry.</p>

<p>The French army was still considered the model to the rest of
Europe; even after the defeats that had culminated in the Peace
of Utrecht, it was the finest fighting machine in the world, with
a prestige, a tradition, and an organisation equalled by the army
of no other country.</p>

<p>Augustus II, weary of everything and in particular weary of
Maurice, his wife and his mother, was delighted at a decent
excuse to be rid of him; this difficult son, one of so many
bastards, was only 23 years of age, but Saxony was already too
small for this brilliant young giant of gay and brutal manners,
who could do nothing but fight, drink, wench and spend his wife's
money on gaudy luxuries.</p>

<p>"He might be useful to someone," conceded Count Flemming, "but
not, at present, Sire, to us."</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck also agreed that it would be better for
her son to seek his fortune in the still mighty Empire of the
Bourbons. There were opportunities in France that could not
possibly be found in Saxony or even in the Empire. The amount of
glory, money and distinction to be gained in fighting the Turks
was limited.</p>

<p>Paris was the centre of the civilised world and France still,
if half-heartedly, championed the cause of the dethroned Stuarts,
and might at any moment be involved in a war on behalf of this
unfortunate family.</p>

<p>All things considered, both selfishness and affection worked
to send Maurice to France. Aurora von Königsmarck came once more
to Dresden to take farewell of the son whom she had never known
intimately but for whom she had worked so patiently and
skilfully. It was more the fault of her circumstances than of her
character that both skill and patience had been employed for poor
ends&mdash;the snaring and exploiting of Johanna Victoria von
Loeben had not resulted in anything except a few years of aimless
extravagance for Maurice, humiliating scandal and the nauseating
disintegration of a marriage corrupted at the very altar.</p>

<p>It was as well that neither Maurice nor Johanna Victoria had a
heart to break. Aurora von Königsmarck possessed a heart, but she
had veiled it with resignation. She saw Maurice depart on his
adventure as she had seen Philip and Christopher depart on theirs
a generation before. She had not been able to do anything for
them, not even to avenge them, and she could do nothing more for
Maurice but watch over such interests as he still might be
supposed to possess at the court of Saxony where Augustus, once
so strong, drooled in premature senility by virtue of the
permission of Peter, Czar of All the Russias.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1.2" id="ch1.2"></a>II. "LANGUES DU CHAT"</h2>

<p class="first">MAURICE DE SAXE had good credentials to offer at
the court of Versailles; he was not the man to hesitate to
present them, or to be slow in backing them by the rather
startling ostentation of his appearance, manners and
<i>entourage.</i> He was not altogether abandoned by his careless
and slothful father; the Comte de Watzdorf, Minister of Saxony in
Paris, was ordered to send secret reports concerning his conduct
and fortunes, to Augustus II.</p>

<p>In the year 1720 the appearance of Maurice de Saxe was at its
most impressive; his gaiety and good humour, his courteous, if
brusque air, the easy tact that is called the polish given by
courts, prevented his boundless self-assurance and deep-seated
arrogance from being offensive save to the very fastidious.</p>

<p>His strength was in its flower; youth, pride and health gave
his blunt, slightly brutal features a comeliness that easily
passed for handsomeness. His taste for splendour made him deck
his massive figure with a magnificence that the bizarre taste of
decadent Paris applauded.</p>

<p>The Saxon giant&mdash;this he was in proportion if not in
height&mdash;decked in fashionable satin coats of pastel colours,
with quantities of lace at his bull neck and with a waistcoat
encrusted with bullion across his huge torso, was much admired,
as an amusing, as an acceptable curiosity.</p>

<p>The fashions were less grotesque than they had been twenty
years before; the wigs of towering horsehair had been discarded
for locks powdered, pomaded, tied with ribbons, tied in bags,
plaited in long tresses, frizzled, rolled and curled. Maurice's
well-shaped head was adorned with a varying fantasia of the
hairdresser's art; he favoured in particular curls powdered and
dressed loosely round his clean-shaven face, and a long plait
hanging over one shoulder; in one ear he usually wore a large
pearl, which contrasted piquantly with the aggressive masculinity
of his square, snub-nosed, long-lipped face.</p>

<p>None could deny the splendour of this new-comer to the faded
ranks of the hangers-on of the Bourbon court; he carried himself
superbly, the uniform of his Saxon regiment, steel cuirass,
leopard skin, scarlet, was the extreme of pomp, he had the right
taste in wine, in horses, in women, in insolence, above all he
was unscrupulous, neither offering nor expecting any inconvenient
standards of honour or morality and he knew how to flatter with
that brusque air of candour which makes flattery so
delicious.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, easily to be understood that Maurice gained
at the court of France a brilliant but an easy reputation; for,
despite his glitter, there was nothing stable in either his
character or his circumstance as far as his present experience
went.</p>

<p>His life had certainly been full of action and show, and he
looked back with regret at every occasion that had given scope
for his martial ardour. Most of all did he regret the resplendent
days when he had served under Prince Eugene before Belgrade and
as a youth, who had already acquired a European reputation as an
ardent and successful soldier, had been joyfully welcomed by a
superb array of august gentlemen who adorned the camp of the
Imperialists, among whom had been thirty sovereign rulers and
some of the French Princes of the blood so lately fighting
against the Saxon whom they now welcomed with cynic courtesy to
share their hospitality and their vices.</p>

<p>Maurice had enjoyed to the full those skirmishes with the
Turks, the sallies and carousals with his fellow Princes, the
exciting vivid life of the Christian camp, and he remembered with
particular pride the great battle of August 17, 1717, when Prince
Eugene utterly overthrew the Ottoman power, thus consolidating
the victory of Peterwardein.</p>

<p>How reluctant he had been to leave the scene of so much
splendour, pleasure and glory! He had lingered to the last in the
company of the sumptuous and triumphant Allies and it had only
been with regret that he had repaired to Fravenstahe where his
father had then held court and the hearty Augustus, delighted
with reports of his son's success, had decorated him with the
flamboyant cross that showed so well on his broad chest...these
scenes remained vividly in the memory of Maurice, as whets to
ambition for the future; he let no one forget that such had been
his background and such his reputation, when with a princely
equipage paid for out of the ruins of Johanna Victoria's fortune
he arrived in Paris to be received with civility and even warmth;
the tie of rank was then much stronger than that of nationality.
Men of the same caste as himself did not remember against Maurice
that he had served in Marlborough and Eugene's camp as a boy 12
years old.</p>

<p>He was welcomed as a nobleman among noblemen, a prince among
princes and made free of French society.</p>

<p>France was then ruled by three men, each in a different way an
extraordinary and powerful personage.</p>

<p>The "great" King who had tried to revive the glories of the
Emperor Charlemagne, and whose greatness indeed was borrowed from
his Ministers, Louvois and Colbert, while his manifold
pettinesses were his own, was five years dead and his most
Christian Majesty, King of France and Navarre, was his great-
grandson, Louis XV, then a charming child in the hands of
governors and governesses who were skilfully and cynically
teaching him the corruption then considered necessary to the
subjugation of princes.</p>

<p>France had been beaten but not broken by the wars that had
been concluded by the Treaty of Utrecht, which after all had not
been as humiliating and ignominious as it might have been had the
Allies known when to end the war and when to press their
advantages.</p>

<p>Louis XIV, at one time the most powerful prince in the world,
had been forced to pawn his personal gold plate to pay for his
costly defeats, and his successor had ascended the throne of St.
Louis amid no very happy auguries.</p>

<p>The first half of the eighteenth century seems in retrospect a
dull, vague period. It was too late for so many things, too early
for so many others. The age of discovery was nearly over, the age
of science scarcely begun; poetry was occupied with wit, prose
with reason, art had become ornament. Everything was showy,
overblown, exaggerated, insincere; the baroque style of
expression, flowing movement, theatrical over-emphasis prevailed
everywhere.</p>

<p>Graceful festoons of exquisitely lovely decorations served to
disguise a decaying art; pomp, etiquette, ceremonial had reached
a pitch of formality that had become absurdity. Nothing was liked
but what was unnatural, a curious sentimentality began to show in
the passions of the cultured; natural emotion was disguised by
fine, vapouring speeches.</p>

<p>Men had begun to powder their hair, to paint their faces, to
wear pastel-coloured clothes, to talk cynically, to live
exquisitely.</p>

<p>The highest Parisian society affected a tone of delicatd
effeminacy; aristocrats, men and women alike, addressed each
other by affected nicknames, foolish, grotesque, or whimsical,
taken from fashionable plays, novels and fairy-tales of the
moment. A whole mythology of pseudo-gods and goddesses was
invoked and depicted at every turn and the stiff satin robe of a
<i>Vénus poudrée</i> fluttered against the shell-pink feet of a
plump shepherdess from a sham Arcadia, with gilded crook and
coquettish straw hat perched on curls stiff with flour and
grease.</p>

<p>France, exhausted from long wasteful wars, was but seventy
years away from that great Revolution which was to give humanity
a new idea of the "Rights of Man"; the only people whom Maurice
met, the aristocracy, seemed idly drowsing in elegant decadence
without being as comfortable and secure as the English nobility,
as undeveloped as the German princelings, as decayed as the
Austrian and Spanish aristocracy; the patricians of France
adorned this period of essential dullness with all the pretty
trifles sophisticated man has been able to conceive: beneath this
prettiness was foul grossness, like toads beneath the lilies on a
pool.</p>

<p>The Regent for the young King was Philip, Duke of Orleans,
head of the cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, one of the most
attractive of a line of princes distinguished by little save
superficial brilliancy and a cunning aptitude for intrigue that
backed an insatiable ambition.</p>

<p>The Duke of Orleans was handsome, elegant, intelligent and
accomplished; it was said of him that he possessed every good
gift but had not the power to make use of any of them. The truth
was that the Regent, like the vast majority of the witty society
that he gathered round him, was completely amoral. He lacked all
qualities of heart and spirit; he possessed to the full that
complete and impressive cynicism which enables a man to use his
powers and opportunities entirely for his own advantages and
pleasure without any thought of others, and without ever
experiencing a single pang of regret or remorse for the
sufferings or misfortunes of others.</p>

<p>When the Comte de Saxe came to Paris, the Regent had two
advisers; men like Maurice himself, who were, in the true sense
of the word, adventurers.</p>

<p>The first of these was a Frenchman and a priest, the abbé
Dubois, the Regent's first Minister and close companion, a man
who exactly suited his master's taste, if he did not exactly suit
the needs of France. Brilliant, unscrupulous, with all the social
graces and none of the social virtues, Dubois possessed a
penetrating wit, an entrancing gift of conversation, remarkable
aptitude for hard work, a disposition that might have been summed
up as a front of brass and a heart of iron.</p>

<p>He had no conception of true statesmanship but was an able and
completely dishonest politician, well fitted to hold his own in
the complicated and corrupt intrigues that kings and their
ministers then considered the art of government.</p>

<p>His small wizened figure in the decorous habits of the Holy
Catholic Church, his bilious tinted face with the small twinkling
eyes crowned with the monstrous yellow peruke, was always by the
side of the Regent both in business and amusement, in the Cabinet
and in the box at the Opera or the ball at the Palais-Royal.</p>

<p>The monkey-like, sinister appearance of the Minister with his
malicious smile and heartless glance made him appear like the
<i>âme damnée</i> of the suave and voluptuous prince whose soft
features, large blue eyes and gentle smile gave a wholly false
impression of his ruthless and implacably selfish character.</p>

<p>The second personage whom Maurice de Saxe found in power in
France was the most notable and honourable of the three. This was
Mr. John Law of Lauriston, a Scot then in his fiftieth year, a
man whose life had been as remarkable as that of any of the
Königsmarcks.</p>

<p>Well-born but not noble, John Law was the son of an Edinburgh
goldsmith who, as was then usual, combined his occupation with
that of banker and moneylender. Law was well-educated and from
his earliest days showed an extraordinary aptitude for
mathematics.</p>

<p>He did not, however, apply himself to his father's business,
which might have been supposed peculiarly suited to his talents,
but spent his youth in the fashionable manner by dissipating his
father's fortune in costly living, gambling and idleness. He was
extremely handsome, "better looking than any man had the right to
be," the French said of him later in his life, foppish in his
dress, gallant in his bearing. But he made no particular stir,
even in his own set, until an extraordinary incident brought him
into public notice and decided his future.</p>

<p>In the year 1694, the year that saw the tragic story of Philip
von Königsmarck and Sophia Dorothea nearing its close, John Law
went to London and there joined a set of wealthy young men-about-
town. Among these was a certain Edward Wilson, called "Beau
Wilson" on account of his good looks. This gentleman was the son
of a country esquire, whose whole estate was worth but two
hundred a year, yet he lived in sumptuous style, kept a costly
equipage, furnished his house in the richest and latest taste,
gave portions to his sisters, and paid off his father's
mortgage.</p>

<p>This was naturally matter for considerable gossip, scandal and
conjecture among his friends, who, however closely they tried,
could not discover the source of Beau Wilson's fortune. He did
not gamble, he had no wealthy mistress, it was not considered
possible that he was a spy, and although the member of a fast,
expensive, fashionable set he lived a quiet, decorous life never
mingling in any dubious matters, neither card-playing nor
wagering nor horse-racing and having, what was most curious of
all, no love affair that anyone could discover.</p>

<p>Beau Wilson was supposed to be of very moderate intelligence
but he had, however, sufficient wit to keep his own counsel and
no one could guess the source of his income; his end was as odd
as his life. His sister, coming up to town, took rooms in an
establishment where lodged a Mrs. Lawrence, supposed to be the
mistress of John Law. Edward Wilson, with his usual decorum,
withdrew his sister from the house where she was likely to be in
doubtful company.</p>

<p>John Law took, or pretended to take, offence at this and
meeting Beau Wilson in Hyde Park confronted him and challenged
him to a duel.</p>

<p>The parties went at once to Bloomsbury Square, then a famous
spot for these affairs of honour, swords were drawn and at the
first pass Law ran Wilson through the stomach. The unfortunate
Beau died immediately and Law was arrested on a charge of murder.
The duel had been irregular and after the outrageous death of
William Montford, killed by a couple of drunken boys&mdash;Lord
Mohun and Colonel Hill&mdash;feeling had been very strong against
duelling; the King, William III, being in particular strongly
opposed to these bloody and foolish "affairs of honour."</p>

<p>John Law claimed that he deserved no more than punishment for
manslaughter. He was, however, placed in Newgate, tried,
convicted of murder and sentenced to death, the Wilson family
showing the greatest bitterness against him, as indeed well they
might, for with the Beau seemed to have died their one source of
income. Edward Wilson had left no more than a few pounds behind
him, and it still remained a mystery where he had obtained his
money.</p>

<p>John Law finally eluded their vengeance by one of those
escapes from prison that are so strangely easy that they arouse
suspicion of complicity in high places.</p>

<p>John Law sawed through the bars of his prison-window in
Newgate and made his way out of England into the Netherlands,
where he was employed as clerk or secretary to the Resident in
The Hague.</p>

<p>This romantic affair still remains a mystery, but long after
an explanation that purported to be the truth was published.</p>

<p>Beau Wilson, it was declared, was the secret lover of
Elizabeth Villiers, Countess of Orkney, the close friend and, as
scandal said, the mistress of William III. It was this lady that
had supplied the Beau with his funds, and so prudently and
discreetly was the affair managed that the lovers only saw each
other by candle-light and at rare intervals.</p>

<p>The Beau had, however, according to this account, become
tiresome and had demanded an increase in his pension, with
menaces that amounted to blackmail. Lady Orkney had then decided
to sacrifice her passion to her interests and had employed John
Law to seek some frivolous excuse to dispose of the Beau in a
duel. It was, so this tale ran, this lady that had provided Law
with the means of evading prison and escaping to the
Continent.</p>

<p>The story is probably a malicious libel, but not much is known
of the character of this extraordinary woman, with her wit, her
talents, her squint and her undoubted influence over one of the
most powerful minds of her time.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the secret of Beau Wilson, his death sent
John Law of Lauriston on the road that was to lead him to a
unique position in Europe.</p>

<p>While in the Netherlands he studied economics, particularly
the working of the banks of Amsterdam, and when he returned to
Scotland in 1700 he published pamphlets on finance that advocated
paper money. He easily induced powerful personages both in
England and Scotland&mdash;notably the Duke of Argyll and Lord
Godolphin&mdash;to listen to his scheme, but he could not induce
any minister to try out his proposal of a State bank.</p>

<p>In 1708 he was again in Europe and in the next seven years he
travelled from country to country, gambling and trying to induce
some Prince or State to adopt his project. He impressed all who
met him as sound, honest, industrious and a mathematical genius,
but his suggestions were considered too daring and though the
Duke of Sardinia came near to taking him into his service, John
Law did not attain his ambition until he went to France after the
death of Louis XIV, in September 1715.</p>

<p>Here he found success beyond his wildest imaginings. The
Regent, astute, reckless and badly pressed for money, listened to
the Scotsman's proposition and allowed him to found his <i>Banque
Générale,</i> the first bank in France.</p>

<p>By the beginning of 1717 John Law was issuing his paper money.
His bank was brilliantly successful, especially when the Regent,
by a royal decree, allowed his money to be accepted in payment of
taxes. Law's Bank was in every way beneficial to France; he
advanced loans and expanded industry, he encouraged trade and
enterprise.</p>

<p>The Scot's ambition was not yet satisfied and he persuaded the
Regent to make over to him Louisiana, the French province in
North America. Law's idea was to rival and eventually to displace
the British East India Company; under what was termed the
Mississippi Scheme or <i>The System</i> he designed to obtain
control of all the non-European trade of France. The French
Parliament and many French people were indignant at the power
given to a foreigner and a Protestant, but the Regent met this
resistance by changing the name of the Bank to <i>Banque
Royale,</i> the King guaranteeing the notes and Law being created
Director-General. By absorbing other trading companies, the Bank
obtained the whole of the non-European trade of France, exactly
as Law had designed and also the important monopoly of tobacco.
In 1719, the Mint was given in charge to Law who was thus in
complete control of the entire monetary system of France.</p>

<p>The Regent, who, whatever his motives, had acted patriotically
and wisely in this, went far to hamper and even ruin Law's
designs by using the Bank for his own private extravagances,
which were pretty well boundless.</p>

<p>When Maurice de Saxe came to France in 1720, the Mississippi
Scheme or <i>The System</i> was at the height of prosperity, a
dividend of forty per cent. was being paid to the shareholders
and John Law of Lauriston was Controller-General of the finances
and had lately become a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>So powerful was he that when he quarrelled with Lord Stair,
the British Ambassador, because the latter had taken exception to
his avowed intention to overthrow both the trade of England and
that of The States General, the Ambassador was recalled and one
more complaisant sent in his stead.</p>

<p>John Law's position at this time was, if brilliant, rather
insecure. He had an active enemy in England and a secret enemy in
the abbé Dubois, while the Regent did not know what the words
faith and honour meant and was likely to repudiate John Law's
schemes, whenever it suited him. However, at the moment, the
banker reigned over French finance and was a dazzling figure in
French society; the elegant, blond Scot, still one of the
handsomest men of his time, with his tall figure, silver-grey
eyes and fair brows, was one of the first to welcome the young
Saxon adventurer to Paris, where all the talk was of money and
the spending of money.</p>

<p>Maurice perceived with satisfaction all this splendour and
luxury; it exactly suited his taste and he gave John Law all the
admiration due to one who seemed to have found, for all practical
purposes, the philosophers' stone.</p>

<p>But Maurice was neither financier nor politician; it was the
spending of the money that interested him, not where it came
from; it was the conducting of wars that fascinated him, not the
rights or wrongs of the conflict.</p>

<p>He attached himself neither to Law nor Dubois but to the
Regent and was soon his companion in many of his pleasures. The
example of John Law had brought the fashion of gambling, always
active among the idle and the rich, to a point of frenzy. Card
playing was but one aspect of this rage; wagers were made
everywhere and on everything, and horse racing with its attendant
betting was so fashionable that it was said of French society
that it "lived in the riding-school and the stable."</p>

<p>All this was exactly to Maurice's taste. These amusements were
the only means he considered of making peace tolerable, and he
entered easily into this vicious life of levees, fetes, hunting
parties, galas, the Opera, <i>petits soupers,</i> and balls, into
this gay, witty company, where everyone was perfumed and
powdered, where the women's naked shoulders were laced with
diamonds and their tiny waists circled with silk roses and their
faces painted to the likeness of a Cupidon, where fortunes
changed hands for a horse, a diamond, a hazard of the cards.</p>

<p>Maurice too could wear velvet and bullion lace and carry a
gold-hilted sword with a flourish and pomade his brown locks into
side curls and make himself agreeable to great ladies and more
than agreeable to ladies not so great. His thick-set figure and
heavy Teutonic face made him conspicuous among fine gentlemen who
were all grace and languor; but his amiable&mdash;for so it
appeared on the surface&mdash;and lively disposition and a
certain "sweetness," as the French ladies termed it, in his
manner won him favour in a society where everything was tolerated
but dullness. Nor did the delightful sirens of court and city who
strove to render his endless leisure agreeable dislike his
prodigious strength that had such a piquant contrast with their
own exquisite frailty.</p>

<p>So Maurice de Saxe was received into the topmost efflorescence
of this effete civilisation as one who was already an adept in
the virtues and vices then considered necessary for a gentleman
of quality. He was noted with elegant attention at Versailles,
where the Regent and Dubois contrived to squander splendidly what
they had plundered carelessly from the half-bankrupt kingdom.
There was, as usual, a fly in the ointment, and it was the usual
fly.</p>

<p>Maurice wrote to his mother, fading resignedly in her Hartz
Mountains retreat:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"I have found money difficulties greater than I
could possibly have imagined."</p>
<br>

<p>It would certainly not have taken much imagination for Maurice
to have foreseen that he would not be able to compete with men
like Law, Dubois and the Regent, who had the resources of a
kingdom behind them.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck could do nothing Augustus II was not
disposed to take any further interest in his son, at least not in
a monetary sense. He was another reckless voluptuary through
whose fingers any amount of money ran like sand.</p>

<p>The Comte de Watzdorf, the Resident of Saxony in Paris,
possessed some prudence. He wrote a letter of advice to the King-
Elector, suggesting that the young Count should be recalled as
soon as possible to Dresden, for, in his opinion, the young man
was being utterly ruined by the debauchery in which he lived.
Augustus II did not take this advice very seriously. He merely
wrote to Maurice, suggesting that he "left off gambling and
preserved his good manners if he wished to retain the royal
favour."</p>

<p>But Maurice had found another patron who was more useful to
him than his father. During one of those convivial evenings where
the artificial refinements of the period were swept away by
drunkenness and where in fact, as a contemporary says, "all sorts
of indecencies were committed," the Regent suggested and Maurice
accepted with enthusiasm a commission in the French Army.</p>

<p>In his first moment of sobriety Maurice returned to Dresden to
obtain his father's consent to this flattering proposition; and
as a graceful act of bribery the Regent had given the young Saxon
the honorary rank of <i>Maréchal de camp,</i> signed by Louis and
countersigned by Leblanc, in August 1720: this he now showed as
an earnest of better things to come.</p>

<p>But Augustus II and Aurora von Königsmarck had both the same
objections to their son's decision&mdash;the expense. How was he
possibly to maintain himself in Paris?</p>

<p>Maurice at once made fervent protestations as he had so often
made before. He would reduce his establishment, he would cease to
gamble, he would live on his pay and his pension and cease to
pester the King-Elector to pay his debts.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, and pressed by Count Flemming, who was
glad to see the young Count forever removed from Saxony, Maurice
obtained the paternal and maternal consent to his acceptance of
the Regent's offer. For Aurora von Königsmarck also gave way; her
motives appear to have been unselfish, she did not wish to
interfere with her son's destiny. She was as avid as he was
himself of his worldly success, glory and renown and she believed
that he might attain all three in the service of France.</p>

<p>There remained the young Countess to deal with. During
Maurice's absence in Paris she had taken on a quieter mode of
life. She was willing, she declared, "to repent, to correct her
faults."</p>

<p>Maurice did not wish to have anything more to do with the
erring lady whose fortune he had already spent and whose person
he had always despised. In a long <i>mémoire</i> he told her that
he would only keep her faults from the public on condition that
she divorced him. It was not difficult to satisfy the Polish law
on one head, for Maurice's infidelities were notorious.
Unfortunately, however, adultery was punishable by death, so
Augustus II went through the farce of sentencing his son to death
and giving him his pardon in his napkin when he dined with him
the same evening.</p>

<p>In March 1721 the young Countess of Saxony appealed to the
Consistory of the Reformed Church for the annulment of her
marriage.</p>

<p>The formalities were quickly put through and soon the marriage
of Maurice of Saxony and Johanna Victoria Loeben was legally and
religiously dissolved. The lady, considered, generously enough,
"innocent" in a technical sense, was allowed to contract a new
marriage according to the laws of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>Maurice took his liberation from a union that he had entered
into entirely out of self-interest lightly and even with a
certain impertinence.</p>

<p>Johanna Victoria, who was then only 22 years of age,
afterwards married a man who by prudent management was able to
restore some of the fortune that Maurice de Saxe had done his
best to ruin. She lived a quiet family life with her second
husband and three children on the estates purchased through her
father's industry, which had been used as pledges for the
reckless extravagance of her first husband.</p>

<p>Maurice never thought of his wife with tenderness nor spoke of
her with regret.</p>

<p>When the priest, in dissolving his marriage, had been about to
add a moral harangue, Maurice had interrupted insolently, saying
that the clergy interfered in everything and that as for himself
he knew "we are all great sinners, there's truth enough in
that."</p>

<p>In this matter, as in several others, Maurice had begun to
show his complete heartlessness; he had been brought up without a
family life and no sentiment had ever been roused in him. Perhaps
it would not have been possible to do so. Certainly his marriage,
based on such sordid reasons, had done nothing to soften him;
certainly, he remained as completely amoral, as lacking in
spiritual and magnanimous qualities as the Regent himself.</p>

<p>As a matter of pride, he was still a Protestant, for his
family had always been champions of Lutheranism. But to religion,
in whatever sense the word might be used, he was completely
indifferent.</p>

<p>Now in his twenty-fifth year, on his return to Paris he amazed
everyone by a strength even more prodigious than Augustus II had
possessed in his youth and of which fabulous tales were told; he
had been able, so the legend ran, to twist a horseshoe into a
knot, to take an iron banister rail from the stairs in one grasp
and even&mdash;most incredible of all&mdash;to raise a mounted
cavalier, horse and man in full armour, on the palm of his
hand.</p>

<p>Such legends were beginning to gather round Maurice, and
though the merest common sense could have proved them
exaggerated, the young man's magnificent torso, bull neck,
powerful jaws, deep voice, the long swing of his arms, the stride
with which he walked, all helped to create the impression of a
remarkable and invincible vigour, mental and physical.</p>

<p>In curious and, as many women found, fascinating contrast to
this brutal appearance, he continued to indulge a childish
delight in fantastic adornments. He had eagerly copied the most
extravagant fashions of the French court. The richly curling
locks were dashed with perfume, tied with gold ribbons and fell
in long buckled tresses over his shoulder. He wore an even larger
pearl drop in his ears, diamonds and pearls appeared among the
costly lace at his throat and wrists; his baldric and sash were
mingled with gold thread and fringed with bullion. His horses and
servants wore the most expensive and resplendent of liveries.</p>

<p>Taste for art he had none, but he bought in prodigal
recklessness the work of whatever artist was fashionable at the
moment. Inlaid furniture, crystal vases, silverware, tapestries
and paintings adorned his Parisian hotel. Of horseflesh he was a
fine judge, but too lazy to bargain. His stables were often full
of horses he bought at a high and sold at a low price.</p>

<p>He was not an expert gambler like John Law; his play went on
no mathematical calculation, it was a true hazard when he threw
down the dice or the cards. And when he lost he paid as a man of
honour, and when he won he flung the gold as a man of honour also
to the sycophants and lackeys who fawned round the gambling
table.</p>

<p>As a man of honour also, he completely forgot the promises he
had made to his father and mother, and his first step when he
returned to France was to purchase a regiment at a price so high
that as Count Flemming drily remarked, "two Saxon regiments could
have been had for half the money."</p>

<p>Augustus II did not appear to be prepared to pay up, and
Maurice had again to make a hurried journey to Dresden, which he
broke at Quedlinburg, in an endeavour to win his mother over to
his side.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck was tenderly foolish where her son was
concerned, where perhaps it might be said any man in whom she was
interested was concerned. Her conduct had not been marked by
prudence either towards her headstrong young brothers, whose
vices and follies she had tacitly condoned, or towards the Prince
to whom she had run for vengeance; indeed, what was possible for
a woman of her period and type, her birth and circumstances, but
to acquiesce admiringly in masculine lusts and selfishnesses, or
to exploit them for feminine lusts and selfishnesses?</p>

<p>Being a refined and exquisite lady, Aurora chose the more
delicate part. She admired, she flattered, she sighed over, she
ministered to these reckless, passionate and callous cavaliers.
For diversion she wrote poems and dramas and corresponded with
wits and philosophers.</p>

<p>It could hardly be said that she was mercenary; she had
certainly pestered Augustus and made an enemy of Flemming with
her continual demands for money, but no one regretted these
ungraceful actions more than the lady herself, and it could
hardly be said that her motives were entirely personal She had
been forced to beg for her pension, which had not been paid,
broken promises had thrust her into an awkward position, and most
of her pleas had been for Maurice.</p>

<p>She was not long in making another of these. Stormily pacing
the quiet corridors of the remote Abbey at Quedlinburg, the young
man had demanded his costly French regiment as a tempestuous
child might demand a box of soldiers.</p>

<p>Aurora had written to Augustus II and he, with a shrug of
lassitude, had turned to Flemming and the bill had once more been
footed, though not without considerable difficulty, for the Saxon
treasury was at last almost as empty as that of France when the
Regent turned to John Law of Lauriston to save him from
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Augustus sold one of the Crown lands, making it appanage in
the name of his son, and satisfied Flemming with the clause that
the land should return to the Crown if Maurice died without
legitimate heir.</p>

<p>Maurice returned in triumph to Paris and at once began to
occupy himself with his new regiment, which he trained, exercised
and supervised with the same care as he had taken with that other
regiment which Count Flemming had caused to be disbanded. It was
a German regiment by the name of Gerder.</p>

<p>The regiment represented the serious, the intellectual side of
his nature. For this object and for this alone he would work; to
improve his regiment and his own knowledge of military science he
would spend laborious hours in learning dry sciences. He studied
mathematics (algebra), tactics, fortifications; he read the
memoirs of great and successful soldiers, not only for their
romantic exploits and their glorious deeds, but for the means
whereby they had attained their renown and their prizes. He made
several innovations in the training of his own regiment and he
planned out on paper further innovations he would make if he was
ever in command of a large force of men. In particular he was
inspired by the friendship and writings of the Chevalier Folard,
who had been aide-de-camp to Vendome.</p>

<p>He might now consider himself singularly fortunate. At 25
years of age he was a <i>Maréchal de camp</i> in the army of King
Louis of France, a favourite of the Regent, and possessed of a
person that was the passport to all the good fortunes his passion
desired.</p>

<p>All the time that he did not give to the study of military
science he spent in pleasure, in the sense that that word was
understood in the Paris of the first half of the eighteenth
century. The French aristocrats, among whom the young Saxon
Marshal mingled, appeared to be, on the surface, the last flower
of brilliant sophistication; people who had exploited every
sensation possible to humanity, for whose enjoyment and amusement
every possible aspect of amusement and enjoyment had been
exploited by the wit, the pander, the charlatan, and the genius
who mingled anxiously in their train.</p>

<p>Despite this, however, they preserved a curiously ingenuous
interest in the crudest vices of mankind. These elegant, perfumed
and powdered lords did not disdain drinking bouts in which they
became drunk in a fashion as banal and disgusting as that
practised by the least of their lackeys. These cynical,
languishing, over-refined ladies did not disdain a lewd intrigue,
an amour as commonplace as any that their kitchen-maids might
have delighted in.</p>

<p>Sentimentality there was in plenty, but it was a mere disguise
for heartless lust. Of intrigues of the soul and spirit there
were none, and platonic love was not even known as a term.
Magnificent princesses and haughty great ladies who affected to
be shocked by a song too shrill or a perfume too potent, who
loved the artificial, the grotesque, and objected to nothing save
Nature were themselves natural enough, when they received,
smuggled up back stairs, the gallants who shared their satin-
lined alcoves but made no pretence to touch their hearts.</p>

<p>The new Marshal with his superb physique, his romantic
appearance, his glittering history could have been the hero of as
many of these exploits as he chose, so free was this society, so
indifferent to appearances that it is only a wonder that satiety
did not soon blunt the appetite of even the most sensual.</p>

<p>But sometimes the echo of a tradition lingered, and now and
then piquancy was given to an adventure, in itself banal enough,
by the jealousy of a husband or a lover.</p>

<p>Louis, Armand, Prince de Conti, son of the man once robbed of
his chance of the Crown of Poland by Augustus II was now robbed
of what was still termed rather mechanically "his honour," by the
son of the successful candidate.</p>

<p>And the story went round the gossips of Paris that the limp
that Maurice attributed to a false step when leaving the Palais-
Royal was really owing to a thrust from the sword of the Prince
de Conti, who had caught his charming wife in the arms of the
young Saxon. This anecdote was embroidered with one of the
malicious pleasantries then so much the vogue. Madame de Conti
was supposed to have told her husband, with great candour, the
six possible ways in which she could have deceived him with M. de
Saxe and then to have added: "There is a seventh! What it is I
shall not tell you, for it is the one I have employed."</p>

<p>This story reached the ears of the King-Elector, and he had
nothing better to do than employ one of his Ministers, the Count
Manteuffel, to ask his Ambassador in Paris what the seven means,
were that Madame de Conti had found so useful in deceiving her
husband.</p>

<p>Such incidents as these composed the life of Maurice de Saxe
at the court of the Regent; mistresses, acquaintances, flatterers
he had by the dozen, nay, it might have been said by the hundred,
but friends none, unless the old Duchess of Orleans could be
counted as such. She was a German, brusque, frank, loyal and on
her death-bed she gave her young countryman plenty of good advice
of a hard, worldly nature.</p>

<p>The fortunes of France, of the Regent, and incidentally those
of Maurice, were somewhat shaken by the fall of John Law of
Lauriston. His schemes, though wide, bold and wholly beneficial
to France, were in advance of his time. They were indeed almost
exactly the same schemes as were employed two generations later
by the Swiss banker and the French financier, Necker and Turgot,
who tried so desperately to save France from the bankruptcy that
helped to produce the revolution of 1789.</p>

<p>The first sign of danger was a run upon Law's bank; people
began to realise the paper money. Several edicts were quickly
passed to deal with this crisis, but Law's actual downfall came
through the enmity of England.</p>

<p>Dubois, England's friend and perhaps her paid ally, influenced
the Regent against John Law. And Lord Stair, although he had been
recalled from Paris because he had affronted the great financier,
had contrived to influence his Government against the man who had
boasted that he would destroy the English and Dutch trade.</p>

<p>Society, too, was fickle and though Law had worked in the
interests of the country in general, particularly in those of the
small proprietor, the middle classes and the peasantry, he no
longer pleased the aristocracy when he could not pay them
fabulous interest on their loans and supply them with an
unlimited amount of paper money for their reckless
expenditure.</p>

<p>One of the chief offenders was the Regent himself, who was
utterly prodigal. It was most profitable to be his friend or his
mistress&mdash;one woman at least had received a pension for life
for pleasing him for a fortnight&mdash;but it was not profitable
to work for him or to be his creditor. The Banque Royale was to
him merely a purse into which he could at will dip his hands.</p>

<p>All these circumstances combined against John Law, and the
Regent, either seeing that the scheme was no longer to his own
interests or wrought upon by Dubois, working in the interest of
England, or through mere lassitude and indifference, rated upon
the man whom he had promised to support and repudiated the royal
bank.</p>

<p>Law fled the country, cursed as a charlatan who had ruined
France. His fortune was confiscated and he found himself in
Brussels without friends or resources.</p>

<p>Maurice had gambled at Law's card-tables, and drunk with him
across his elegant board, but he had no interest in either his
schemes or his downfall, or in the prosperity of France. He was
only slightly vexed that the gold did not flow quite so freely
and that some of the amusing companions with whom he had laughed,
wagered, drunk and hunted looked for a short time downcast and
vexed by the collapse of the Mississippi scheme.</p>

<p>Maurice had, however, for any gloom that might have been
deflected upon him, a gracious consolation. It was not possible
for him to fall in love in the usually accepted sense of the
term, but he had been attracted by a woman to whom he was to be
more faithful than to any other of his mistresses.</p>

<p>The sentimentality or sensibility&mdash;these terms meant the
same thing&mdash;of the period found its finest expression on the
stage; the melancholia, the languors, the swooning lassitudes
affected by the great ladies to veil emotions and passions crude
and primitive enough, were part of the actress's stock-in-trade.
A tragic actress was called upon to express, usually under a
classic guise, a limited range of mournful
emotion&mdash;suffering, self-sacrificing, long drawn-out
farewells, renunciation, and death-bed scenes. With such fillips
to their own jaded feelings did the lords and ladies of Paris
regale themselves when they went to the <i>Comédie Française</i>
to hear the sonorous and soothing lines of Corneille and
Racine.</p>

<p>Chief among these actresses in the year 1721, when Maurice de
Saxe graced with his superb physique and his resplendent uniform
the royal <i>loge,</i> was Adrienne de Lecouvreur.</p>

<p>She was some years older than Maurice, in her thirtieth year;
she had been four years in Paris, that is to say, she was at the
height of her fame; four years was considered a long while to
have pleased so capricious and fastidious an audience, but
Adrienne had unusual gifts, remarkable histrionic talents, grace,
beauty, and a wistful appeal calculated to touch the most jaded
senses, the most callous heart.</p>

<p>Her name was Couvreur; she had added, without any right, the
graceful prefix herself. Her father was a journeyman hatter and
she herself as a child had worked in a laundry and a provincial
laundry at that. The hatter was a man of a violent temper who
died in a lunatic asylum and the only good turn he did his
daughter was to bring her to Paris where her love for reciting
any verses she could pick up led her to join a <i>troupe</i> of
young amateurs, who met in a grocer's shop to indulge that
passion for the play-acting then common to all classes in
France.</p>

<p>The little <i>troupe</i>&mdash;none of them was much more than
a child&mdash;Adrienne being 13 years of age at the
time&mdash;attracted the attention of a generous patroness, who
offered them the courtyard of her house to perform in, and when
they were dispersed by order of the police, because they were
infringing the rights of the <i>Théatre Français</i> Adrienne
found another friend&mdash;Le Grand, the actor, who was one of
the customers of the laundry where she worked.</p>

<p>He encouraged her, good-humouredly enough, and gave her a few
lessons and Adrienne abandoned the wash-tub and the ironing-board
to go on the road as a touring actress.</p>

<p>She was unusually successful and in five years' time was
acting before the court of Lorraine. The life was all she had
dreamt it would be; she was scarcely herself save when behind the
footlights, but she had not the temperament to be happy. She was
one of those women always in love with Love and always out of
tune with the lover. She was well paid and well applauded, but
she longed for the luxuries that were not yet hers and she was
discouraged by the coarse life, the ugly shifts, the poverty, the
lack of social status then the common lot of the travelling actor
or actress.</p>

<p>She had, and without question, her lovers; she took them and
left them as she travelled about&mdash;an officer, and actor, a
young nobleman. All these affairs were conducted with
sensibility, with sorrow, and soon followed by tears or regrets.
One was the father of her first child, another died young, and
Adrienne mourned him with brief but intense grief.</p>

<p>M. Clavel, himself a well-known actor, promised her marriage
and Adrienne seized the opportunity of writing a letter of
piteous warning and delicate renunciation:</p>

<p>"Do not, I pray you, promise me anything that you cannot
perform. Even if you promise to loathe me, I should prefer that
to being deceived. I know you well enough to know that you
delight in being magnanimous and that you might relish beating me
at my own game. But once more, think it well over. I should play
my part, whatever it might be, as well as I can, whether I keep
you or lose you."</p>

<p>All this was rather high-falutin and the prospect of marriage
between the actor and actress came to nothing. Nor did the offers
made by the chief magistrate of Strassburg, M. Klinglin, to whom
Adrienne bore a daughter in 1716.</p>

<p>Adrienne worked and sighed, and after the fashion of the day
wrote mournful worldly-wise epigrams: "Experience teaches me that
one does not die of sorrow."&mdash;"There are some delightful
errors that I dare not commit again." She also declared with an
air of delicious languor that she was "utterly weary of love and
intended to be done with it for the rest of her life."</p>

<p>In this disillusioned mood she came to Paris, her considerable
fame already preceding her, and triumphed immediately on the
boards of the <i>Comédie Française</i> in the part of Monime. She
was exceptionally clever; she had the grand manner yet a natural
air. Her simple style of speaking was something new to the French
stage, she was "unspeakably moving," her frail beauty was
precisely the type most in fashion. Her large, languorous grey
eyes that seemed to sparkle through tears, her oval face,
straight nose and small mouth were set off by a brilliant
complexion and a quantity of smooth, lustrous tresses, which she
wore in no monstrous head-dress but looped round her well-shaped
brow and hanging in low plaits and curls on her smooth white
shoulders.</p>

<p>Her taste was luxurious but flawless; she wore few jewels,
only pearls wreathed in those smooth locks glowed in her dainty
ears. Veils and plain gowns of velvet and satin flowing in simple
lines set off a figure she was too clever to disguise with hoops
and furbelows.</p>

<p>Her sensibilities, her sentimentality, her emotionalism, call
it what you will, were her greatest asset on the stage as it was
her greatest drawback in real life. She felt every part she
played.</p>

<p>This wonderful creature became at once Queen of the tragic
stage in France and admired by all foreigners. Her position was
for long unassailable; there was no one like her, no one even to
compare with her.</p>

<p>The society of the Regency made an idol of her; the daughter
of a journeyman hatter whose youth had been spent at the wash-tub
could hold her own with princes and princesses of the blood
royal. She was accepted everywhere with that condescending
admiration which aristocracy pays to art. She was considered as
necessary as a vase of flowers or a dish of fruit at a
fashionable supper party and affected to be wearied by the
adulation she received. Her grace, her dignity and her
distinction greatly improved the social position of actresses,
hitherto regarded as little better than amusing vagabonds.</p>

<p>She had, as a matter of course, her lovers; actress and
courtesan were still terms almost synonymous, and if Adrienne did
not sell her favours her salary, lavish as it was, could hardly
have kept her in the luxury in which she lived, or enabled her to
put by a veritable treasury of jewels, gold, silverware and other
precious objects.</p>

<p>She lived as Maurice lived, as if there was no such word as
economy and no need to take concern for tomorrow when to-day was
so fair.</p>

<p>The appearance of the great actress who had begun as little
better than a gutter-waif was in itself aristocratic. Her
delicate aquiline nose with the fine nostrils, her exquisitely
curved lips and her proud, graceful carriage combined to give her
that appearance and air which princesses are supposed to possess
but often do not have in real life. She had acted great heroines
so often that she had herself the manner of a Berenice, a
Pauline, an Iphigénie, a Phédre.</p>

<p>In her costly gilt <i>salon</i> in the <i>rue des Marais,</i>
as a contemporary put it, "the most famous and most distinguished
of the capital gathered together." And she herself said with a
gracious satisfaction for the sake of her art as well as her own
personality "it is an established custom to dine or sup with me,
and there are several duchesses who do me this honour."</p>

<p>Lax as the age was, her position as an unmarried woman who
entertained a succession of lovers might have kept her out of
some of the society she frequented, but her talent opened all
doors to her, even that of the Marquise de Lambert, whose
<i>salon</i> was known as the ante-chamber of the <i>Académie
Française;</i> Voltaire was her sincere friend.</p>

<p>Under these influences the sentimental side of the young
actress's character came uppermost. She declared that she would
dedicate herself to "virtuous love," an expression that was as
near as the period got to platonic affection.</p>

<p>She had, indeed, a worthy and amiable friend in M. d'Argental,
who adored her without receiving other rewards than her smiling
gratitude.</p>

<p>She was not, however, able to live without passion and when
she declared that love was a folly for which she had no further
leisure, she merely meant that she was waiting for the grand
passion that should become her own creation and be the absorbing
business of her life.</p>

<p>When she met Maurice de Saxe in 1721, she had had some
experience of his type. She had been for a short time the
mistress of Charles Mordaunt, the eccentric Earl of Peterborough,
who, meeting her in Paris, had said brusquely: "I know your
reputation. Come now, show me plenty of wit and plenty of
love."</p>

<p>But Peterborough, though a reckless adventurer and dashing
soldier, had none of the personal advantages of Maurice who shone
in real life as godlike as the heroes of Racine or Corneille. He
was what Pauline might have imagined Severus to have been; he was
a superb Titus for any Bérenice. He was not French, he was not
royal, he was landless and marked by many follies. His future was
largely in his own hands and no wise observer could have thought
that a safe place. But Adrienne de Lecouvreur for all her
resolutions to have done with love, allowed herself to fall
headlong into that passion for Maurice de Saxe.</p>

<p>Her temperament, her long schooling on the stage, the
emptiness of her life, the profound attraction of a young man who
really did seem the hero of a romance to the emotional and
imaginative woman, combined to make her love a frenzy and
ecstasy. She used all her arts and graces to embellish this love
that she created as some people have created a religion or a work
of art into which they pour their whole soul.</p>

<p>Adrienne saw him first in the royal box when she was playing
<i>Phédre</i> and at once, forgetting all her previous
experiences, believed that she was "in love" for the first time.
It certainly was for the last time; she remained faithful for
what remained to her of life to the young Saxon with the powdered
curls, whose thick neck was adorned with the pearls dangling in
his ear, whose bull-like torso was draped in the leopard skin
that hung over his cuirass, or with dainty laces and ribbons.</p>

<p>The libertine, whose taste had been catholic enough from
princess to chambermaids, was attracted by the woman adored by so
many men; he waited on her in the <i>rue des Marais</i> and found
her in the company of such men as Voltaire, d'Argental,
Fontenelle and Coypel, who painted her as Cornelia, grasping a
funeral urn.</p>

<p>She became, as a matter of course, the mistress of the
leisured hero. It was understood between them that this was not
to be a casual affair. The man was flattered and passionate, the
woman flattered and sentimental. She had her sensibility and he
had his honour, and both would be respected in their mutual pact.
Fidelity was not asked of her nor asked of him, but she claimed
the right to suffer from his neglect or absence, and he claimed
the right to rule her heart, her life and, if need be, her
income.</p>

<p>Soon after their meeting he left her for one of his Dresden
visits and this gave Adrienne de Lecouvreur an opportunity for
one of those amorous correspondences for which French women are
famous.</p>

<p>Adrienne de Lecouvreur possessed every luxury, possibly not
purchased by the efforts of her own talents and certainly not
paid for by Maurice de Saxe. In her <i>salons,</i> bed-chambers
and ante-chambers of the <i>rue des Marais</i> she possessed
Flemish tapestries, inlaid and gilt furniture, costly pictures of
the French and Italian schools, hangings of velvet and satins,
all that the taste of the day declared necessary for the
embellishment of beauty and talent.</p>

<p>These became the mere background of her love-story that she
heightened with every art and grace in her power. Her letters to
the absent lover ran the whole gamut of amorous emotion; every
aspect of anguished passion that she had been called upon to
portray on the boards of the <i>Comédie Française</i> she revived
for the benefit of her absent lover. She had fixed upon her part
and decided to play it to the finish and to play it
elegantly.</p>

<p>Her friends in vain endeavoured to distract her; she would
think of nothing, talk of nothing, brood over nothing but the
absent Maurice. She chose night for preference in which to write
to him; in her charming classic <i>négligé</i> with pomaded hair
falling over her exquisite shoulders, a vase full of lilac, roses
or acacia at her side, the marble table before her, the gilt
clock ticking over the hours when most reasonable people slept,
this for her was the chosen scene in which to write her
passionate, her sentimental, her languishing letters to the
adored hero.</p>

<p>She knew that she could not count upon his fidelity; she
almost enjoyed the pain that this knowledge inflicted upon her.
He had, after all, made no great attempts to deceive her. Part of
his charm was his brusqueness, his candour, his frank avowal of
the obvious intentions of the roving and dominant male.</p>

<p>"You are not the kind of lover that I have longed for," she
wrote to him. But these were mere words; the truth was that he
satisfied her completely.</p>

<p>The essential scoundrel in him called to the essential wanton
in her: play as they might with high terms and lofty phrases, she
was adventuress to his adventurer. Neither of them had known real
decorum, real training, honest family life, the ideals of
religion, any kind of spiritual existence. He in his way, she in
hers, played with sensuality. All that the gross love affair
required of decoration the actress was capable of giving it. She
disguised a headlong passion with a hundred prettinesses.</p>

<p>When he returned from Dresden she received him with an
enthusiasm that appeared virtue. Her intelligence forced him to
believe that he really preferred her to his other easy loves and
he was stampeded into a kind of fidelity.</p>

<p>She spoke of the soul and its grandeur and its beauty, of a
love that should outlast death, he believed nothing of the
matter, but the phrases pleased his ear. He recognised that there
was a certain value in diamonds, in costly tapestry and painted
furniture. He declared himself enthusiastically in love with
Adrienne and she concealed from him her horrid premonition of an
early death.</p>

<p>Adrienne, indeed, had begun to develop tuberculosis, to fall
into what was then poetically termed "a decline," a disease
fashionable among the young and ardent, one altogether beyond the
rude medical science of the age and only to be assuaged by
copious doses of opium that produced a frenzy in the thoughts and
actions of the patient worse than that what might be attributed
to the disease.</p>

<p>Adrienne de Lecouvreur saw herself faced by this desolate
fate; she was to die then, young, in her beauty, in her power, in
the full strength of her passion. The thought was terrible, yet
in a way it appealed to her theatrical temperament. She had died
so often on the stage that it did not seem much to die in real
life. Her luxury and her love concealed her disease, opium gave
her false courage, a false beauty; her eyes sparkling from the
effects of the drug she would rave her part upon the boards, then
throw herself enervated by passion, into the powerful arms of
Maurice de Saxe, who believed that his caresses would be
sufficient to revive any woman from any exhaustion.</p>

<p>She did much to polish him, to educate him in the fashionable
"tone" of the moment, to cover his Teutonic rudeness in Gallic
fineness, to make the Achilles of Homer become, as a contemporary
said, the Achilles of Racine. She taught him how to speak
elegantly to women, how to write delicate badinage to them, but
she could not teach him how to treat them in all affairs that
really matter. Of the gutter herself, she could yet teach this
son of a Prince how to behave, though not how to think. She could
give him lessons how to bow before a lady, how to kiss her
finger-tips, how to advance his suit by the subtleties of sighs
and appeals, but she could not give him any lessons in virtue or
honour, for she knew little of these things herself. But through
all the languish of a passion that was purely sensual did gleam a
complete fidelity.</p>

<p>She contrived to make of Maurice de Saxe her religion, to find
him everything she might have found in a family, in an assured
social position. He became fused with her art; he was all the
heroes of all the dramas in which she had ever played. Her affair
with him became famous in Paris, almost classical, entirely
virtuous. Who had ever heard of such fidelity on the part of an
actress, a beauty, a courtesan? She forwent many of the
amusements, the diversions, the prizes that were considered her
due; her tears, her sighs, consecrated her on the altar of
virtuous love. Had she been his long-suffering wife, she could
scarcely have earned so much praise.</p>

<p>As for him, he had all the advantages and none of the
obligations or despairs of the affair. He came and went as he
pleased. Other women, his sports, his games, his regiment,
occupied as much of his time as he chose they should. When he was
away he received her letters with negligence and answered them
with brevity.</p>

<p>Adrienne was all nobility and self-sacrifice; she wrote to him
that she could never be completely happy save in his presence but
that he was to forgo nothing for her sake. She left him
completely free and she always added the assurance that was so
entirely lost on a man of his type, "I do love you a thousand
times more than you believe," than you deserve, she might have
added with truth.</p>

<p>The affair became public property and rumours of it spread to
Dresden. Augustus was a little disturbed in his senile lassitude.
An actress! and loved for more than a day and a night! When
Maurice was in Paris he was living openly with her, they had a
joint establishment though Maurice paid little towards the
upkeep. The King-Elector made some little effort to betroth his
son to the Princess of Holstein-Sonderburg and to control his
behaviour.</p>

<p>"Conduct yourself with dignity," he wrote in a tone of weak
rebuke, "and I will make of you a Prince indeed." But Count
Flemming was always there to whisper in his apathetic sovereign's
ear: "The young Prince is indeed incorrigible."</p>

<p>Incorrigible Maurice was, if not a Prince. But he was not so
far gone in his follies that he did not keep his eye on the main
source of his revenues. He was frequently in Dresden and
frequently at the ear of Augustus, who even employed him on
secret negotiations with the Regent, trifling in themselves, but
useful to the young man's importance.</p>

<p>What these negotiations were is not known, but the King-
Elector complimented his son on accomplishing them with address
and discretion.</p>

<p>Always restless and seeking for fresh diversions, Maurice went
to London, where he was received with a great deal of amiability
at the court of the man whose wife had been his uncle's mistress.
George I was all affability for the young French Marshal, Saxon
by birth, who won the English aristocrats by his easy manners,
rich equipage, his bold air and extremely handsome person.</p>

<p>As a change from court life, Maurice enjoyed himself walking
about the streets of London by himself or with only one body-
servant in attendance, and in watching all the rich adventures on
the streets of the capital.</p>

<p>It was told of him with much relish that on one occasion being
halted by a drunken boxer in Covent Garden, he turned and with
one magnificent gesture seized the offender by the hair and threw
him in the ditch that ran then down the centre of all the
principal streets of London.</p>

<p>Women, of course, were the accompaniment of all these
adventures and when at length he returned to Paris the faithful
Adrienne ventured to utter some gentle reproaches. She had had no
letters from him and there was the usual complaint: "Is it so
difficult to write just one word? Can one love a woman whom one
neglects like this?" And with some bitterness she reproached him
with the seraglio that he maintained and that would, she
declared, efface all memory of her in his mind. She was too good
an actress to lose any point in the argument; she ran through the
whole gamut of reproaches as she had once run through the whole
gamut of emotion.</p>

<p>"What a fool I am to concern myself for a man like you? What a
mistake to pass my life in such uncertainty!"</p>

<p>The libertine consoled her, he caressed her, he was her lover
once more. Her fascination acted upon him like a charm when he
was in her presence, the feverishness of her malady helped to
give her a desperate seductiveness. Her health was failing, she
had fainted, she had spat blood, her head ached and her cough was
continuous. It was with difficulty that she was able to take her
part on the stage; sometimes at the last minute another play had
to be substituted for that in which she had been billed to
appear. Then she would remain in her luxurious chamber, sunk on
her pillows, dazed with opium, with ill-health, scribbling her
notes that were to call Count Maurice to her bedside. She was
disillusioned, she was in despair, but she was just as able to
persuade herself, still "in love." Maurice had never had a rival
in her sensitive heart and soul. She was his, always
his&mdash;she continued to write her notes, a whole literature of
love. It is doubtful if he ever read them or at least more than
the first or last line. Why should he concern himself with the
perusal of these sad epistles when he knew the writer was his
prey? He had but to smile upon her and all her grievances were
forgotten. After all, she had held him longer than any other
woman, though her reign might have been intermittent, it had
endured for five years.</p>

<p>In the year 1725 she became more and more distracted and it
was with great relief that she learned, after a desperate
exercise of all her subtleties, that her rival was not a woman.
This time it was ambition. Maurice had never forgotten how near
he was to a throne, how completely divided he was from one.
Traditional and conventional in all his behaviour, he had never
shown himself an enemy to his brother, the Prince-Electoral of
Saxony, the heir to the throne, as it was hoped, of Poland; there
Maurice was all loyalty, all submission. But in a world that was
large and stormy and where many adventurers were tossed to the
top on the crest of every tempest, might not he, with all his
advantages, find a crown, a throne? Bold, reckless, imprudent, he
was prepared to undertake any adventure, if it held out even the
least hope of satisfying this ambition of effacing the <i>baton-
sinister</i> that debruised his coat of arms.</p>

<p>During his military and mathematical studies, during his
reckless debauches he had always had before his mind this
glittering hope&mdash;a crown, a kingdom.</p>

<p>Oh, to rule, to have not one regiment but a whole army under
his command, to have the revenues of an entire country to draw
upon, to be by right what he felt himself to be by nature, a
master, a king! Where was this ambition to be gratified?</p>

<p>He ran now into the gilded <i>salon</i> where Adrienne de
Lecouvreur tossed on her down satin pillows and told her with
enthusiasm, with feverish excitement, there was at last a
chance.</p>

<p>"What of?" she demanded, starting up upon her lace-hung couch.
Her thoughts were only of love, of peace, of possessing in
tranquillity this gorgeous lover. But he quickly disillusioned
her. He came to her as a friend, as a confidant. He needed her
wit, her sympathy, perhaps her jewels and her credit. There was
an opportunity that he might at last be a sovereign, a prince,
free, he said, above them all, the equal of his father, his
grandfather, the Prince of Saxony. And he unfolded to her the
project that had been broached to his eager attention.</p>

<p>The sovereignty of Courland and Semigallia was for sale and it
had been suggested to Maurice at a carnival in Warsaw where he
had waited upon his father, that, if he could find the price, he
might obtain the double dukedom, which would set him on a level
with the sovereign Princes of Europe.</p>

<p>This duchy represented the farthest north barriers of Europe
between Russia, Lithuania, and Livonia. It was a strip of barren
enough land on the Baltic, the climate was harsh, the winters
almost intolerable to a Southerner and a heavy fog usually
enveloped it even in summer. The inhabitants counted at most five
hundred thousand; they lived humbly on what agriculture their
unfertile country could produce.</p>

<p>The capital was Mitau, and there had ruled, ignored by the
rest of Europe for some generations, the Dukes of Courland and
Semigallia. The niece of Peter the Great, Anna Ivanowa, had been
married to the Duke Frederick William, who had died childless in
1711. He had been followed by a weak prince, Ferdinand de
Kettlar.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the fact that Poland was the overlord of
Courland, Augustus II thought of annexing the small barrier
country. The election of the sovereign rested with the Diet of
Courland, who were allowed, by the constitution of the country,
to choose an heir to a childless ruler. Not only was Ferdinand de
Kettlar childless, he was feeble and in ill-health and did not
seem disposed to make any opposition to a scheme to dispossess
him of his throne.</p>

<p>An intrigue was therefore set on foot to offer this prize to
Maurice de Saxe, son of the King Augustus, who already had made a
pretension to Courland. The prime mover in this manoeuvre was M.
Lefort, Resident of the King of Poland at the court of
Russia.</p>

<p>The King-Elector approved the scheme. It would give his son,
so turbulent and difficult to place, an establishment at last and
it would maintain his hold over Courland. Obviously, heavy
expenses would be entailed. The bribes expected would be numerous
and heavy.</p>

<p>Maurice did not allow this consideration to get in the way of
his enthusiastic acceptance of the plan. He was even prepared to
sell his beloved regiment in order to raise the money with which
to establish himself in Courland. The dazzling dream that had
been so dear to him since he was a child seemed at last about to
be realised and the illegitimate son of Aurora von Königsmarck
already saw himself a ruling Sovereign. It was the title, the
glory, not the substance, that he wanted. It mattered nothing to
him that Courland was a desolate, forlorn situation, that the
country was poor and backward; he would be a sovereign Duke, a
ruling Prince.</p>

<p>Some formalities, however, remained to be gone through. The
Diet would have to elect him a future Duke and there would have
to be a reference, however formal, to the wishes of the people.
There was also the Dowager Duchess, Anna Ivanowa daughter of
Ivan, brother of Peter the Great; she had some claims to the
throne her husband had occupied, or believed she had; at least
she possessed a considerable party in Courland and might be
supposed to have the backing of Russia.</p>

<p>M. Lefort and fellow-intriguers saw no great difficulty here.
Why should not Maurice, now that his marriage had been annulled,
marry the Duchess? Thus their claims would be combined and the
people of Courland would not have much excuse to refuse to accept
as their Sovereign the man whom their Duchess had married.</p>

<p>Maurice was perfectly willing to agree to this plan and to
contract a second marriage of self-interest. He was also
convinced that he had but to see the Duchess to win her, and this
confidence, it must be admitted, was based not so much upon
vanity as experience. He had never yet been refused anything by a
woman.</p>

<p>Here was Adrienne de Lecouvreur's opportunity for sacrifice.
She could display a delicious feminine sympathy by renouncing all
her frail and dubious rights over her lover's heart in order that
she might not stand in the way of his destiny. Not only did she
encourage him to undertake this adventure but she was willing to
raise all the money she could, even to sell her jewels, to assist
him. Other French women were willing to finance the enterprise;
the money seemed assured.</p>

<p>Maurice, however, had not set out for Courland when a
difficulty arose.</p>

<p>Russia, whom the King-Elector was fearful to offend, had
another scheme for Maurice de Saxe; she proposed that he should
marry Elizabeth Petrovna, a daughter of Peter the Great, receive
her with a portion suitable to her rank and renounce all claims
to the throne of Courland.</p>

<p>Augustus II felt that he had no alternative to the acceptance
of this scheme. He took, as usual, the easiest way and sent Count
Manteuffel to tell Maurice to give up the Courland adventure.</p>

<p>The King-Elector should have known his son better. Though he
was told by his father's envoy that this was not a request but a
command, Maurice replied brusquely that he would obey the King in
everything but this. And he proceeded to get together a party in
Paris to supply him with funds.</p>

<p>There were a number of women besides Adrienne de Lecouvreur
willing to help the hero to obtain his ducal crown, and armed
with this practical proof of feminine devotion, Maurice employed
an agent who was told to engage all the deserters of whatever
nation who might be still loitering in the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Nearly two thousand of these doubtful mercenaries were
enrolled, but half deserted again before reaching the port of
Lubeck, where they were to embark, and all the efforts of the
lovelorn ladies and amiable friends only provided Maurice with a
ragged motley troop of about eight hundred men. He was not,
however, daunted by this nor by the appearance in the field of a
Russian Pretender supported by his own court, Prince Mentchikof,
who, encouraged by the Empress of All the Russias (who was not at
all disposed to let this opportunity slip of annexing the two
duchies) waited on the frontier of Courland with twenty thousand
Russian troops.</p>

<p>Maurice set out for Mitau, encouraged by the self-sacrificial
tears and caresses of Adrienne de Lecouvreur and several other
enthusiastic women who promised to send further supplies.</p>

<p>It is said that, when Maurice asked one of his agents for a
book to amuse himself with on the tedious journey across Europe,
this man could find nothing but a history of the Duke of
Monmouth. If Maurice had read this, he must indeed have found
some similarity between the story of James II and his own, while
Adrienne de Lecouvreur seemed well cast for the part of Henrietta
Wentworth, another fond and foolish woman who with a kind of
exquisite silliness had stripped herself of jewels, even of the
wherewithal on which to live, in order to urge a beloved hero on
to a crazy adventure. However, Maurice "went at the gallop" with
his band of filibusters to Mitau; he had all the Duke of
Monmouth's advantages and some that were entirely his own; "All
Paradise was opened in his face," Dryden had written in hyperbole
of the English royal bastard, and Maurice was able to note with
complacency that when he was presented to Anna Ivanowa in Mitau
in the May of 1726&mdash;"my face pleased her."</p>

<p>She was, indeed, as infatuate as Maurice and his friends had
hoped she would be and expressed herself as willing as Adrienne
de Lecouvreur herself to spend the rest of her life with the
noble and handsome adventurer.</p>

<p>"I had the happiness," wrote Maurice to Aurora von
Königsmarck, "not to displease her. She herself told the Czarina
that she wished to become once more Duchess of Courland and share
my throne."</p>

<p>With the help of the amorous Russian princess and the money he
had brought from equally infatuated Parisian ladies and
actresses, Maurice contrived to make himself acceptable to the
Courlanders, who believed he might save them from annexation; he
was hailed as future Duke.</p>

<p>The title, however, was merely nominal; Maurice found himself
the centre of intrigues, surrounded with jealousy, indifference
and treason. If he could win the women, he was not invariably so
successful with the men and like many another Pretender he found
himself surrounded only by those who hoped to obtain some favours
from him and who were ready to leave him when there was nothing
to be had from him; worse than this, he was disavowed by his
father, who feared to displease Russia.</p>

<p>Some of the Courlanders, to whom Maurice represented national
independence, rallied round him, but neither their number nor
their training was such as to render them very effective. Maurice
appealed passionately, authoritatively, to his adoring troop of
women. Aurora von Königsmarck left Quedlinburg to endeavour once
more to raise money from bankers and usurers. She brought out
from her treasury such jewels as she had been able to save from
her son's insatiable demands; Adrienne de Lecouvreur realised the
fortunes given her by other lovers to help this lover who had
given her nothing, and sent to Mitau forty-thousand <i>limes</i>
in one instalment only.</p>

<p>Maurice was not, she wrote in an excess of sentimental
generosity, to concern himself about returning this money, but to
make good use of it for his own glory. At the same time she
expressed feminine fears for his safety. She believed that he had
gone among savages, she dreaded the mishaps that might overtake
him in the cold, far North. She implored him to return, if only
for a brief while, as soon as possible, to her luxurious and cosy
hotel, in Paris.</p>

<p>The Dowager Duchess of Courland in her turn worked for the
irresistible young hero. She did her best to persuade the feeble,
perhaps dying, Duke of Courland to use what influence he might
possess in favour of the Saxon Pretender to his throne; like all
feeble, cornered people, Ferdinand Kettlar compromised, promising
his aid here and there according to the last person who spoke to
him and Anna Ivanowa's arts were useful.</p>

<p>But more powerful allies worked for Maurice. The beautiful
Maréchale Vielinska was in an influential position at Warsaw, and
the charming Countess Pociey, whose husband was of equal
importance at Riga, did their best by subtle underhand influence
to secure to the resplendent Maurice his uneasy duchy. He had had
tender passages with both these useful ladies.</p>

<p>The election took place on June 26, 1725, when Maurice was
unanimously chosen by the Diet and the Dowager Duchess gave a
sumptuous banquet in the evening to celebrate his success.</p>

<p>The diploma of election stated frankly enough that "the House
of Gotlar-Kettlar, being about to end in the person of His Serene
Highness Duke Ferdinand, the nobility and the commons of the
Duchy of Courland and Semigallia had elected as his successor the
Serene Prince Maurice, Count of Saxony, to be their Sovereign in
case that His Serene Highness the Duke Ferdinand should die
without male children."</p>

<p>Maurice wrote triumphantly of his success to the father who
had opposed it and he began in the enthusiasm of the moment to
cast upon paper his plans for ruling his new Duchy; the
spendthrift, almost bankrupt adventurer, took some pretty good
resolutions.</p>

<p>"I propose to live very quietly; my domains are indebted and
ruined by famine and war. It is only with industry and economy
that they can attain some measure of prosperity. I shall give all
my attention to this."</p>

<p>The adventurer had, however, to reckon with another
adventurer. Mentchikof, the one-time pastry-cook, who had become
general and first minister to Peter the Great, was also hankering
after a crown, and he was the favourite of Catherine the First,
widow of Peter the Great. It seemed possible that one woman could
achieve for Russia what many women could not achieve for the
Saxon.</p>

<p>Mentchikof no sooner heard of the election of Maurice than he
sent Prince Dolgorouki to apprise the Diet that the Empress of
Russia did not acknowledge the election, that it both surprised
and irritated her, and that Mentchikof was her choice.</p>

<p>This ominous announcement was soon followed by the Russian's
arrival at Mitau with the twenty thousand men he had gathered on
the frontier, with credentials as Catherine's Minister.</p>

<p>Shortly after he had entered the city the Russian waited upon
Maurice, then installed in the palace of the Duchess.</p>

<p>It was a strange interview. The two men were alike in
much&mdash;adventurers both of them, one of royal blood but
debarred by bastardy from the throne, the other of the lowest
birth but raised to princely rank through the friendship of an
Emperor; both ambitious, bold, reckless and dependent upon the
favour of women for their power.</p>

<p>The Russian informed Maurice that it was the wish of the
Empress that the Courlanders should proceed to another election,
and he added frankly that he was Her Imperial Majesty's choice
and that, failing him, the Duke of Holstein or one of the Princes
of Hesse should be chosen. In no case were Maurice's claims to be
even considered.</p>

<p>Maurice met insolence with insolence, assurance with
assurance. He was, he said, the duly elected Duke of Courland and
Semigallia and he refused to listen to any messages even from the
Empress of Russia.</p>

<p>Mentchikof's reply was to continue to pour troops into the
country and to give the Diet ten days in which to consider their
future actions.</p>

<p>The sight of Catherine's cavalry riding sword in hand through
the streets of the capital made the Courlanders regret their
impulsive choice of the Saxon.</p>

<p>Maurice had no troops beyond the sixty guards who composed his
escort and who were quartered in the mansion where he resided in
Mitau, when he was not enjoying the hospitality of the
Duchess.</p>

<p>The Russian made an attempt to capture the Saxon pretender by
besieging him in his own house, but the Dowager Duchess, hearing
of this move, sent her own guard to rescue Maurice, and to carry
him to her Palace where he was given apartments, and treated as a
ruling sovereign. Without her intervention he would have fallen
into the hands of the Russian and been carried as a prisoner to
St. Petersburg, a turn to the adventure that would at least have
given him the opportunity of laying siege to the heart of the
Empress herself and thus, perhaps, displacing his rival not only
in Courland but in Russia.</p>

<p>Maurice escaped from his besieged house in the most dramatic
and romantic circumstances, among which, if the gossips of the
time are to be believed, was the capture of a beautiful young
Courland girl disguised as a man, whom the Russians believed to
be Maurice. While she kept up this pretence and was being led
into the presence of Prince Mentchikof, Maurice was escaping to
the palace of the Dowager Duchess. If there be even the fraction
of truth in this tale, the lady must have been of Amazonian
stature or the Russians entirely deceived with regard to the
person of the Saxon pretender.</p>

<p>The Dowager Duchess, handsome, passionate and savage&mdash;in
everything a fitting niece to Peter the Great&mdash;had become
violently enamoured of Maurice, to whom she paid every possible
attention and in whose cause she used all her influence with the
Czarina, with the Courlanders, with Mentchikof himself.</p>

<p>She entertained him lavishly at her own expense and Maurice
was able, at least, to simulate a return of these warm feelings
and induce the Duchess to send pressing embassies to St.
Petersburg with the two objects of persuading Mentchikof to drop
his pretensions and of securing the effectual election of Maurice
himself.</p>

<p>At first these intrigues seemed successful. The Empress, to
oblige her husband's relative, sacrificed her own favourite and
ordered him to abandon his claims to the Duchy of Courland and to
withdraw his troops from Mitau.</p>

<p>The situation had all the elements of either tragedy or
comedy; there was something bizarre and fantastic about the
characters of all concerned in the Courland intrigue.</p>

<p>The Empress, Catherine I, had been a Livonian captive, who had
taken the capricious fancy of the conquering Russians, and who
had been the mistress of several generals who had commanded the
troops overrunning Livonia. She had, at last, attracted the
attention of the brutal, half-crazed Czar himself and he had
married her; after his death she had passed into the possession
of Mentchikof, a former army cook who had attained a high
military rank and considerable influence in the councils of his
master.</p>

<p>This man, able, astute, daring, dreamed of holding together
the Empire of Peter the Great and even of achieving his aim by
means of Catherine and he was powerful enough to secure her
coronation as Empress of all the Russias; his desire for Courland
was inspired by the same motive as Maurice's longing for that
barren Duchy&mdash;the wish to possess some independent title
that might at least have a show of sovereignty.</p>

<p>But neither the ambitious Maurice nor the ambitious Mentchikof
was as important in the tangled affair as the women; the former
slave and camp follower whom Mentchikof had crowned with the
surer crown that formed the imperial diadem, and the lusty Anna,
widowed for fifteen years, whose support only kept Maurice in
Mitau.</p>

<p>Even this patronage would have been useless to him without the
money sent by Adrienne de Lecouvreur and other infatuate women;
the money was absolutely necessary to him, not only for bribes,
but to support the magnificence necessary to dazzle Anna, who
liked her suitor to glitter in satin and velvet, brocade and
tissues, to be surrounded by liveried lackeys.</p>

<p>When writing to his father, Maurice had tried to put a good
face on his ambitions and projects by expounding schemes he had
in mind for Courland "ruined by war, pestilence and debts."</p>

<p>He admitted that there would be considerable difficulties in
the way of putting Courland&mdash;under any aspect&mdash;on the
map of Europe, but he affected to believe that it could be done;
he used the words "industry" and "economy," which had not
hitherto been in his vocabulary, and added disdainfully that he
had always detested the pretentious luxury of little courts that
raised the mockery of the small people and the contempt of the
great.</p>

<p>"I shall never live in pomp&mdash;plenty of guns and bayonets
in my salles d'armes,' and no flatterers in my antechambers."</p>

<p>This was all very well, but for the moment Maurice had to be a
flatterer himself, and to go splendidly in order to hold the
sensuous fancy of the dangerous Russian.</p>

<p>She did not, it would seem, greatly attract him, she was not
young, she was used up; there was something about her as
"farouche" as Mentchikof's pikemen. Maurice, used to the
elegances of Dresden and the superb delights of Paris and
Versailles, found Anna and her household, if not as savage as
Adrienne feared they might be, at least lacking in polish and
finesse.</p>

<p>More than this, Anna dared to be exacting and suspicious, to
try to dominate her suitor; it was the first time that a woman
had ventured to bring him to heel; the satisfaction with which he
had written "I please her" soon wore off. There was rather too
much femininity in the whole affair and Maurice was not quite so
clever at managing Anna as Mentchikof was at managing the
Empress.</p>

<p>It was all very sweet and dainty on the surface and Maurice
enjoyed the gorgeous quasi-oriental splendour of Anna's
establishment, but the sugared tongues of the women could soon be
spiteful&mdash;"langues du chat," a sweetmeat with a bitter
flavour.</p>

<p>Maurice controlled himself to some show of prudence in view of
the prize at stake; when his marriage with an Emperor's niece had
made him in truth Duke of Courland&mdash;and master of her
private fortune, too&mdash;then he might permit himself to treat
her as he had treated Johanna Victoria, a lady of whose history
Anna was doubtless in ignorance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maurice indulged his dreams; Anna was confident that
she could persuade Catherine to call off Mentchikof, whose
ferocious looking men so energetically patrolled the streets of
Mitau, and Maurice was confident that he could outface the
Russian adventurer, backed as he was by the Diet of Courland,
which had duly and truly elected him as sovereign designate. It
was true that the Courlanders were a little disturbed by the
presence of the Russian cavalry, but Maurice, always sanguine,
believed Anna's assurances that this would soon, by orders of the
Empress, be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Of Anna herself he was sure, dangerously sure; he felt that he
held her in the palm of his hand. She had given him the most
splendid suite of apartments in her palace, she sent an officer
every day to take his orders and a page to enquire after his
health; she was as submissive as the lovelorn Adrienne de
Lecouvreur to his least wish.</p>

<p>Maurice felt his throne secure and looked forward to a future
as ruler of Courland and Semigallia&mdash;"a poor thing, but mine
own."</p>

<p>He was confident that he could hold at bay&mdash;even turn
into allies, both his father and Russia; after all, Anna could
manage the Empress, and Augustus II had never really refused him
anything within reason.</p>

<p>Maurice had, however, to reckon with his life-long enemy,
General Count Flemming, who was still powerful with Augustus II,
whose counsels and armies he had directed for twenty-seven years,
and the dream of this ambitious, resolute, unscrupulous soldier-
statesman was a united, large Germanic state, Saxony and Poland,
between Germany and Russia, with the Crown of the Jargellons
hereditary in the family of the Electors of Saxony.</p>

<p>Flemming regarded Maurice, as always, as a tiresome, insolent
adventurer and he had inspired Augustus II with some of his own
ideals concerning the future of Poland or, at least, Augustus,
who every day was further decayed in spirits, agreed out of
apathy to pretend to believe in these ideals. In any case, the
King-Elector had other reasons for keeping fair with Russia. He
had been even more than usually extravagant in the magnificence
with which he maintained his position and he wanted money; there
were new palaces to pay for and new favourites demanding
gold.</p>

<p>The King-Elector, therefore, ordered his son to return to
Saxony.</p>

<p>Maurice, dazzled with the prospect of a throne, and encouraged
by the help of Anna Ivanowa, maintained an attitude of haughty
defiance more in accordance with his obstinate, reckless
character than from any dictates of prudence or reason.</p>

<p>The breach between Augustus II and Maurice widened, and
finally the King-Elector was roused to take strong measures
against the disobedient son and rebellious subject.</p>

<p>But even now Maurice might have achieved at least a certain
measure of success, had he not carelessly played fast and loose
with the enamoured Russian princess who was his hostess and his
most powerful ally.</p>

<p>It would have been both common prudence and common gratitude
to have maintained some sort of fidelity towards his betrothed at
least until their marriage day. But Maurice allowed his essential
lightness of character and his love of coarse, careless
debaucheries to ruin his chances with the niece of Peter the
Great.</p>

<p>With equal carelessness and bad taste he entered into an
intrigue with a young woman who was in the service of the Dowager
Duchess. This charmer was lodged on the ground floor; her window
was near to those in the apartments occupied by Maurice, and it
was his rash and foolish custom to visit her or to allow her to
visit him by means of these windows almost every night.</p>

<p>On one occasion when his mistress was with him, the snow fell
heavily and when the moment arrived when it seemed even to
Maurice prudent for her to leave his apartments, he found that it
would be impossible for her to do so without leaving her
footprints in the courtyard.</p>

<p>He thereupon took her without the least difficulty, for she
was small and he was still prodigiously strong, on his shoulders
and was proceeding across the snowy courtyard from his window to
a point in the garden where he believed she could scramble back
along a frozen path to her own room without leaving her tracks
behind her, when, unfortunately, Maurice and his fair burden were
met by an old servant going the rounds with a lantern.
Recognising both the cavalier and the lady, the old woman gave a
shrill cry of either alarm or malice. Maurice, who hoped he had
not been recognised, tried to knock the lantern out of her hand
but, encumbered as he was, he slipped in the ice and snow,
knocking the old woman down with him.</p>

<p>The adventure, though perhaps romantic in its beginning, was
undoubtedly ridiculous in its ending. Attracted by the old
woman's indignant cries and the curses of Maurice, the guard came
running up and at once recognised the new Duke of Courland and
one of the Dowager Duchess's servants. The news of the scandal
spread like a spurt of wild fire. Anna Ivanowa heard of it almost
immediately. The haughty Russian fell into a frenzy of fury and
sent Maurice out of her palace and out of her life. It was the
first time that a woman had turned on him and he was too amazed
to be angry.</p>

<p>It is uncommon for a man fascinating enough to fix the
affections of an imperious, difficult and powerful woman to be
faithful enough to retain them, and Maurice did not possess the
art nor the flexibility to disguise his lapses from constancy.
Anna had already been disgusted with his continual love intrigues
in Mitau and this gross incident in her own palace was too much.
She redeemed the folly that made her believe herself capable of
retaining the sole attentions of this universal lover by the
fortitude with which she dismissed him from her mind and
heart.</p>

<p>The Duchess had the good sense to disdain the forced imitation
of passion and penitence that Maurice put up and to bestow her
favours where their considerable value was better appreciated;
she promised her hand to the Duke of Hesse-Homburg, a Prince less
attractive than the brilliant Saxon but not of a disposition so
light and roving.</p>

<p>Another misfortune swiftly followed; Maurice's election to the
throne of Courland was annulled by the Diet of Poland, acting
under pressure from Augustus II; this Diet was considered
superior to that of Courland; Maurice was ordered to leave Mitau
and to return his diploma of election.</p>

<p>Thereupon he wrote to his father about his "honour" and his
"prestige" and tried to raise money in various quarters and even
to invoke the aid of England. But the combined efforts of Poland
and Russia were, however, too much even for the inflexible Duke-
Elect. He was obliged to retire to Libau to avoid arrest and
finally to the island of Usmaiz, where he employed himself in
forcing the peasants to build fortifications and in summoning the
Courlanders to his assistance.</p>

<p>The Empress Catherine had now died (May 17, 1727) and her
successor, the Emperor, Peter II, or his ministers resolved to
settle the affair of Courland in good earnest.</p>

<p>Russian troops dislodged Maurice from the island of Usmaiz,
seized his baggage and his followers, and forced him to retreat
to Windau in a fury of temper, with the treasured but useless
diploma of his election as the sole relic of his adventure;
Poland put a price on his head.</p>

<p>He wrote to his nephew, the Comte de Friesen: "I don't know
any more than a stray wolf where my next lodging will be." And he
added with a cynicism that came from a barren heart: "There is a
price upon my head and the sum promised so high that I can expect
my best friend to betray me."</p>

<p>The death of his protectress, Catherine, had deprived the
other adventurer, Mentchikof, of the hopes of Courland. He still,
however, felt bitter towards Maurice and with eight thousand men
followed him and his ragged mercenaries; Maurice talked in bold
and bombastic terms, but the end had come. His flight became so
hurried that not only the baggage but even the precious diploma
of election had to be abandoned; finally he burnt, in a fit of
temper, all the love-letters he had received during the
adventure.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December, 1727, the Diet of Courland declared
illegal the vote of the 26th June, 1726. The women had made the
adventure possible and the women had ruined it. It is a vast
misfortune for an ambitious man to be unable to provoke the
attention and help of at least one intelligent, able and charming
woman, and a succession of petty mistresses&mdash;dancers,
actresses, chambermaids, great ladies and camp
followers&mdash;prevented Maurice from ever achieving the
possession of a woman who might have been of the least use to
him.</p>

<p>His quarrel with his wife had given him an adventurous air
even for that period and his failure with Anna Ivanowa cost him
not only the Courland but the throne, possibly, of all the
Russias.</p>

<p>There was now nothing for him but to return to Dresden where
he was reconciled with the easy King-Elector and employed himself
in designing liveries for his lackeys and having the arms of
Courland placed on all his appointments, the purple and ermine of
Gotlar-Kettlar, the red lion of Courland, the wild goat of
Semigallia.</p>

<p>The whole adventure had had a tinge of the grotesque, almost
of the ridiculous. There was a touch of <i>opéra bouffe</i> about
the extravagance of the episode. Maurice had appeared as a man
who had no thought for anything but his personal advancement and
not sufficient finesse to accomplish that; only the flourish with
which he carried off his ill success prevented it from becoming
absurd. Notable, too, is the utter lack of honour and honesty
among all the actors in the Courland interlude.</p>

<p>After a short period of reflection in the stately retreat of
Quedlinburg, Maurice repaired with all his bravery and Courland
liveries to Danzig, where Anna Ivanowa then was with her dying
mother-in-law, with the object of exerting all his fascination to
regain the Russian's interest.</p>

<p>But it was in vain. The Dowager Duchess received him coldly
and eyed his splendour with indifference. However brilliant he
might be, she was but a step now from the Imperial throne and an
Empress does not need to search for lovers or to share their
caresses with the least of her sex.</p>

<p>The Russian princess announced her approaching marriage to the
Duke of Hesse-Homburg with malicious calm, and Maurice retreated,
discomfited before a woman for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>He was now rather at a loss as to his next move, and Augustus
II scarcely knew what to do with the son whose reputation so far
exceeded his achievements.</p>

<p>A lovely widow of immense riches was now proposed to Maurice
by the King-Elector and accepted eagerly enough by that young
nobleman, whose fortune was so much in need of repair and whose
position was so unstable.</p>

<p>Prudent considerations were, however, unable to keep Maurice
constant till the wedding day, and the wealthy bride-to-be
rejected her giddy lover for the same cause that Anna Ivanowa had
withdrawn her favour from the fickle Saxon.</p>

<p>In all these humiliations and misfortunes there always
remained the brilliant and constant devotion of Adrienne de
Lecouvreur. She had been true to him for five years, and when he
returned to Paris she received him with passionate tenderness,
declaring that she loved him more in his misfortune than she
would have done if he had returned as a Sovereign Duke-Elect, and
not even mentioning the large sums of money that she had
squandered on a hopeless cause.</p>

<p>Before the reckless, disappointed adventurer she placed the
attractions of a sentimental woman's love dreams. The little
cottage at Daumartin, was it not more beautiful than all the
courts in the world? Could not they live there alone, happy and
free?</p>

<p>Adrienne might have been able to do so, but Maurice could not.
He was glad of the famed actress's flattery, of her caresses, of
her tenderness and sympathy, he was glad of her money and her
jewels, he was glad of the prestige of being the lover of so
famous and coveted a woman, but he could not give her much of his
time.</p>

<p>"I do not hope," sighed Adrienne sadly, "ever to be
happy."</p>

<p>She doubted, too, if <i>he</i> could ever be happy.</p>

<p>"What will remain to you at the end of all your adventures?"
she asked him. "What is before me?"</p>

<p>She could see nothing ahead but disillusionment, fatigue and
early death. Her tears flowed daily, her health was really
undermined, her beauty fading; she was approaching her fortieth
year.</p>

<p>Maurice began to find her tears, the emotional displays she
indulged in, her exactions, insupportable. She was deeply
humiliated. But Maurice could never find anything humiliating in
any relationship with a woman.</p>

<p>His infidelities once more became careless and open; Adrienne
constantly created scenes of furious jealousy and wrote in a tone
of bitter despair to the devoted friend the Comte d'Argental: "I
am half-crazy with rage and misery. Is it not just for me to cry
out against his treachery? This man <i>ought</i> to know me,
<i>ought</i> to love me! Oh, my God! What are we? What are
we?"</p>

<p>But he still called himself "her admirer, friend and lover,"
and still kept for her that intermittent affection which alone
held her to life, for he had become with her an obsession. She
lived for his visits, to write him letters, to express on the
stage the passion with which he had inspired her&mdash;love,
jealousy, despair, mingled in one frenzied agony.</p>

<p>Maurice had indeed other things to think of; he was still
searching for an establishment, a wealthy wife, a dukedom, a
war&mdash;anything that would satisfy his energy and set him up
where he wished to be, above his fellows. He had not neglected
his mathematical studies during the Courland excitement, nor had
he, after all, been forced to sell his regiment; while besotted
women continued to strip themselves of their jewellery to give
him all the toys and pleasures he needed.</p>

<p>The affairs of France had changed since he had arrived in
Paris in the year of the downfall of John Law. Louis XV was now
of age and had married a Polish princess, the daughter of that
Stanislas who for a brief period had replaced Augustus II on the
throne of Poland.</p>

<p>Dubois and the Regent had both passed from the scene, but they
had left a permanent impression on the society of France. There
was no change in the tone of Paris; Maurice still found himself
much at ease in the <i>salons,</i> in the racing stables, at the
gambling tables, the <i>foyer</i> of the Opéra, in the
<i>loge</i> of the <i>Comédie Française.</i></p>

<p>European politics and the international condition of France
were to him alike, nothing of the least interest. He had been
quick enough to see, when he glanced round Courland, how famine,
pestilence and war could ruin a country and how necessary economy
and good management were for its revival. But he was not prepared
to give attention to these matters in as far as they affected
France.</p>

<p>He spent recklessly and cared nothing at all where the money
came from, and he hoped that his always desperate finances would
soon receive some replenishment from an unexpected source.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck died at the age of forty-eight; she
left a reputation for gentleness, wit, and even for chastity, for
if she had had no husband she had had only one lover and the
Lutheran cloisters of Quedlinburg had never been disturbed by any
of the exotic gaieties of Moritzburg.</p>

<p>She had loved Maurice with wistful tenderness, but he sent a
representative to mourn this devoted friend, this kind adviser,
at her funeral and was disgusted to find that she had, after all,
not been making a hoard for him and that she had not left behind
enough for him to keep his creditors quiet, at least for a while,
and to indulge his extravagance afresh.</p>

<p>The friend appointed by Maurice to enquire into the estate
left by his mother had to report that she had left only a few
<i>écus</i> and only a few pieces of furniture, hardly worth the
trouble of moving from the cloisters of Quedlinburg.</p>

<p>Aurora von Königsmarck had been indeed like the pelican in her
piety, she had pierced her own breast in order to feed her young
with her life blood. Not only with her treasure, but with her
energy, her wit, her charm, had she supplied the greedy demands
of the child who had by his birth deprived her of health and
beauty.</p>

<p>She was buried in the vaults of the church attached to the
Abbey, where the chemical qualities of the sandstone had so long
preserved in a mummified condition the bodies of long dead
Imperial men and women.</p>

<p>There was no one to preserve the memory of Aurora, though her
body might, for a long while, be kept intact; she remained
forgotten in the Hartz Mountains, which she had looked upon first
with the curious eyes of a stranger when the Electoral carriage
had driven her to Goslar. More than a hundred years after her
death the tomb of Aurora von Königsmarck was opened and her
beauty, as well as her splendid dress, found to be well conserved
by the curious properties of the vault. It was said that traces
of her great charm could still be seen on her features; she wore
a gown of silver brocade, a "Mary Stewart" bonnet of white velvet
with a border of silver lace and pearls, white silk stockings and
white satin shoes. The great Emperor who lay beside her was but a
handful of dust.</p>

<p>With the death of Aurora, all hopes of any portion of the
fortune of the Königsmarcks was lost to Maurice.</p>

<p>In 1703 Count von Löwenhaupt had gone to Hamburg, to try to
obtain some satisfaction from the bankers who held Count Philip's
property, but in vain; the murdered man's papers had disappeared;
thirty-three years later there was a tentative promise of a
search for them in the Archives of Hanover, given to Von Koller,
agent for the heirs of Count Philip, but this came to nothing,
and the huge fortune continued to be held back by the Jums of
Lastop, von Hartoge and Stamped, nor did any of the descendants
of the Königsmarck ever see the splendid jewel, the seven-headed
snake valued at 40,000 <i>thalers</i> or the "brown chemical
powder" supposed to be the <i>lapis philosophorum.</i></p>

<p>Maurice was not checked in his reckless expenditure by the
loss of this valuable ally who could always be relied upon to
pester or cajole some money or some benefit from Augustus II, or
to wring some loans from the Hamburg bankers on the remnants of
the once magnificent fortunes of the Königsmarcks.</p>

<p>The adventurer went from capital to capital, spending,
gambling, followed by women, lackeys, flatterers. His object was
now to reconcile himself with his father, the only person from
whom he could hope to receive substantial benefits; he felt
offended because a larger portion of Saxony was not carved off
for his benefit than the trifling estates that he disdained.</p>

<p>True, Augustus II had numerous bastards, but none so worthy of
his patronage as Maurice, surely, and M. de Saxe continued to
complain fiercely of his enemies, Count Flemming and Count
Manteuffel, who were always at his father's ear with tales of his
worthlessness. Maurice could see no fault in himself&mdash;"I
have nothing with which to reproach myself," he wrote indignantly
to one of his friends in his bad French, for despite Aurora's
early care he never mastered that elegant language, and his
German accent pleased the ladies as much as it irritated the
lords of the court of France.</p>

<p>A few months after the death of his mother, Maurice, who
continued to make Paris his headquarters and Adrienne his
<i>maítresse-en-titre,</i> but who was often <i>en voyage,</i>
was at Moritzburg, where his father had consented to receive him
among the baroque surroundings where Aurora had played her brief
love-story.</p>

<p>The gallant cavalier who had so easily seduced the lovely
Swede was now nothing but a pitiful and dreadful monument to vice
and folly. His once handsome person was bloated and diseased, the
face that had once been so charming under the bright blond curls
was covered with eruptions and carbuncles, the bald head
disguised by a floured wig, or in moments of privacy with a silk
foulard; the once famous strength was gone, sapped by every kind
of sensuous excess, and the man, whose heroic physique had once
been legendary, could now hardly totter from his couch to his
chair. Gout gave constant and exquisite torture; his swollen
limbs were swathed in bandages, his crippled fingers could grasp
neither sword nor pen and all that life had ever meant to him was
like ashes in his mouth.</p>

<p>Maurice regarded his father with cynic calculation and took no
warning from this spectacle of ruined manhood, being wheeled
round the lakes and along the glades where he had once performed
those athletic feats that had earned him the name of Augustus the
Strong.</p>

<p>The only thought in the younger man's mind was how much money
he could possibly squeeze from his peevish and reluctant
parent.</p>

<p>While he was engaged in this tedious task, in the spring of
1728, he lost his worst enemy a few months after he had lost his
best friend. The news of the death of General Count Flemming was
brought to father and son at Moritzburg; Augustus II was
indifferent, the delight of Maurice was brutal. The details of
the death and burial of the stern statesman were discussed over
the bottles&mdash;wine for Maurice&mdash;medicine for His
Majesty&mdash;served on the gold and silver platters in the
opulent hunting-box.</p>

<p>Some ugly gossip was going round Dresden; Flemming had left a
young and pretty widow who did not in the least mourn him; nay,
it was said that so far was she from observing even outward
decency that when she had learnt that the coffin made for her
dead husband was too small for him, she had ordered his limbs to
be broken sooner than provide another for him. At this tale
Maurice gave his deep and hearty laugh; it was very much to his
taste.</p>

<p>"The lady gives her husband after his death the punishment he
should have had during his lifetime from your Majesty," he said,
referring to death by "breaking on the wheel" then the usual mode
of disposing of traitors or fallen politicians.</p>

<p>Augustus II, at heart good-natured, and always courteous in
his speech, rebuked his son for this coarseness&mdash;"One does
not insult the memory of one's enemy."</p>

<p>But the King-Elector showed even greater brutal cynicism,
however, when he suggested that Maurice should marry the fair and
heartless widow and receive with her the vast fortune that Count
Flemming had gathered together during a lifetime of prudence or
rapacity according as he might have been judged.</p>

<p>Maurice was willing to listen to this shameless suggestion; he
was never nice where women or money were concerned, and Augustus
II thought that his late minister's estate would serve very well
to keep his own scoundrel son quiet for a while.</p>

<p>Maurice put the prospect before Adrienne who still contrived
to send him those passionate love letters that he found
convenient for shaving papers. She had helped him in the
disastrous attempt to win Anna Ivanowa, what did she think of
this matrimonial project?</p>

<p>Nothing. Even her complaisance did not go as far as this,
amidst all her desperate protestations of love and her gossip of
the French court she declared her dislike and distrust of this
scheme; it was even, she said, "dangerous." It, in any case, fell
through, and by the autumn of that year Maurice was again in
Paris. Adrienne received him with a rapture perhaps the more
delicious as she herself felt "<i>la fin des beaux jours,"</i>
approaching.</p>

<p>Accomplished actress as she was she could play this part
superbly; in her silk and gauze, with her pearls, fards and
powder she could assume the beauty she was losing and turn the
fever of her malady into the ardour of passion.</p>

<p>She could sit still at her little Chinese painted clavecin and
evoke tender melodies and exquisite memories, she could still
surround her lover with an adulation that was the very essence of
adoration. But beneath all this she was an ageing, fading, dying
woman. Maurice did not long remain satisfied with this
suffocating passion.</p>

<p>His dream was still of glory, of a throne; he began to meddle
in the Courland affair again, intriguing with Lefort and some
Courlanders whom he went to see at Danzig.</p>

<p>"Will you leave me for these barbarians?" cried Adrienne in
agony.</p>

<p>He was only too eager to do so; there was another marriage
broached by Lefort; this time a daughter of Peter the Great,
Elizabeth, cousin of the Empress, whom Maurice had lost through
the Mitau escapade. Elizabeth was not easy; she wanted, she said
crudely, "To see the goods before she bought them." Maurice was,
of course, certain of pleasing her or any other woman, but
Augustus II was against the project; he had more dignity than his
son and disliked to see even a bastard of Saxony so constantly
playing the adventurer and "<i>le galopin."</i></p>

<p>Disgusted and discouraged, Maurice continued to wander round
Europe, leading a life of such disorder that even the brief
reports of it that reached Adrienne filled her with shame and
self-scorn, and even, at last, with weariness. "Everything
combines to separate us," she wrote, almost on a note of
resignation. Maurice, however, soon after returned to Paris and
outwardly to his life with Adrienne; he gave her but a divided
attention; his longing gaze was ever on Courland and those
sensual, arrogant, spiteful Romanoff women whom he might even yet
win.</p>

<p>For all his reckless frivolity he was conscious of the passing
of time; like all hedonists he had his cold fits.</p>

<p>Reviews and hunting parties, balls and carnivals, could not
last for ever and when they were over Maurice de Saxe, however
much praised and caressed, was still landless and without a
definite status or occupation.</p>

<p>The Courland affair had now taken on a further turn of the
grotesque. Harassed alike by the Poles and Russians, the
Courlanders thought of a desperate expedient to end the struggle
for the succession and forced a wife, Princess Johanna Magdalena
of Saxe-Weissenfels, on the old, feeble, and reluctant Duke
Ferdinand, who was recalled from Danzig in the hope that an heir
might still bless the ancient House of Kettlar.</p>

<p>This marriage stirred Maurice to further attempts on the
favour of the Czarina, but the agent he employed to speak for him
was dismissed the Imperial service and Anna Ivanowa who, on the
death of Peter II, had ascended the Imperial throne, chose a more
tactful lover and a less impetuous adventurer, Count Biron, to be
Duke of Courland, an appointment against which Maurice protested
with equal bitterness and futility.</p>

<p>He had now nothing better to do than to reclothe his regiment,
exchange the diversions of Dresden for the diversions of Paris
and endeavour to invent a mechanical boat or barge&mdash;a
failure on which he expended more money than he could well
afford. He also amused himself with a new mistress, coldly chosen
from those who competed for his favours, Louise Henriette-
Françoise, d'Harcourt Lourraine, Duchesse de Bouillon, who, bold
wanton as she was, set herself out to snare him deliberately and
when he was won, and won easily, to flaunt him in the eyes of the
faithful and lachrymose Adrienne de Lecouvreur.</p>

<p>Madame de Bouillon was the fourth wife of a man forty years
her senior and very feeble. Fashionable Paris watched with
amusement the combat between the two women for the favours of the
fickle libertine. Maurice did not entirely break with Adrienne;
not only did her homage flatter his greedy vanity, he feared the
furious scenes that neglect on his part provoked from her. On the
other hand, Madame de Bouillon suited his taste and his mood
exactly; he was the male to her female, artless, callous, coarse
and brilliant; she was full of vitality, too, tall, quick moving,
with large black eyes and a wide red mouth.</p>

<p>Adrienne found some revenge through her art. On one occasion
when she played Phédre she directed some of her most poignant
lines at the Duchesse de Bouillon, then seated in a box near the
stage&mdash;the lines in which Phédre declares she was not "one
of those bold women who did not know how to blush."</p>

<p>The great lady could not contain her open indignation, and the
cynical and fashionable audience applauded the courage of the
outraged actress. Maurice remained complacent&mdash;cats'
tongues&mdash;coated with sugar!</p>

<p>The story of Adrienne de Lecouvreur now took on a more
melodramatic and sinister turn into events still obscure; this
much is known; a hunchback miniature painter, the <i>abbé</i>
Bouret, was sent to the Bastille for a mysterious crime; all
crimes were, indeed, in those times mysterious; the Law worked
and struck in secret and was largely in the hands of the King,
his Ministers, and the powerful nobles.</p>

<p>A dark tale, however, soon ran round about the unhappy little
miniaturist, who had been for a long time a factotum among the
ladies whose portraits he so delicately sketched on his
ivories.</p>

<p>The story, which has been preserved by Mlle Aissé, a fellow-
actress with Adrienne at the <i>Comédie Française,</i> was that
Mlle de Lecouvreur had one day received an anonymous letter,
begging her to go to the gardens of the Luxembourg and there
behind a tree in one of the principal avenues (carefully
indicated on a plan enclosed in the epistle) she would find a man
who would have "something very important to tell her."</p>

<p>When Adrienne de Lecouvreur arrived at the trysting place she
found the <i>abbé,</i> who showed her a little box full of
poisoned pastilles. According to his tale the Duchesse de
Bouillon had given him these to hand to Adrienne when he should
next be received in her easy circle of friends and
acquaintances.</p>

<p>At this terrible news the actress prayed the miniature painter
to accompany her to M. Henault, Lieutenant of Police; he did so
and in the police office one of the pastilles was given,
brutally, to a dog, who died a few minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>The <i>abbé</i> was sent to the Bastille but, so the story
goes, through the influence of Madame de Bouillon, was soon
released. Nothing could be proved against him, but it seems
doubtful whether, if he had been employed by the great lady to
murder her rival and then betrayed her, she would have taken the
trouble about his fate in prison, unless he was clever enough to
conceal his exposure of her scheme.</p>

<p>That, at least, was the tale, or one of the many tales that
were going round Paris about the rivalry between the actress and
the duchess for the favours of Maurice de Saxe; and it is certain
that Bouret was sent to prison because of some attempt on the
life of Adrienne and that, though Maurice might be unfaithful to
his Adrienne, he soon proved himself cold towards the great
lady.</p>

<p>Once more the story of violent death touched an intimate of
Maurice de Saxe; two of his brothers had come to their deaths by
the sword; there had been his wife's supposed attempts to poison
his mother and himself, and now there was this loud rumour that
one of his mistresses was striving to poison another. All these
incidents show more the temper of the age than anything peculiar
to the destiny of Maurice.</p>

<p>It is extremely doubtful, moreover, whether the Duchesse de
Bouillon, though no doubt extremely enraged by the coldness of
her magnificent lover, really did try to poison the actress. Mlle
de Lecouvreur was dying by inches and had been doing so for
months, and these tales of poison in a bouquet of flowers, in a
cup of chocolate, in a lozenge or a handkerchief are
fantastic.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for the Duchesse de Bouillon to find
these means of disposing of her rival; a long illness was
depriving Adrienne de Lecouvreur, first, of her beauty, then of
her strength, then of her love for the theatre, but never of her
love for Maurice. She had been complaining of her health for
years; she was undoubtedly tubercular, but the illness that
killed her was dysentery, hence perhaps the talk of poison. And
poison, no doubt, it was, but not given by the hand of another
woman.</p>

<p>The great actress tried to remain on the stage to the last,
but a terrible bout of illness attacked her when she was playing
Jocaste in Voltaire's <i>Oedipus</i> on March 15, 1730. She
contrived to get through her part, but fainted as the fringed
velvet curtain slid together, and was carried home, so weak that
she could not raise her arms from above her heart where they were
folded.</p>

<p>Maurice and M. d'Argental hastened to attend her in the
splendid rooms in which she had so often entertained them both;
the lover was admitted to the bedchamber he had often disdained
to share.</p>

<p>She had nothing more to give him, not even reproaches. She did
not remind him of any of the troubles or pain to which he had put
her, or of the vast sums of money she had spent upon him. Actress
to the last, she contrived to give her death from a disgusting
disease the air of a classic sacrifice.</p>

<p>There were horrible scenes in her rooms&mdash;servants,
lackeys, flatterers were plundering her even before the eyes of
her friends; the rooms were being despoiled as if Paris was being
sacked.</p>

<p>A priest was summoned and proved to be the <i>curé</i> of her
parish, Saint Sulpice, one obstinate, coarse-grained and awkward,
in the estimation of her friends. He was a Jesuit, by name
Languet de Gergy; he offered the dying woman absolution only upon
the terms that she repented of her theatrical career. The sins of
the flesh might be pardoned her, but not that she had been ever
connected with the theatre. The man seems to have done his plain
duty. It was all very well to talk of charity, but what reverence
had this crowd of atheists ever paid the Church?</p>

<p>Adrienne cared little for the disputes that were going on
round her bedside; her friends, pressing the stern priest to
stretch a point, he refusing. For long, as she had written
recently to Maurice, she had neither slept nor ate and she would
prefer death to a continuance of her suffering.</p>

<p>"How happy we shall be," she had cried to her lover, "when we
are free; you from me and I from life."</p>

<p>As the indecorous disputes continued round her bed, the dying
actress had the final word. Struggling up in bed, torn by
paroxysms of coughing, blood upon her pillows and her
handkerchief, she had strength enough for a last dramatic
cry.</p>

<p>Her lover, bored and impatient, was for the moment out of the
room, but a small bust of him stood upon a pedestal near her bed.
She turned to this, outstretching her arms in her last strength,
opening her large blue eyes for the last time and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There is my universe! My hope and my god!"</p>

<p>As soon as her eyes were closed the quarrel beyond her bed-
curtains became fiercer.</p>

<p>Was she, or was she not to have Christian burial? The hope of
obtaining that for her was the reason why her relatives had
brought the Jesuit to her bedside. But he now, as they had feared
he would, refused this grace to the miserable corpse; the actress
had not repented of her profession, the courtesan of her lusts;
she had not shown any sign of submitting to the discipline of the
Church. The priest was logical; but his refusal meant that
Adrienne could have no decent resting place.</p>

<p>What, then, was to be done with the remains of one of the most
beautiful, celebrated and charming women of her time, one who had
been an inspiration, a delight to so many, who had numbered among
her friends the most cultured and intelligent people of the most
cultured capital in Europe?</p>

<p>Here indeed was a difficulty; the Cardinal de Fleury, a mild,
modest, honest, if not very able, man, who was the first minister
of Louis XV after he had attained his majority, arranged with M.
de Maurepas a plan to avoid all possible scandal in this
regrettable affair.</p>

<p>Two police officers were sent at night to take the body of
Adrienne de Lecouvreur away and inter it as quietly as possible.
The small corpse was to be got rid of as if it had been that of a
criminal or a suicide.</p>

<p>And she had been termed one of the wonders of Paris. "In
Greece," Voltaire had written of her, "she would have had an
altar." But in Paris she could scarcely obtain a grave.</p>

<p>Now that she had been refused not only Christian but any other
kind of official burial, her body was hastily wrapped in one of
her own sheets and the two policemen took it away at night in a
cab <i>(fiacre),</i> in which it was driven to a piece of waste
land near the Faubourg St. Germain, and there flung down among
the other refuse of the great city, a sack of quicklime emptied
over it and left. One friend, a M. de Loubinière, is known to
have accompanied the police.</p>

<p>Some tales say that Maurice de Saxe followed this sad funeral.
Others that he went at once to her stables to arrange the sale of
her famous horses.</p>

<p>As he had sent a substitute to represent him at his mother's
funeral and shown on that occasion a great anxiety as to how much
money Aurora von Königsmarck had left, it may be that the last
anecdote is truer than the first.</p>

<p>Maurice had seldom mentioned his mother once she was dead, and
he never mentioned Adrienne de Lecouvreur; he had taken all she
had to give and he had made her happier than she had ever been
through any other person or any other thing. He had given her the
excuse for the passion, the emotion that was her life and her
art, by which she lived until it killed her; he had made possible
her reputation of "a sacrifice to love." He helped her to create
the legend in which she will always live as long as men and women
are interested in amorous passion.</p>

<p>After all the compassion given and indignation expressed for
the fate of such as Adrienne de Lecouvreur, the fact remains that
the wronged and love-slain heroine could not achieve her doleful
and immortal crown without the perfidious lover.</p>

<p>We do not know if Maurice, joining others in the scramble for
the spoils of the actress's establishment, obtained at a bargain
price or as a legacy the fine horses he coveted, but some
posthumous benefits Adrienne did confer on this "<i>beau
comte</i>." She had shown him some verses that M. Voltaire had
written in her honour and he had kept a copy; impressed by the
effectiveness of the poet's praise, Maurice had asked and
obtained some model love letters to send to Adrienne; facsimiles
of these he preserved together with that precious parchment, the
diploma of his election to the Duchy of Courland, which Beauvais,
his body servant, had rescued at last from the baggage abandoned
in the flight from Windau. Some day, he thought, these delicious
love letters, written by an expert both in life and language,
might be useful in winning a woman who expected more than a
brusque demand for her person, her heart and her fortunes. He
also kept letters to himself. We do not know his motive, it can
hardly have been tenderness.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1.3" id="ch1.3"></a>III. A GREAT GENTLEMAN'S
NOTEBOOK</h2>

<p class="first">THE next diversion that offered itself to
Maurice was a summons from his father&mdash;rather relieved at
the end of the too long drawn out idyll with the actress, now
tumbled into a ditch&mdash;to help receive in Dresden the King of
Prussia, who was paying an incognito visit to His Majesty of
Poland.</p>

<p>Frederick William, a pedantic and unbalanced tyrant, had to be
entertained with resplendent honour and was impressed and
delighted by a flamboyant military display at the camp of
Muhlberg, which was on such a scale of ostentation that the horse
and harness of every sub-lieutenant were valued at a thousand
crowns; the King-Elector boasted three tables with twenty-four
covers, all gold, and two or three hundred covers all silver,
while his tents were valued at ten million livres. He himself
contrived to have his bloated carcass hoisted on a horse and to
hold himself in the saddle at the great review. All this
stimulated and excited Maurice, who was lodged royally and
supplied with an equipage equal to that or his brother, the
Electoral Prince, who was far too lazy to object.</p>

<p>These opulent excitements and the praises of their Majesties
may have been a little embittered for Maurice by the reflection
that Anna Ivanowa was now Empress of All the Russias and
completely indifferent both to his prowess and the applause it
excited, while the other Russian princess, Elizabeth, for whom
the Imperial diadem seemed a distinct possibility, had shown no
interest in the schemes of M. Lefort to marry her to Maurice.</p>

<p>After the glitter of the parade ground, the carnage of the
hunts, the gorging and swilling of the military banquets, where
the manners were not as refined as the porcelain and the plate,
Maurice returned to Paris.</p>

<p>He had a fit of seriousness; the energetic side of his nature,
his real talents asserted themselves; he often turned to his
military studies after the dissipations and idleness of the day,
spending his night in his study, reading ancient authors on
military science, throwing his own ideas on paper.</p>

<p>Was he at all disturbed by the thought of that deserted
cottage at Daumartin where Adrienne had dreamed to end her days
with him, by the thought of that hole in the waste land where the
quicklime ate her bones? He wrote, he said, "because of
sleeplessness and '<i>pour dissiper mes ennuis.</i>'"</p>

<p>These midnight jottings, mostly on military science were
termed <i>Mes Rêveries;</i> these were published six years after
his death, but some sheets he sent to his father, together with
some plans for a new cannon; he had always been a busy
correspondent and his letters, in particular those to his father,
from the first showed vigour and a certain skill in the use of
words.</p>

<p>These gifts were apparent in these jottings thrown off to
relieve tedium and the burden of an empty heart.</p>

<p>Some time before the year 1732, when he composed in "thirteen
nights" his <i>Rêveries,</i> he had tried his hand at an
autobiography&mdash;the fashionable "Memoirs" of the period, and
these, found afterwards in the archives of Dresden, are of
considerable interest.</p>

<p>They are inaccurate in detail and fragmentary, but they
contain acute character studies of Augustus II and of Count
Flemming, and a long relation of the mysterious end of Philip von
Königsmarck.</p>

<p>This is the most valuable part of the fragment; the story is
romantic and unlikely enough in some parts; it has never been
proved completely inaccurate and no doubt represents the account
of the mystery current in the family of the Königsmarcks, for it
was probably this relation that Maurice had heard from his mother
Aurora, Madame Löwenhaupt, his aunt, and his uncle, all three of
whom had been closely connected with the intrigues of the court
of Hanover.</p>

<p>A portion of this autobiography was stolen from Maurice by a
secretary, Saint-Laurent, and found its way&mdash;by what
intrigue is not clear&mdash;into the hands of Count Flemming,
who, indignant at the unjust and violent portrait of himself
therein, took the trouble to sit down and refute the sketch line
by line; declaring sarcastically at the same time that it was
probably the work of some enemy of "the Prince Maurice."</p>

<p>The Saxon adventurer was approaching his thirty-fifth year and
for the first time began to feel twinges of ill-health, when he
composed his <i>Rêveries.</i> Men of his type can only be truly
satisfied while health and money last; Maurice was beginning to
be deprived of the first, though still fairly sure of the second.
It was during an illness that lasted a fortnight that he composed
<i>The Rêveries,</i> as he states himself.</p>

<p>The sentiments expressed in the book show the writer in a
favourable light, especially as they were put on paper, as he
himself says, when he was harassed by "fever." The book is
unequal, hastily composed but shows many kinds of talent. As far
as his axioms of military science go, they reveal the originality
of genius; as regards what he thought of contemporary affairs,
here is a specimen of his opinions.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"What a spectacle the nations present to us to-
day! One sees some men rich, idle and voluptuous, who owe their
happiness to the labours and misery of a multitude who flatter
their passions and who could not exist without preparing for them
new voluptuous delights! This assemblage of men, oppressor and
oppressed, form what one calls society. The most vile and
miserable of men are they who are made its soldiers to defend it
from the other society. It was not with such manners and with
such arms that the Romans vanquished the universe."</p>
<br>

<p>These sentiments, though they show a certain nobility and a
certain shrewdness, were not put into practice by Maurice in his
own career, for he took the world as he found it and acted wholly
selfishly with no attempt to emulate the fabulous ideals that he
called <i>Roman</i> save in his courage.</p>

<p>The rambling notes also show his keen attention to detail. "I
should like to see," he wrote, "soldiers with short hair and with
a wig, grey or black, that they can put on when the weather is
bad. This peruke would look like short hair; it could be combed
and kept in order, and would always appear neat. It would last
for ever and cost no more than twenty sols."</p>

<p>Maurice had much to say on this important point of military
uniform; he had observed keenly all the great armies of Europe
and had approved of none of them. Military science was, he
admitted, dry and tedious and therefore none had concerned
themselves about it very much. True, "the great capitaines" had
left behind them in the way of rules and examples on which one
could build anything exact&mdash;this science was "covered with
shadows." Maurice paid tribute to Gustavus Adolphus, whose
methods had, however, he declared, been followed but
misunderstood and abused; he felt that there was much to be done
to improve the art of war, and among his dreams was that of being
himself a Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>To glance through his book is to see how he had studied this
subject, to him of such overmastering intent, in every detail.
How to raise troops, how to clothe, pay, exercise and prepare
them for battle, how to use them to win battles and so glory,
crowns, thrones, such was the matter of these dreams.</p>

<p>His ideal formation of troops was the legion, founded on the
Roman model, and "giving rein to my imagination in order to
disperse boredom" he put on paper his scheme for legions composed
of four regiments each, each regiment to comprise four centuries
of infantry, fifty of cavalry, fifty of light horse, these
"centuries" to be named battalions of infantry and squadrons of
cavalry and so on. Maurice, lovingly working out this plan,
allowed 881 men to a regiment, and to this number one surgeon; to
his legion of 3,579 men, he allowed one surgeon, one almoner and
two pieces of 12-lb. cannon.</p>

<p>And so the dreams continued, down to details of arms,
encampments, convoys, with constant reference to the heroes
Eugene, Villars, Charles XII, Gustavus Adolphus, and to the
dreamer's favourite military author and close friend, the
Chevalier Folard. Armies of perfectly equipped men, moving like
clockwork must have passed through the energetic mind of Maurice,
as restless from wine, fever and unsatisfied ambition he cast on
paper these sketches, or drew, with perhaps an unsteady hand,
diagrams of guns, studies of uniforms, models of fortifications,
disposition of troops.</p>

<p>What purpose was behind all this careful, even passionate
attention to perfect engines of destruction?</p>

<p>Maurice had no country to defend, no dynasty to uphold, no
people to protect. He thought of his troops as human beings, in
as far as he wished to keep them well fed, warm, comfortably
clothed and sheltered and preserved from all the evils of
campaigns, battles and sieges as far as that was possible, but
this consideration was no more than he would have given his dog
or his horse. He had nothing to say on the purpose of these
continual wars, nor any word of compassion for those involved in
them against their will; he was a professional soldier&mdash;no
more. And the one purpose that he could see in warfare was his
own glory and aggrandisement.</p>

<p>He cast on paper a few "reflections on the propagation of the
human species" that were published in the first edition of the
<i>Rêveries,</i> in which he dryly remarks: "&mdash;after having
treated of the art that instructs us in the method of destroying
human beings it is as well to reflect how we can propagate
them."</p>

<p>Maurice believed that the population of the world had suffered
an <i>"extraordinaire"</i> decline since the time of Julius
Caesar. He states that M. Vauban, sixty years before
(<i>circa</i> 1670) had placed the population of France at twenty
millions and that this number had been diminishing ever since.
Maurice blamed Christian marriage for this state of affairs and
advocated a scheme of easy divorce and continual remarriages that
was "free love" in everything but name.</p>

<p>He suggested pensions <i>(cent écus)</i> for each woman who
had ten living children, <i>quinze écus</i> for fifteen, and
<i>mille écus</i> for twenty offspring. Maurice does not directly
state as much, but no doubt these children <i>("des gens du
commun")</i> were to be soldiers or the wives and mothers of
soldiers. He has some shrewd things to say of women; it cannot be
denied that he had had a fairly wide experience of this "<i>sexe
charmant.</i>" Men, he observed, made the laws and to suit
themselves; the Turks shut women up, but the Christians were
equally tyrannical with their prejudices that caused women
continually to disguise their thoughts and wishes and so made
them false.</p>

<p>If women were free to choose their husbands themselves, and
"for a limited time," all this hypocrisy would vanish, and with
it debauchery, and subsequent sterility, also that false pride in
"being thought a virgin" that handicapped so many women. Instead,
sexual matters would take a natural course and a kind of Arcadia,
or "golden age" of universal love would return. Maurice used the
word love <i>(amour)</i> in the sense in which he had heard it
employed in Paris alcoves; he did not even allow it the dignity
it had gained on the lips of Adrienne de Lecouvreur. Maurice was,
indeed, heartless, insensible to any tenderness, spiritual grace,
delicacy of feeling or warm affection. His complete lack in these
directions a little abashed some of his contemporaries and most
of them were hard and selfish.</p>

<p>A few notes on Poland complete his literary efforts, he had no
time or energy for such labours once the fit of depression had
passed, but he always remained an industrious letter writer with
a facile pen, and his long, detailed and animated epistles are
very characteristic of the man; he never wrote or spoke French
correctly, his grammar was as erratic as his spelling, he coined
words to suit his purpose, but all his writings show a quick
observation, a power of virile expression, a fund of
inexhaustible energy, a complete self-confidence and a
callousness that is not without its charm when combined with so
much brilliance.</p>

<p>Soon after writing his <i>Rêveries,</i> when Maurice was
suffering, not from remorse or loneliness but from a gnawing
boredom, he brought his German Uhlan regiment to Paris, reclothed
and re-instructed the men, and passed them in review on the Plain
of Sablons to the great admiration of the Parisians who had never
seen such perfectly equipped men move like a piece of clockwork
before. Maurice had taken the most extraordinary pains with the
regiment from the top-knots of the men's caps to the buttons on
their gaiters.</p>

<p>These Uhlans were as far as he could get in realisation of his
dreams; the regiment was his toy, a world in little where he was
dictator.</p>

<p>For the rest of his life was becoming stale; he was glutted
with excesses but could not cease them; in everything
conventional, he had taken up with two more light mistresses,
Mlle Carton from the Opera, and Mlle Aissé, Adrienne's friend,
and the authority for the anecdote of the poisoning attempt by
the Duchesse de Bouillon.</p>

<p>But his energy was not to be satisfied either by exercising a
regiment in time of peace or by throwing his thoughts on military
science and human nature on paper or by balls, masques, Operas or
the paid caresses of actresses; his shrewd mind seethed with
intrigues and soon his life shifted into a new pattern.</p>

<p>On February I, 1733, Augustus II, the King-Elector, died; he
broke his leg, stumbling from his carriage, and gangrene
followed.</p>

<p>Maurice gives a flattering portrait of his father in his brief
autobiography, accusing him, however, of laziness, "a continual
lassitude that enervated all his great qualities." Probably
Maurice was as fond of Augustus as he was of any human being and,
besides any natural grief that he may have felt at this loss, he
was disturbed lest it should affect his own unstable
fortunes.</p>

<p>It seemed, indeed, at first that it would close to him the
courts of Warsaw and Dresden, for though France was traditionally
the friend of Poland, a country that she used as a lever against
the Empire, yet the fact that the King, Louis XV, had married
Marie Leczinski, ended in France's spending a million livres in
Poland to secure the election of her father, Stanislas, who was
proclaimed King September 12, 1733. A few days, however, after
this the troops of the Czarina invaded Poland and her man,
Augustus III, brother of Maurice, was elected.</p>

<p>Stanislas fled to Danzig and Augustus III, a man like his
father, splendid, debauched, idle and under the domination of his
ministers, was well content to accept the nominal dignity of King
of Poland and to leave the country as an appanage of Russia.</p>

<p>But Louis XV did not consider it compatible with his glory to
have his father-in-law thus chased ignominiously from the throne
on which he had placed him. As it was impossible for him to
invade Russia, he attacked the Czarina's allies, the
Imperialists, on the frontier of the Low Countries, war being
declared in October, 1733.</p>

<p>Maurice decided, seemingly without hesitation, to serve France
against his own half-brother for whom, however, he always
retained a traditional respect and a certain affection; he always
remained on good terms with Augustus III who had not only
confirmed but augmented his Saxon pension; on the other hand
Maurice had certainly no interest in or affection for Stanislas,
a feeble, uninteresting Prince, who had reluctantly exchanged the
damp grandeurs of Chambord for the yet more dubious glories of
Warsaw.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that Maurice was inspired by the desire
of serving the glory of France or felt bound by his French
commission. But it seems that he was both shrewd and cynical
enough to see where his true interests lay. He had been fortunate
in securing the friendship of Louis XV, whose companion he had
become in his vices and pleasures. The voluptuous and elegant
young King admired the brusque and dashing Saxon. Maurice was
able, by temperament and training, to employ the most subtle of
flatteries, that open, almost rude candour which seems to disdain
to praise and yet in reality does so even with fulsomeness; he
pleased Louis XV and he knew that he would be wise to continue to
do so.</p>

<p>In any case, Maurice showed the professional soldier's
indifference to politics by joining his regiment and serving on
the Rhine under Marshal the Duke of Berwick, Commander-in-Chief
of the armies of Louis XV. Maurice, still <i>Maréchal de
camp,</i> had under his orders twenty companies of grenadiers and
two thousand fusiliers. Serving with him were several Princes of
the Blood, including that Louis, Francois de Bourbon, Prince de
Conti, who had always been his enemy both passive and active.
This young man was the grandson of the claimant to the Polish
crown and the son of the Prince de Conti who was supposed to have
wounded Maurice.</p>

<p>This campaign dragged on with the usual formal tedium of these
pompous wars, and Maurice had little opportunity of showing more
than personal bravery before the army went into winter quarters
to enjoy what was termed the "Truce of Nature" or "of God."</p>

<p>Operations re-commenced in April, 1734, with the bombarding of
the great Rhine towns, Spires, Coblenz and Mainz, when some of
the new bombs recently invented by the Count de Comminges were
used with terrific effect.</p>

<p>The French army, then on the offensive, was divided into three
corps; the first was called the army of the Princes, "L'armée des
Princes," and consisted of 50,000 men commanded by Marshal
Berwick, son of James II of Great Britain and nephew of the great
Marlborough; the second corps was commanded by the duc de
Noailles and contained 25,000 men; Maurice served with the third
corps under the Maréchal de Belleisle. With his usual
impetuosity, however, the Saxon left his division that was
marching on Coblenz to join Berwick at Etlingen, because he had
heard that the Commander-in-Chief intended to force the enemy's
lines. Berwick received him with enthusiasm. He had been
thinking, he said, of sending for a reinforcement of 3,000 men
and here they were to his hand!</p>

<p>And he gave Maurice a detachment of grenadiers with which he
threw himself upon the ranks of the Imperialists with such fury
that he broke them and forced them to retreat, leaving behind a
large quantity of baggage and war material. For this exploit
Maurice was warmly commended by Marshal Berwick; his hopes began
to rise; he saw his glittering ambitions shine brightly.</p>

<p>The General, whom the French were now facing, was the veteran
Prince Eugene, under whom Maurice had served before the walls of
Belgrade; he had always immensely admired this famous soldier,
and with reason; probably the Imperialist General was the
greatest soldier of an age that had bred Marlborough and
Frederick II; he was still, in his old age, with his long yellow
bilious face, half-open mouth and piercing black eyes, his old-
fashioned flowing peruke and well-worn Imperial uniform, more
than a match for Berwick, who was finally killed by a cannon ball
that took off his head when he was visiting the trenches at
Philippsburg; Maurice was conspicuous in the subsequent
operations that ended in the surrender of the town on July 26,
1734. His gallant behaviour was duly reported to Louis XV; the
result of the fall of Philippsburg, where more than 40,000 men
had perished during seven weeks' siege, was for Maurice to be
promoted Lieutenant-General.</p>

<p>He had indeed distinguished himself by many personal exploits
of considerable brilliance, including one romantic adventure when
with some few dozens of grenadiers he had charged two hundred
Austrian Hussars near Zell, where had died not long before the
Sophia Dorothea who had caused the downfall and murder of his
uncle, Philip von Königsmarck.</p>

<p>In October 1734 the army again went into winter quarters and
Maurice returned to Paris, where fireworks and <i>Te Deums</i>
gilded the ineffectiveness of both the war and the peace that
followed with at least a semblance of triumph.</p>

<p>Maurice de Saxe personally had gained both experience and
reputation in the fruitless struggle.</p>

<p>Nothing further of moment occurred in this aimless war, which
continued on the Rhine intermittently until 1736, when it was
terminated by one of the usual ineffectual treaties that left
everything <i>in statu quo.</i></p>

<p>Maurice was again without an occupation, but some of the
staleness had gone from his life; once more he had shone before
his fellows, been praised by the King whom he had chosen to
serve, proved that he could cry "check" even to the veteran
Eugene in this game of war in which he so delighted.</p>

<p>But if the numbers of his friends had increased, he had noted,
with his usual cool shrewdness, that his enemies were becoming
more numerous and more formidable.</p>

<p>The King's friendship for a foreigner&mdash;a bastard
mercenary, too&mdash;was fiercely resented by the arrogant,
cynical, greedy and incompetent "Princes of the Blood," who
claimed by right of birth privileges without number, licence
without limit, and all the honours, prizes, rewards, pensions in
the King's gift. Graceful and accomplished, if insolent and
worthless, this gilded flower of an effete aristocracy was
ornamental enough in time of peace and added greatly to the
reputation for elegance and brilliancy that Paris enjoyed.</p>

<p>But in time of war, they were, to any general who took his
duties seriously, an intolerable nuisance. Untrained and
disdaining any kind of discipline, this <i>maison royale</i> or
<i>troupe dorée</i> accompanied the army in glittering
detachment, dictators in their own regiments, taking no heed of
orders from headquarters, amusing themselves with every luxury
and licence and regarding the campaign merely as an excuse to
display the splendour of their equipages in the camp, and their
personal bravery "on the field of honour," where their dashing
but random exploits often upset the plans of the general in
command and his staff. Maurice, military expert as he was, and
keen on every detail of military science, found it hard to endure
these spoiled, curled minions, with their effeminate
affectations, their insolence, their incapacity, their cool
insubordination, their endless privileges.</p>

<p>They in their turn regarded him as an upstart adventurer,
coarse and overbearing, and were spitefully jealous at his
success. One of them at least, the Prince de Conti, was his
determined enemy.</p>

<p>Maurice knew that these princes "of the blood," who commanded
a large following among the nobility, were dangerous to his hopes
of advancement in the French army; he also knew that it was
hopeless to endeavour to win them over, therefore, with dry
prudence, he cultivated the friendship of the King.</p>

<p>Louis XV, who bears so sad a reputation and who is seldom
mentioned without scorn, was merely what his environment and
upbringing had made him; it is as absurd to blame him for being
what he was as to reproach a piece of warm wax for taking the
shape with which it is stamped.</p>

<p>Early orphaned of both parents, early a King, Louis was the
pupil of the Regent Orleans and the <i>abbé</i> Dubois and their
underlings; by means of superstition and debauchery, of adulation
and luxury, his mind and body were kept in subjection. With all
his senses deadened by a surfeit of pleasures, from the most
refined to the grossest, enervated by an elaborate, senseless
etiquette, trained in complete idleness, the young Monarch grew
up languid, bored and cynical.</p>

<p>He had his share of good qualities; his people named him "well
beloved," and he was always what is expressed in his own language
as "aimable." His taste had been as well looked after as his
morals had been neglected; his person and his manners were, at
this period, fascinating; his graceful figure, his features,
delicate yet manly, his large dark blue eyes and clear complexion
were perfectly fitted for the powdered curls, the gleaming satin
and lustrous velvets that then composed the attire of a
fashionable gentleman.</p>

<p>In appearance, Louis XV was exactly suited to be the sovereign
who ruled over the world depicted by Boucher, Fragonard, Drouais
and Francois Troy.</p>

<p>He was a profoundly unhappy man; moving in a fiction of divine
right and absolute power, he was unable to find more than brief
cures for the long boredom of his idleness, he was a moral
coward, cynic, yet afraid of death and, so well had the priests
done their work on his malleable youth, of hell fire. His
personal tastes had been modest, delicate and refined; he had
been deliberately and coldly debauched, and in debauchery he had
found a dull refuge from his ceaseless "<i>ennui.</i>"</p>

<p>It was his misfortune that the one woman whom he could not
charm was his wife, the chill and bigoted Polish Princess, who
bore his children with aversion and was relieved when her
repulses drove him to other women. He had his standards of
honour, of the glory of France, he was not without capacity for
business, as far as he was allowed to meddle in it, not without
shrewdness in public affairs, and his witty acceptance of his own
puppet position is shown in such remarks of his as&mdash;"Were I
the Mayor of Paris I would have the streets better paved."</p>

<p>Such was the King, then in his early, charming youth that
seemed so full of generous promise, who offered a firm friendship
to the Saxon adventurer, who might be permitted to lose that name
now and take that of Maurice, Comte de Saxe, Lieutenant-General
in the Army of His Most Christian Majesty.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2.1" id="ch2.1"></a>I. CROWNS, SPADES AND
DRUMS</h2>

<p class="first">THE Peace of Vienna was supposed to have brought
some lustre to the lilies; it at least brought amusement to the
Parisians, who enjoyed the sumptuous services in Notre-Dame, the
cheering of the returning troops, the cannons firing their
salutes, the dazzle of the fireworks, the air of glory given by
the news in the <i>Gazette</i> of captured towns and forts; but
there was little tangible result from the war of the Polish
succession; Stanislas had exchanged the odious privations of
Chambord for the Duchy of Lorraine (the one gain made by Cardinal
de Fleury for France), Augustus III was secure on the throne of
Poland and the Emperor was occupied in marrying his daughter, the
Archduchess Maria Theresa, to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had
received that title (in the market since the Medici were extinct)
in exchange for Lorraine, while Russia and Prussia returned to a
state of watchfulness and Spain and the lesser nations to one of
languor. The pack of political cards had been reshuffled without
anyone's being much the gainer thereby.</p>

<p>Maurice took advantage of the peace to go to Dresden, where he
soon became reconciled with his brother, Augustus III, who had
inherited his father's easy nature and indolence of spirit. With
all the good will in the world, however, Augustus III could not
help Maurice to the throne of Courland, on which Anna Ivanowa,
taking advantage of the confusion of the war, had contrived to
place Count Biron, of sinister reputation, on the death of the
last of the Kettlars, the feeble duke whose desperate marriage
had proved fruitless.</p>

<p>Augustus III was governed by Count Bruhl as his father had
been governed by Count Flemming; he asked for nothing but
sufficient money with which to continue the pleasures that filled
his indolence. But Maurice had the good sense to make a friend of
Bruhl, knowing too well what it had meant when he had made an
enemy of Flemming.</p>

<p>The three Saxons were soon on confidential terms and
understood one another perfectly. Maurice was a Northerner
through both parents and only very superficially a Frenchman;
before he left the court of Dresden he accepted a curious office
from his brother and one that might have been given an ugly name,
had it come to the ears of a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Augustus III, like all German Princes, was intensely
interested in Paris; the court of Versailles, the character of
Louis XV, the intrigues and favourites that surrounded him were
both his models for imitation and the food of all his gossip: and
the King-Elector, in common with his fellow potentates of the
Holy Roman Empire, employed a secret correspondent in Paris whose
duty it was to send him all the anecdotes, tittle-tattle and
scandal of that brilliant capital.</p>

<p>This man having lately died, Maurice offered to take his
place. And so the matter was arranged, not without prudent
precautions on the part of Maurice. He foresaw that, if his
occupation was known or any of his letters intercepted, he might
lose everything he possessed in the way of favour or friendship
at the court of France: what he was undertaking might well have
been termed espionage.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to be known by my writing, by my ink or by my
paper," he said. Nevertheless, it was essential that he should
write these scandalous chronicles himself; it was, therefore,
arranged that they were to be sent secretly under seal in the
postbag of the Saxon Minister in Paris and they were to be
addressed to the King, unsigned; the King was to read them, and
then to give them to the Queen (unless they contained anecdotes
too indecent for modest eyes), then Count Bruhl was to peruse
them, then these dangerous papers were to be enclosed for ever in
the archives of Dresden.</p>

<p>The peril of discovery was well understood and both Augustus
III and his half-brother kept his part of the bargain; Maurice
was outspoken and the three at Dresden were discreet. The
packages of sheets of gossip, anecdotes intermixed with political
hints, sketches of influential people, accounts of amusing
incidents and escapades at balls, at hunts, at supper parties and
so on were written down by Maurice and eagerly read by the King,
Queen and the Minister, so that the most intimate life of the
French capital was well known to a foreign sovereign whom any
shifting of the political scene might make the enemy of
France.</p>

<p>Maurice found some amusement in this sly occupation but not
sufficient to occupy his boundless energy; he was now middle-aged
and his once superb health was becoming daily more impaired; when
re-visiting the scenes of his parents' voluptuous pleasures, the
delicious glades of Moritzburg, he had been thrown from his too
spirited horse and had injured the thigh wounded in a skirmish at
Crachnitz, years before; his accident added to his infirmities.
His boasted strength had already been affected by his fatigue and
his excesses; the constitution that seemed of iron began to
languish and he prepared in 1740 to take the baths at Barlaruc in
Languedoc and to meditate somewhat grimly on the stagnation of
his fortunes.</p>

<p>There seemed, strangely enough, no signs of another war in
Europe and without a war where was he?</p>

<p>That dazzling dream of a crown and a kingdom, that too was
farther away than it had ever been. He seemed no nearer to
achieving the brilliant destiny he had hoped for than he had been
when Marlborough had patted him on his rough blond head before
Lille and his father had laughingly admired him in his first
uniform and Saxon gaiters.</p>

<p>He remained at best a German nobleman and at worst a mercenary
soldier and an adventurer. His finances were, as usual, in poor
condition and he had had to borrow money on the fifty thousand
<i>livres</i> given him by Louis XV as <i>brevet de
rétention,</i> and to beg for loans from his half-brother.</p>

<p>His best hope lay in a friendship he had formed with Madame de
Lenormant d'Etioles&mdash;a woman of wit, resolution and taste
and brilliance, who seemed likely to be the King's new favourite
and make her dubious position a permanent one, who admired him
under almost every aspect save that of the lover. There this
lady, later when she was the King's mistress, and who was, at
least, really in love with the King, had fastidious comments to
make. "Maurice de Saxe," she wrote, "doesn't understand anything
of the delicacy of love. The only pleasure he takes in the
society of women can be summed up in the word 'debauchery.'
Wherever he goes he drags after him a train of street
walkers."</p>

<p>She added: "Everything in his private life bespeaks him an
ordinary man; he is only great on the field of battle. As soon as
the engagement is over all his littlenesses return and nothing
remains great about him save the noise of his renown."</p>

<p>For all that she admired, liked and encouraged him; and the
life he led, though it seemed to Madame de Pompadour commonplace,
was the only one possible to a man highly placed and not highly
gifted save in the art of war.</p>

<p>He was profuse, he kept an open table, he surrounded himself
with all who caught his fancy, from the youngest officer of his
regiment to the great lady who did not disdain his brutal
favours, and his establishment vied with those of the Princes of
the blood. He purchased a château at Piples near Boissy-Saint-
Léger, where he had not only the usual occupation of the hunt,
but a private theatre to amuse himself, his friends and
flatterers.</p>

<p>With all this splendour he was a disappointed man. All his
ambitions, his marriage projects had failed; despite the reckless
and flaming air with which he had conducted the Courland business
there is no doubt that he had it most passionately at heart and
desired above everything the possession of these honours, which
he had come so near to wearing and which had been snatched from
him in so tantalising a fashion. He still cherished jealously the
Diploma of Election to the succession of the Kettlars and refused
to part with it for any argument or any money.</p>

<p>Despite the applause he had gained and the splendour of his
exploits he had never been in command of any considerable action
or found any good opportunity of putting into practice the
results of his ardent studies in the science of war. No one was
interested in the doctrines that his <i>Rêveries</i> contained;
Maurice himself did not take these too seriously; he knew that
never would he be able to put them into practice, but his
frustrated talents tormented him.</p>

<p>Madame de Pompadour, fine and delicate as she was, may have
regretted the grossness of the private life of the hero, but the
courtiers of Louis XV cared little for either Maurice's coarse
vices or his frustrated ambition, or for the great general that
he was, potentially.</p>

<p>In their light laughter at the strength of wrist that could,
on the occasion of a picnic at Chantilly, twist a nail to replace
a missing corkscrew or break a horseshoe in half, in their amused
acceptance of the impetuous, lively Saxon as a boon companion in
their frivolous, languid pleasures there was always&mdash;and he
knew it&mdash;a hint of tolerant patronage for the foreigner who
quartered the <i>baton-sinister</i> on the arms of Saxony. Most
of them were secretly his enemies; still foremost among these was
the young Prince de Conti, who loathed this Duke without a duchy
and often ventured to sneer covertly at the alien and bastard
adventurer.</p>

<p>Maurice was now at the period of life when reflections upon
the frailty of human grandeur come readily to the mind, and
visiting the neglected tomb of Louis XIV in the dark gloom of the
Abbey of St. Denis he had remarked with disgust on the
abandonment of the ashes of that resplendent monarch to a mean
solitude; his sense of law and order, of ceremony&mdash;always
strong in him&mdash;was also roused, as was his fellow feeling
for the monarch whose pretensions had been so large, who had so
emphasised the might of power and kingship and carried to such an
enviable height the domination of one personality over a whole
nation, nay, over a whole century.</p>

<p>There the Saxon Lieutenant-General made a suggestion that a
sentry of bodyguards might fittingly honour the mausoleum of the
king who had given such lustre to the arms of France.</p>

<p>This project, which had not occurred to the Bourbons or to any
of those who had benefited by the favours of Louis XIV, was taken
seriously by Maurice, who drew up a scheme for this parade of
honour before the urn of the great king, and another for the
establishment of a barracks in the Isle of Swans to obviate the
danger of billeting soldiers on the Parisians.</p>

<p>Neither scheme was approved by M. de Dangervilliers, Minister
for War; the enterprise and energy of Maurice alike went
unemployed, so he took his insatiable appetite for life, for
action, for splendour, for grandiose achievement to hunting
parties, to the boudoirs of opera dancers and the waters of
Barlaruc. He toured Languedoc and Provence, being received,
Lutheran as he remained, by the Vice-Legate of Avignon, and with
still more formal honours by Admiral Matthews at Toulon where the
English were blockading the Spanish fleet; as a French General
Maurice was welcomed by the discharge of all the English
artillery and exchanged bumper for bumper the healths of the
Kings of France and of England, each glass being honoured by a
broadside of great guns.</p>

<p>This was the last meeting of Maurice de Saxe and the English
save on the field of battle where indeed he was soon to face
them, for when he returned to Paris with the British salvoes
still ringing in his ears, he heard of the death of the last
Habsburg, Charles VI, on October 20, 1740; this event amounted to
a declaration of war from each of the European states on their
neighbours and caused what Maurice termed a "<i>brouillamini
général."</i></p>

<p>Maria Theresa, the late Emperor's daughter and Grand Duchess
of Tuscany, claimed all her father's honours by virtue of the
Pragmatic Sanction and was answered by the Elector of Bavaria's
protest and rush to arms; he was supported by Augustus III,
though both these princes had promised to respect the claims of
Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>At this juncture the young King of Prussia, bold and wary,
seized Silesia after having in vain demanded it from Maria
Theresa as the price of his alliance.</p>

<p>Russian affairs changed through the death of the Empress Anna
and the fall of her favourite, Biron, Duke of Courland, <i>de
facto</i> at least; the Elector of Bavaria appealed to France for
assistance. Maria Theresa, as Queen of Hungary, appealed to the
Hungarians, gathered an army together and was defeated by
Frederic at Maleritz, April 4, 1741.</p>

<p>It was purely a Germanic quarrel and France had nothing to
gain by interfering and had already suffered sufficiently by
espousing the dispute of Stanislas Leczinski; but a double
marriage drew Louis XV into the embroilment; the second wife of
the first Bourbon King of Spain, Philip V, had contrived to
engage her daughter to the Dauphin, and her son, Philip of Parma,
to the eldest French Princess; and the cause of Spain, or rather
that of Elizabeth Farnese, being that of the House of Bavaria,
this <i>pacte de famille</i> gave France an excuse again to
attack once more her hereditary enemy, the House of Austria;
Great Britain, through her German King, George II, had championed
the cause of the Archduchess, while the Stuart Pretender hoped to
find this a favourable moment for a repetition of the Scottish
adventure of 1715; here then was Europe's call to arms again and
in the subsequent <i>brouhaha</i> Maurice de Saxe hoped to find
his part; first, he tried again for Courland; with the fall of
Biron, who was exiled to Siberia, he hastened North but in time
only to hear of the election of Louis Ernest of Brunswick-
Luneberg to the throne of Courland, and the acceptance of this
prince by the Courlanders, and Maurice, after uttering a formal
manifesto protest, was obliged to content himself with his most
hoarded diploma now sixteen years old.</p>

<p>Despite the advice of Cardinal de Fleury, France declared war
1741&mdash;thirty thousand French troops were sent to Westphalia,
forty thousand to Bavaria. Charles, Elector of Bavaria, was now
<i>generalissimo</i> of the French forces and Maurice de Saxe was
sent to serve under him at the opening of the campaign; in
command of a division of French cavalry in the army commanded by
Maréchal de Belleisle, he arrived at the Bavarian camp on the
thirtieth of September, 1741.</p>

<p>Maurice did not fail to bring the affair of Courland to the
notice of the Elector, who disposed of the matter with more
courtesy than satisfaction to Maurice by answering that the Saxon
should be satisfied with preserving the sovereignty of the State
without wishing to enjoy it. Charles, indeed, had to be prodigal
of compliments, having nothing else to bestow.</p>

<p>Saxony having taken the side of His Electoral Highness,
Maurice found himself in affiance with his brother, Augustus III.
It seems that he would have been very willing to command his
native troops and offered to the Minister of Augustus, Count
Bruhl, his assistance in "the storm growing," as he said, "in the
vast sea of politics;" but the wary Bruhl passed over the offer
in silence, not wishing to share his power with so impetuous and
dominant a personality. Had Maurice been in command of the Saxons
instead of being a lieutenant under Charles of Bavaria, a man
ineffective and mediocre, the young King of Prussia's attack on
Silesia might have had another ending. So the scene was set for
another long, exhausting, costly and pointless war, which
involved nearly the whole of the so-called civilised world. The
combatants were thus divided; Maria Theresa's supporters were
Great Britain, Russia and Holland, her opponents France, Spain,
Poland, Prussia and several of the ruling German Princes.</p>

<p>In this bloody medley there were many adventurers, of the
temper of Maurice, looking for crowns&mdash;of gold, of laurel,
royal, ducal, what you will&mdash;"a ribbon here, a halter there,
to keep 'em quiet" as Eugene had advised his master in another
such war; there were drums to beat the advance, the retreat,
there were spades to bury such of the carcasses as were accorded
a burial; it was a good game for the lucky ones, and Maurice, at
least, enjoyed it to the full; during the winter of 1741-2 he
fought his way to the walls of Prague, leading his splendid
troops, hussars in blue cloaks, his own Uhlans in their green
uniform with the horsehair tails on their casques, other French
soldiers, of Grassin, in scarlet and blue, of Larlière, in brown,
of Fischu in scarlet; Maurice himself in cuirass and leopard
skin, pearls in his ears, a star on his heart, a fur cap on his
powdered curls, seemed to have recovered his former strength as
he directed the encirclement of the famous city.</p>

<p>The whole of the operations were under his personal direction
and it was thought a brilliant feat of arms when Prague fell
after a few days' assault.</p>

<p>Maurice made a state entrance into the ancient city of the
alchemists, where Emperors, already half legendary, had brooded
over the possibility of the philosopher's stone, and received the
keys of the town and citadel from the governor.</p>

<p>His troops took possession of Prague with the same magnificent
discipline as they had shown when parading on the Plain of
Sablons, and Maurice forbade all pillage and outrage. Many
generals had, under similar circumstances, given similar orders,
but Maurice was obeyed. And the astonished magistrates gave the
victor a superb diamond in gratitude for the good order he kept
in the vanquished city.</p>

<p>This clemency was probably due more to Maurice's sense of
discipline than to his tenderness of heart or his magnanimity,
for there is nothing to show that he possessed either quality.
Sacking a town that had surrendered was against the rules of war
as he understood them, and licence was ruinous for his men, that
was all.</p>

<p>But his stern control of his troops had at least the semblance
of humanity and took away some of the lurid horror of a war more
than usually horrible.</p>

<p>Soon after he had received the keys of Prague, Maurice, again
providing a grandiose spectacle against the background of the
towered city and the grim December day, presented them to the
French candidate for Imperial honours, the Elector of
Bavaria.</p>

<p>There were fanfares and drum rolls, a display of captured
standards, <i>Te Deums</i>, a visit to the battlefield, where the
dead and dying froze together, and, a few days later, the
coronation of the Elector as King of Bohemia; Maurice saw that
all this ceremony was performed splendidly; under his watchful
eye the disarmed Austrian garrison stood to attention, the
Bohemian nobility came to pay homage to their new sovereign,
there was another <i>Te Deum</i> with the clergy properly in
their places, and the crowd, only too happy to have escaped
massacre, dutifully shouted in the winter-bitten streets.</p>

<p>Charles of Bavaria, however, had wit enough to put a just
valuation on the show. He dined in public, under a splendid
canopy, and Maurice, with complacent calm, came to offer his
felicitations.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Charles, "I am King of Bohemia in the same way as
you are Duke of Courland."</p>

<p>This campaign in the north was not the only French activity.
Extensive military operations commenced also in Italy, but these
did not concern Maurice de Saxe, whose conduct and exploits alone
redeemed the French from complete disaster in this senseless war,
in which France lost what was left of the military prestige
bequeathed her by Louis XIV, her maritime power, her finest
colonies and such financial resources as she still possessed; the
War of the Austrian Succession was the last act of the long,
feeble administration of Cardinal de Fleury (though undertaken
against his advice) and was not without its bitter critics even
at the moment.</p>

<p>The Marquis d'Argenson, the political and personal enemy of
Maurice, lamented the folly of this intervention in a German
quarrel at the instigation of a violent and turbulent Queen of
Spain for the benefit of a cunning King of Prussia.</p>

<p>The old Maréchal de Noailles had also had a very acute idea of
the situation and frequently said so. There was no money left, he
pointed out, and no one knew where it had gone, and the people
were oppressed and wretched; yet even this shrewd observer
declared that, though the country was without funds, without
resources and the people were exhausted, it was necessary to
fight in order to maintain the rank and reputation of France in
Europe and the honour and glory of the King.</p>

<p>The burden of maintaining "this honour and glory" fell largely
on Maurice de Saxe, who remained the main support of Charles of
Bavaria, who proved, as he had expected, another snow King of
Bohemia, for his shadowy Kingdom melted with the winter
frosts.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, not long before the new King had to abandon
Prague to the Austrians, who had taken the field under the
husband of Maria Theresa, Francis, Grand Duke of Tuscany and
later Emperor and Prince Charles of Lorraine, who was married to
the sister of the Empress. Although he had been successful in all
that he had undertaken, Maurice lacked opportunity of displaying
his most resplendent talents; though fitted for the highest
command (there was not his equal in military genius in Europe,
with the possible exception of Frederick of Prussia), he remained
in a subordinate position. The King of France was his friend, and
a great future was hoped for from the King, who had lately left
his shy retirement with his unloving Queen under the influence of
the four Nesle sisters, who were successively his mistresses. But
the King himself could not combat the jealousies aroused by the
success of Maurice among the Princes of the Blood and the
nobility.</p>

<p>Most dangerous to Maurice of all these enmities was that of
the Prince de Conti, Louis Francois de Bourbon. This Prince de
Conti was the grandson of that charming and graceful cavalier who
had disputed the crown of Poland with Augustus II and the son of
that Prince whom Maurice had made absurd as well as dishonoured
by intriguing with his wife.</p>

<p>Hate of the House of Saxony might well be considered
hereditary in the House of Bourbon Conti. Louis Francois, now 25
years of age and not without talents and graces, was lieutenant-
general under Maréchal de Belleisle; he longed to distinguish
himself "on the field of honour" and had already shown reckless
bravery, musket balls on one occasion piercing his cuirass and on
another his horse being shot under him. By right of his rank, and
his descent from so many heroes, he claimed a high military
position, and he used his vast influence and that power of
intrigue inherent in his class to see that he obtained it and
that Maurice was excluded from power, preferment and
opportunity.</p>

<p>On his side Maurice did nothing to conciliate this powerful
enemy and did not hesitate to keep alive, with coarse anecdote
and jovial laugh, the double loss, of crown and wife, that the
House of Conti had suffered from the House of Saxony.</p>

<p>Some air of success was given to the French arms by the
election of their candidate by the Diet and his subsequent
coronation (April 12, 1742) at Frankfort as Charles VII with a
pomp that was impressive but slightly ironical, for the Austrians
were not only masters of the Empire to which Charles had been
elected, but had even overrun his native electorate of
Bavaria.</p>

<p>These unpleasant circumstances, rendered worse by the fall of
Linz on the Danube, then the capital of Upper Austria, were
lightened when Maurice succeeded in raising the spirits of his
troops and his allies by the taking of Egra, an important town in
Bohemia, which procured for him added glory and a letter from the
new Emperor in which his Imperial Majesty lamented "My dear Comte
de Saxe, why can't you be everywhere?"</p>

<p>This being impossible, the cause of Bavaria went ill enough,
though Charles of Lorraine was mainly occupied in checking his
Prussian Majesty, now proving himself a consummate general as
well as a wily politician.</p>

<p>Belgrade, once the scene of Maurice's early and brilliant
exploits under Eugene, was again besieged&mdash;now by the Grand
Duke Francis, soon to be the rival Emperor Francis I, and
Maréchal de Belleisle, the commander of the garrison there, cut
off from the expected re-inforcements under Broglie and
Maillebois, undertook that ghastly retreat in mid-winter which is
one of the most gloomy, cruel yet heroic episodes of any war.</p>

<p>M. de Belleisle was himself a sick man, ravaged by fever,
bowed down by the hardships he shared with his troops. His
behaviour and that of all under him in these awful circumstances
cast a true, if gloomy, glory over the hideous affair; the best
side of the French aristocracy, who often cut a glittering but
trivial figure at Versailles or Fontainebleau or Paris, showed in
these dismal circumstances; M. de Belleisle's conduct and that of
his officers was as admirable as that of the troops under him;
the integral bravery and resolution of a great nation were
revealed during this terrible march from Prague to Egra across
the snow-blocked mountains.</p>

<p>It was during this retreat from Prague that Vauvenargues, most
elegant and gracious of French philosophers, contracted that
illness which enfeebled him to the end of his days and eventually
ended them; nearly a thousand Frenchmen perished in the snow that
fell continuously on the rugged Bohemian defiles, but, by
marching his men day and night, M. de Belleisle brought the bulk
of his army, artillery, stores and baggage to Egra; an exploit
worthy of a better cause.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the small French garrison left in Prague was
reduced to eating rats before it surrendered to the Austrians on
January 2, 1743. From all these disasters Maurice de Saxe learnt
what not to do in warfare. He saw what was wrong and said so,
first to M. de Broglie, and then to M. de Maillebois, who
succeeded him as Commander-in-Chief, but neither general was
disposed to listen to the foreigner, and Maurice returned in
disgust to Paris and thought of leaving the army.</p>

<p>He had his distractions, the King, who always believed in him,
allowed him to raise a new regiment, and there was Mlle
Dangeville, a seductive actress of the <i>Comédie Française,</i>
who amused him for a little while.</p>

<p>But Paris was not as gay and agreeable as usual; the retreat
from Prague had darkened the spirits of the French and cast a
deep gloom over the unhappy cause of the Emperor who was their
puppet.</p>

<p>Maurice had no further opportunity of distinction and he
decided to go to Moscow and solicit the new Empress, Elizabeth,
daughter of Peter the Great, for his maternal estate in Livonia
and possibly for her influence in Courland; these lands in
Livonia were all that was left of the once large fortune of the
Königsmarcks; Maurice had not any strong hopes of obtaining them;
and, as it fell out, the Czarina was gracious but non-committal;
the adventurer was no longer young and handsome.</p>

<p>He returned to Dresden, where he was much caressed by his
half-brother, the King-Elector, his sister-in-law and their
family. Maurice had continued, even during the progress of the
war and travelling from place to place to keep up his services as
gazetteer to the court of Dresden, and those French princes who
disliked and suspected him were not far wrong in thinking that he
was only superficially French and that his affections, such as
they were, remained in Saxony.</p>

<p>Maurice was much shaken and irritated by the general dismal
progress of the war, and in an attempt to secure some success for
French arms he hastened to Ratisbon where Louis XV's army lay
under the command of Maréchal Maillebois; Maurice arrived there
at the same time as the Prince de Conti, who now openly declared
himself the active enemy of "the German mercenary" and disputed
his command with him.</p>

<p>This campaign, made worse by the grim Bohemian winter, this
year as severe as any experienced in the steppes of Russia, was
little short of disastrous to the French; their armies were
shattered, ill and in bad condition, exhausted and pinched with
the unaccustomed cold and harried by Prince Charles of Lorraine
and the Grand Duke of Tuscany with their troops of Austrians and
Hungarian Uhlans.</p>

<p>At the age of nearly ninety years, the man who had been so
long Minister of France, died, in the midst of this futile war,
which cost so many thousands of lives, so much suffering, such an
outpouring of treasure, and which he had tried in vain to
prevent.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Fleury, Bishop of Fréjus, was a mild, pleasant
priest, a kind, gentle man but one without either strength or
ability. His one service to France, if service it could be
termed, was the acquisition of Lorraine. He was succeeded in
Louis's counsels (after the King had tried in vain to stand
alone) by the Marquis d'Argenson, Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
and M. de Noailles, the first always the enemy, the second the
friend and protector of Maurice de Saxe; these two Ministers
found themselves faced with an extravagant court, a half-ruined
country, and a war that had now spread to such an extent that all
Europe seemed in a confusion of turmoil; the English and
Hanoverians had recently joined Prince Charles of Lorraine and
Maurice; with his new regiment of Uhlans, was in the Upper
Palatinate.</p>

<p>The next event of importance was the battle of Dettingen,
1743, where the losses and the advantages on the field appear to
have been equal; it was considered, however, a victory for the
King of Great Britain, who was present at the engagement and so
inflicted the last disgrace of defeat in the open field on the
dispirited French.</p>

<p>This king, George II, was the son of Sophia Dorothea, whose
cause he had always espoused and whom he had in vain endeavoured
to see during her long imprisonment. It is believed that, had she
survived until he mounted the throne, he would have given her
rank as Dowager Queen of England; the most slanderous of the
Jacobites said openly that George II was more a Pretender than
Prince Charles Edward, since his father was not George I, but
Philip von Königsmarck; so the old scandal and tragedy, which had
first thrown Aurora into the arms of Augustus the Strong and
brought Maurice de Saxe into the world, still echoed as a
whispered slander both in the courts and the pot-houses of
Europe. At Dettingen had fought the Duke of Cumberland, third son
of the King, who had received a musket ball through his leg, when
his frightened horse, running away with him, had carried him into
the French ranks.</p>

<p>After this defeat of M. de Noailles and his sixty thousand men
at Dettingen, the cabinet of Versailles were faced with the
possibility of invasion, for the Allies were descending on the
Spanish Netherlands. Count d'Argenson, Minister of War, decided
to mass the main army of France on the frontiers and at the same
time to harass England by an attempted invasion in favour of
Prince Charles Edward Stuart.</p>

<p>Both these tasks were entrusted to Maurice de Saxe. And he
declared he would execute them "<i>a la Tartare"</i> without
hesitation or delay.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2.2" id="ch2.2"></a>II. MAURICE, SWEET WILLIAM AND
SOME UNDERLINGS</h2>

<p class="first">MAURICE DE SAXE, in the spring of 1744, when the
dismal fortunes of France were entrusted to him without much
preamble, but rather as a desperate measure, was in his forty-
seventh year and permanently disabled by dropsy. The old wound in
his leg gave him increasing trouble, his once splendid figure was
bloated and unwieldy, his once attractive face purpled and
carbuncled; copious dosings of powerful drugs kept at bay the
poisons that consumed him, but the physicians could not induce
him to alter his personal habits; dying of self-indulgence, he
yet refused any restraint, and what was left of his strength went
in gross excesses. Of all his one-time graces and comeliness
nothing remained, but he still was, when arrayed in his battle
panoply, an impressive, a formidable figure; the blue eyes,
though bloodshot and sunken, were yet full of fire, and rolled
fiercely beneath the shaggy brows, the voice, often likened to a
trumpet or a drum, still retained a ferocious power; and he had
abated nothing of his splendour; fine lace still encircled the
swollen bull neck, pearls hung either side the purple jowl,
powdered curls surrounded the face, ugly now save for that grin
of cynic humour.</p>

<p>Diamonds were clustered on the monstrous breast and the
swollen fingers still displayed a blazing ring with the arms of
Saxony.</p>

<p>He leered at the fools who had been forced to beg his help,
heaved himself on to his massive horse, turned towards the
frontiers and in a short campaign did what M. d'Argenson had
asked of him; in his own style of coarse pleasantry he said he
had "packed off Prince Charles and the King of England, after
'confessing' them."</p>

<p>"The thing was worthy my attention," he added. He had
fortified the frontiers, held back the Austrians, and prevented
the enemy from obtaining a foothold in Alsace-Lorraine. Nor was
he daunted by the other prospect put forward by the cabinet at
Versailles, the invasion of England; a scheme frequently
cherished by the French, but never successfully put into
practice.</p>

<p>It greatly pleased Maurice, it had that touch of the bizarre,
the fantastic, that always delighted him; it touched that most
dreamt dream of all&mdash;a crown. Not for himself, perhaps, but
if the enterprise was successful, what not could Maurice hope
from the gratitude of Charles Edward Stuart?</p>

<p>It may have, too, amused his sardonic humour to contemplate
chasing the son of Sophia Dorothea from his throne.</p>

<p>Always active, despite his ill-health, he contrived to be at
Dunkirk in February 1744, where the young Italianate Stuart met
him with enthusiastic delight; for him a golden dream seemed
about to become a reality; Maurice had fifteen thousand men
embarked by March I; his intention was to take them across the
channel, up the Thames, and to threaten London, while the
Jacobites (the French hoped) would rise in revolt against the
Hanoverians.</p>

<p>Spring gales saved England, not for the first or last time,
from invasion; some ships were lost, others had to return to
port, and Maurice, fevered with impatience to begin his
enterprise, was forced to exclaim furiously: "Decidedly the wind
is not Jacobite!"</p>

<p>Despite the delays, however, and the knowledge that the
English were strongly fortifying their posts, Maurice still
wished to attempt the descent and would have done so, had he not
been forbidden by M. d'Argenson, who thought that both James
Stuart, his son, and their supporters formed rotten reeds on
which to lean and that the whole scheme was too costly and too
hazardous.</p>

<p>Maurice's earnest attempts to persuade the Minister and the
King that it would be well worth while to endeavour to transport
thirty thousand men across the Channel even in fishing boats to
attack England, met with no success and he was forced to abandon
to despair and folly Prince Charles Edward, and to return to
Paris where he received the superb honour of Maréchal de France
and the command of the Army on the Moselle.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties, in the eyes of the nobles and
courtiers, in the way of his elevation to this magnificent
dignity, was the fact that he was a Protestant and therefore
debarred from some of the privileges of his new dignity. Although
he was completely indifferent to all religion, he had always
refused to leave the Lutheran Church of which he was nominally a
member, and it was useless to suggest it now. An obstinate pride
engaged him in this surface loyalty; yet he hardly knew the
meaning of the words Religion, God or Spirituality; any mention
of such matters brought a cynic laugh from the rough, robust and
gross soldier. He enjoyed with gusto the material glory and
splendour this new honour brought him and the fact that he was
called <i>"le Maréchal Maurice"</i> and that the King addressed
him as "my cousin," while the Prince de Conti and other royal
personages could hardly contain their rage.</p>

<p>At the same time, and in some measure by his influence,
another Northerner was received into the French service; Danish
by birth and a general in the Saxon army, Ulric-Frédéric-
Waldemar, Count de Lowendal, at 44 years of age, was a mercenary
soldier of great success and distinction; one of his most notable
exploits had been, when he was in the service of the Czarina Ann,
expelling at the edge of the sword the Tartars out of the
Ukraine; Lowendal had on occasion fought against Maurice, but
they had been for many years friends, men of much the same
temperament, the same destiny, the same background. Lowendal
proved a good second to Maurice in the organisation and command
of the French armies.</p>

<p>It was a period of grave anxiety for France; the last campaign
had been little short of disastrous, both in lowered prestige and
in crippling defeats; French bones, treasure, flags and guns,
were scattered over Flanders, Italy and Germany; the cause of
Charles of Bavaria seemed, too, lost. The entry of Great Britain
with her fresh troops, her sound financial resources and good
organisation, the fear of invasion, the failure of the Count
d'Argenson's bold plan for the landing of Charles Stuart in
England, all these events were shrewd blows at the failing
strength of France. Internal conditions, too, were bad; de
Noailles, in a memorial to the King, painted them in the blackest
colours, and Europe indeed did not think that France could put
another army into the field. The war had been tedious and
exhausting, the French troops were fatigued and dispirited,
thousands of them were prisoners, and the cabinet at Versailles
hardly knew where to turn for the means and the men with which to
support the only two generals who were likely to be of use, the
two foreigners, Saxe and Lowendal.</p>

<p>In a passionate appeal to the King, M. de Noailles entreated
His Majesty to take the field in person; nothing else would so
raise the prestige of France or so put heart into the men. For de
Noailles was still of the opinion that France must continue to
fight, for the sake of "honour and glory."</p>

<p>Paris had, indeed, attempted to open negotiations with Vienna,
but Maria Theresa had refused to listen to terms, and in truth
the national dignity could only be saved by carrying on this war
so wantonly undertaken.</p>

<p>The combination against France had now been strengthened by
the entry of the Netherlands into the ranks of the Allies; the
Dutch, peace loving, and only remotely concerned in the quarrel,
had been persuaded against their own inclination and to no one's
great advantage to enter the struggle and they played their part
but half-heartedly; they were, however, well equipped and, if
lethargic, had a prosperous government behind them.</p>

<p>Louis XV responded to the appeal of M. de Noailles and decided
to take the field for the campaign of 1744.</p>

<p>Wondering, in his exquisite boredom, if there might not be
some excitement to be obtained out of war, Louis XV had been
attracted by the suggestion that he should lead his army in
person and had selected the Saxon Maréchal for his model and
guide in the enterprise. Other reasons beside dread of tedium
inspired the King at this crisis in the affairs of France; he was
but in his thirty-fourth year and, freed from the long dominion
of Cardinal Fleury that had followed the dominion of the Regent,
Dubois and the Duc de Bourbon, he felt some stirrings of energy
and ambition, some sincere desire to follow in the tradition of
Saint-Louis, Francis I, Henry IV&mdash;to be a King indeed,
leading his men in glorious exploits.</p>

<p>He had tried to rule by himself after the death of Cardinal
Fleury, but the burden had been too much for one untrained in
anything save arts of idleness, yet there remained in him some
manly desire for independence. Neither was the young King
insensible to the appalling condition of his country, and a
powerful adviser was always at his ear, inspiring him with brave
and generous thoughts. This was the youngest and most beautiful
of the Nesle sisters, Madame de Châteauroux, who was romantic and
high-minded above most women of her caste.</p>

<p>The King seemed to love her; the affair had the air of Louis
XIV's idyll with Louise de la Vallière and Madame de Pompadour
with her shrewd selfishness, her keen materialism, was still in
the background, with Madame Lenormant d'Etoiles, waiting
patiently for her chance of complete ascendancy over the King, as
she had waited already two years. Though the King's decision was
extremely popular with the people and put heart into a dispirited
nation, his choice of Maurice de Saxe as his instructor in the
art of war was taken as little less than an insult by the Princes
of the Blood and nobility, all squabbling among themselves for
military honours, titles and rewards.</p>

<p>Louis XV had, however, more good sense and shrewdness than
appeared at first from his indolent and frivolous exterior. He
had not chosen Maurice altogether from a caprice or because of
the influence of M. de Noailles. He remarked, with his light
cynicism, "that the times were not fertile in great men"; in
Maurice he perceived the only general capable of restoring the
tattered glory of the lilies and of conducting with dignity the
war that he himself was entering as a piquant distraction and
with some generous idea of emulating the glories of his
predecessors.</p>

<p>Maurice was to have the effective command of the forces that
His Most Christian Majesty would lead in his name and the Saxon
had therefore achieved a very splendid position in the French
court and camp, one from which it would be almost impossible to
dislodge him and which he had every opportunity of
consolidating.</p>

<p>Now that this splendid prospect opened before him, Maurice was
full of enthusiasm and of activity; his zeal was one of the
reasons that Louis XV leant upon him. Here at least was a solid
character, self-confident and enterprising, and one whose destiny
seemed to be to save France if not to restore her ancient
splendour.</p>

<p>Thus supported, Maurice de Saxe was able to snap his fingers
at the enraged <i>troupe dorée,</i> but the hatred of some of
them, still notably that of the Prince de Conti, who aspired to
his place, was dangerous.</p>

<p>The campaign opened in April; Maurice went to Valenciennes
with half the French forces, where he was soon joined by M. de
Noailles with the remainder of the French troops; the Saxon's
organisation had been superb; M. de Noailles, when urging the
King to take the field, had complained of every possible trouble
with the army, including insubordination, but Maurice de Saxe was
able to take the offensive with troops at least as well
disciplined and equipped as those of the Allies. For their part
the government had worked hard; Count d'Argenson had taken
energetic measures for mobilisation and recruiting and a gravely
depleted treasury had been drawn upon for the manufacture of
bombs, balls, cannon and arms, and for the purchase of war
supplies; during the whole of the war there was a desperate
struggle between the <i>Contrôleur-Général</i> Ovry and the
Minister of War on this vital question of expense.</p>

<p>The war could not continue without enormous expense; the
nation had no money, and yet the war must be sustained; such was
the position that occupied the wits of the Versailles cabinet;
yet, while M. d'Argenson and M. Dumesnil were endeavouring to
find the means to carry on this almost hopeless task, the
organisation of hospitals, the making of military roads, the
supply of transport, the construction of bridges and all the
elaborate machinery of war, the royal household that surrounded
the King were indulging in the most reckless extravagance and the
most splendid luxury. It might be a great encouragement to France
that the King was, symbolically at least, "at the head of his
troops," but his presence was a source of continual embarrassment
and vexation to Maurice and such other generals as took seriously
their task, not only of defending France, but of carrying the war
into the enemy's country. For Louis XV brought with him all that
comprised his court, except his Queen; the fair and enthusiastic
Madame de Châteauroux took her place.</p>

<p>For the rest there were the royal Princes, with their vast
households, the nobles with their establishments, and all the
crowd of hangers-on to these great ones that had formerly flocked
to the corridors at Versailles, or jostled in the ante-chambers
of Parisian hotels. Merchants, tradespeople, moneylenders,
panders, jobbers and sharpers, dancers, singers and "fines de
joie" by the waggon-load accompanied the aristocracy of France to
the war.</p>

<p>Maurice, endeavouring to put into practice some of his long-
held ideas in military science and those of his life-long friend
and favourite author, the Chevalier Folard, was hampered and
infuriated by this cumbrous train of vice, extravagance,
etiquette, folly and pride, which impeded all operations and
filled the army with all the corrupt and base intrigues that
poisoned the court and the city.</p>

<p>Maurice's ideal soldier remained Charles XII, of whom he had
caught a glimpse in his youth&mdash;"attired like one of his own
men, and sharing all their miseries and perils." And he often
allowed himself a rough statement of his feelings. When it was
suggested to him that a certain assault would be worth while
"since it would cost the lives of ten dragoons only" he replied
brusquely, "Ten dragoons! If you had said ten lieutenant-generals
I might not have hesitated." And when an officer came to him for
orders, perfumed, powdered and as exquisitely groomed as if ready
for the King's <i>levee,</i> Maurice asked scornfully, "What ball
are you going to, my fine fellow?"</p>

<p>Yet his own luxury was as ostentatious as that of any gilded
<i>mignon;</i> and he did not permit himself this inconsistency
out of indifference or compliance, he really liked all that was
opulent, costly and sensuously pleasing. He maintained his own
private theatre with a <i>troupe</i> of accomplished actresses
and actors, and elegant berlines full of light and pretty ladies
followed his staff.</p>

<p>But if he had his diversions he did his work well; he never
relaxed the discipline of his troops, he continued to train,
exercise and instruct them; he treated deserters with such
severity that even the Swiss, mercenaries with no heart in the
war, remained at their posts, and he tried even to discipline the
officers "who have too much leisure" and to close to them the
Flemish cafés, theatres and houses of ill-fame, where they spent
too much time. He also kept order among his troops; the
surrounding country was not pillaged, and the peasants were
encouraged to come to the camp to sell their provisions at a fair
price.</p>

<p>Affairs were very different in those sections of the army that
did not come under the command of Maurice de Saxe; M. de
Seychelles wrote to M. de Belleisle from the royal headquarters,
"there is no order or discipline here. The soldiers rape and
pillage, we are detested, all have their hands against
us&mdash;there is no hope of any discipline."</p>

<p>Maurice now put into practice one of his ideas of the
<i>rêveries,</i> incessant attacks on the enemy by small
parties&mdash;a kind of guerilla warfare, new and effective.</p>

<p>In May, he presented the King with a splendid spectacle, the
capture of the town of Menin; this success was followed by the
fall of Courtrai, Ypres and Fumes. The activity of Prince Charles
of Lorraine on the Rhine, however, drew off Louis XV and M. de
Noailles to Alsace and left Maurice with diminished forces to
hold the Flemish posts.</p>

<p>The King, afraid of death and afraid of Hell, had nevertheless
shown an elegant kind of bravery during such actions as he had
been permitted to share; he had been shielded, however, from any
real danger. But at Metz he was struck down 'by a peril that no
one had the skill or the knowledge to prevent.</p>

<p>Disease then accounted for at least as many soldiers as those
slain by the enemy in time of war; the filthy camps, the dirt,
ignorance and apathy of men and officers, the scarcity even of
such medical help as the age afforded, made many maladies endemic
during time of war.</p>

<p>The young, charming and handsome King was infected by one of
the pestilences bred from the insanitary camps, the herded
troops, the foul camp followers.</p>

<p>It was believed that he would die, and France was moved into a
rush of love and loyalty&mdash;the last that this dynasty was to
provoke from the nation over which they had ruled so long.</p>

<p>The priests worked on Louis's fears of Divine vengeance and he
sent away Madame de Châteauroux. When he recovered, it seemed as
if the passionate prayers of France had been answered; and he
found himself saluted by the term "Well beloved."</p>

<p>"What have I ever done" he asked with that sad self-
understanding for which much may be forgiven him, "that I should
be loved?"</p>

<p>Madame de Châteauroux returned to the royal couch as the
priests, whose absolution was no longer required, left the royal
chamber; but infection was in everything she touched, and she too
fell ill.</p>

<p>Her quick death touched and terrified her lover; his own grief
alarmed him, he turned to the suave comfort offered by Madame
d'Etoiles, who had waited so long and so patiently; she loved
him, she was brilliant, she was sensitive, she knew all the arts
of passion, she rapidly achieved the envied position of
<i>maîtresse-en-titre.</i> Louis submitted to her dazzling
seduction; after the loss of Madame de Châteauroux he never
permitted himself the dangerous luxury of a tender or sentimental
attachment. The new mistress, soon to become Madame de Pompadour,
had always admired Maurice, at least as a soldier, and he was
very ready to come to an understanding with the powerful new
favourite.</p>

<p>Louis and Noailles continued to hold Charles of Lorraine in
Alsace; the King saw Fribourg taken during a violent storm of
rain; during the assault Lowendal was wounded, Maurice kept the
enemy at bay in Flanders until the troops went into winter
quarters.</p>

<p>The state of his health had now become alarming; little was
left of the manly strength that had passed for beauty in the eyes
of so many women. His huge limbs were enfeebled, his hands shook,
the heavy-featured face with the snub nose and long upper lip was
empurpled, bloated and saggy, twitching with pain and blotched
with disease. Though he had been long ailing and struggling with
intermittent illnesses, he seemed to his doctors, his friends and
his acquaintances to have suddenly collapsed. Not yet nearing his
fiftieth year he appeared to have the weaknesses and disabilities
of a man of 70 years of age or more. His dropsy had become worse,
and in vain he was tapped by his physician, M. Senac; it seemed
that his "blood was dissolving "; his body was covered with sores
that baths of healing balms did little to relieve; he was in
continual pain from the chronic festering in the wounded leg.</p>

<p>Yet he had the will-power to employ this winter of 1744-5, not
only in exercising his regiment and in inventing cannon and guns,
but in ingratiating himself with Madame de Pompadour.</p>

<p>Though Maurice de Saxe had shown a brisk contempt for the
intolerable insolence of the gilded rakes, idle fops and
voluptuous loungers who flourished in the train of the King, he
had maintained his hold on the monarch who was now confided to
his care by Madame de Pompadour. The mistress's interest in the
war was entirely personal; she had gracefully conveyed to
Maurice, whom she looked upon, and rightly, as the one strong
personality in the French army, her hope that he would be able to
shorten the tedious war that kept her royal and charming lover
from her side; she knew that the King was fickle and the fact
that he was at the seat of war did not mean that he was free from
feminine influence.</p>

<p>The new favourite, who had not yet become a habit with her
lover, was glad to have Maurice de Saxe as her ally, and the two
understood each other very well.</p>

<p>Thus, despite so many handicaps, his health, the enemies that
his success in the field made him among the Princes, Maurice had
the address to maintain his hold on the King, the mistress and M.
de Noailles.</p>

<p>The winter passed in fruitless negotiations between the
hostile nations, and Maurice employed himself with what
diversions came his way, in raising, training his Uhlans, in
studying for his next campaign and in trying to regain some
strength; but many thought he would not live to see the spring.
His one desire was to return to the active life of the camp, yet
it was to his interest to please Madame de Pompadour, who wished
the King idle, safe and under her direct influence.</p>

<p>Maurice continued his "gazettes" and letters to the court of
Dresden and he served the interest of his own country skilfully
enough with Madame de Pompadour, even down to such details as
inducing her to buy the products of and patronise the enterprise
of the porcelain factories whose dainty productions were becoming
famous throughout Europe.</p>

<p>There had been some changes in the political situation;
Frederick of Prussia had been detached from his allies by Maria
Theresa and on the death of Charles VII, January 28, 1745, whom
France had crowned but never been able to provide with an Empire,
the court of Vienna succeeded in seducing his young son from his
champions; Saxony also veered round and signed a treaty with
Maria Theresa and England. Despite the fact that there was no
Emperor to fight for, France continued her struggle with all and
sundry across the ruins of the Empire.</p>

<p>Maurice, Commander-in-Chief of the French army in Flanders,
prepared to leave Paris in March; he was in command of sixty
thousand men, and Tournay was his objective.</p>

<p>Voltaire, visiting him as he was issuing his orders from the
chair he could not leave, asked quizzically, "How can you hope to
live through the fatigues of another campaign?"</p>

<p>The crippled giant replied dryly: "I'm not thinking of living,
but of leaving for the front."</p>

<p>He had to travel in a litter, however, and soon after his
arrival at Maubeuge a crisis of distress caused M. Senac to
operate on him again for dropsy.</p>

<p>The doctor, acting under orders from the alarmed King, who saw
his one champion laid low, tried to introduce some order into the
life of his formidable patient. There were to be no more
temptations, declared the physician, either in court or in camp.
The berlines full of gay ladies, who followed Maurice from town
to town during the campaigns, were to be forbidden; the good
companions were to be kept at a distance. "Plus de femmes" was
the order; and the invalid's door was barred to petticoats.</p>

<p>Maurice, with an indifferent air, groaning with pain, promised
amendments, but neither the King nor the doctors believed in
these and his house was guarded day and night to see that
undesirable favourites did not enter to tempt him to further
debaucheries.</p>

<p>All these precautions were, however, too late. Even if Maurice
had reformed his way of life, he would not have been able to cure
his complication of diseases; for he had to contend not only with
his own lack of control, where sensual appetites were concerned,
but with the primitive hygiene of his day and lack of knowledge
on the part of even the most famous physicians.</p>

<p>The man whose living flesh was corrupting, was tormented, for
the first time in his life, by a thwarted passion. It was,
indeed, ironical that the man who had only to glance at a woman
to win her, who had been besieged by many fashionable, proud and
delicate beauties, sometimes in vain, was now, with his youth,
and beauty, and health gone, tortured by the inability to win a
woman on whom he had set his desires; this woman was Madame
Favart, and her story, though it runs concurrently with the
political and military events of the last few years of Maurice's
life, is better given as a complete narrative.</p>

<p>At the opening of the campaign of 1745, the reckless and
extravagant life of Paris was again continued by the princes,
generals and nobles of France in Flanders; gambling, love-making,
and extravagant dressing passed the time between the battles and
the sieges.</p>

<p>And all this gross brilliancy was heightened by the presence
of the charming King of 35 years of age and that of the little
Dauphin, 15 years old, who had just been married to the ugly, sad
little Spanish princess whom he adored.</p>

<p>They again brought with them the whole "golden troop" of the
royal household and all the glittering and arrogant aristocracy
of France, equipped with the extremes of luxury, brave and cool,
though utterly incapable of the military commands that were given
them, amused themselves while on the ravaged fields of Flanders
with all the diversions to which they had been accustomed in
Versailles.</p>

<p>Maurice and the Prince de Conti, his great enemy and rival, in
particular made a point of outshining the others, in the amount
of money they lost at their card tables, in the costliness of
their equipage and with the talents of the companies of actors
and actresses who accompanied them.</p>

<p>But Maurice was not so well able to join in these pleasures as
he had been even a year ago; between the watchful physician, the
agony of his own ailments and his severe military conscience, he
had little time or strength for any kind of pleasure.</p>

<p>He placed his men from the Sambre to the Lys, from Maubeuge to
Warneton and, passing his troops along both banks of the Scheldt,
invested Tournay on May 1, 1745.</p>

<p>Immediately after he had opened the trenches, he learned that
the Allies, with a force of sixty thousand men, were moving on
Soignies and so threatening to cut his lines of communications;
leaving twenty thousand men before Tournay, Maurice, with the
rest of his force, forty-five thousand seasoned troops,
established himself in a defensive position on a plain a few
miles from the besieged city.</p>

<p>He had often worked out such a situation, "pondered over it
for weeks, perhaps months," and he now made his preparations with
the precision of an accomplished player setting the chess
board.</p>

<p>His health continued desperate, though he had written to Count
d'Argenson that he "felt better since his arrival at the
camp."</p>

<p>The Minister was not, however, reassured, and demanded
constant news of the progress of "the precious invalid."</p>

<p>After the tapping for dropsy, Maurice had seemed, indeed, a
little restored; "he ate with appetite, slept eight hours and saw
visitors." Now he was again enfeebled and in gnawing pain; his
worst distress was a perpetual thirst; the doctors had forbidden
him to drink because of his dropsy; M. de Luynes, who saw him
daily, thought that he would not "live more than a few months at
most" and that "one could not count on him." France, however, had
to count on him; though the holders of almost every brilliant and
famous name in France were gathered before Tournay, there was no
one to take the place of Maurice.</p>

<p>Having so carefully made his preparations and disposed his
troops on the undulating plain, surrounded with woods and pitted
with bogs, between Antoing and Fontenoy, and flanked by the
Scheldt, Maurice learnt with grim, if silent, fury that the
glittering array of the royal household was hastening to his
camp. On hearing that a great battle was likely to take place,
Louis XV, the Dauphin, and the <i>troupe doreée</i> had hastened
to Fontenoy to see the spectacle and to pick up whatever laurels
might be lying about after the exertions of others had gained
what was then termed glory; and also to risk their own lives in
the service of France.</p>

<p>Louis XV possessed a considerable personal courage and a
graceful sense of dignity as well as an immense trust in his
Saxon mercenary; elegant idler as His Most Christian Majesty was,
he showed more bravery in the field than had ever been displayed
by the conquering Louis XIV and appeared elated at the prospect
of a pitched battle.</p>

<p>Maurice tried with grim resolution to conceal his physical
disorders, but was so ill when the King arrived at the camp that
he was not able to leave his tent; his soured temper was not
improved by the tiresome courtiers, utterly incompetent, selfish
and vain, with their impudent demands for high rank and
authority, but he continued with those qualities of vigour and
enthusiasm that were his best points to make every possible
preparation for the advancing enemy, though not able to sit on
horse-back, or indeed, hardly upright.</p>

<p>The Allies were under the command of an English Prince of the
blood royal, who was also a pure German, William Augustus, son of
George II and Caroline of Brandenberg-Anspach.</p>

<p>He was then in his twenty-fifth year and had only recently
taken up his command; indeed, shortly before he had begged to be
allowed to take part in the campaign "in any capacity." The tact
of Lord Stair had, however, won a diplomatic victory over
Austrian pride, and an office, in abeyance since the days of
Marlborough, that of Captain General of the Allied Forces, had
been revived for the young Prince, while Marshal Königsegg, a
veteran of the school of Eugene, acted with him as <i>ad
latus.</i></p>

<p>This appointment had been made in the same spirit as that in
which Louis XV had joined his army in the field; to give some
brilliancy to the general staff of the allies and to animate in
particular the spirit of the soldiery, who might be supposed to
be heartened to be serving under a prince of royal birth.</p>

<p>George II might have remarked with Louis XV, that the age was
not fertile in great soldiers; there was no Marlborough on his
staff; Lord Stair was a good soldier and a fine tactician, but
had been hampered by continual interference from His Majesty,
while Field-Marshal Wade, who succeeded him, was not of startling
talent and handicapped to some extent by his own caution. Wade
had, however, as early as the spring of 1744, represented to King
George that Maurice de Saxe was a leader of such fine mettle that
it was useless to oppose him with the inferior troops of Austria
and the Netherlands and with an army suffering from a divided
command.</p>

<p>The appointment of the Duke of Cumberland was thought to
remedy this defect; he had at least the advantage of undisputed
authority over the Anglo-Hanoverian troops and of ardour for his
task; no general could have shown more ardour than did this young
Prince when he advanced to the relief of Tournay to find the
French firmly and skilfully entrenched across his route and
before the beleaguered city.</p>

<p>No character in history has been more maligned than William
Augustus, Duke of Cumberland; a succession of prejudiced or
indifferent historians has been followed by a crowd of fiction
writers, who almost mechanically repeat slanders about this
unlucky prince; and no cheap romance about the Jacobites, clogged
with false sentiment and false history, but adds another sneer at
the "butcher" Cumberland, who is accused of almost every possible
fault and crime, the least of these being brutality and
incapacity.</p>

<p>The source of these libels is Jacobite squibs, lampoons and
caricatures; the Stuarts and their followers never showed
themselves generous towards those who beat them, and William III
and all the members of the House of Hanover have had their
reputations blackened&mdash;for all time it would seem&mdash;by
the spite of Jacobite party writers.</p>

<p>Cumberland was of the same type as Maurice de Saxe, a heavy
Northerner, authoritative, sensual, a born soldier, hard and
resolute to a fault. He delighted in his profession and spared no
pains to perfect himself in it and he achieved what Maurice never
did, an identification of himself with his men. To him they were
not the pieces on a chess board that they were to Maurice, but
human beings; he looked after their welfare, he made reforms for
their comfort, he frequently said that their "honour and glory"
were very near his heart and no one could please him better than
by praising his men. They in their turn adored him; to them he
was "Billy" or "Sweet William" and they wore in their caps
clusters of the prim little flower of that name.</p>

<p>The British Prince lacked the genius of Maurice, but he also
lacked his vulgarity; Cumberland had a sportsman's taste, he
liked racing, easy women, cards, but no ugly stories were told of
his private life, and there was nothing of the scoundrel in his
character.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, honourable, did nothing for profit, was not
corrupt in money matters, and had that quiet dignity which
disdains a meanness, nor did he stoop to intrigues of any
kind&mdash;one reason for his unpopularity and the lies that were
told about him.</p>

<p>He had been severely wounded at Dettingen and the damaged leg
had been so unskilfully treated that it helped bring him in early
middle life to an end as dreadful as that which now fast
approached Maurice de Saxe.</p>

<p>On that occasion, when in great pain on the battlefield,
Cumberland had refused a drink of water in favour of a French
officer lying near; a similar incident with the name of Sir
Philip Sidney attached is in every text-book of English history,
but few chronicle the good deeds of the Duke of Cumberland.
Horace. Walpole, whose standards were high in matters of taste
and elegance, said that His Royal Highness had no social virtues,
but he had other qualities that would have been useful to the
nation if he had come to the throne; he was unfortunate in
everything, and not least in being always subordinate, first to
an elder brother, then to a nephew, as well as continually
subjected to the not too easy rule of his father. The third
general in command of the Allied Forces was Prince Waldeck, at
the head of the Dutch contingent. He was a brave and experienced
soldier, but it would have been better if the Prince of Orange
had not been prevented by party politics from taking his place,
for the Dutch were not inspired by Waldeck as they would have
been by the head of the House of Nassau.</p>

<p>The Allies had made slow progress, less than forty miles in
ten days, and Maurice had had time to fortify his position with
trenches and redoubts and he was advantageously placed, in fact
he considered that he would not, for this reason, be
attacked.</p>

<p>His earthworks, furnished with men and artillery, filled the
ground between the village of Antoing on the right, and the
forest of Barre on the left; his one weakness was the fact that
the Scheldt ran along his rear; his cannon were arranged to face
the approach and his reserves, six battalions of the Irish
Brigade, were hidden behind a gentle incline that rose from the
river-bank.</p>

<p>In front of him was the hamlet of Vegon that stood on the edge
of a concealed ravine through which ran a stream.</p>

<p>Maurice's quick and extensive work had destroyed hedges and
fields and gardens, but amid his complicated entrenchments rose
the white-walled, red-tiled houses of the Flemish village, the
ancient church, with the slender bell towers rising clearly into
the spring air. The Allies would have been well advised to leave
Tournay to its fate and not to offer a challenge to so able a
general so well entrenched, and the blame of their mistake has
been given to Cumberland, always a scapegoat, but the fact is
that the Allied commanders were unanimous in their decision to
attack.</p>

<p>It was not so much Tournay that was at stake as prestige,
Cumberland and his allies could not afford to forgo a chance of
victory and they had been badly misinformed, the number of the
French was nearly as many again as Cumberland's spies had told
him it was. The exact number of men on either side cannot be
ascertained, some military historians give Maurice the advantage
of six thousand more than Cumberland, but all that can be known
with certainty is that both the Allies and the French had about
fifty thousand men.</p>

<p>The English troops were well disciplined and keen; the war was
popular in England where Maria Theresa was regarded as something
of a persecuted heroine and there was still a sense that the
French were the natural foes of the English, a heritage from the
long wars of Louis XIV. The threatened, though abortive invasion
had roused the British, too, and these continual attempts on the
part of the House of Bourbon to thrust the House of Stuart on a
people who had definitely cast them out, were sharply resented;
the British Government had been for some time aware of the
importance of a war that, if it set the French in Vienna and
jeopardised the liberty of the Netherlands, would upset the
balance of power in the West, and eleven new regiments had been
raised in 1741. Well matched, therefore, in all respects, save in
their generals, the two armies confronted each other on the
morning of the May 11, 1745.</p>

<p>The King, the Dauphin and the royal household took their
places on a little hill, where the soldiers could salute them as
they went into action. Maurice, still unable to sit on horse-
back, had been carried, during the preceding night, from post to
post, inspecting everything, giving his final orders with clarity
and precision. Tormented with thirst and forbidden to drink, he
rolled a musket ball in his mouth in order to create a little
saliva and by sheer energy of will dominated his atrocious
sufferings.</p>

<p>"A fine day for His Majesty!" he cried to Lowendal when he saw
the sun rise in a cloudless sky. And he gazed with deep pride and
pleasure on the half moon of his waiting troops, dragoons,
guards, infantry, hussars, light horse, with their officers
bearing the most magnificent names in France before them;
standards, drums, cannon, all the panoply of war in exact
array.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the French outposts signalled by burning a
group of cottages that the enemy was advancing.</p>

<p>Cumberland was making for the only gap in the French sector,
that of about half a mile between the outer redoubt of St. Eu and
the village of Fontenoy. He had given the post of honour to his
twenty-five thousand British troops, the Dutch and Austrians were
on the left. The young general, inexperienced and too ardent, was
in the cruel position of being faced by the greatest soldier of
the age and in attempting to carry Maurice's admirable position
by assault he was undertaking what only a Marlborough could have
performed successfully; but this admitted, it must also be
allowed that he did the utmost that any man could have done and
in spite of severe handicaps. The first of these was a
misunderstood order; he had ordered the redoubt of St. Eu to be
taken, but the two Austrian battalions entrusted with this task
did not move; while the Dutch sent against Fontenoy and Antoing
soon fell back.</p>

<p>Cumberland perceived these misfortunes and sent his aides
galloping with fresh instructions as he carried out his own part
of the plan of assault and advanced at the head of the British
troops&mdash;ten battalions of infantry in the first line, seven
battalions in the second line&mdash;up the slope towards the
earthworks that enclosed the waiting French. Many men have lost
their presence of mind through fear, Cumberland was apt to lose
his head through courage; his father said of him that "his head
turned" when in action through the passionate desire to be
everywhere, to inspire every man with his own fiery courage.</p>

<p>He now went from rank to rank, exhorting the British in the
warmest terms, to which they responded with cries and shouts; as
neither Fontenoy nor St. Eu had been taken, silenced, or even
engaged in the struggle, Cumberland and his men marched forward
under a deadly cross fire from these two points. Their ranks did
not break, and Cumberland's trust in their iron discipline and
the murderous accuracy of their musketry was justified. When they
were within range of the French earthworks, he gave the order to
fire; as the answering volley rang out the first French line fell
almost to a man; by the time the second line had formed, the
British were ready to fire again, and did, advancing, Cumberland
at their head, right into the enemy's position; a hand to hand
fight with muskets, sabres and swords ensued; the standards
swaying above the combatants as the British thrust their colours
through the breaches in the wall.</p>

<p>The French regiment at the earthworks, that of the Dauphin,
was taken by surprise and was overwhelmed as the British rushed,
with wild cries, through the smoke and dust towards Fontenoy. The
veteran de Noailles thought the day was lost and was terrified
about the safety of the King and Dauphin, but Maurice being borne
in his litter through the smoke and din ordered his concealed
artillery into play against the still-advancing British, to whom
Cumberland had given as an objective the delicate spire of
Fontenoy church.</p>

<p>Cumberland, however, still forced on, though caught between
St. Eu and Fontenoy, which his allies had done nothing to take;
the Dutch and Austrians, either through misunderstanding or
lethargy, were now little more than spectators. There was a
bloody medley within the French lines; the French infantry could
not stand up to the British musketry; the reckless bravery and
general incompetence of the royal Princes and the aristocratic
officers added to the confusion, in some cases to the panic;
orders and counter orders were frantically given and Maurice,
shouting from his litter, could hardly make himself understood,
or even heard.</p>

<p>Cumberland had found himself on the edge of the ravine that
protected Fontenoy, so abandoning that objective, he changed his
tactics, and forming his troops, now supported by some Dutch
regiments, into an immense column, threw it, with the precision
of one aiming a dagger at a shield, at the slight hill where four
battalions of French guards waited.</p>

<p>When the English gained the hill and saw the ranks of France
before them there was a pause and the enemies saluted one
another. The famous anecdote that is told of this occasion is
hardly likely to be true, but is still related.</p>

<p>Lord Charles Hay, the story goes, advanced from the British
ranks, as the officers raised their hats in salute of the
chivalry of France, and said: "Gentlemen, give the order to
fire." Upon which the Comte Auteroche replied: "No, we never fire
first." The English thereupon fired and laid a thousand Frenchmen
on the field; in any case the English broke the French line, and
their terrible column still advanced, Cumberland, the standards,
at its head; Maurice too, began to think the day might be lost.
He threw in his cavalry, and the hussars, sabres in their hands,
galloped against the British infantry. Cumberland's lines did not
break; his men met the cavalry with the bayonet, with musketry
fire; the hussars charged again and again but the British ranks
appeared invincible; they were not to be turned back even when
Maurice added the infantry of the <i>Maison du Roi,</i> whom he
had held in reserve behind the woods of Barre, to the hideous
<i>mêlée.</i></p>

<p>"God give me strength to survive the day&mdash;a victor," he
said. Of what God was he thinking? The battle lasted six hours;
when, at two o'clock in the afternoon news was brought to Maurice
that Cumberland, with the tattered British flag and ten thousand
infantry, was still advancing, though slowly, the Saxon saw that
only desperate measures could save the day. He called up his last
reserves, the Irish battalions under the command of Lord Thomond
the descendants of the "Wild Geese" of Limerick and, making an
heroic effort, was lifted from his litter to a horse. Grasping
his sword in his swollen fingers, his cloak dragged over the
cuirass he could scarcely support, Maurice shouted on the Irish
brigades against the shattered, but still-advancing British.</p>

<p>These fresh troops were too much for Cumberland, unsupported
as he was by his allies, and having sustained six hours' combat
against most unequal odds, he could do no more; he gave the
signal for retreat, and the British withdrew slowly in good
order, rolling sullenly, with torn flags and tattered, bloody
uniforms, down the trampled slope up which Cumberland had led
them that morning.</p>

<p>The losses were equal; about six thousand five hundred dead
and wounded; each side the advantage lay in the glory and
prestige acquired; France had inflicted a defeat in the field on
England that was considered as definite and spectacular as any
since the days of Jeanne d'Arc.</p>

<p>Cumberland sent a laconic note to Waldeck&mdash;"My Prince, I
shall retire under the guns of Ath"&mdash;and withdrew in good
order. There is no record of what passed between him and his
allies on the subject of the disobedience of his commands, which
had cost him the battle; his feelings must have been bitter, for
it was only through lack of support that he had been prevented
from wresting, through sheer dogged valour, victory from the
foremost general of the day entrenched in a position that he
deemed impregnable. Certainly Maurice had to thank the behaviour
of the Austrians and Dutch, as well as his own genius, for his
famous victory.</p>

<p>It should be said, however, that the Netherlanders left nearly
one thousand five hundred dead and wounded behind. If, when the
issue of the day was uncertain, the Dutch battalions had come to
the aid of Cumberland and his infantry, then struggling with
horse and foot together, the <i>Te Deum</i> might have been sung
in St. Paul's instead of Notre-Dame.</p>

<p>But Waldeck's troops undoubtedly displayed that natural
slowness and deliberation so admirable in business and sometimes
in politics, but rarely successful in a pitched battle; little
blame can be attached to the Netherlanders for their lack of
enthusiasm. Their State was reluctant to enter the war and their
soldiers were naturally reluctant to fight in it, but it is odd
that they offered so feeble a support to the efforts of the
British to drive the enemy from their own frontiers. It should be
noted, nevertheless, that there was a fair number of Dutch dead
and wounded left on the field.</p>

<p>Certain it is that, as if disdaining the whole affair, that
many of the Dutch troops retired early with a loss so small that
the <i>Gazette de Hollande</i> apologised for it by saying that
they had been alarmed by a row of dummy guns in the French
trenches, an excuse that hardly betters the case and was probably
meant cynically.</p>

<p>The victory of Fontenoy was the personal triumph of Maurice
and of Maurice alone; whether in his wicker carriage, or forcing
himself on horse-back, always half-fainting with pain, hindered
by all the elaborate ceremonial rendered necessary by the
presence of the King and the Dauphin, embarrassed by the
incapacity and arrogance of the Princes of the Blood, Maurice was
over the field in the shortest possible space of time, at the
last galloping from rank to rank of the Irish reserves shouting
his own orders, animating the men, forcing, as it were, the
French on to victory by the sheer energy of his own impetuous and
valiant spirit. When he learned of the retreat of Cumberland he
collapsed and was taken half conscious to his tent; the officers
who gathered round him with enthusiastic praises and
congratulations found him sprawling in a chair, convulsed with
agony, a yellow saliva dripping from his mouth, while his
physician waited to tap him for dropsy; after he had gulped a cup
of soup he contrived to whisper: "Gentlemen, you see me more
fatigued than I can tell you&mdash;but I'm pleased with to-day's
work."</p>

<p>He was put to bed and operated upon; the King came to enquire
after him; couriers hastened with the news to Paris; the nation
was delirious with joy; Voltaire said that it was three hundred
years since a King of France had performed so glorious an action,
and he wrote his <i>Poème à Fontenoy.</i></p>

<p>Maurice was worried about some technical errors, which he
believed he had made&mdash;he ought to have had another redoubt
where Cumberland had passed through between St. Eu and Fontenoy,
but, he added in unconscious tribute to the British commander, "I
did not think that any general would be bold enough to pass
through there." He was not generous towards his valiant foes, but
he wrote to a friend that "Les Anglais ont été étrillés en chiens
courtauds!"</p>

<p>The slaughter had been terrible; some British regiments had
lost half their number; nearly twelve thousand dead and wounded
were scattered round Fontenoy, Antoing and the woods of Barre.
The King of France had displayed the courage expected of an
ordinary trooper and no more during the engagement and
sentimentalised the battle in the true spirit of the period, by
remarking to the young Dauphin as he pointed out the heaps of
slain and dying, "See, my son, on what the glory of Kings is
built." A pretty example of the mock heroic. Or is it possible
that Louis XV was genuinely moved by the ghastly spectacle of so
much blood, ruin, misery, waste and horror, that he might enjoy
the glory of a purposeless victory in a war undertaken out of
arrogance and continued through despair.</p>

<p>There were, at least, some present at this dreadful slaughter
who were moved out of professional insensibility; Comte M.
d'Argenson himself wrote to Voltaire: "To give the other side of
the picture, I remarked that one too soon acquires the custom of
regarding unmoved the field of battle covered with nude corpses,
dying men in agony, ghastly wounds. For myself, I admit that my
heart often failed me and I had need of a dram...A triumph of
this kind is one of the finest things in the world, but it rests
on spilt human blood and torn morsels of human flesh."</p>

<p>Both the d'Argenson brothers were present at the engagement;
the son of the Marquis, M. de Voyeu greatly distinguished himself
in the action.</p>

<p>M. de Seychelles was also sickened by the sights he had to see
and remarked pointlessly, "that it was a good thing for M. le
Dauphin to see, at his tender age, the price of royalty."</p>

<p>Sensibility of another kind was shown by the Prince de Croy:
"This terrible spectacle," he wrote, "did not affect me in the
least. I went over the field asking after my friends, many of
whom were dying, with a calm that astonished myself. In the
evening everyone was going about, looking after the wounded,
enquiring about acquaintances, delighted when these were found
safe, for never is one so fond of one's comrades as after a
battle. But, as for me, I remained cold and indifferent, doing my
part mechanically, regretting that I remained unscathed, for my
misfortune was always present before me and prevented me from
having any attachment to life."</p>

<p>M. de Croy's "misfortune" was the loss of his wife in the
preceding year and it is agreeable in an age that seems callous
and corrupt, at least among the French aristocrats, to find so
much constancy&mdash;and to a wife. Honours were distributed
immediately after the action; the King rode from regiment to
regiment, praising all, in particular the Irish brigade, whose
advent had forced the dogged British soldiers to retreat. An
Irish sergeant, named Wheelock, had captured the one British flag
to fall in the hands of the French; he was given commissioned
rank on the spot; the same honour was accorded to other
sergeants.</p>

<p>The Ministers took fifteen days to prepare the list of the
other recipients of rewards; apart from promotions and the cross
of Saint-Louis, handsome "gratifications" to the officers and men
of thirteen regiments were provided from an almost exhausted
treasury.</p>

<p>It was admitted that the trophies of the great victory were
scanty; fifteen Dutch and eight English pieces of cannon had been
abandoned; and the Comte d'Estrées, who had been sent, not in
pursuit of Cumberland, but to observe his movements, returned
with the report that the British were encamped on the Dendre and
brought back with him one hundred and fifty baggage waggons and
nearly two thousand wounded men, Dutch and English, who had been
left on the line of retreat.</p>

<p>The care of these unfortunates constituted a grim problem; the
French reckoned over seven thousand killed and wounded of their
own, including twenty-two nobles of the <i>Maison du Roi.</i> M.
Seychelles, to whom, as <i>intendant,</i> this important work
fell, had made his preparations in advance; he had ordered the
sick to be moved from the hospitals of Lille, Douai and the
military field hospital that was established near Notre-Dame-aux-
Bois. To the rooms thus vacant the wounded of Fontenoy were now
transported on more than four hundred waggons and carts. For
those too ill to be moved, a hospital was constructed on the
battle-field.</p>

<p>The sappers and miners were charged with the task of burying
the dead, and in twenty-four hours interred at least five
thousand corpses; for this they received extra pay. The
inhabitants of Lille, headed by their magistrates, threw
themselves with zeal into the succour of the wounded; every
surgeon and apothecary in the town offered his services, and
every household supplied a quota of linen, medicines and the
inevitable "bouillon" that seemed so highly valued. The prisoners
were treated exactly the same as the French, a fact of which
Louis XV took care to assure himself; when Waldeck sent thirty
waggons to pick up the Dutch wounded, he found only fourteen men,
the others being cared for by the French&mdash;"now they are
defeated and captive," said Comte d'Argenson, "they are no longer
our enemies."</p>

<p>The usual tales of atrocities went round and the French were
accused by the English of using pieces of glass and the buttons
of uniforms in their muskets; there seems no foundation for such
slanders and the French certainly behaved with humanity and even
chivalry.</p>

<p>By the end of the month a large number of the wounded had
died, but the mortality was equally high among the French, and
due, not to lack of care, but to primitive conditions of hygiene
and lack of medical knowledge. It is interesting to note the fate
of the two thousand three hundred and eight Dutch and English
wounded; after a fortnight two hundred and seventy-three were
dead, five had entered the service of France and fifteen were in
prison. The French held as manyprisoners as possible, for George
II had refused to release Belleisle whom he held, unlawfully, the
French maintained, as a hostage.</p>

<p>Maurice de Saxe could not have hoped to gain more for France
by this costly victory than Tournay; the town surrendered on May
21, but the garrison retreated to the citadel and there defended
themselves for another month. For himself, he had gained almost
everything for which he had ever longed; by universal acclaim he
was put beside Frederick of Prussia as one of the greatest
generals of the age. The French even mentioned him in the same
breath as Condé and Turenne and Louis XV was prodigal in rewards.
His Christian Majesty overwhelmed Maurice with caresses and
compliments; a pension of forty thousand <i>livres</i>, a
<i>tabouret</i> in the royal presence, a coach in the royal
courtyard, the regal château of Chambord, once the retreat of
King Stanislas, as a residence&mdash;these unexampled rewards
were not considered too dazzling for the victor of Fontenoy.</p>

<p>The permission for Maurice&mdash;and his wife, if he should
marry&mdash;to enter the courtyard of the Louvre in a carriage,
and to seat himself on a stool in the presence of members of the
royal house, was given in a brevet, signed by Louis in "the camp
before Tournay" on June 6, 1745.</p>

<p>France was delirious with patriotic enthusiasm for the barren
victory; it seemed as if the great days of Louis XIV had
returned; the great service at Notre-Dame, where the <i>Te
Deum</i> was attended by forty bishops, was held as a day of
national rejoicing; the King, the Government and Maurice de Saxe
were wildly popular. His health had rallied a little after
Fontenoy and his success gave him a high good humour, which
delighted the French people, who found even his coarse
pleasantries very agreeable.</p>

<p>Louis XV returned to Paris and the arms of Madame Pompadour,
to savour to the full these triumphs, which were to be the last
his House would enjoy, and Maurice continued his conquests;
Cumberland, who was now outnumbered, two to one, could not stay
him, and was soon recalled to England to face the rebellion in
the North, a diversion engineered by the French, in which Charles
Stuart and the Scotch were the unhappy cat's-paws.</p>

<p>While Cumberland was rallying his men at Lichfield, in
expectation of a French invasion, Maurice was taking the Flemish
towns, Ath, Bruges, Oudenarde and Ostend, as if he was collecting
pebbles from his path. He announced the capture of Ghent by
sending the King a basket containing a fine <i>"langue de
veau"</i>,&gt; this delicacy being a speciality of Ghent.
Contrary to all custom, he decided to remain with the army during
the winter, and prepared the plan for a new campaign with the
knowledge of the Comte d'Argenson only.</p>

<p>Glory! He had had a taste of it and now meant to glut himself,
as he had glutted himself&mdash;but never to satiety&mdash;with
other pleasures. He had an army under his command, a treasury
(even though a depleted one) behind him, a government, even
though a feeble one, to support him.</p>

<p>While Cumberland's advance guard was struggling through the
snow towards Penrith, and Cumberland was teaching his men how to
meet claymore and shield by the sideway thrust, Maurice was
concentrating on Brussels, marching his men through icebound,
flooded fields, against bitter winds, in six different
directions.</p>

<p>The Dutch Governor, Kaunitz, completely taken by surprise at
the audacity of the assault, resisted bravely but in vain; on
February 21, 1746, the white flag flew over the capital of
Brabant and the whole province lay at the mercy of Maurice de
Saxe. Among the many treasures found by the conquerors in the
superb city was the oriflamme captured at the battle of Pavia by
the Spanish.</p>

<p>Maurice then decided to return to Paris; he knew that he had
his enemies; the Prince de Conti remained implacable and there
were others busily intriguing against him; he was accused by many
of the aristocratic officers, whom he had totally eclipsed, of
prolonging the war for his benefit, and many were eagerly
watching for his sudden death through his renewed debaucheries.
But Maurice defied them all; he had had almost all&mdash;but only
almost&mdash;that he wanted. There was no crown or sovereignty in
the offing and he longed for royal honours with the single-
hearted lust of a child for a coveted toy, persistently withheld.
His admirers whispered that he deserved, and his enemies that he
expected, the office&mdash;quasiregal&mdash;of Governor of the
Spanish Netherlands. It seemed likely, too, that he might live to
enjoy his honours; he was well enough to direct the operations
against Brussels in mid-winter, to enjoy his brutal sports, to
which he had added cock fighting, and to make a triumphal entry
into Brussels.</p>

<p>Sending his troops into winter quarters as late as March,
after having overrun Flanders, Maurice returned to Paris as
Cumberland, realising that there would now be no French invasion,
was taking command of the troops who were to pursue Charles
Stuart to his last stand on Culloden Moor. French strategy had
been successful in this attempt to cause a rebellion in England,
in so far as it had drained Flanders of British troops and made
Maurice's conquests easy, while Cumberland and his seasoned
troops were held in Scotland.</p>

<p>When Maurice&mdash;"conqueror of the English" arrived in Paris
in the early spring of 1746, he was received with a very fever of
adulation. Louis XV had almost exhausted his rewards, there was
little else he could do for Maurice de Saxe beyond what he had
already done, but he paid him the supreme compliment of
naturalising him as a Frenchman (April, 1746) to the further
jealousy and disgust of the Princes of the Blood; but Maurice had
no difficulty in ignoring this spite of the <i>troupe dorée,</i>
so complete was his triumph, and so frantic the popular
acclamation.</p>

<p>He had now somewhat recovered from his disorders and was able
to show himself from the galleries of Versailles, in the streets
of Paris and in a box at the Opera. Here his appearance was the
signal for an outburst of enthusiasm. A fair actress, dressed to
appear as the eighteenth-century conception of Victory, stepped
from the glittering stage and offered to set her laurels on the
powdered curls of the victor of Fontenoy; Maurice made a fitting
protest but amidst immense applause was finally persuaded by the
Duc de Villeroi to fasten this glittering garland on his arm.</p>

<p>The unwieldy, stout figure of Maurice de Saxe, with his coarse
purple face, his manner that began daily to savour more of the
camp than of the court, his brusque air, his hearty laugh, his
Teutonic bluntness that hid a good deal of shrewdness and even
slyness, decked in all the flamboyant bravery of his French
uniform, took the imagination of the people, who had, indeed,
lately lacked heroes to worship, and this foreigner easily became
the most popular man in France.</p>

<p>M. de Saxe was not, however, so admired at court, where he
exercised to the full his privileges of entering into the royal
presence and made no apology for his friendship with the King.
The jealousy of the nobles amounted to hatred in some cases and
his inveterate enemy, the Prince de Conti, had to be rebuked more
than once for his behaviour to Maurice, now Maréchal de
France.</p>

<p>Never had great men been so feted in Paris; there was a furore
of silliness over the victor of Fontenoy and among the beautiful
and celebrated women who struggled for the favour of offering him
luxurious entertainment was Madame de la Popelinère, wife of the
famous financier, of easy virtue and dazzling charm; there was
also Mlle Galin who interested him intermittently for three
years; but he began to perceive that his mistresses were
unfaithful to him, and played him tricks; he was no longer all-
conquering; some of these "little creatures" who "turned his
head" escaped him, or showed too clearly that they only gave what
had been paid for; a sigh escaped him for the fine days when
women had pursued him for the splendour of his person as much as
for his fame and money.</p>

<p>He was in Paris when the news of Culloden, which ended for
ever the use of the Jacobite pawn for France, came to Louis XV;
this was in practical importance, if not in glory, more than a
set off to Fontenoy and set Cumberland and his veterans free to
return to the seat of war; the Highland episode was regarded but
as an episode in the struggle with France, and Cumberland's
grenadiers threw up their caps on the northern moor, shouting,
"Now for Flanders, Billy!"</p>

<p>Maurice soon felt the wretched effect of his Parisian excesses
and making as he termed it "a truce with pleasure" returned to
Lowendal's seat at La Ferté; he then paid a short visit to
Chambord, which satisfied even his lust for magnificence.</p>

<p>But a crown still evaded him&mdash;a crown and Madame Favart;
the little actress had proved more difficult to take than
Brussels.</p>

<p>He maintained his hold on the King and on the King's
favourite, but apart from these, he had no real friends; despite
his services to France, the M. and M. d'Argenson remained his
enemies, and even Madame Pompadour, though she encouraged him and
found him useful, understood him too well. Maurice was not fine
enough to read between the lines of the elegant letters, in which
flattery concealed irony, that she wrote him congratulating him
on the homage he paid to love amid the fatigues and labours of
war. She added that she thought beauty "divine"; (she had
certainly found it profitable) and that she thought the "grandeur
of God" shone with more brilliancy on a handsome face than in the
brain of a Newton. Such words, addressed to Maurice were double-
edged; it was long since he could have claimed <i>"un beau
visage."</i> He had many brushes with Ministers and courtiers; he
bore his honours very arrogantly towards these, though he was
coarsely good-humoured with his toadies and inferiors.</p>

<p>Most of these fine French aristocrats saw through him, even
when they did not dislike him; the Marquis d'Argenson, as much
his enemy as the Prince de Conti, wrote of him in something the
same terms that Madame Pompadour had used. "He has not much
intelligence, he likes only war, mechanics and easy beauties.
Besides these, what is there but a disorderly German soldier
without breeding?"</p>

<p>It was said of him that under his command only the thick
witted were promoted, and, despite his discipline at Prague, he
was accused of brutal pillaging of the captured Flemish towns;
worse, from a Frenchman's point of view&mdash;"he liked poor
company&mdash;not only in women but in men"; in brief, he had no
taste, no <i>"esprit."</i></p>

<p>He had, however, a rough sense of humour, and when a seat in
the French Academy was offered him, refused, declaring that he
could not even write or spell, "I've always feared ridiculous
things and this seems to me to be one."</p>

<p>Maurice returned to his headquarters in Flanders slightly
restored in health, glittering with all the honours France had to
bestow, to meet Prince Charles of Lorraine, with four battalions
of British, near Liége.</p>

<p>The Princes of the Blood now began an even fiercer resistance
to the elevation of Maurice; they refused to serve under this
bastard adventurer, Conti pretended to the command of the forces
on the Rhine, Clermont of the House of Condé, irked under
Maurice's authority and sneered at him at his own table, upon
which the Maréchal dared to demote him&mdash;a prince of the
royal family&mdash;to a mere brigade of infantry and a regiment
of dragoons. The royal princes did not forgive this high-
handedness, and the feeling in the camp was fiercely bitter.</p>

<p>The cold haughtiness of Conti, who treated him <i>"en grand
seigneur,"</i> pierced even the thick skin of Maurice, and when
Conti refused to support him before the walls of Mons, the
Marshal thought it wise not to press the matter.</p>

<p>The brilliant little company, headed by Favart, accompanied
Maurice during the campaign of 1746, and it was before the battle
of Raucoux that Maurice delivered his famous order to the actor:
"I shall give battle to-morrow. No one knows yet&mdash;announce
my intention in a few lines after the fall of the curtain to-
night." And Madame Favart did so in some neat couplets:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Demain bataille, jour de gloire."</p>
<br>

<p>Maurice did beat the Austrians&mdash;ten thousand dead,
trophies of flags, cannon, prisoners&mdash;"if I had had a few
more hours of daylight, M. le Prince Charles would have saved
nothing," the victor declared.</p>

<p>By November he was again in Paris and with two heavy intrigues
on his hands, the struggle with Conti, who was gaining ground
with the King and striving hard for the appointment of
<i>generalissimo</i> for the next campaign, and who was backed by
almost the entire French aristocracy, and the pursuit of Madame
Favart.</p>

<p>The story of the Favarts is like an episode of Pierrot and
Pierrette, of Harlequin and Columbine, amid the gross luxury and
extravagant materialism of the story of Maurice de Saxe. It
covers his two last campaigns, his furious rivalry with Conti,
his negotiations with the Saxon court for the marriage of the
Dauphin and the first part of his retirement to Chambord, but it
is here told as a continuous narrative.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2.3" id="ch2.3"></a>III. SCOUNDREL'S
DIVERSION</h2>

<p class="first">MADAME FAVART was the celebrated actress who had
spoken the lines "<i>Demain bataille,"</i> from the boards of M.
de Saxe's elegant little travelling theatre the evening before
Raucoux. It was considered "heroic" to have the approaching
engagement announced by an actress to the crowds of officers
gathered to watch the elegant vaudeville. The coquettish lady,
instructed by Maurice, had sung:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"To-morrow, battle! the day of glory!"</p>
<br>

<p>Which in the chronicles of history will show once more the
triumph of the French name,</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Worthy of eternal memory."</p>
<br>

<p>Then, advancing, the charming creature had declared with much
spirit, "To-morrow, gentlemen, there will be no performance
because of the battle. The day afterwards we shall give the
'<i>Coq du Village</i>.'"</p>

<p>This was very much to the taste of the moment and the defeat
of Charles of Lorraine was more appreciated for being announced
through the pretty lips of an admired actress in frivolous and
dramatic fashion.</p>

<p>Justine Duronceray was for comedy something what Adrienne
Lecouvreur had been for tragedy; she had every gift necessary for
success in her chosen career. Delicate and gay, lively, witty and
tender, she was both an accomplished actress and an exquisite
singer. As she was also a pretty woman she soon became one of the
favourites of the Parisians and sang under the name of Mlle
Chantilly at the Opera House, where Maurice first saw her and
coveted her; he soon discovered that he had met a woman capable
of repulsing him and whose affections were fixed, with sure
constancy, elsewhere.</p>

<p>The lovely creature was not, strangely enough, for sale; she
was quite content with her husband, an actor, a writer, a
musician and producer who ran a little travelling theatre that
gave shows at the famous Paris fairs and in other places.</p>

<p>When Maurice saw that it was hopeless to assail the wife
directly, he decided to win her through the husband, and entered
into the mean intrigue with that slyness and subtle dishonesty
which were among his ugliest traits and which quite destroy his
reputation for candour and good humour.</p>

<p>There was much competition among the actors of Paris for the
post of director of Maurice's field theatre, and he knew this
when he offered it, in flattering terms, to the husband of Mlle
Chantilly.</p>

<p>M. Favart was a brilliant, as well as an honest and charming
man. He brought his troupe eagerly enough to the front and
followed with his Thespian cart the army of Maurice across the
ravaged fields of Flanders, giving almost every night a
performance in a tent, where topical verses, composed by himself,
were related by his company with verve and spirit.</p>

<p>He left, however, his delicious wife in Paris and Maurice saw
that he would have to take more trouble to gain by intrigue what
he could not gain by the force of his personal charms; he
scarcely, perhaps, realised that he was but the ruins of the
magnificent cavalier who had scaled the breaches at Belgrade or
captured the heart of Anna Ivanowa but, in any case, he
determined to have the actor's wife. It would be difficult to
find any occasion on which the hero had not been a scoundrel in
his relations with women, and in his plots against M. and Madame
Favart he was at his worst.</p>

<p>Difficulty inflamed his passion and he decided to gain his end
however long and however much it cost; he, therefore, flattered
the actor to the top of his bent; nothing was too good for M.
Favart and his troupe, who were overwhelmed with compliments,
with presents, with privileges; during the campaign of 1746,
Favart was installed at the headquarters in Brussels.</p>

<p>Proud of his art and secure in the devoted affection of his
wife, whose loyalty it never occurred to him to doubt, Favart,
called by Voltaire the "Molière of the Opera," really believed in
the good faith of the great Marshal, whose officers he amused.
Nor did he suspect anything when Maurice suggested to him that
Mlle de Chantilly would give the last touch of brilliancy to the
travelling theatre.</p>

<p>The actor at once wrote enthusiastically to his wife, and she
broke off an engagement at the Opera to travel to Flanders, where
she was received with all respect by Maurice.</p>

<p>Her beauty and her charm did indeed give further grace and
brilliancy to the little theatre, making Maurice's travelling
show the finest of any that the French army could boast.</p>

<p>The Marshal held his hand and overwhelmed the young couple,
whose devotion was as obvious as it was rare, with his presents.
There were horses, there was a carriage, there were travelling
beds covered with fine satin, there were wine and delicacies from
the Marshal's own table. In a country pillaged, burnt, exhausted
and surrounded by half-starved, ruined people, the actors and
actresses and all their entourage, for Maurice's generosity
extended to the whole troupe, could live as they had never
dreamed to live in Paris.</p>

<p>Favart was not as reckless as the gilded nobility who
surrounded him. He put money by and hoped, as he said with
delight to a friend, to have fifty thousand francs of savings
when he returned to Paris.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maurice declared himself to the delicious Justine,
who had not encouraged him by as much as a glance or a smile.</p>

<p>The officers, the court, watched the intrigue with amusement,
some with a touch of compassion; it was an uncommon, perhaps a
pathetic little episode. How long would the actress withstand the
great man who had never had any difficulty with a woman before?
There were bets on the subject, jests and anecdotes bandied about
the camp.</p>

<p>Only M. Favart, elegant and smart as a figure by Lancret in
his satins and laces, was completely deceived and rejoiced with
touching single-heartedness in his unexpected good fortune.</p>

<p>He was a fine artist and knew his worth, it did not therefore
occur to him to doubt the sincerity of M. de Saxe when the
Marshal declared that he did not wish the troupe merely to amuse
his officers; the actors, by their arts were to encourage and
inspire the soldiers, and the graceful, refined satire of some of
their pieces was to help to throw discredit upon the enemy. They
were, indeed, to supply propaganda for the army and the French
nation. So completely was Favart hoodwinked that he even
ingenuously indentified himself with his munificent patron and
wrote to Paris of "<i>our</i> success, <i>our</i> prisoners."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maurice began to lay more and more open siege to the
woman, whom, could he have won, he would have forgotten in a
day.</p>

<p>He sent her the love letters that Voltaire had written for him
in honour of Adrienne de Lecouvreur, together with some verses
from the same source, as well as the most extravagant gifts.</p>

<p>Madame Favart perfectly understood her position; but she loved
her husband and she was not dazzled by Maurice; she realised the
type with whom she had to deal and she did the only possible
thing for a woman in her situation&mdash;she fled from the camp
and took refuge in the Brabant capital with a great lady, Madame
de Chevreuse, who had long been her patroness and friend.</p>

<p>Maurice was furious, the husband bewildered; he tried to put
forward some feeble excuse of his wife's illness, but the wrath
of the Marshal fell upon the unfortunate actor, to whom the
enraged soldier showed his most brutal side. He would, he
declared, have Madame Favart "dragged by grenadiers from
Brussels;" he regarded her departure as nothing less than a
desertion from his flag. Not only all luxuries, but all pay and
comfort were taken away from the unfortunate actors, who had all
their pay and supplies stopped. Favart had to spend his savings,
then to sell what he had in the way of goods in order to save
himself and his company from starvation.</p>

<p>Madame Favart went from Brussels to Paris, where she returned
to the stage in order to earn her living, and the full wrath of
the Marshall fell upon the unhappy husband; his company was
disbanded under the pretence that it offended the morals of the
officers, and the unhappy players were left in a foreign country
in wartime not only without friends and resources, but given over
to an active persecutor. For Maurice so manoeuvred the matter
that Favart and his troupe were presented with a bill for twenty-
five thousand <i>livres</i> under the excuse that they owed this
for rent of various rooms in towns and villages where they had
given their shows.</p>

<p>The troupe broke up, the wretched artists wandering away in
misery&mdash;scattered; Favart made his way painfully back to
Paris and there, when the troops went into winter quarters,
Maurice returned.</p>

<p>The actor presented himself before his one-time patron,
demanding the truth: Why this persecution? Would not the Marshal
at least give him a letter of recommendation to some friend who
might employ him?</p>

<p>Maurice, instead, obtained a <i>lettre-de-cachet</i> with the
intention of throwing the unhappy comedian into the Bastille.
Favart, however, heard of the design in time and fled, utterly
ruined, from the French capital; by travelling day and night, he
managed to evade pursuit and to reach Strassburg where a friend
hid him. Justine Favart was still in Paris, and she still ignored
Maurice.</p>

<p>Every night, in order to gain her living, she sang on the
boards of the <i>Comédie Italienne.</i> She had no friends beyond
the members of her own profession, as powerless as herself
against a man in the position of Maurice de Saxe. She had no
protector, save the hired but faithful servant who followed her
every evening from the theatre to her lodgings, when on foot and
disguised she made her way by back streets in the hope of evading
possible kidnappers.</p>

<p>Every night she wrote to her husband, sometimes putting a
flower she had worn between the pages of her letter. Not only did
the young couple keep up a tender and touching correspondence,
but Madame Favart even contrived to escape from Fontainebleau
where her troupe was engaged to amuse the Court and to meet her
husband at Luneville.</p>

<p>This adventure proved, however, a great imprudence. When she
was stepping out of her carriage on her return, she was arrested
by two police agents, who pretended that they were to re-conduct
her to Fontainebleau, where the King wished to see her again to
act her part on the stage.</p>

<p>In truth the men were sent by the orders of Maurice, and
Madame Favart found herself conducted to the convent of Andelys,
where she was enclosed, having only time to write a short letter
to her husband, in which she declared that whatever happened she
would remain faithful to him.</p>

<p>After days of bitter suspense she learned the nature of the
intrigue against her; Maurice de Saxe had bribed her own father,
M. Duronceray, to act with him in endeavouring to prove that her
marriage with Favart was illegal.</p>

<p>In vain the desperate woman contrived to smuggle a letter to
her husband, telling him to get together all his papers and
prove, as surely could easily be done, that they were "legally
and properly married."</p>

<p>Any reply was intercepted, but she received letters from
Maurice de Saxe, full of alternate menaces and caresses,
mentioning "the iron claw and velvet glove," telling her "that
all should be well with her would she but submit to his
will."</p>

<p>He moved her from the convent of Andelys to that of Angers as
a state prisoner and he continued his grim persecution of the
husband, who was forced to leave Luneville and to travel like a
vagabond from place to place, earning a miserable livelihood by
painting fans, often by the light of a candle in a dark
cellar.</p>

<p>Justine Favart wrote, as a last resource, a letter of appeal
to Maurice.</p>

<p>But the only answer she had was that she was a "fool to
sacrifice herself to a miserable actor, who ought to have been
very flattered that for him she forwent fortune, pleasure and
glory."</p>

<p>For under these agreeable terms the Marshal indicated his own
passing fancy.</p>

<p>The letter ended with a threat: "If you will not assure my
happiness, you will probably cause your own disaster and that of
Favart. I do not wish this, but I fear it."</p>

<p>Her imprisonment became more severe; she could obtain no news
of her husband, who was certainly ruined, if not dead.</p>

<p>The woman of the people, whose own father had been bought by
her persecutor, had no friend, no protector, no money or resource
of any kind; for her there was no hope of justice or of mercy.
Alone, a prisoner, continually menaced, her spirit broke; she
consented to visit Chambord and to entertain the hero with her
art and to offer him that loathing and terrified submission which
was all he wanted of her; as soon as her consent was obtained,
she was treated with more consideration, but not to make the
scandal too obvious, not immediately released but sent for a
while from one convent to another where she was gently treated,
while the persecution of her husband ceased and the two
<i>lettres-de-cachet</i> that Maurice had obtained against the
unfortunate couple were revoked.</p>

<p>He had obtained his end, the satisfaction of what he termed
his "love." Once this satisfaction was gained he had little
interest in the delicious Madame Favart. She was allowed,
disdainfully enough, to return to her young husband.</p>

<p>They had a mutual respect and tenderness one for the other and
the philosophy of the artist who is the under-dog. They did not
allow the brutality of Maurice de Saxe to ruin their marriage and
happiness. And in the tender affection and admiring respect of
her husband, Justine Favart endeavoured to forget those ugly
moments when she had visited the ogre's castle and been his
prey.</p>

<p>Such was the power, such was the manner, and such were the
sentiments of a great general, a magnificent gentleman, one who
deemed himself by blood and right, a Prince; the man whom
thousands acclaimed as a hero and whom the exquisite Adrienne
Lecouvreur had acclaimed as a "god."</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Part III. THE TROPHIES AND THE
DUST</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3.1" id="ch3.1"></a>I. A CHARMING SACRIFICE</h2>

<p class="first">WITH the opening of the campaign of 1747 Cumberland was again in Flanders, his allies were ineffectual and he was outnumbered.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, as if the dazzling star of Maurice de Saxe
was on the decline and that there would be no more victories like
Fontenoy for him; the pursuit of Madame Favart was not the only
intrigue that had occupied his leisure; the struggle with Conti
had reached dangerous proportions, and the Saxon's enemies had
increased in number.</p>

<p>Neither the King nor Madame Pompadour could afford to offend
all the Princes of the blood and most of the aristocracy; indeed,
they hardly wished to do so for the sake of this foreigner at
whom they laughed a little behind his back.</p>

<p>He was not really of their world, and their elegant depravity
found his gross indecency disgusting; he was heavy-witted, he was
horribly ill, he was noisy and aggressive; Versailles could do
without him; besides, what did all this glory amount to? France
could not afford the war, the King was bored with it, Madame
Pompadour did not want it; war had caused the elevation of M. de
Saxe, and for that reason alone, his enemies intrigued for
peace.</p>

<p>Madame de Conti had taken a hand in the intrigue, she promised
to present Madame Pompadour at court, if her son, as <i>"fils de
France,"</i> could have his rightful post as Commander-in-Chief
of the army that was to open the campaign of 1747 in Brabant. The
King's friendship for the Saxon was soon undermined; there were
so many at his ear ready to tell him, as d'Argenson noted, "how
little M. de Saxe was worth" and the favourite could not resist
the bribe offered by the great lady. So M. de Conti obtained his
brevet and M. de Saxe fell into ugly furies and talked of
retiring from the army; he felt that he was like his friend
Lowendal "absolutely discredited" by the intrigues of <i>"petits
maitres."</i> Then the King veered round; Maurice was extremely
popular with the people and had his friends at court, notably M.
de Valfons, his companion at arms, besides Louis did not know if
the redoubtable soldier might not yet be useful; the war was not
over; it was even possible that French frontiers might be
threatened again and M. de Conti could hardly be trusted to
defend them, able and arrogant as he might be.</p>

<p>So, like all weak people when pressed, Louis compromised;
Maurice received an office dormant since Turenne, whose patents
were espied in the diploma given to the Saxon, who became
<i>Maréchal Général</i> (January 1747), a rank that put him above
Conti, all the Marshals of France, not excepting those who were
Princes of the blood.</p>

<p>A change in French policy, inspired by the Marquis d'Argenson,
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, also immensely helped the dubious
position of Maurice; though d'Argenson was his enemy, a shifting
of the scene in Europe made them play the same game. The Foreign
Secretary decided to endeavour to detach Saxony from Austria; he
resolved to use that old line, a matrimonial alliance. The
Dauphin was a widower and might be considered the finest match in
Europe; there were many candidates for his hand, and each of
these had a party at the French court; the Queen favoured the
Infanta Antonia, as did the Maréchal de Noailles, and there were
powerful supporters for the daughters of the Duke of Modena and
for those of Charles Emanuel of Savoy.</p>

<p>M. d'Argenson gained over M. Loss, the Saxon Minister at
Paris, and the two of them approached M. de Saxe, who gladly
entered into the long, difficult and complicated intrigues
necessary to place his niece next to the throne of France; here
his long, intimate and secret correspondence with Augustus III,
his Queen and Count Bruhl was extremely useful, and Maurice,
during the campaigns of 1746-7, was secretly working at this
great scheme, which brought him so near the dazzle of a
crown.</p>

<p>The marriage of the Dauphin seemed of great importance; could
a prophet have looked into the future, he might well have advised
that this Prince should die unwed; but to these busy intriguers,
it seemed as if the end of the elder branch of the House of
Bourbon would be an unthinkable and unparalleled misfortune for
France. And the only hope of an heir to this elder line lay in
the Dauphin, whose first wife had left him with a frail baby
girl&mdash;Madame.</p>

<p>The King was still young, but when his sixth daughter was
born, he had remarked&mdash;"Madame sixth and last." Louis and
the wife he had once regarded with so much affection were indeed
completely estranged: and Madame de Pompadour saw to it that this
estrangement was permanent. The whole hope of a succession to the
throne therefore hung upon a second marriage for the Dauphin, who
was 16 years of age, sombre, pampered, and peevish, who disliked
his father, had no friends at court, who was bored alike by
sport, the theatre, the camp, whose only diversion was music. He
played the violoncello, sang in a promising bass voice and was an
expert on the clavecin.</p>

<p>He had been, also, devoted to his plain and gloomy little wife
and was sickened by grief at her early loss; he regarded with
aversion all the Princesses proposed to him, but Maurice was not
the less eager to secure this brilliant match for his niece,
Maria Josepha, known as Pepa, then fifteen years of age.</p>

<p>Maurice displayed a good deal of finesse, judgment and
shrewdness in these protracted and elaborate negotiations; he
even succeeded in winning de Noailles over to his side, and
working in accord with his brother, his sister-in-law and Count
Bruhl, he sprang his "mine," as he called it, and brought off the
marriage in spite of most powerful opposition in France.</p>

<p>It was considered an extraordinary triumph for the court of
Dresden when the affair was concluded. Augustus III decorated
with White Eagles and other distinctions all those who had taken
part in the long, tedious preliminaries to the announcement of
the marriage; the Marquis d'Argenson received a handsome service
in Saxon porcelain, while Louis XV sent the Count von Bruhl a
magnificent set of Gobelin tapestries, representing the twelve
months of the year; and one of the most charming and accomplished
courtiers of Versailles, the duc de Richelieu, first gentleman of
the chamber, was sent to Dresden to receive the bride, somewhat
to the chagrin of the French Ambassador in Dresden&mdash;M. des
Issart, who, however, allowed that "M. de Richelieu was the most
distinguished and the most decorative person in France."</p>

<p>For his part Maurice found time, amid battles, sieges and
court intrigues, to send long letters of advice and warnings to
the mother of the young bride; he urged haste in sending the
girl&mdash;"for I have promised a duke of Burgundy [title given
to the Dauphin's eldest son] by the end of the year and you would
not have a soldier break his word."</p>

<p>The etiquettes and ceremonials were long and elaborate, as
were the letters and dispatches that came by the various
personages concerned in this important affair.</p>

<p>The only factors in the case that were taken no notice of were
the sentiments of the young bride and bridegroom. The Dauphin
bitterly resented this second marriage so soon after the death of
his little Spanish wife, and Pepa herself, so young for marriage
and of a disposition gentle and soon to prove itself noble, was a
mere puppet in the hands of her ambitious, excited mother and her
busy ladies.</p>

<p>M. de Richelieu wrote a letter full of graceful compliments
about the magnificence of his reception in Dresden to Maurice,
and to Louis XV another, in which he expressed his great
satisfaction with the Princess Josepha, whose only fault was that
she did not yet know how to speak French perfectly. As to her
person the celebrated rake said, "she would have been noted if
she had been of humble birth; for a Princess she might be
considered a great beauty."</p>

<p>The Princess who was to enter what her uncle termed "the new
Babylon" had been described by another Frenchman, the Comte de
Vaulgrenant, as "not beautiful, but she might be termed pretty
and she pleases everyone; her air is sweet, her carriage noble,
she walks gracefully, she is blonde, with large blue eyes."</p>

<p>M. de Richelieu was considered very attractive himself and
fulfilled his elegant mission with so much magnificence, courtesy
and grace that he won the applause of everyone at the indolent
and sumptuous court of Dresden; in particular the King and Queen
were delighted to see in the flesh a superb example of one of
those French aristocrats that they had always been endeavouring
to imitate.</p>

<p>The French grandee, like Maurice himself, was not above the
smallest details appertaining to his mission; to the Countess de
Martinez, the governess of Maria Josepha, he sent a paper of
questions as to the little Princess's habits and tastes; and this
the Saxon lady scrupulously filled up.</p>

<p>From it we learn that Maria Josepha's ordinary drink was
"fresh water from the fountain," but that she sometimes took a
little beer or Moselle wine that she did not like chocolate, that
she favoured green tea, coffee with milk, but did not care for
soup. She was not dainty in her appetite but preferred light
fare. For her clothes she liked dark colours, for her bed a
quilted down coverlet. The governess added with satisfaction that
the Princess read "all kinds of pious and historical books, that
she enjoyed seeing comedies and that she played the clavecin. She
was not subject to colds and had had small pox, chicken pox and
measles."</p>

<p>While Richelieu was being entertained with all the resources
of the court of Dresden, including the spectacle of the famous
Torch Dance, of which Louis XV asked for a particular description
from his plenipotentiary, the Queen, the bride's mother, was
writing anxiously to Maurice about the details of her daughter's
trousseau, and also about the various points of etiquette and the
establishment that Maria Josepha might hope for as Dauphine of
France. Maurice answered with great gravity and in much
detail.</p>

<p>He had always taken a great interest in clothes and was as
close an observer of the set of a lady's corsage as of the number
of a soldier's buttons. He answered at great length in his neat
handwriting and bad spelling, expressing himself first "as
overwhelmed with joy at the conclusion of this great affair." As
for the trousseau he had taken care, he told Her Majesty, to
inform himself "very carefully on this serious matter."</p>

<p>He began with some comments on the toilette of the late
Dauphine. Her gowns were, Maurice declared, too heavy and she had
had too many of them, worn them but once and then cast them
aside. She had also been her own Mistress of the Robes, but this
post belonged by right to Madame la Duchesse de Lauraguais, who
had the right to purchase all sets of jewellery, linen, lace, and
so on, and send the accounts for them in to the Treasury.</p>

<p>This important lady had also the charge of engaging all the
chamberwomen and other domestics and also the lackeys of Madame
la Dauphine. The Mistress of the Robes ordered the equipages, the
carriages, the horses and equally sent in her accounts for these.
As for jewels, a large quantity of diamonds and other precious
stones would be at the service of Pepa; they would not, however,
be entirely at her disposal as they were Crown jewels, but she
would be able to purchase many others according to her own taste.
"But time is so short it would be impossible for Your Majesty,"
added Maurice, "to secure for the Princess as magnificent a
trousseau as you would wish."</p>

<p>Then, descending into the most minute details, the gallant
soldier suggested that the Princess should have "several lengths
of fine Holland or lawn, piped with satin or gold stripes in the
Indian or Persian style, because there is very little in France
and it is forbidden to import it."</p>

<p>Fine examples of this lawn, he added, could be bought from the
Armenian merchants at Warsaw; he had, also, written to another
merchant, M. de Brosse, at The Hague, to send the best that he
had in this line of goods to Dresden.</p>

<p>It was difficult, the Marshal continued, to find handsome furs
in Paris, so he suggested that the Princess should bring with her
a large double cape in zibeline, or marten, such as the Russians
wore. Besides being very warm, he remarked, they looked very
handsome, especially when worn with a muff of the same
material.</p>

<p>The whalebone supports used for the crinolines or hooped
skirts and corsets, were not made anywhere, Maurice declared, so
well as in Dresden. The Princess therefore should bring with her
a good supply of these articles very carefully cut so that they
could be copied in Paris. It was very necessary, he observed, to
see that the corsets were not made too long in the waist. This
was a fault to which the Parisian cutters were very liable and it
gave, Maurice thought, the ladies an awkward look to have long
waists and short skirts; besides it was not at all to the taste
of the King, who would appreciate seeing the little Princess with
a short waist and her hooped skirts touching the ground.</p>

<p>"No doubt," Maurice added after this explanation, "I express
myself in a way that is very ridiculous to Your Majesty, but I
hope you will excuse me, for you know my good will."</p>

<p>As to the jewels that the Princess should have, besides the
crown jewels, Maurice gave Her Majesty a hint that this should be
arranged with the French Ambassador in Dresden, and that a
certain allowance should be made for them in the marriage
contract. The same should be done with the robes, the dresses, in
fact all the articles of the trousseau.</p>

<p>He also thought it well to send all the little Princess's
clothes in advance, so that they might be kept for her in Paris
and not fall into the hands of her ladies.</p>

<p>Maurice had also gone into other details about the
establishment of his niece, the appointment of her confessor, her
ladies of honour, her steward, her coachman, even down to her
cook and her kitchen-maids.</p>

<p>The journey from Dresden to Paris, undertaken in the depths of
winter, was no light enterprise. So numerous was the train of the
young Princess that it took two hundred and forty-eight post
horses to transport them. These had to be changed at each relay
station.</p>

<p>Leaving Dresden on January 14, 1749, Maria Josepha went by
Leipzig, Eisenach, and Freiburg to Frankfort, where she arrived
on the twenty-third of the month to the sound of cannon and
trumpets. These honours were given her by the order of the
Emperor Francis, though Austria was at war with France; Maria
Josepha was received with much pomp and presented with a massive
silver toilet service.</p>

<p>From the Imperial city she passed by Darmstadt, through
Durlach to Baden. By the end of the month she had reached the
frontier; the cumbersome procession had taken a fortnight to
travel from Dresden to Strassburg. There she was met by her
French household and by M. Loss, the Saxon envoy in Paris, who
had done so much to forward the marriage of his master's daughter
to the heir of the crown of France.</p>

<p>Here the Duchesse de Brancas, lady of honour to the new
Dauphine, presented the portrait of the Dauphin to his wife, as
the girl now was, for she had been married to him by proxy in
Dresden.</p>

<p>After these long ceremonies had been gone through and the
Princess and her train had taken some repose at Strassburg, the
journey was recommenced. When she had passed into the hands of
her French household, Pepa had put aside her Polish costume and
taken on the fashionable attire of France. M. Loss found that
rouge, powder, hoops and a piled up coiffure improved the charms
of the young Saxon.</p>

<p>At Nangis Maurice had joined his niece and here also occurred
a painful incident. A letter was brought by a courier from
Versailles to Madame de Brancas; she recognised the handwriting
of the Dauphin and offered it at once, with unfortunate courtesy,
to Maria Josepha; when the girl opened the letter, hoping for
some, at least, formal expression of affection and welcome, she
found that the childish handwriting expressed nothing but regret
and reproaches. The Dauphin had made a last protest to Madame de
Brancas against his second marriage, declaring that nothing would
make him forget his first wife. Maria Josepha was overcome by
this unhappy mistake. She left the supper table hastily and
shutting herself in her chamber, wept.</p>

<p>The Dauphine played her part well, however, when, on the next
day, she met, between Nangis and Corbeil, the King, her father-
in-law, and the husband whom she had not seen till then. She was
gay, simple and natural, as onlookers noted, and Louis XV deigned
to be charmed. As for the Dauphin, he stood sullen, silent,
awkward, staring before him, while the little bride rallied him
gently on his gloom.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the new Dauphine was presented to the Queen
and her daughters, Madame Henriette and Madame Adelaide&mdash;the
first 19 years of age the second a child aged 14 years.</p>

<p>More ceremonies, more entertainments and receptions, and at
last, on February 9, the arrival at Versailles.</p>

<p>On the eleventh of that month she was married with all the
exhausting pomp and elaborate ceremonial that the most
magnificent court in the world could offer.</p>

<p>There was a ball the night before; after the ceremony there
was a banquet, after the banquet the bride had to submit to a
public toilette, and last there was the <i>mise au lit,</i> which
M. de Saxe, a man of no delicacy of taste, himself termed
"terrible."</p>

<p>The day after the wedding, Maurice wrote to his brother, the
King of Poland, an account of the triumph of the House of Saxony
that he himself had done so much to bring about. The letter is
couched in bombastic and fulsomely flattering terms, but behind
these one can see a picture, charming and pathetic, of the girl
bride and the boy bridegroom&mdash;whose fatigues, whose
emotions, whose likes and dislikes no-one was taking into much
account.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"This Princess," wrote Maurice from Versailles
on February 12, 1747, "is adored by everybody. The Queen loves
her as if she was her own daughter; the King is enchanted with
her and M. le Dauphin loves her with passion. She conducts
herself in all this with every imaginable address; I don't know
how to admire her sufficiently. There are not many children of
fifteen years of whom one could say that. In truth, she has
astonished me. Your Majesty would not be able to believe with
what nobility, with what presence of mind and wit Madame la
Dauphine has conducted herself. M. le Dauphin appears a schoolboy
beside her. No feebleness, no childishness has appeared in any of
her actions, but a noble firmness, and tranquillity has
accompanied everything she does, and certainly she has had to go
through moments where one wants all the assurance of a person
born to play these difficult parts with dignity. Among others
there is that of the final nuptial ceremony, when the curtains
are opened, showing the bride and bridegroom in bed. This is
terrible, for all the court is in the room and the King told me
to reassure Madame la Dauphine and to remain near her.<br> <br>
"She went through it with a tranquillity that astonished me. M.
le Dauphin put the coverlet over his face, but the Princess did
not cease talking with a grave charm indeed, and paid no more
attention to the courtiers crowding about her than if there had
been no one in the room.<br> <br> "I said, in approaching her,
that the King had ordered me to stay near her in order to keep
her in countenance and that the whole ceremony would not last
more than a moment. She told me that this would please her, and
that I was not to leave her and only to bid her good night when
her women had closed the curtains and the crowd had gone out.<br>
<br> "Everyone left with a kind of sadness, for this seemed to
have the air of a sacrifice, and somehow she had managed to
interest everyone in herself. Your Majesty will laugh, perhaps,
when I tell you that the blessing of the bed, the priests, the
candles, this brilliant pomp, the beauty, the youth of this
Princess and above all, the desire that everyone felt that she
should be happy, all these things together seemed to inspire more
thoughtfulness than laughter. There were in the bedchamber all
the Princes and Princesses who compose this Court, the King, the
Queen, more than a hundred women covered with diamonds and
brilliantly dressed. It was a unique scene and, I repeat, had the
air of nothing so much as a sacrifice."</p>
<br>

<p>In a postscript Maurice thanked his brother for the
Generalship he had given him in the Saxon army, and remarked on
the great endurance his niece had shown and the heavy fatigues
she had had to support.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"I told the King that if she did not have some
rest she would become ill. Indeed, I don't know how she has been
able to hold out. During all the festivals there was a great heat
in all the apartments, enough to make one die because of the
pressure of the huge crowds and the number of candles burning.
More than that, her robes were of such a weight that I don't know
how she could carry them. Besides, there is nothing more
fatiguing than the endless presentations. She had to remember all
the names and give a smile and a little attention to everyone.
This was so considerable a fatigue that I don't know how she
could do it.<br> <br> "The other day the King asked me to take up
her skirt that was on a sofa, while she was at her toilet. It
weighed quite sixty pounds; there are none of our cuirasses that
weigh as much as that. I don't know how she was able for eight or
nine hours to stand on her feet with the enormous weight."</p>
<br>

<p>There was an even sadder side to these gorgeous ceremonies
than Maurice knew of, or at least, than he mentioned. There had
not been time, through some strange carelessness, for a new
bedchamber to be decorated and furnished for the Saxon bride, and
it was in the apartment where his wife had died, in the very bed
where she had lain in state not long before, that the couple, so
little more than children, had to commence their married
life.</p>

<p>Sometime afterwards Maria Josepha confessed to her mother that
when the curtains of brocade were finally drawn and they found
themselves at last alone, bride and bridegroom fell on each
other's necks in a passion of miserable tears.</p>

<p>For a while Maria Josepha's life was wretched, her husband
avoiding her as often as he could and as far as possible only saw
her in the presence of his sister, Madame Henriette. It was in
the tender, disinterested and lovely friendship of this other
girl that the stranger Princess found some happiness. It is one
of the most delicate things ever recorded of Maurice that in the
midst of all his splendours and satisfaction he had the
sensibility to commiserate the two weeping children, whose
splendid marriage was such a tedious pageant of glittering
formality, and that he had felt a touch of pity when lifting the
ceremonial dresses, massive with bullion; it is not to be
supposed, however, that he regretted "the sacrifice" as he termed
it, for he was still successful in a war further protracted by
the death of Philip V and was honoured with the unheard-of
privilege of a grant of six cannon for his own use at Chambord,
as well as his patent of <i>Maréchal General.</i></p>

<p>The Dauphin, crying for his ugly little Spaniard, and the
Dauphine, a frightened and lonely girl crying for
home&mdash;overwhelmed, both of them, by their destiny&mdash;were
the parents of the last three Kings of France&mdash;Louis XVI,
Louis XVIII and Charles X. The State marriage became one of
affection and the niece of Maurice led a retired and simple life
amid the scandalous frivolities of the court and gave to France
twelve children. Seven of these shared the usual fate of royal
infants of that period and died in the cradle.</p>

<p>Of the five surviving, three were Kings of France, one was
Queen of Sardinia and one was the gentle and tragic Madame
Elisabeth, one of the most innocent and pathetic victims of the
furies of the Revolution of 1789.</p>

<p>The first incident that brought the young couple together was
the death of Madame, the Dauphin's child by his lost wife, a
frail baby, who did not survive a year; Pepa had a good influence
on her young husband; both of them were serious-minded and liked
home life, and under her sweet encouragement the young man began
to develop qualities that might have been useful to him as King
of France; they lived happily surrounded by their children. Their
great diversion was music and the Prince became proficient on the
violoncello and enjoyed singing in his fine bass voice. But
perhaps, content though she was with her husband, the greatest
joy of Maria Josepha's life was her friendship with her sister-
in-law, Henriette.</p>

<p>On the death of this girl, suddenly, in the winter of 1752,
Maria Josepha wrote the following touching letter to her mother,
whom she was never to see again:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"I am very sorry, my dear Mamma, not to have
written to you last Saturday, but the cruel situation in which I
am did not allow it. Besides the extreme grief in which I am
plunged by the loss of Madame, I am obliged to hide at least part
of it not to add to that of M. le Dauphin. No, my dear Mother,
nothing can be compared to the misery that I feel at this moment.
I loved my sister very tenderly, I was bound to her with a very
close friendship, yes, and from the first instant we saw one
another.<br> <br> "Besides, I owe the happiness of my life to
her, for the friendship and affection that M. le Dauphin has for
me I owe to her care only. I won't conceal from you that when I
first arrived here he held me in the greatest aversion; he had
been turned against me, besides, he was very much distressed and
vexed to see me occupying the place of a woman whom he tenderly
loved. He regarded me, too, as a mere child. All this meant that
there was a separation between us and gave me mortal displeasure.
I was even forced, by my blind obedience to the least of his
wishes, to conceal from him the desires I had to please him. I
did not have many moments of the day in which I could speak to
him or prove to him how I wished to serve him, for he would not
remain a moment alone with me. He always made his sisters come,
then took Adelaide away with him and left me with Madame.<br>
<br> "She saw the sadness that his conduct caused me, although
she did not appear to do so, and she advised me what I had better
do. And besides, when I wasn't there, she talked to M. le
Dauphin, impressed on him my unhappiness and my despair at not
being able to see him. At last she succeeded so well that he took
a little pity on me and treated me a little better.<br> <br>
"When she had gained this point she continued her tender cares,
so much so that at the end M. le Dauphin fell into some affection
for me. And this affection Madame Henriette to the end of her
days always cultivated and augmented.<br> <br> "You can see, my
dear Mamma, what this loss will mean to me. And meanwhile I am
not permitted to give way to my grief. I daren't even think of
that of the King, who is not in a state to give any orders at
all. It is I, therefore, unhappy creature, that am in charge of
everything, haft even been obliged to order everything for the
transport of the coffin, for the mourning and for all these sad
ceremonies. You know the tenderness and sensibility of my heart
and you can judge to what state it is reduced.<br> <br> "They
have been obliged to bleed me a little, for after the death of my
sister I had the most frightful pains in the head. However, since
Wednesday, when I was bled, they have passed.<br> <br> "I beg you
once more to pray for her, to pray to the good God for the repose
of her soul, though I hope there is no great need of that,
considering the manner in which she died was very consoling."</p>
<br>

<p>This forgotten Princess was a gentle, pathetic figure in that
glittering and cynic court.</p>

<p>Though he used her as a means for his own advancement and for
the glory of his House, Maurice appears to have had a sincere
affection for her, an affection in which perhaps a certain
wistfulness was mingled, for she too was a stranger and despised
as such at the arrogant court of France where, for all his
honours and glories and his friendship with the King the son of
Aurora von Königsmarck was never allowed to feel altogether at
his ease. Yet the man who could feel compassion for Pepa was the
man who could ruthlessly pursue and brutally overcome Justine
Favart. Had not this also, "the air of nothing so much as a
sacrifice"?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3.2" id="ch3.2"></a>II. THE MONSTROUS PALACE</h2>

<p class="first">IN July 1747, Maurice de Saxe gained his last
battle, that of Laufeldt; this was the name of the village near
Maestricht that was occupied by Cumberland with the dragoons, the
Greys and the Innis-killings and some infantry. In the struggle
for the position that Maurice finally took, the British lost a
quarter of their number; the infantry withdrew without confusion
owing to the gallantry of the cavalry that covered their
retreat.</p>

<p>This fight was the result of the efforts of the French to
carry the war into the Netherlands, where the Allies had striven
to animate the disgusted and hesitating Republicans by forcing on
them a Stadtholder, William III of Orange, who was married to the
King of Great Britain's daughter, Mary.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of the year Maurice had marched on Dutch
Flanders and taken Holst and Ostl and this battle outside
Maestricht was termed "the third great victory over the Allies."
The Allies and the French sustained equal losses at Laufeldt, but
the result of it was the capture of that much-besieged city,
Bergen-op-Zoom, by M. de Lowendal under the orders of Maurice on
September 17, 1747, which concluded the campaign and practically
the war; Maurice was named Commandant-General of the Low
Countries by Louis XV, who had himself been present at Laufeldt;
he now enjoyed as many honours and as much power as had ever been
possessed by Eugene; but he was still dreaming of a crown.</p>

<p>His enemies at the court of France increased, and the
behaviour of Maurice gave good grounds for these strictures. His
character, always brutal, had become even more coarse and violent
with age and the agonies of his own suffering; in this last
campaign he countenanced atrocities.</p>

<p>Bergen-op-Zoom was punished for a heroic resistance by being
given over to pillage; Lowendal's grenadiers raped, stole and
slew with the approval of their generals; France was shocked and
felt disgraced by this behaviour on the part of the two
foreigners&mdash;so different from their own chivalry after
Fontenoy.</p>

<p>"Cartouche," wrote the Marquis d'Argenson, naming the most
notorious bandit of the time, "could not have behaved worse."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1748 Maurice was at Brussels; he opened the
campaign by besieging Maestricht, garrisoned by twenty-seven
thousand Austrians; he had hardly opened the trenches before
Cumberland asked for an armistice.</p>

<p>This was granted and the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle opened in
May.</p>

<p>The conquests of Maurice had left France in a strong position;
she was able to dictate terms; but Louis XV did not wish "to
bargain like a tradesman," and wanted "the thing over
quickly."</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that this King passes out of history
with this peace, so humiliating to France, the miserable result
of a long, costly, purposeless war&mdash;"stupid as the peace"
became a common saying among the people, now completely disgusted
with King and Government.</p>

<p>The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle on October 18, 1748, which
boasted a preamble very elegant and profuse, restored all the
conquests of Maurice and was as stupid from the French angle as
the war it closed&mdash;if indeed it did close the war; by some
it was regarded as a mere truce, and, ignored by politicians at
home, the struggle continued in India.</p>

<p>Bitter and furious were the protests of M. de Saxe at seeing
his triumphs thus reduced to such futilities, his victories to
vanities, all his exertions, fatigues, his success to
nothing.</p>

<p>Not only did the Peace leave him without an occupation but
with the stinging sense of a barren labour of eight years behind
him. Very hollow indeed must have sounded in his mind the shouts
of "Demain, bataille!" the Te Deums of Paris and Brussels, the
applause of the Opera, the praise of the King, the flatteries of
Madame Pompadour, and the "Hurrahs!" of his own conquering
army.</p>

<p>No one indeed, had gained much from the Peace of Aix-la-
Chapelle save the one person who deserved, perhaps, to do
so&mdash;the wily, bold and unscrupulous King of Prussia, who had
dared calmly to take and keep his own vantage mid the surging
broil.</p>

<p>Frederick, as Maurice grimly remarked, was allowed to take
Silesia, while all his own conquests were ceded.</p>

<p>All his own high-sounding honours, were they not a little
empty, a little smacking of the Duchy of Courland adventure? The
right of entry to royal palaces, this permission of a stool in
the royal presence, a coach in the royal yard, these royal
embraces, these six pieces of cannon, these laurel wreaths from
imitation goddesses, what were they to a man who aspired to
royalty himself? Even the magnificent title of Maréchal General
de France did not satisfy one who hoped to be a ruling Prince.
Maurice had dreamt to the last of the Austrian Netherlands and it
was said that Louis would have been willing to grant him this but
dare not so far affront the spirit of the Princes of the blood
and nobility, and now that hope was lost with the rest.</p>

<p>Maurice, then, after all these gaudy flourishes and theatrical
rewards, was left with his pension; Chambord, and the
Governorship of Alsace.</p>

<p>He had visited Chambord before and finding it in considerable
disrepair had purchased a more modest and more comfortable
residence at Piples, but the grandiose domain on the flat
vineyards of the Sologne, where the vast château of Francis I
rose in majestic solitude, with a huge park full of wild boar and
game, now appealed to Maurice as a fitting place in which to
escape the persecution of the courtiers and live in independence,
as much after his own taste as was possible.</p>

<p>Chambord was the nearest approach to a kingdom that the victor
of Fontenoy, Raucoux, and Laufeldt could obtain. The superb
château was neglected, lonely, and uncomfortable, as Stanislas
Leczinski to his cost had found, but Maurice received permission
from the King to improve the place at the royal expense and
promptly proceeded to turn the fortified castle of the Middle
Ages and the pleasant palace of the Renaissance that Chambord was
into the gaunt barracks and pompous mansion combined that was the
eighteenth-century idea of a royal residence.</p>

<p>There was something in the regal size of the place, the vast
squat towers, the huge parade ground, the soaring pinnacles and
massive gargoyles, the great staircases and multitude of heavy
chambers, that pleased the extravagant taste of Maurice de Saxe;
if he could not have a kingdom, at least he had a king's palace,
if not an army, at least a regiment and a barracks.</p>

<p>"A fig for your infernal politics!" the disappointed soldier
flung at Maurepas and retired to Chambord with his captured
flags, his cannon and his troop of Uhlans; he suffered more
acutely every day from dropsy and a confusion of minor ailments,
but his bold spirit was as vigorous as ever and he threw himself
into his new life with as much spirit as that with which he had
ever conducted a campaign in Flanders, or stormed the walls of
Lille and Belgrade.</p>

<p>The flag with the arms of Courland and Saxony floated on the
lantern above the fleur de lis carved on the facade of Chambord;
when the architects had multilated such of the Gothic beauties of
the ancient château as Louis XIV had left, Maurice was in
possession of a very pompous, comfortable palace, extensive
barracks and an elegant theatre, all most lavishly appointed and
furnished; only a personality like that of Maurice could have
adequately filled the vastness of Chambord, but he did fill it,
and admirably, living in a high-handed state of fantastic
magnificence; it was still <i>en avant! tambour battant!</i> with
the Maréchal Général de Saxe; he had made, the story goes, his
first formal entry into Chambord by driving in a coach and six up
the great <i>escalier d'honneur</i> to his apartments, and during
all his residence at Chambord kept up the same scale of grandeur;
sixteen colours taken in battle in the vestibule, six captured
cannon in the court, fifty men on guard at the entrance, a
sentinel at the door of the bedchamber of Maurice, everywhere
girandoles of crystal, hangings of Utrecht velvet, garlands of
gilt blooms, mirrors with bronze clamps, porcelain from Sevres
and Missein, pastels in pale tints, statuettes of Loves and
Graces in delicate alabaster, airy wreaths, ribbons,
Cupidons.</p>

<p>Maurice liked this <i>mise en scène</i> and for a while
completely enjoyed himself; there were great hunts and shooting
parties in the huge park, there were voluptuous performances in
the baroque theatre, where madame Favart, ravished from her
husband, queened it sadly and briefly over a troop of lesser
light beauties, and where there was a discreet <i>grille</i> for
the Bishop of Blois, and there was, above everything, the
regiment of Uhlans, which became the main occupation and the main
pride of Maurice de Saxe.</p>

<p>Though supported by the King, this strange troop was entirely
subordinate to Maurice, who subjected his soldiers to a severe
discipline and did not hesitate to hang them for severe faults;
for all this they remained in his service willingly enough; the
quiet people of Touraine were startled by this sudden influx of
foreign and brutal soldiery, who had nothing to do but wheel in
evolutions on the parade ground before Chambord, mount guard over
the trophies of Fontenoy and Raucoux, and escort Maurice de Saxe
when he pompously rode abroad, who feared neither God nor Devil,
but only the redoubtable <i>Maréchal Général.</i></p>

<p>These "Saxon Volunteers," as Maurice called them, consisted of
a thousand men, Hungarians, Turks, Poles, Germans and Tartars,
officered by French and men of their own nationality; there was
also a "Colonial Brigade" formed of negroes from the Congo,
Cayenne, Guinea and Pondicherry, commanded by the son of an
African King, who, mounted on white horses and clothed with
Eastern flamboyancy, made an arresting spectacle on the lonely
plains of Sologne; a bevy of negresses accompanied these black
warriors and added to the picturesqueness of the exotic garrison,
which gathered together every week to hear Mass in the chapel of
the château; Maurice had had the dignity to remain a Lutheran;
but these soldiers, though half of them were heathen, had to keep
up the appearance of being good Catholics being nominally in the
service of the Most Christian King.</p>

<p>Maurice had reviewed these troops before Louis in Paris, in
the Champs-Elysées, previous to his departure for Chambord, and
had achieved a considerable <i>succès de curiosité</i> when, in
full-dress Uhlan uniform, he had made his brilliant and fantastic
troops perform their skilful manoeuvres.</p>

<p>At Chambord he drilled them every day and the lordly terraces
resounded to the clatter of arms, the clangour of trumpets and
the shouts of command; Maurice dined alone, in public, before his
court of officers and friends, who only sat down to their covers
when he had finished; two tables, one for eighty, one for sixty
were usually served in Chambord.</p>

<p>Eight hundred horses were in the stables and wild steeds from
the Ukraine galloped in the immense park, and when one of the
sumptuous performances was given in the theatre in the donjon,
Maurice sat alone in a box opposite the stage, as the King sat at
Versailles when he also took his idle pleasure.</p>

<p>But this opulent life of enjoyment began to pall; dullness
stole even over the concerts on the water, the slaughter of the
boar, the stag hunts, the vaudevilles, the reviews of Uhlans, the
caresses of easy light ladies, the gallopades in the park, the
dinners with one cover, even the sight of the captured flags and
the captured cannon lost its first flavour, the visits to Paris
and Dresden palled; Maurice began to boast a great deal of his
famous campaigns and to look at the map of Europe.</p>

<p>Not even the thousand distractions of Chambord could satisfy
his bold and restless spirit; the memory of Courland rankled and
he still dreamt of exchanging his marshal's baton for a royal
crown.</p>

<p>He cast his bold glance at all the corners of Europe in vain;
even the adventuring spirit of the Königsmarck could see no hope
there, every inch was occupied; Maurice began to think beyond
Europe.</p>

<p>He demanded the island of Madagascar from Louis, declaring
that he would colonise it with German paupers, but he wanted too
many ships and too much money and the request was refused;
Maurice then asked for Tobago, but also in vain.</p>

<p>"Vast projects and chimerical enterprises," as one of his
visitors, the Marquis de Valfons, says, then occupied the
restless mind of Maurice de Saxe; with every day Chambord staled
the more, and the rancour of the Prince de Conti, had followed
him to Touraine and was irritating him through his neighbour, M.
de Caumery.</p>

<p>He thought of establishing a Jewish kingdom in America and of
conquering Corsica (as France did conquer Corsica, twenty years
later) but Versailles had no money, no energy, no enterprise, and
Maurice was left to languish with his useless splendours at
Chambord.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1750, Mlle de Sens with a <i>trôlée</i> of
court ladies had come to visit the Maréchal de Saxe, and there
had been considerable gaieties, balls, hunts, comedies; Maurice
was full of spirit and vigour despite his chronic ailments and
wrote a lively account of the entertainments to the King, his
brother, ending his letter with: "A tout péché miséricorde!"</p>

<p>It was a long way from the room in Goslar, where Aurora von
Königsmarck had given birth to this child of a casual, if
princely, intrigue; but Maurice, looking back over the half
century found that the time had passed quickly&mdash;like a
flash, the struggles, the victories, the honours, the women,
hardly to be distinguished now, so rapidly had they gone, like
bright bubbles dissolving, the intrigues, the luxuries.</p>

<p>What was there that he had not had? How many thousands of
pounds had passed through his hands, what heaps of gold he had
lost on gambling tables, paid out to panders, harlots, lackeys,
what piles of diamonds, pearls and patiently worked jewels had
been scattered on his dressing tables or flung to his flatterers!
Not even the King had had finer mares in his stables, richer
silks and velvets on his back, more easy money in his pocket, not
even M. de Richelieu, superb Don Juan of the last flower of the
French aristocracy, had been more successful with women.</p>

<p>He had gathered as many laurels, trophies, stars, honours,
glories as any of the heroes whom he had set out to emulate; he
had been able to put into practice some of his own most cherished
<i>Rêveries</i> and to see them successful; there was no lust
that he had not gratified; he had taken cities and sacked cities,
he had seen massacres, pillagings, countries broken and ruined by
war, he had had power of life and death over thousands.</p>

<p>He had even enjoyed the delicate fidelity of an Adrienne de
Lecouvreur and been able to force the delicate loathing of a
Justine Favart; he had met Kings and Queens on equal terms, his
niece was on the step of the throne of France, he had woo'd and
won the niece of Peter the Great, and twice missed the throne of
all the Russias by a mere chance.</p>

<p>Maurice looked back on all this glitter of gold, lust, blood,
greed, luxury without remorse or a qualm of self-disgust. No
gleam of tenderness, of regret, no softening of doubt or wonder,
brightened the last days of Chambord.</p>

<p>His callousness, his selfishness, remained unmoved; the
bitterness of boredom that was clouding over him was because he
was inactive, because he had missed a crown, because his body was
no longer able to afford him pleasure.</p>

<p>Chambord was not Paris, it was not a kingdom, and he was not a
king, though he had contrived to have a sentry at his door by
writing <i>barracks</i> over the door to his suite of
apartments.</p>

<p>It was mid-winter and the country beyond Chambord was dull
under the gloomy skies; the magnificent castle was set down like
a crown on a table on this marshy plain, and in the winter even
the park, one of the largest in Europe, with a wall of prodigious
circumference, was gloomy; the long avenues were bare of leaves,
and stripped and gaunt the ancient elms, from which Maurice
hanged his disobedient Uhlans; the white donjons, towers and
pinnacles, above which hung the standard with the arms of Saxony,
were coldly reflected in the sluggish waters of the river.</p>

<p>The monstrous palace soon became melancholy, ever overhung
with an intolerable gloom; it was too large, too pompous, even
Maurice de Saxe and his Uhlans could not fill it; the majesty of
his residence sometimes oppressed even his vanity and this winter
he was more than usually infirm.</p>

<p>The "<i>trôlée"</i> of women had gone and he had laughed to
see them go; it was as much as any woman's reputation was worth
to visit Maurice and his full-fed idle officers at Chambord, but
they came just the same, and their host declared that in
providing each of them with a fine Uhlan he had sent them away
well satisfied.</p>

<p>He had sent away Justine Favart, too; he was tired of her, he
was tired of the woman who had borne the child who was to provide
him with an illustrious descendant, Madame George Sand; he was
tired of all the marvels and splendours of Chambord, even of the
curious <i>escalier d'honneur,</i> which gave his palace its
unique glory; his senses were beginning to fail; he could hardly
stand, feet and hands were crippled, his sight was dim, the
festering wound in his leg gnawed him, no unguents could heal the
sores that covered him, his broad purple face was a caricature of
the comely countenance that had so nearly won him an Imperial
crown; only the beetling eyebrows remained to give an air of
ferocity to an expression that remained on the whole good-
humoured.</p>

<p>He was not tormented with self-disgust or satiety; he would
have echoes of glories that were past, if he could have nothing
more; "the old wagoner likes the clack of the wagon-wheels," he
wrote to his mother, referring to the military pomp with which he
surrounded himself, and the old libertine liked to turn over the
taste of vices it was no longer possible to indulge, but that, to
the very last resource of his strength, he had indulged, snapping
his fingers at physicians and friends alike.</p>

<p>Propped up in his vast gilt bed, with the brocade curtains, he
would summon the most debauched of his old soldiers, the most
servile of his lackeys, and bid them tell obscene tales, one
against the other; when his guffaws of appreciation at indecent
words and gestures passed into the convulsive grins of his
disordered sleep, the hangers-on crept away, wondering how long
they would hold their places.</p>

<p>For Maurice de Saxe was plainly dying in this winter of 1750,
in the monstrous castle in the midst of the vast park where boar,
deer and hares roamed the bare thickets and the scanty grass,
where the six cannon captured at Raucoux guarded the entrance,
where the standard of Saxony hung limp in the damp air.</p>

<p>The ferocious looking negroes and Tartars with their bizarre
accoutrements, idled in the barracks and stables, in the princely
kitchens; the famous <i>chef,</i> Rotisset and his charming
daughter, who had been one of the many fancies of Maurice, waited
among their huge array of pots and pans awaiting the orders for
another banquet.</p>

<p>The luxurious apartments were silent, the curtain with its
motto <i>Ludum in Armis</i> hung across the empty stage in the
large theatre, where there was a throne for Maurice under a dais,
with a Persian carpet.</p>

<p>They had all gone; there was no one there left to share or
soothe the nightmares, fantastic, grotesque, that clouded his
sick sleep; no one but paid flatterers and panders, and his
soldiers who feared him more than they loved him.</p>

<p>Rosetta, the little lace-maker was gone; when he had entered
Brussels as a victor, he had asked after her; Aurora von
Königsmarck's bones rested in the sandstone vaults of
Quedlinburg; Adrienne Lecouvreur's body had long since become
part of the waste grounds of Paris; Justine Favart had escaped at
last; all the other women were dead or old or had found other
lovers or repented of love in a convent. Madame Pompadour had
deigned to come to Chambord to taste Rotisset's invention, the
"<i>Brochet à la Chambord,</i>" to sit in the theatre and listen
to the witty shafts of the heartless comedy, to admire the
ostentatious display of arras, sculpture, pictures, bronzes,
miniatures that were displayed in the great galleries.</p>

<p>Maurice had no taste for or knowledge of these things, but
they were costly, envied, and kings had them.</p>

<p>Madame Pompadour had gone with her train; the diseased and
crippled soldier was of no more use to her; perhaps she disliked
to gaze at this warning of what the man through whom she ruled
France would one day look like; perhaps the elegant, fastidious
woman hoped that she would die before nature sent in her
account.</p>

<p>The King had, as the Marquis d'Argenson noted, "taken an
aversion to M. de Saxe."</p>

<p>And this was not only through the intrigues of M. de Conti and
the Princes of the blood; the brusque Saxon's manners, once so
flattering, had not been deferential enough to His Majesty in the
last campaign; he had even dared to contradict him at the council
of war.</p>

<p>When Maurice had petitioned the King for royal honours,
relying on that old Courland claim, and his relationship with the
Dauphine, they had not been granted.</p>

<p>So, despite a guard of fifty men at his gates, and the
sentinels before his apartments, and all the pomp and the power
of life and death over his men, Maurice had not achieved his
ambition...the itch for a crown tormented his mind as the fester
in his leg tormented his body; his disordered dreams became
fantastic, eccentric; he was not concerned with the thousands of
men whom he had seen brutally slain, with the sacked cities, the
burning villages, the ravaged fields, the blood, the treasure
wasted in a cause for which he felt nothing but indifference.
Wasted? No, those long wars had made him what he was; what did it
matter if half Europe had been ruined, as long as a king's
bastard with a turn for soldiering had his cannon, his savage
soldiers, his twenty five stallions, his park full of beasts to
drive into nets and slaughter?</p>

<p>The wars had been satisfactory from the point of view of
Maurice and his kind. But they had not provided him with a crown;
and the gross chimeras haunted him in the grey, heavy November
days.</p>

<p>They had all gone; even that last beauty, frail Mme de Blot,
who had queened it at Chambord so brilliantly, had already passed
to his heir, the Comte de Friesen and the hero was lonely in his
bed, where he would die "like an old woman" as Madame de
Pompadour had sneered.</p>

<p>He had caught a chill, he had a cough, putrid fever, a
seizure; the two physicians were in a quandary; the household,
the garrison, in despair; how many excellent places were likely
to be lost!</p>

<p>He was bled three times and felt some relief; he wished to
conceal his illness and a strange agitation shook him; during the
night of November 24, he became delirious and M. Senac was sent
for and, as he drew the curtains and looked down at Maurice, the
soldier for the first time showed fear.</p>

<p>"Who sent you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>M. Senac replied that it was M. de Friesen, but another name,
"Death," must have been in the minds of both for they knew that
the physician's visit was but a farce.</p>

<p>Courteous messages came from the great ones, who cared nothing
if he lived or died; Marshal Lowendal came to his bedside and
tried to convert him from his heresy; but Maurice refused him as
he had refused Cardinal Tencin, when His Eminence had begged him
to achieve one more victory&mdash;"that over Martin Luther."</p>

<p>Maurice had never made any pretence to be anything but an
atheist, but he clung to Lutheranism, as he clung to his diploma
of election to the Duchy of Courland.</p>

<p>And he was now fast falling into a lethargy from which no talk
of any God could rouse him; in his intervals of consciousness he
faced the complete annihilation that he believed awaited him with
the same unimaginative courage that, as a boy, he had viewed the
carnage of Malplaquet.</p>

<p>Senac reported that, before Maurice died, the morning of
November 30, 1750, he had whispered: "Life is but a dream, mine
has been fine&mdash;but short."</p>

<p>The sentiment is commonplace, the terms neat for a dying man,
but something of this kind Maurice may have stammered in that
last delirium, and there is nearly always someone ready not only
to note but to dramatise.</p>

<p>This is what is believed to be the true account of the death
of Maurice de Saxe. Another and more romantic version, however,
soon gained ground, became a persistent rumour, and is confirmed
by a passage in the <i>Mémoires</i> of the Baron Grimm, who
claimed to have been at Chambord at the time, and gives a
detailed account of the end of Maurice.</p>

<p>This is neither confirmed nor utterly refuted by other
authorities; the letters of the two doctors then at Chambord, M.
Roth and M. Lefort, prove that Maurice was ill in November, 1750,
and that he had fever, some kind of seizure, and was bled five
times in twenty-four hours (this in itself a sufficient cause for
a fatal collapse in a man "<i>accablé d'infirmités,"</i> as
Madame de Pompadour wrote of Maurice after his death), that he
desired his illness to be kept secret and showed his usual
independence by relying on his remedies, rye-broth and cider, and
that he died suddenly between six and seven in the morning of
November 30, 1750, in the bedchamber that can still be seen at
Chambord.</p>

<p>There is nothing in all this that renders absolutely
impossible the recital of Grimm and the tenacious local rumours.
According to these, Maurice de Saxe was roused one morning, at
eight o'clock, by a messenger who brought him a sealed envelope;
he hastily dressed, put his papers in order, said a few words to
the Comte de Friesen, his nephew and heir, and went out alone
into the vast park, then wrapped in the gloomy mists of
winter.</p>

<p>In one of the melancholy <i>allées,</i> now stripped of leaves
and fit resort for the ghostly chase led by Thibaut of Champagne,
which is said to sweep through these dreary glades, waited a
plain coach without arms, driven by a servant without livery or
cockade; a gentleman in travelling dress descended from this and
saluted Maurice with a bitter smile it was the Prince de Conti,
his implacable enemy.</p>

<p>In this lonely and dismal part of the park a duel took place;
Maurice de Saxe was mortally wounded, and M. de Conti drove back
to Paris satisfied with having removed for ever the man who had
been for so long the object of his arrogant but perhaps justified
rancour.</p>

<p>Maurice returned to the château, <i>commanded</i> secrecy, and
died of his wound after an illness of nine days.</p>

<p>If this is true, doctors, servants, M. de Friesen, officers,
secretaries, in short, a crowd of people, must have been employed
in deceiving the world; it is possible that they may have done
so; no one would have gained anything by revealing the truth and
it would have been a dangerous thing to breathe a scandal
involving the name of a Prince of the blood; the persistence of
the rumours round Chambord also seems to point to someone having
whispered something of the dark story; it is strange that such a
scandal should have been started without any foundation. Yet on
the face of it the tale was absurd; Maurice had been a dying man
since long before Fontenoy; the only wonder was that his splendid
physique should have so long resisted his own efforts and those
of his doctors to ruin it, and, if the accounts of his last years
can be credited, he would have been incapable of fighting a duel
in the winter of 1750.</p>

<p>Moreover, he would probably have refused to do so, especially
with a much younger man, a royal prince and under conditions of
secrecy. Maurice was shrewd and valued his favour at the court of
France; he was almost wholly dependent on Louis XV; what sort of
tale would he have told if M. de Conti had been killed? On the
other hand M. de Conti had nothing to fear from Maurice, who no
longer worried him or&mdash;save for the fact of his
existence&mdash;vexed him. Maurice had rarely left Chambord since
his retirement. Once he had gone to Prussia to talk of military
science with Frederick II, once he had gone to Versailles, but
the King had been cool and had not invited him to supper.</p>

<p>There was no apparent reason, therefore, for M. de Conti to
fasten a duel on this out-of-favour, dying man, old enough to be
his father.</p>

<p>If there was some deadly business between the two enemies
beyond their life-long jealousy, the gossip mongers do not give
it, and all that remains is surprise at the persistence of what
seems a grotesque rumour. One account gives Marshal Lowendal as
being at his bedside and the Comte de Friesen as in the château,
another says that no friends arrived at Chambord till after his
death, and that no one viewed the body till it was embalmed, thus
the wild rumours of a secret duel spread at once. Perhaps the
public imagination could not endure to think that this grandiose
and theatrical hero, with all his adventurous pomp and glittering
bravado, should die of a chill or a putrid fever like an ordinary
man.</p>

<p>Certainly the romantic, lonely duel in the haunted glades of
Chambord would have been more in keeping with the life of the son
of Augustus the Strong and the descendant of the dashing and
reckless Königsmarcks.</p>

<p>It was all of a piece with the mysterious tragedy of Philip
von Königsmarck, with the poisoned pastilles given to Adrienne de
Lecouvreur, with all the strange, obscure episodes of this
bizarre life. The Marquis d'Argenson notes the tale of a duel in
his memoirs, without mentioning the Prince de Conti and adds "it
is not true."</p>

<p>A farmer who lived in the park of Chambord claimed to have
been a hidden eye-witness of this strange duel; but he could
hardly have recognised M. de Conti, or have known, as he claimed
to know, that upon the Prince's return to Paris he told the King
what had happened and that His Majesty thereupon sent M. Senac to
Chambord.</p>

<p>However he died, he was dead on this last day of November,
1750. His Highness Maurice de Saxe, Maréchal Général de France,
was dead and on his <i>lit de parade;</i> he had died a Lutheran,
and, his servants said loyally, with a smile; there seemed
nothing more to say. His devoted physicians had achieved the
dangerous task of embalming the remains of the hero, often termed
godlike, who could not have seemed divine to them on this
occasion, but all too obviously human. There were probably good
reasons enough, without searching for a romantic mystery, why his
friends were not allowed to see the corpse before the men of
medicine had done their work.</p>

<p>The marble table that M. Senac and his assistants used on this
occasion was proudly preserved as a great curiosity, if not an
object of beauty, and has survived many more worthy and
interesting memorials of famous men.</p>

<p>The dream was over, but there were those willing to pay it
homage; the officers of the garrison went into mourning in memory
of Maurice de Saxe, the famous six cannon were fired by the
sorrowful Uhlans every quarter of an hour; across the desolate
park where the Ukraine horses roamed unheeded, across the
barracks where the motley garrison were tying crape on their
arms, across the theatre where the hangers on were packing up
their finery and their masks, sounded the sullen funeral salute
for this <i>roi manqué,</i> the man who had achieved so much, but
never his utmost desire.</p>

<p>This hero of barren victories, this conqueror without
territories, this landless prince and heirless gentleman, was
accorded a funeral that would have pleased his love of pomp, even
though it was in contradiction of the request contained in his
will (in imitation of St. Monica, as one biographer oddly
remarks, but surely rather in imitation of Adrienne de
Lecouvreur) that his body should be buried simply and in
quicklime&mdash;"that nothing may remain of me, but my memory
among my friends."</p>

<p>Certainly his life and his death were all of a piece; no
tenderness, no regrets, no mention of God, no hope of any
eternity showed in either his will, or in any word or action
recorded of his last moments. Besides his immense quantity of
furniture, pictures, jewels and other treasure, Maurice left, on
his own estimation, six hundred thousand <i>livres</i> in French
banks, twenty thousand <i>livres</i> in Saxony, that were in the
hands of a M. Muldener, together with the diamond "Prague," and
an estate worth ten thousand roubles in the Isle of Wormissiau,
in Livonia.</p>

<p>He had not, he declared in his will (dated 1748) any debts,
and he left a number of legacies to friends, his servants and
soldiers. He left the bulk of his fortunes, his precious stud of
horses, his famous diamond called "Prague" (given him for sparing
that city) and his regiment to his nephew, M. de Friesen, the son
of his half-sister, the Comtesse de Cossell; to him, too, was
left the MS. of <i>Mes Rêveries.</i></p>

<p>The King confirmed this testament, allowing M. de Friesen to
keep up the Uhlans and enjoy Chambord and the pensions; but in
five years the gay and ineffective young officer was dead, the
regiment was dispersed, the stud broken up, and Chambord
abandoned to neglect and decay; all the glories of His Highness
Maurice de Saxe had vanished like his dreams of Tobago and
Corsica, his visions of thrones and crowns in the Fortunate
Isles.</p>

<p>The ghostly huntsman galloped undisturbed through the
melancholy solitudes of the ruined park, and the vast chambers
and galleries of the great château that had for so brief a time
shone with the unsubstantial glories of Maurice were closed on
decay and gloom.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3.3" id="ch3.3"></a>III. FOR VALOUR</h2>

<p class="first">THE funeral of Maurice de Saxe was so much of a
piece with his life that to omit some account of it seems to be
to end his biography too soon.</p>

<p>A suggestion was made that he should sleep with Turenne in St.
Denis; but Maurice, unlike Turenne, had been firm to a hereditary
faith, and though, as the Queen remarked, "It is a pity that the
<i>De profundis</i> cannot be said for one who has so often
caused the <i>Te Deum</i> to be sung," it was decided that a
heretic could not repose in the church that was the mausoleum of
the most Christian kings. Nor could the brutal quicklime request
be granted. Louis XV, in a formal note to Augustus III,
acknowledged the "important services" rendered to France by
Maurice de Saxe, and it did not befit the dignity of a great
nation that these should go unrecognised. True, it might have
been argued that Fontenoy, Raucoux and Laufeldt had been well
paid for; but it was necessary to observe custom and M. de
Friesen, at least, had cause to be grateful to his uncle; while
the guard of honour still stood at attention in the funeral
chamber, he gave orders to the upholsterers and milliners, and
sat over plans of the elaborate convoy; heralds and painters set
to work, and yards of braid, velvet and cloth were ordered.</p>

<p>The gossips had their say; no one was very witty; Maurice was
of too simple a character to provoke any subtleties of comment
from the French.</p>

<p>There were the usual remarks about Mars and Venus:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"Il fut un autre Mars; mais it perdit un jour<br>
Pour avoir trop souvent combattu pour l'amour."</p>
<br>

<p>The court of France avoided all difficulties caused by the
obstinacy of M. de Saxe, with their usual grace; the Lutheran
Faith should receive her faithful son with a ceremony so costly
that a grateful nation would not be ashamed to foot the bill. By
January, after two months during which time Maurice's body had
lain on his <i>lit de parade,</i> everything was ready.</p>

<p>The Lutheran church of St. Thomas at Strassburg was then
decided upon, since Maurice had been governor of Alsace, and on
January 7 the convoy set out across the wintry plains of
Touraine; the huge funeral coach drawn by six horses draped in
black was escorted by a hundred Uhlans, with crape in their
casques and their arms reversed, and followed by two other
coaches occupied by the gentlemen of His Highness's Household,
one of whom, Baron Heldorff, <i>premier écuyer,</i> was in charge
of the heart of Maurice in a silver box reposing on a black
velvet cushion heavy with metallic fringe.</p>

<p>Following came the rest of the Uhlans, Swiss on foot, pages in
weepers, and the two nephews of Maurice, M. de Friesen and M. de
Löwenhaupt, in weepers and long mourning cloaks, drums beat
funeral marches continuously as the procession made its difficult
way under leaden skies and over snowy ground; so bad was the
weather that this dismal pageant did not reach Strassburg until a
month after the departure from Chambord. As the capital of Alsace
was reached, M. de Saint-André, the commandant of the province
sent out the regiment of Clermont to meet the "<i>convoi"</i>
and, at a signal from a cannon, all the bells of the Lutheran
churches rang out.</p>

<p>In Strassburg a very orgy of funeral pomp was indulged in, all
the notabilities turned out, smothered in crape, guns and bells
made the most doleful sounds possible, while the massive coffin
of Maurice de Saxe was laid by ten gunners on a bed of state "in
the taste of a duchess," that had been prepared in the
castle.</p>

<p>Here under a "grand imperial" of black velvet garnished with
silver mohair, between curtains of white satin tied with crape,
Maurice took his last part in a spectacle of worldly pomp; the
hall was hung with black, adorned with the arms of Saxony and
Courland, marshal staffs tied saltirewise, death's-heads, tears,
hour-glasses, ribbons of the White Eagle, and such-like pleasing
emblems of the desirability and futility of earthly grandeur.</p>

<p>On the black velvet pall gleamed and sparkled in the light of
white wax candles, under a veil of black crape, the crossed sword
and scabbard so often used and the ducal crown that had never
been worn. At the four corners of the bed sat four heralds; in
one hand they held a flaming torch, in the other a marshal's
baton.</p>

<p>While Maurice thus lay in state, the Protestant students from
the College of Saint William passed round the bed, chanting
funeral hymns. Thus was the Marshal honoured after death by the
professors of that faith which he had not taken the slightest
notice of during his life.</p>

<p>True, he had remained constant to Lutheranism, but hardly in
the face of temptation and more from dislike of other brands of
Christianity than belief in the faith for which his ancestors had
battled.</p>

<p>However, his stolid adherence to the tenets of Martin Luther
had brought a good deal of money and excitement to Strassburg
that otherwise would have been enjoyed by the Parisians, and the
city was grateful.</p>

<p>If the students had their gossip about the dead hero, it was
exchanged in private, on the surface all was decorum. On the day
of the funeral the whole town was in mourning, everyone of
importance was in trailing cloak and weepers, and ingenuity was
exhausted in the pomp and gloom of the final journey of the
victor of Fontenoy. All the nobility of the province and all the
magistrates of the town marched to the accompaniment of doleful
symphonies and the beat of drums muffled in crape. Torches of
white wax were burnt, and everyone was in ceremonial habit and
full mourning.</p>

<p>Besides all the vicars and curates of the seven Protestant
churches of the town, there were forty-three country ministers to
pay homage to the hero, whose huge coffin was carried by twelve
sergeants. Three "notable bourgeois" in mourning followed the
pall and torch-bearers, and the Marshal's two nephews had been
joined by the most important personage of the neighbourhood, the
Prince of Nassau-Saarbrücken.</p>

<p>The new church of Saint Thomas had been chosen for the
resting-place of Maurice and this had been lavishly prepared by
anxious upholsterers, carpenters and scene painters for the great
occasion.</p>

<p>Every gleam of daylight was excluded from the church, which
was lit by torches and candles and lavishly adorned with
skeletons, skulls, Virtues, Genii and weeping Saturns, with a
very plethora of emblems, laurel wreaths, coats of arms, Latin
mottoes, and hundreds of yards of black cloth and silver fringe;
in short, nothing was wanting to render the idea of death as
dismal and disgusting as possible and to terrify people into
desiring a long life by the spectacle of the terrors waiting at
the end of it. Nor were two tedious and pedantic discourses
lacking, in which zealous professors of Theology, M. Laurenz and
M. Froereisen, gave the deceased, in the most fulsome terms,
credit for every virtue ever possessed by man, including those of
temperance, piety, and chastity, and invoked a whole heaven of
heathen deities to weep for the death of this Christian hero,
now, no doubt, comfortably in a Lutheran heaven.</p>

<p>After these sermons, the exhausted and stifling congregation
had to listen to a funeral hymn; then the body was carried to a
<i>chapelle ardente</i> that had been especially prepared, where
there was yet another "<i>lit de parade"</i>; on this Maurice de
Saxe was left, all the emblems and decorations from the church
being placed round the catafalque. Nor was this the end of it;
when Maurice was at last consigned to the dark bed of state in
the black-hung vaults, and the weepers and mourning cloaks had
been folded away, and the Uhlans turned back towards Paris, the
celebrated Pigalle must be ordered to adorn the new Lutheran
temple with as ostentatious a piece of sculpture as the florid
taste of the times could inspire.</p>

<p>A model was soon completed and on view in the Louvre two years
after the death of Maurice. The experts judged it "worthy of the
best period of Athens and Rome," and it certainly possessed great
technical merit and a certain grace and beauty that are, however,
more shocking than pleasing. Twenty-six years after the death of
the hero, the monument was set in place in the church of St.
Thomas, a fitting Saint to preside over such an edifice, such a
tomb. And there it stands to this moment, looking odd and somehow
ghastly in the bare church, a skilful exhibition of the false
taste, laboured symbolism and insincere sentiment of a cold and
exhausted period of art.</p>

<p>Maurice, handsome and elegant, is standing at the summit of
the monument, wearing his cuirass and holding the marshal's
baton. Behind him is a pyramid generously adorned with symbols of
victory, before him is a flight of stairs that he is slowly
descending. France, a voluptuous female figure, draws him back;
Death draws him on with a hand that holds an hourglass and with
the other slides open the lid of an empty coffin. Glory, in
tears, extinguishes a torch; Strength (Hercules) sinks in
despair; the symbolic beasts of the nations beaten by Maurice on
the field of battle balance on the other side the composition
that is twenty-five feet in height and twenty feet in width and
carried out in cold white marble.</p>

<p>What thought is behind this gloomy piece of work it is
impossible to say; it states merely that a hero must die and that
a nation mourns. The lack of any spirituality, any hope, any
gleam of faith in any creed, is odd in a memorial in a Christian
church, and the crass worldliness of the conception is
almostfrightening.</p>

<p>In attempting the sublime, Pigalle has only achieved the
theatrical, and so much perhaps might be said of the man he
commemorates; this is an ill piece of sculpture but not an ill
epitome of the career of Maurice de Saxe.</p>

<p>This swaggering figure descending to the tomb, does it not
express the victor of Fontenoy? This graceful weeping France, is
she not a very Adrienne de Lecouvreur despairing over her
faithless lover? And these vapid leopards, eagles and lions, do
they not fitly represent the futile and showy wars where Maurice
was conqueror, the barren triumphs he achieved?</p>

<p>And the hideous grinning figure waiting to fasten the coffin
lid on all this virile grandeur shows fairly enough the dull
materialism, the gloomy doubt of the prosaic and cynic society in
which Maurice de Saxe played his part. And with the fortitude
represented in his statue did he face the death that he believed
was the end of body and soul.</p>

<p>The sentimentality of the actress, the frivolity of the ballet
dancer, the hypocrisy of the priest, mingle in this monument
where the bitter gaiety of a disillusioned aristocracy, the
useless flourishes of a mercenary soldier who had no worthy cause
to serve, the tawdry ambitions of an adventurer, are alike
vanquished by that terrible material death conceived by the
atheist and accepted by the nominal Christian who has lost his
faith.</p>

<p>This pretentious monument, which has an air so oddly sinister
in its gross materialism, is a fitting commemoration of the life
and death of the son of Aurora von Königsmarck, the lover of
Adrienne de Lecouvreur, the persecutor of Justine Favart, the man
who drove back Cumberland and his stubborn British soldiers.</p>

<p>The first biographer of Maurice quotes with approval this
epitaph that expresses, he thinks, the spirit of the "superb
monument" in Strassburg.</p>
<br>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">
Hostibus Fusis.<br> Pace Data.<br>
Mauritius<br>
Gallia Gemente.<br>
Tartara subit impavidus.</span></p>
<br>

<p>More might have been said; but that was scarcely the moment in
which to say it and the epitaph, different from the monument,
showed at least good taste, and lied as elegantly as any of its
kind. Maurice had never shown good taste or elegance, but it
should be remembered that he had asked for quicklime.</p>
