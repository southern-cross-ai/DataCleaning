<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. MAN ALONE</h2>

<p class="first">FORTY hours of steady riding brought Buck
Surratt across the wide desert to these foothills. The road at
once left this burning plain and followed a canyon's rising
tangents into broken masses of ravine and butte and deep green
sweeps of pine. Far away and high up the Gray Bull peaks reared
their stony shoulders.</p>

<p>A long training in trouble turned him aside from that canyon
road. Bearing to the left, he climbed the ridge and reached its
summit and there, with the invitation of the pines directly ahead
of him, he paused to scan his back trail. His high, flat body
became still and all the restlessness of his nature flowed into a
hard, prolonged attention. The sun had dipped against the western
horizon, and its edge seemed to burst and spill a golden lava
across the earth; that final light laid a clear flame on the far
mountains over there. Emptiness and a smoky heat haze filled the
flat, tawny desert lying between. Buck Surratt's glance explored
every detail of it, the whole picture engraving itself on his
retentive memory. Afterwards his eyes turned to the green tangle
of the hills. Up there was coolness and isolation&mdash;and
anonymity for a man. And because these were the things he sought
beyond all other things, he lifted his reins gladly and passed
into the timber...</p>

<p>At dark he sat on his heels with a pipe clenched between his
teeth, watching the livid coals of his campfire burn a ruby hole
through the felted shadows of the forest. Water ran sibilantly
along the bottom of a ravine on his left; a damp, earthy smell
rose from that black depth. The voice of the forest and its
mysteries pulsed around him, softened by a small cool wind
flowing off the Gray Bull peaks. Out of this deep solitude came
the air-borne call of wildness, intangible, yet striking
definitely through him. His shoulders swayed a little, he cocked
his head to listen, and the pressure around the corners of his
long lips relaxed and smoothed away the taut, dry bitterness that
had so long been there. The firelight struck up a bright flash in
his eyes. A windless chuckle disturbed his chest and his
inscrutable, sun-darkened cheeks broke to a faint smiling. He was
still smiling when he rolled the blankets around him and fell
asleep, the presence of that wild mystery invoking a swift
response in his wire-tough body. It eased and nourished him,
though he did not know why. There was some ancient familiarity
here he didn't understand. The last thing he heard was the
patient stir of the pony around its picket rope...</p>

<p>The shot ripped a ragged hole through the stillness, its sound
near enough to strike physically against him. Wakened, he
remained a motionless moment in his blankets, keen to the
possibilities of the night, hearing the echoes of the shot break
and run down the corridors of these hills and die out remotely.
His fire was dead and a thin, damp fog lay along the ground, with
the curdled blackness of early morning condensed in the sky. The
shot, he decided, had come from the canyon on his left. Down
there brush began to break before a traveling body. He lifted his
head from the saddle and reached beneath it and pulled his gun
from the holster; and kicked aside his blankets, rolling quietly
away. He got up and stood behind a tree. His horse blew out a
gusty breath.</p>

<p>Somebody crashed up the side of the canyon without regard for
secrecy. He heard the sound of a quirt slashing down and the
reaching grunts of a pony. The rider came straight on, broke
through the last brush and reached the little clearing. The pony
stopped, and the breathing of animal and rider rasped heavily
across the black; the pony was turning around and around, without
control, and the rider's shape seemed to sway and almost fall
from the saddle. An odd groan came out of the rider, very thin
and very high. After that he wheeled and went away at a reckless
gallop, bound east into the deeper mystery of the hills.</p>

<p>Buck Surratt remained by the tree until the last fugitive
murmur had faded in the distance, then came back to his blankets
and packed and lighted his pipe. He crouched down, pulling a
blanket over his shoulders. There was no additional rumor in the
canyon, no signal of life or pursuit. He lifted his watch to the
pipe bowl and blew up the tobacco coals, and by that dim glow he
registered the time. Ten minutes after two of a chilly morning.
He replaced the watch and lay down in the blankets, supported on
an elbow, his thinking sharp and taciturn and wary. There was, he
understood, no more sleep for him. That one shot had destroyed
all his security; his nearness to it had enmeshed him in whatever
trouble was to follow. So considering, he debated his course and
at half-past three, with a dim band of light beginning to break
above the Gray Bull peaks, he rose and went down that slope
whence the fugitive had come. At the bottom he distinguished a
small clearing and a line rider's log cabin. The door was open
and a saddled pony stood near by. He came up to the door,
listening for sounds that never arrived. Presently he went
in.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later he climbed back up the canyon, breathing
hard, the pipe clenched more tightly between his teeth. All his
motions were swift and decided. He saddled and caught up his
blankets; and then did a strange thing. Until this point in his
joumeyings he had worn his gun. Now he put gun and holster and
belt in the blanket roll and lashed it behind the saddle. A
little beyond four o'clock, with full daylight breaking, he rode
eastward away from his camp.</p>

<p>The pony prints of the fugitive were increasingly clear to
him, and at one point he got down and paid them a slow, enigmatic
attention. He went on then, following the trail continuously
upward, with his mind sticking hard to the central fact of the
night gone. The trees broke away in front of a small mountain
meadow turned amber by summer's heat; beyond the meadow the trail
coursed out to a point and from that point he saw the road again,
looping its way along the bottom of the rocky canyon. Beyond the
road the country continued to rise in green waves toward the Gray
Bull peaks. Turning to resume the trail, he found a rider poised
at the edge of the trees. The man put both his hands on the
saddle horn. He said, without inflection: "Momin'."</p>

<p>There was in Buck Surratt the sudden leap of a wicked flame,
but it made no change on that sun-darkened, wind-ruddied face; it
did not disturb the enigmatic, faintly wistful gravity. He held
himself straight, poised for whatever unexpected turn might come,
and the powder-gray surfaces of his eyes bit into the opposite
rider and absorbed all significance. The man was small and gray-
haired, and his shoulders sloped from the years he had obviously
spent punching cattle for thirty dollars a month. The corners of
Buck Surratt's mouth relaxed imperceptibly.</p>

<p>He said, "Mornin'," in the same brief tone.</p>

<p>The small man allowed indifference to shade his talk. "Camp
around here last night?"</p>

<p>"Back on the ridge."</p>

<p>The puncher's nose twitched briefly. "Hear a shot?"</p>

<p>"I heard it."</p>

<p>The puncher said, "Where&mdash;?" and definitely closed his
mouth. He stared at Buck Surratt with a narrower interest. It was
as though he threw up a guard and retreated from what he suddenly
saw in Surratt. His glance fell to Buck Surratt's beltless
waistline and remained there, showing wonder. "Well," he said, "I
guess it's none of my business."</p>

<p>"That was my thought likewise," Buck Surratt mused. "So I rode
on."</p>

<p>Silence fell, polite and discreet. Sunlight definitely reached
over the Gray Bull peaks, slanting immaculate golden splinters
across a flawless sky. The color of day stepped up one full
octave. The puncher lifted a hand casually to his shirt pocket
and got out his cigarette dust and rolled a smoke. He licked the
cylinder with his tongue; his eyes were bright beneath the
shading brim of his hat.</p>

<p>"Looking for a job?"</p>

<p>"That pegs my situation."</p>

<p>"I judged so, from the desert dust you're packin'. Go see Bill
Head in Morgantown."</p>

<p>"Why Bill Head?"</p>

<p>"If you want a job," the puncher softly added.</p>

<p>Curiosity stirred Buck Surratt. He said: "I'm a great hand to
pick my outfits."</p>

<p>The puncher's small shoulders lifted and fell. "That may be.
But if you work, Head's the man you work for."</p>

<p>"Nobody else?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," suggested the puncher. His words had a dry
rustle; remote speculation gleamed in his calico-blue glance.
"Morgantown's three miles. Cut down to the road." He picked up
his reins and slowly rode a circle around Buck Surratt. There was
a caginess here Surratt clearly identified. Matching the gesture
he put his horse in motion and passed into the trees. He wasn't
impolite enough to look behind him, but at the next sharp turn of
the trail he caught a glimpse of the puncher's pony sliding into
the far brush. A little beyond that point the trail swung down
from the ridge to the road.</p>

<p>A stage came careening around a high bend of that road, four
horses running freely and a great boil of dust behind. The
squealing of the brake blocks and the rattle of doubletree chains
broke dissonantly across the dreaming peace of the morning and
lingered long after the stage had rumbled out of sight beyond a
farther curve. On the road, Buck Surratt took the lifting grade
at a walk, his head bowed against the dust hanging heavy in the
warming atmosphere.</p>

<p>To either side of him the canyon walls ran upward to distant
vantage points, arousing in him a restless dissatisfaction at his
exposure. It was a protective instinct he could not forget; and
strengthening that feeling was the memory of the friendless
reserve of the puncher on the ridge. There was a tension here
that had its roots in some background of which he knew nothing.
Once, looking behind, he caught a view of the distant desert all
asmoke with its own glaring yellow heat.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, hungry and alert, he rounded a final high
bend of the canyon and came upon Morgantown.</p>

<p>It sat narrowly within the walls of the canyon, its single
street bending between front-flared wooden buildings that held
about them a beaten, long-settled look. The sidewalks were shaded
by overhanging, second-story porches and trees grew
intermittently up from the dust. Alleys ran back from this
street, and down the alleys he observed houses clinging to the
steep canyon walls. A woman in a blue dress and a white
shirtwaist came out of one of these alleys, to look fully at him
and to turn into a store whose sign read: "Annette Carvel,
Dressmaker." Farther on, a saloon's ornate and varicolored
windows set up a little blaze in the slanting sun. Beyond that,
at the intersection of another alley, stood a new brick building
with high, gingerbread cornices. Up in its central arch an
inscription said: "William Head, 1887." A few horses stood three-
footed at the hitching racks and a few people moved with
unhurried leisure beneath the shade of the overhanging porches.
All these things Buck Surratt absorbed with that insistent need
for detail which forever drew his eyes to the stray motions of
the world and to the subtle changes of men's expressions. At the
stable beyond the bank he left his horse and quartered over to a
restaurant he had noted.</p>

<p>He ate without haste and came again to the street, packing and
lighting his pipe. The town seemed livelier than before. One
rider came down from the hills into the upper end of the street
at a canter and wheeled before a group of men standing there. The
girl in the white shirtwaist appeared at the doorway of the
dressmaking shop and rested a round white arm against the wood.
Her eyes were on him deliberately, with a faint insistence that
carried over the interval and stirred him. He saw then that she
was young, and that her lips were full and curving and red across
a face made graphic by some warm, frank curiosity lying within.
Her hair was black. Even in the shadows there it was shining and
turning her forehead and her cheeks whiter, more expressive. He
dropped his glance, for something came from her to him and
touched him with embarrassment. A man behind him said:</p>

<p>"Come up to the office a minute."</p>

<p>There was a short civilness in the tone, nothing more. Surratt
turned without hurry to look down on the broad bulk of a man
whose long and gray mustaches made a half-moon pattern along a
face purely unemotional, plainly dogged. Surratt's attention
remained on him steadily. A softness ran on with his talk. "Whose
office?"</p>

<p>The older man's eyes dropped to Surratt's unbelted waistline
and lifted with a freshening interest. "My name's Tom
Bolderbuck," he said. "Marshal of the town." His glance deepened,
and a reserve and a faint courtesy rubbed the edges of his
command. He stepped half a pace backward. Two thin lines started
across the pink swell of his forehead. "Some gentlemen up the
street want to see you a minute in the jail office."</p>

<p>Behind a continued impassivity, Surratt's mind ran quick and
knowing. There had been a shot deep in the hills and the
invisible telegraph of cattle country had picked up that rumor of
trouble and carried it on. He had a part to play here, as he had
known since the crash of that bullet had wakened him. He said,
"Sure," and moved his high, alert body up the walk, the marshal
tramping at his side.</p>

<p>A man at the hotel doorway wheeled and stared. The group
collected farther up the street had disappeared through a
doorway, but the rider who had come so rapidly into town still
stood by his horse. Surratt saw the pony's flanks stained with
sweat; his glance came up to the puncher and recognized him to be
the thin fellow he had met on the trail. The man's eyes were
fixedly on him, deliberately without recognition, remotely
hostile. Bolderbuck said, "Go ahead," and Surratt bowed his neck
and passed into the jail office.</p>

<p>In the semidarkness he saw the forms of men standing along a
far wall. They were waiting for him and in the room was a feeling
of challenge. It sent a rapid warning all through his flat
muscles.</p>

<p>A voice said, in a swift, attacking way: "You camped on
Soapstone Ridge last night?"</p>

<p>"A ridge near the road," replied Buck Surratt. "I'm not
acquainted with its name."</p>

<p>"You heard a shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where's your gun?"</p>

<p>"Packed in my blanket roll, on my horse."</p>

<p>Stillness came on, broken only by a curt murmur that sent
Bolderbuck immediately out of the jail office. Surratt's eyes,
better accustomed to the darkness here, saw five men posted
beyond a table, watching him across a bottomless gulf of
suspicion. They were all past middle age, except for the one who
had done the talking. He was young, as young as Surratt, and he
stood a halfhead above them, with a muscular swell to chest and
arm and neck that was impressive. He had a round face, whose bold
and lively features gave it a handsomeness that was faintly heavy
and very sure. He was a yellow-haired man, with lips long and
heavy and controlled.</p>

<p>He laid out his question in the manner of a man who would not
be denied, who never had been denied. "Where do you come
from?"</p>

<p>"West of the desert."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts, I said."</p>

<p>Buck Surratt's shoulders shifted. His voice rode a steady
tone. "Who are you, my friend?"</p>

<p>The man stared at Surratt, displeased. "My name's Bill Head. I
still want to know where you're from."</p>

<p>"I have told you," Buck Surratt remarked softly, "as much of
that as it is necessary for you to know."</p>

<p>A sudden tide of ruddy color washed across Bill Head's round,
self-certain face. Temper flashed in his eyes and pressed
arrogance into his full lips. "The hell you say. I don't like
saddle bums talking that way to me."</p>

<p>There was a man at the end of the group in a blue serge suit
that fit him loosely. He seemed deferent in this company,
oppressed by it. He said a dry, cautious word to Buck Surratt:
"You're in a ticklish situation, my boy. Answer the question
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bill Head cut him off. "I'll do the talking, Sheriff."</p>

<p>It stilled the sheriff. Looking at him in curiosity, Buck
Surratt saw how he accepted that rebuke without
resentment&mdash;and filed the man's character in the back of his
mind.</p>

<p>"What are you doing up here?" insisted Head.</p>

<p>"Just traveling."</p>

<p>The marshal, Bolderbuck, came back into the office. He said in
his matter-of-fact voice: "It's there all right." A small
interval of tight silence came on again and Surratt's eyes
memorized that scene to its smallest detail. The sheriff was a
nonentity in a blue serge suit, the marshal an unimaginative
errand boy. It was the other four lined up side by side against
the wall who had the power here. He saw them in brief clearness;
the old man with the transparent skin and mild eyes who chewed
silently on his tobacco quid and listened, the fat-bodied one
whose skin was dusky as that of an Indian, the long and bony and
sharp-nosed one who nodded at each spurt of talk&mdash;and this
Bill Head who seemed to rule them.</p>

<p>Bill Head asked: "Want a job?"</p>

<p>But there was an interruption. Somebody came into the office
and stood slightly behind Buck Surratt, and then the whole
atmosphere of the place changed. There had been suspicion and
unfriendliness rolling against him. Now it seemed to change
direction and strike beyond him, against the newcomer, with a
greater and more resentful effect. Deeply curious, Buck Surratt
looked around and saw the man&mdash;tall and lean and
restless&mdash;smiling back at that obvious dislike with an
ironic twist of his mouth. He was redheaded and excessively
freckled, and his eyes were almost green against a sandy
complexion.</p>

<p>Bill Head spoke bluntly enough. "This is a private meeting,
Torveen."</p>

<p>"So I heard," agreed Torveen. His talk reached Bill Head with
a cool and malicious effect. Bill Head's glance burned out his
distrust, yet he had nothing more to say to the man. Buck Surratt
remembered that, and found this Torveen's glance to be
appraisingly and shrewdly on him. Bill Head repeated his
question.</p>

<p>"You want a job?"</p>

<p>Surratt said: "Who with?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll give you a job."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it."</p>

<p>Bill Head's solid chin stretched forward. "Wait a minute,
mister. You're too fast with your answers entirely. Maybe you've
got only two things to do&mdash;take the job or go to jail."</p>

<p>Surratt said softly: '"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you were entirely too damned close to that shot last
night. I propose to find out more than you've told me."</p>

<p>"I'll still think about it," Surratt drawled. There was, then,
nothing to break the force of their general scrutiny. They were
tearing him apart with their thoughts; their minds were fencing
him in with the events of the night. He reached for his tobacco
and packed his pipe. He scratched a match on the table and
wiggled it across the bowl. His features had nothing to tell
them; but his glance crossed to Bill Head and remained there
narrowly. He turned without comment and walked from the room.</p>

<p>Below the jail office he stopped and considered the stable
across the street, where his horse was. But he understood he
could not ride away now and so went on, past the white porch of
the hotel and beneath the shade of the overhanging board awnings.
There were many people collecting in town, and the smell of
trouble definitely lay along the street. He knew it and he
understood it, this Buck Surratt who was somewhat of a specialist
in trouble. It keyed him up. He came to a stand on the edge of
the walk, pipestem bitten securely between his teeth, his mind
alive.</p>

<p>A rider&mdash;a girl&mdash;ran out of the upper trees into
town at a steady canter, lifting the thick dust behind her. Buck
Surratt looked that way incuriously; and then was curious. She
was dressed in a man's blue levi pants and a man's brown cotton
shirt, open at the neck. She rode the saddle in a way that was
good to see, her shoulders swinging, her body full of grace.
Turning in at the rack across the street she dropped to the
ground with one careless jump and went across the walk toward the
door of the dressmaking shop, calling in a quick and even-pitched
voice: "Annette." Surratt got one brief view of her face before
she disappeared inside; she had looked back and her attention
struck him and noticed him, and then the brim of her wide hat hid
her expression.</p>

<p>Without directly watching, he saw Torveen come along the walk
at a lazy stroll. Somebody said: "Hello, Sam."</p>

<p>Torveen's answer was plain and, as it had been in the jail
office, cheerfully ironic. "Don't speak to pariahs like me,
Spud." He stopped beside Surratt. He teetered his boots on the
edge of the walk and looked out into the yellow dust, his eyes
half shut. He said indifferently: "You been offered one job,
friend. I'll offer you another."</p>

<p>"What kind of a job?"</p>

<p>"A job," said Torveen laconically.</p>

<p>Surratt murmured: "I rode into this damned country to keep out
of trouble."</p>

<p>Torveen murmured: "That's your hard luck." He was grinning,
his lips thin and crooked. Some deviltry in his thoughts kept
sparkling through his eyes.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the offer, but I guess not," said Surratt. "Who's
that girl?"</p>

<p>Torveen chuckled. "You're an observin' scoundrel. Which girl?
Annette? Or the one which just came in? She's Judith Cameron. You
saw her daddy in the jail office&mdash;the benevolent-appearin'
old pirate with the white mustache and tobacco chaw. I thought
you were tryin' to keep out of trouble."</p>

<p>He turned his head quickly, toward the upper end of town.
Following suit, Buck Surratt saw a file of riders coming down
with a pack horse. There was a burden, rolled in canvas, lashed
across the pack horse. Surratt's lips tightened; the pipe shifted
between his teeth. He said: "Who've they got?"</p>

<p>Torveen turned and stared at him, for once not smiling. "It's
the man that was killed last night in the hills." Surratt saw
speculation flickering in those green eyes. "Leslie
Head&mdash;Bill Head's brother. Maybe a lot of things are plainer
to you now."</p>

<p>The two women had come from the dressmaking shop. They stood
in front of the doorway, staring up the street. He saw the drawn
expression on Annette Carvel's cheeks and the enormous soberness
of the other girl, Judith Cameron. She felt Surratt's glance, and
looked abruptly at him; and turned her eyes away again. Surratt
removed his pipe; he bowed his head and remained in this studying
attitude. He said: "I'll take the job&mdash;for reasons of my
own."</p>

<p>Torveen's grin freshened across the brick-red skin. "I got
reasons of my own for askin' you. So we're even. Get your horse
and ride up the road three miles till you see a fence. Turn in
there." But after a minute he added dryly: "That is, if you can
leave town. There may be some argument about that."</p>

<p>Surratt left him, quartering over to the stable. He paid the
hostler and went back and got his pony. But he stood a moment by
it before mounting, staring at the blanket roll. It had been
pawed apart, and the end of his gun belt hung out. He withdrew
the gun belt and strapped it on, and lifted the revolver and spun
the cylinder before replacing it. In the saddle he sat
motionless, his head bowed a little. His lips made a faintly
downward semicircle and his breathing deepened. He turned and
rode from the stable.</p>

<p>Bill Head had walked down the street with the others. They
were halted by the hotel now, a circle of townsmen forming around
them. Sam Torveen loitered against a near-by porch post and
seemed indifferent to the scene. Bolderbuck noticed Surratt and
broke from the circle walking over and waving his hands
negatively. "You'll have to get down&mdash;"</p>

<p>Surratt brushed by, riding toward the circle. He slipped from
the saddle and walked on to where Bill Head stood. Bill Head had
been watching, his big shoulders reared. Surratt's cheeks were
thin and his voice slashed against Head with a queer, exciting
effect:</p>

<p>"I believe it was your suggestion that sent the marshal down
to paw over my blanket roll and look at my gun. Is that
right?"</p>

<p>Bill Head showed a sultry surprise. "Certainly."</p>

<p>Buck Surratt's body kinked at the waist. It threw his torso
ahead of his hips. He stood this way, stiffly, with both arms
hanging straight down. A man behind Bill Head suddenly pushed
himself to one side&mdash;an obvious move that agitated and
shifted the other townsmen. Head looked around, scowling at this
change; and then his glance whipped back to Surratt, his
attention rigid and full with what he saw. All the group turned
dead still.</p>

<p>"I am warning you," said Buck Surratt. His talk struck the
silence recklessly, flattening and swelling. "Never touch my
things again. Do you understand? Never touch them again."</p>

<p>He took a backward step and got into the saddle; and turned
and went trotting up the street. Nobody spoke. Sam Torveen, with
his shoulders against the porch post, was silently laughing.
Judith Cameron saw him doing this and looked at Bill Head with a
deepening wonder, and then watched Buck Surratt rise at the head
of the canyon and turn beyond the bend of the road and disappear.
Bill Head's cheeks were locked in a flushed, angry confusion.
Annette Carvel at once whispered to Judith: "Who is he&mdash;who
is that new, good-looking man?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. SAM TORVEEN</h2>

<p class="first">HE rode out of Morgantown at a short trot, as
deliberate in retreat as he had been in attack. But when he
turned the first bend of the road he set his horse to a fast,
reaching canter and held it.</p>

<p>The road kept winding and climbing, with lesser roads angling
off at intervals to ranches hidden somewhere behind the trees.
Now and then, up an occasional vista, he got a brief view of the
Gray Bull peaks, but otherwise his roving glance struck against
the solid green wall of the forest. The day was fresh and still,
with the fragrance of pine resin strong in it. All the details of
this mountain world were vivid and pleasant. They fed his senses
in a way that was strange to him, fulfilling a hunger he did not
understand, covering him with a comfort and a familiarity even as
his regretting thoughts dwelt on the scene in Morgantown. He had
crossed the desert to find ease and rest&mdash;the deep desire of
his life; yet the echoes of that night bullet had laid an ancient
pattern of trouble over these hills, and he was trapped in the
pattern. The ways of a man's life, he thought wistfully, always
caught up with him.</p>

<p>Around the next quick bend of the road he came upon a man
riding loosely and sleepily, the fatness of his body jiggling to
the motion of the horse. A black-brimmed stetson slanted over his
features and hid them until the sound of Surratt's nearing pony
roused him. He hauled himself back in the saddle then and hoisted
his shoulders. His eyes were a sparkling black, set close to a
gigantic nose that brought the rest of his face to a point. He
stopped immediately, and Surratt, following suit, saw some kind
of an emotion ripple through this vast hulk and straighten the
loose lines of a pendulous mouth. Surratt dropped his hands on
the saddle horn. Severe and motionless he watched the man scan
him and identify him. He said then:</p>

<p>"You never saw me before, Blackjack. And I don't know you. Do
you get it?"</p>

<p>The man's lips spread and became loose again. He folded both
arms across his bully chest and seemed to struggle darkly with
his confused thoughts. His eyes dropped from Surratt, and that
was all. Surratt went by him. Three hundred yards up the slope he
saw a fence and a road paralleling it. This he followed, passing
into the semidarkness of the pines, into a thick warm silence.
Five minutes later the trees dropped away and left him on the
edge of a rolling basin surrounded by timber and ridges. A creek
slashed its way through the meadow, glistening under the
sunlight; across the creek stood a ranch house, long and low and
gray, surrounded by the customary clutter of sheds and corrals of
cattle land. Surratt went over a plank bridge, lifting a hollow
signal of arrival, and circled the house. A dark little man sat
on the edge of the porch oiling a rifle. He looked up with the
sharpest and briefest of glances, and returned his attention to
the gun. Surratt dismounted.</p>

<p>The man's head instantly lifted again. He said, uncharitably:
"Anybody invite you to light here?"</p>

<p>"Torveen's place?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Surratt shrugged his shoulders. He walked to an empty box and
overturned it and sat down; he got out his pipe and loaded it.
But his nerves were alert, keened by the suspecting
unfriendliness of that other man's attention. He was beyond
forty, Surratt judged, and gray at the temples; there was a
thinness of body and temper about him, a wicked excitability.
Something struck Surratt on his left side then, something that
had weight but no physical substance. He got a match out of his
pocket and lighted it, his glance sliding quickly along the
porch. A sort of an ell ran back from the left corner of the
house, with four doors opening into what he judged to be kitchen
and bunkroom. His eyes went along the ell and reached a window
and stopped. Behind the window was the attentive face of a young
man, pallid and prematurely etched by lines of violence.</p>

<p>Surratt ground the burnt match into his palm, creating a sooty
disk there. He pulled smoke into his lungs, his lips lengthened
and tightened. The feel of this place was bad. It rubbed his fur
the wrong way, it kept plucking at his senses, it cocked his
muscles. A horse scudded out of the trees. Looking up, he saw Sam
Torveen wheel around the house and step to the ground. The little
man on the porch rose immediately. He stared at Torveen.</p>

<p>"You know this fella?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Torveen.</p>

<p>The man's wire-edged features snapped to anger. He said
something under his voice and picked up his gun and went scowling
through a doorway, into the ell.</p>

<p>Torveen's grin streaked angularly across his sandy cheeks.
"You may like Nick Perrigo," he said carelessly. "Or you may not.
He's my foreman. Come inside." The restlessness of this redheaded
man sent him across the porch at a high stride. Soberly
following, Buck Surratt came into a long bare room cluttered with
the gear of a cattleman. There was a bunk at one end, and a
fireplace, and a desk with a tally book and a pad of writing
paper on it, and two chairs. The windows had wooden shutters that
closed from the inside; a stand containing four rifles stood near
the bunk. Torveen dropped into a chair. He hooked a leg over the
chair's arm and began swinging it. The greenness of his eyes was
brighter and there was the stronger impression of a controlled
rashness playing behind that color.</p>

<p>"Want a drink?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You've heard my name mentioned. I don't know yours."</p>

<p>"Buck Surratt."</p>

<p>Sam Torveen bent forward. "What was the idea of that play
against Bill Head?"</p>

<p>Surratt said, gently: "Just to freeze things up long enough
for me to get out of town."</p>

<p>"Supposin' the play hadn't worked?"</p>

<p>"It worked."</p>

<p>"Supposin' it hadn't?" insisted Torveen.</p>

<p>"I never figure more than one step ahead at a time," murmured
Surratt.</p>

<p>"The hell you don't," countered Torveen. "You're half a mile
ahead of yourself, every foot of the way. I been laughin' to
myself ever since&mdash;the way you framed that." His grin was
hard and cheerful. "You're trapped in town but you walk up to
Bill Head, give him hell, and ride off before he can get
unsnarled from his surprise. If he was a man quick on the recoil
you couldn't of made that play stick, friend Buck. But you pegged
him as bein' slow. I take off my hat to you."</p>

<p>Surratt's mind reviewed the scene in Morgantown methodically.
There was a need in him for information, as there always was.
"Who's Bill Head?"</p>

<p>"He runs the Crow Track for his old man, who's a cripple. It's
a big jag of land, north of here, up in the hills."</p>

<p>"There was a dark, heavy fellow standing beside him."</p>

<p>"Dutch Kersom, another old-timer with plenty of cattle. I
already named you Ab Cameron. The fourth fellow, the one with the
bony face, was Hank Peyrolles. They'll account for eighty per
cent of the beef in this section."</p>

<p>"The sheriff's not a proud man," reflected Surratt, "and the
marshal just does what he's told."</p>

<p>Torveen chuckled broadly. "You're figgerin' again." But his
eyes were curious. "Why did you ride into Morgantown, instead of
goin' back to the desert? You must of known that shot would get
you in trouble."</p>

<p>Surratt looked at Torveen steadily. Torveen shook his head and
made a dry observation. "Pm not sayin' you did the shootin',
Surratt. I meant that you're a stranger and you're pulled into
it."</p>

<p>"Where would I run?"</p>

<p>Torveen remarked, very quietly: "So you're here, for reasons
of your own. The pay is thirty a month."</p>

<p>"If I stay."</p>

<p>Torveen had a poker expression on his roan cheeks. "You came
for a reason. It still holds good, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Surratt. But his thoughts were on Nick Perrigo and
the pallid face in the window, and his mind balanced evenly, with
no decision. He could not resolve the puzzle. The reflection of
it crept faintly into the studying soberness of his cheeks.</p>

<p>Slack in his chair, Torveen watched this out of his jade eyes.
"Your head," he murmured, "never stops working. You got this
ranch sized up and there's somethin' about it you don't cotton
to."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>Torveen shifted his body. The smile left him, the corners of
his mouth stiffened. Inscrutably patient, Surratt searched the
sandy cheeks of this Torveen, seeking some solid bottom behind
the surface recklessness, beyond the skeptical glint of deviltry.
He could not help it. All the hard training of his years had
disciplined him to silence, to patience, to a perpetual vigilance
against the trickeries of men. Faintly, he saw something now.
Torveen's cheeks relaxed and a strain showed itself and his tone
became ragged. He said: "If you stay, you'll find out for
yourself. I need help, friend Buck, but I'll tell you no
more&mdash;and I'm not askin' you to stay."</p>

<p>A steel triangle on the porch began to beat harsh sound across
the day. It was noon, it was dinnertime. Boots scraped the porch
boards and there was a rider coming in from the meadow. Torveen
said, "Let's eat," and rose and led the way to the porch. He
ducked through a door of the ell, into a dining room. Coming in,
Surratt found three men already at the table and an enormous
Chinaman standing against the wall. Then a fourth man entered and
took his place, staring at Surratt with one brief, curious
glance. Surratt sat down, silently reversing his capsized plate.
Torveen said to the crew in his casual touch-and-go voice: "The
name of the new member is Buck Surratt. Wang, if you don't quit
puttin' so damn many eggshells in the coffee I'm going to throw a
plate at you."</p>

<p>The Chinaman didn't stir and didn't show a change of
expression. Torveen reared his head, obviously irritated. "I
meant that," he grunted. But he covered the irritation instantly,
nodding his head at the individuals in the crew as he named them
for Surratt. "You know Perrigo, the gentle soul. The kid there is
Ferd Bowie. Good-lookin' gander near you uses a title called
Chunk Osbrook. It may be his real name, I don't know. Last man
there answers to Ed."</p>

<p>They looked briefly at him without acknowledgment. For his
part, Surratt went imperturbably on with his eating. But his mind
registered them with a camera clarity and their faces told him
things they hadn't intended to tell. This Ed was an easy-going
misfit in a crowd that had a jarring, explosive note. Perrigo sat
stirring his coffee with a bitter and unpleasant concentration on
his dry, drawn features. The kid&mdash;Ferd Bowie&mdash;was bony
and peaked. He still had an adolescent down on his cheeks, but
there was a sallow savagery all about his look that told Buck
Surratt of wickedness too early learned. Chunk Osbrook lifted a
pair of ink-black eyes and seemed to measure Surratt for weight
and reach. He was blunt and solid and proud of his strength, and
Surratt understood then he would never be satisfied until he had
demonstrated it. Buck Surratt suddenly remembered another man in
his past who had been like that.</p>

<p>They ate out their hunger and left the room. More leisurely,
Surratt listened to their idle palavering on the porch. When he
was through he went out there and packed his pipe and glanced
through the soft bright heat of the meadow, not noticing them.
The talk had stopped with his appearance and the silence was a
morose, alien thing. Torveen stood in the doorway of the main
house, indifferent and minutely smiling, as though he were
removed from this animosity and impartial to it. But Surratt
detected the irony of that man's glance.</p>

<p>He tried another match on his pipe and clenched it between his
teeth. Stepping off the porch he walked over to his pony and
unlashed the blanket roll. The stillness behind him was hard and
continuing, and he had no need to turn to see how closely they
were watching him. He strolled back to the ell and went along it
to the end door. Inside, he saw a dozen double-decked bunks
surrounding a stove md a table and four home-made chairs. Heat
and stale smoke and the horsy smell of men's clothes lay thick
through the room. He dropped his roll on an empty bunk and walked
back to the porch.</p>

<p>Nick Perrigo sat on the porch edge, his back bent far forward,
his hands on his knees. He glowered at the dust; the nerve-ridden
thinness of his face sharpened. He said idly: "Chunk, you left
your tobacco in the bunkroom."</p>

<p>Chunk Osbrook rose with a jerk, as though released from
enforced waiting. His spurs dragged along the porch. Not looking
that way, Surratt heard him strike the flat of his hand against
the building wall and go into the bunkroom.</p>

<p>There was a quality of expectancy flowing out from this crew
that fanned across Surratt's cheeks; it was an intangible thing
other men might not have felt But for him, trained in the
shadings of trouble, it registered on receptive senses and ticked
a coolness along his nerves. In the bunkroom something fell to
the floor. He turned then and stared at these men. They were
looking away from him, motionless against the sunlight&mdash;and
waiting. There was, he thought regretfully, nothing new in this
pattern; it was the pattern of his life and all the running in
the world would not help him. He walked back to the bunkroom door
and went in.</p>

<p>It was his blanket roll on the floor, thrown there by Chunk
Osbrook. The man stood backed up against the table, his feet
braced apart. A slow, deep breathing lifted and lowered the heavy
arch of his chest; and his eyes were round and bright and greedy.
He said:</p>

<p>"Your junk was in my way."</p>

<p>Surratt walked around the table. The space was narrow and he
had to pull his shoulders aside to avoid brushing Osbrook. He
went on around. Osbrook made a swift wheel and sudden doubt
shaded the glitter of his desire. The table lay between them.
Surratt put his hands at the edge of the table, gripping it. His
thoughts were dismal then, darkened by the going of a hope. The
ways of a man's life always caught up with him. Somewhere was
peace but not for him; and this chore had to be done. There
wasn't any emotion in his voice.</p>

<p>"The boys wouldn't want to miss this, Chunk."</p>

<p>The sweep of his hands carried the table up against Chunk
Osbrook's taut frame and destroyed the rush the man was set to
make. Osbrook flung the table aside with a lunge of his arm. Rage
came out of Buck Surratt in a gust of breathing and turned his
face white. He threw himself against Osbrook, the point of his
shoulder driving Osbrook across the floor to the doorway. Osbrook
struck against the casing and ripped up a jabbing blow that
caught Surratt wickedly in the belly. They fought and heaved and
wrestled around the doorway, using their knees and their elbows.
But Surratt dislodged Osbrook from the casing and drove him to
the edge of the porch. Osbrook fell off backwards, landing on a
shoulder.</p>

<p>Surratt jumped down to the dust and leaped aside. Osbrook, on
his knees, made a dive for Surratt's legs and missed. He rolled
on and lunged up to his feet&mdash;and charged, his knees driving
him, his shoulders low and crouched. Surratt met him savagely. He
broke up that lowering, bull-like rush. He sheered away those
flogging arms and reached Osbrook's turning temple with one
sledging smash. It exploded through the man's head and he saw
Osbrook's eyes mirror the streaked craziness it produced. It took
the power out of Osbrook's fists; they sagged and struck without
aim, and then Surratt crashed his temple again and sent him down
into the dust. Osbrook was blind, he was half knocked out, but
the attacking instinct still held him together and he reared back
on his knees and made another grab for Surratt's legs. Surratt
kicked the man's hands aside and tramped a half circle around
Osbrook. He reached down and got Osbrook around the neck, hauling
him up that way. There wasn't any pity in him as he battered that
broad and dogged face at will. Osbrook's lips began to drip and
spread formlessly, and when he fell he rolled a little and his
hands reached vainly for Surratt; and then he was through, his
legs squirming involuntarily.</p>

<p>Surratt walked backwards; he turned. The crew hadn't stirred.
They didn't stir now, but the color of Ferd Bowie's eyes was deep
and hating, and the wildness of his disappointment burned bright
spots on his starved, consumptive cheeks. Nick Perrigo stared at
his feet, bitter and biding his time. The other man, Ed, rested
his body on the building wall and seemed afraid of all this. Sam
Torveen remained in the doorway, an obscure smile on his face; he
was behind the crew and they didn't see him raise a hand toward
Surratt in a half-saluting manner.</p>

<p>There were three of them here, Surratt understood, who
respected nothing but the whip&mdash;Perrigo and Bowie and Chunk
Osbrook. Pity or generosity they didn't know. He cast a quick
look behind him to where Osbrook had risen uncertainly. He looked
back to the porch again, the temper in him still pitched to
kill.</p>

<p>He said: "Is that all&mdash;or is there some more?"</p>

<p>They had nothing to say. He hadn't felt Osbrook's blows and
hadn't been aware of being struck. But suddenly his body began to
hurt where those blows had landed.</p>

<p><br> Twilight flowed across the meadow in indigo ripples, and
somewhere in the depths of the hills a coyote's howl thickened
the land's deep loneliness. A faint wind came off the Gray Bull
peaks and rustled through the trees like the echoes of a distant
waterfall. Abruptly it was dark, with the lights of the ranch
laying rich yellow beams across soft blackness. Ferd Bowie's
horse clacked over the creek bridge and Ferd Bowie wheeled into
the yard. He said, "All right," and got down.</p>

<p>The crew made vague shapes on the porch. Somebody ticked a
cigarette through the air, and when it fell its burning tip burst
into a vivid spray of light. They had been waiting here, the
sense of it very strong to Surratt&mdash;and now the waiting was
done and they were rising along the porch. Sam Torveen's voice
was keen and a little whipped-up. "Everybody inside." He turned
into the big room, the others at his heels. Following, Surratt
heard horses traveling down the road.</p>

<p>Torveen stood in the center of the room, his red hair ragged
on his forehead. He was smiling again, crookedly.</p>

<p>"Some of them will come in and some will stay in the yard. Ed,
you go stand at the corner of the house." He looked at Buck
Surratt, that glinting amusement strong in his eyes. "You came up
here for reasons of your own, friend Buck. The reasons are about
to appear." He moved around the room, closing the wooden shutters
against the windows and dropping the bars across them. He
returned to the table, caught up the lamp and placed it in a
corner of the room where its light would not make a background.
Perrigo and Bowie and Chunk Osbrook had posted themselves around
this room, making dark and studied shapes. The oncoming men
boomed across the plank bridge. They were in the yard
presently&mdash;and halted. A voice that was familiar to Surratt
hailed the house.</p>

<p>"Torveen. I want to see you."</p>

<p>Torveen reached the doorway. He stopped there. He seemed to be
suppressing laughter. "Come in, Bill." A boot began scraping
behind Surratt, and he stared around and saw the kid, Ferd Bowie,
waving a little. He said: "Stop that, kid." The kid's glance
burned wickedly on him. Torveen had taken a few deliberate back
steps into the room; and now men filed in and made a sober, alert
rank there. He recognized Bill Head and the sheriff. The others
were strange to him.</p>

<p>Bill Head's ruddy face veered and his eyes found Surratt The
angry memory of Morgantown wrote itself across the man's bold
features. He said to Surratt: "Get your belongings. You're going
to Morgantown."</p>

<p>Torveen laid his electric grin on Head. He said: "You offered
this man a job today. What for, Bill?"</p>

<p>"To keep my eyes on him," grunted Head.</p>

<p>"He's got a job here&mdash;and I'll keep my eyes on him."</p>

<p>"No," grunted Head. "He's bein' arrested."</p>

<p>Torveen turned his attention to the sheriff. "You got a
warrant, Ranier?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Surratt spoke quietly. "What for?"</p>

<p>"The killin' of a man named Leslie Head," said Ranier.</p>

<p>Silent laughter showed across Torveen's eyes. "Tear up the
warrant, Sheriff."</p>

<p>Bill Head swung and threw his shoulders forward. "What?"</p>

<p>"He ain't goin'."</p>

<p>The breathing of these men filled the room. Lamplight
disturbed and stained their expressions. The shadow of violence
lay here. The sheriff's body was stiff and crooked. Bill Head
seemed to be rummaging his mind. Surratt thought that his first
impressions had been right; the man was slow on the bounce. But
it was to be seen now that he had an implacable stubbornness.</p>

<p>"That's bad, Torveen."</p>

<p>Torveen said, almost idly: "I stand back of my men. You should
have known that before you came. You might have guessed a warrant
would do you no good. There is no way of getting Surratt except
by takin' him. You think you want to take him, Ranier?"</p>

<p>Sweat glinted along the sheriff's forehead. His eyes turned
and begged Head for an answer. Behind Surratt the kid's feet were
restlessly shuffling again.</p>

<p>Head said definitely: "No. We'll leave the gunplay alone. It
isn't necessary." He directed his talk at Surratt. "Better
consider this and ride into Morgantown tomorrow. You're in a
trap. If I don't see you in town twelve hours from now it's open
season on you, wherever you're found."</p>

<p>"That's plain," said Torveen cheerfully.</p>

<p>Head's face showed the sting of the remark. It was flushed and
irritated. "You better take a long look at your own hole card,
Sam. Come on."</p>

<p>They filed out. Motionless, Surratt listened to them mount and
ride away. Nobody spoke until the echo of their departure had
died beyond the trees. Ed came across the porch then and put his
head through the doorway. Torveen said: "You plant yourself on
the bridge, Ed, and stay till you're relieved."</p>

<p>It broke up the party. Ed disappeared, and Perrigo led Osbrook
and the kid out of the room. Torveen turned on Surratt. He had
ceased to smile.</p>

<p>"Your reason for comin' up here was to get yourself some
protection you saw you were goin' to need. Well, I gave you the
protection. That's my part of the bargain. But call it quits if
you want. I'll not hold you from ridin' away."</p>

<p>Surratt murmured: "I don't welsh on my debts."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you would," drawled Torveen. "Well, I told you
I had my reasons, too. You'll discover them soon enough. As for
the crew I've got, you know their kind. But I'm in a fight and I
can't be nice about my choice of men." He stopped, framing some
further explanation. Surratt saw it die. Torveen only added:
"What you have to do to those boys is your business, not mine. I
guess you've figured that already, so I don't have to warn
you."</p>

<p>Surratt turned to the porch. He went along it, stepping into
the bunkroom. Osbrook was lying on one bunk, Perrigo on another.
The kid sat up to the table, playing solitaire in moody silence.
None of them looked directly at him, yet as he unrolled his
blankets and pulled off his clothes he felt the effect of a
sidewise, covert scrutiny. He rolled into the bunk and put a palm
over his eyes and stared above him, slowly balancing the help
they had given him against the unqualified hatred they bore him.
There was the thread of motive running through this
contradiction, but he could not ferret it out They were men who
answered only to the whip: they did not understand softness. He
knew then he had something to do here.</p>

<p>He turned his head toward the kid and spoke bluntly, ungently.
"Kill that light, kid."</p>

<p>Ferd Bowie's head jerked. The sullen hatred that was so strong
in him poured across the room. He burst out: "What the hell did
you come here for?"</p>

<p>Surratt reared from his blankets. He put a hand on the edge of
the bed. "If I come over there, runt, I'll spank you dry. Put out
the light."</p>

<p>The kid kicked back his chair, rising. There was a violent
agony of choice printed on his sallow cheeks. Nick Perrigo
remained still on his bunk and looked at this scene with a
bright, scheming attention. But the kid blew out the light and
stamped from the room. Presently Surratt heard Perrigo get up and
call Osbrook. They went out. A door slammed down the porch. In a
moment he heard their voices rising and quarreling with the
fainter voice of Torveen.</p>

<p>Something was plain enough to Surratt then. Torveen hired them
because he needed them. But it appeared they had gotten beyond
his control. Maybe this was why Torveen had offered him the job.
He considered it slowly. But he was tired, and there was a sharp
regret in him for the ways of life he could not escape and the
hope of something he could not name and could never reach; and
presently he fell asleep.</p>

<p class="first">SURRATT swung into his saddle. "I'm going to
have a look at this country."</p>

<p>Torveen murmured idly: "That's all right."</p>

<p>Morning swelled across the meadow in warm full waves of
sunlight. Surratt's horse pitched gently around the yard, strong
with the desire to travel, but Surratt was watching Nick Perrigo,
who remained so still and dissenting by the bunkroom door. There
was a challenge in this man, rising from some obscure purpose.
And then Surratt let the pony go, lining out over a meadow still
sparkling with night's dew.</p>

<p>The sky was flawlessly blue, and a piny smell lay thick and
pleasant in this upland air. Five hundred yards beyond he reached
the trees and passed into them, following the climbing curves of
a broad trail. He looked back at this point to find what he had
expected he might find; a rider cut away from the ranch house and
trotted over the meadow at a different angle, soon
disappearing.</p>

<p>But the morning laid its ease upon Surratt and he was smiling
in a way that relieved the gray sharpness of his smoky eyes, and
his glance traveled the quiet brown corridors of these hills with
an eagerness long unknown to him. He passed the scar of a
woodcutter's camp, thereupon falling into an ancient corduroy
road. The day was turning hot, a faint drone of the forest's
minute life disturbing this shadowy stillness. A bird's scarlet
wings flashed out sudden brilliance across the trail. Impelled by
the restless vigor of his body, he kept climbing, and two hours
later came to a bald knob high on a ridge where two roads crossed
and an ancient signboard pointed northward, reading: "Carson's
Ford." He went on out into the clearing&mdash;and stopped.</p>

<p>Eastward the timber rose in continuous green folds. But
elsewhere, from this high vantage point, the hill country lay
clearly visible under the gold streamers of the sun. Far to the
west the desert rolled on beneath its own sultry
flashing&mdash;on to copper and blue horizons. Nearer, crowded
against the trees, the housetops of Morgantown made a rectangular
pattern against the tawny earth. He caught all this in one sweep,
and turned then to look directly below him. He had climbed the
southern side of the ridge and saw at his feet a valley running
away from the north slope of the ridge. Narrow and summer-yellow,
it lay between stiff-pitched hill walls, with fences setting off
its surface in square design and one long ranch house sitting in
the center of it, surrounded by outbuildings. A river cut a
black-green serpentine course down the valley's middle, crossed
by a bridge; on the road beside the river were the lifting dust
puffs of some stray rider. He considered the picture with a
definite approval, and then looked regretfully to the high east,
where the Gray Bull peaks marked the boundary of some far
country. There was a feeling in him to be on his way, to run with
the days and leave his campfires behind him, one by one, until
the rash and foot-loose mood in him turned cold. But even as he
thought of it, he remembered his obligation to Sam Torveen and
turned back to the trees.</p>

<p>A woman sat on a roan mare and waited for him, just inside the
trees. When he came up to her and stopped&mdash;because she
barred his way&mdash;he saw that her eyes, gray as his own, were
direct and strong with interest. She wore the same clothes he had
seen on her the morning before in Morgantown, a man's denim
overalls stuffed into boots, a man's wool shirt loose across a
firm and rounded chest. She held her hat across the saddle horn,
and deep-yellow hair ran faintly lawless back from features as
serene and fair as he had ever seen on a woman. Restlessness
swayed her a little.</p>

<p>He said, "Good mornin', Miss Cameron," and lifted his
stetson.</p>

<p>There was a smile lying behind the contour of her lips. "I
wondered if you'd remember me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>She said: "Well, you had your mind full of other things
yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"My name," he told her quietly, "is Buck Surratt."</p>

<p>"I was about to ask you," she murmured.</p>

<p>He said: "What is that valley down there?"</p>

<p>"It belongs to my people."</p>

<p>"What's beyond the ridge?"</p>

<p>"Another valley, where the Peyrolles run." Her head turned and
indicated the timbered masses in the higher east. "If you ride
that way you'll run into Head country. Martin Head. Bill's
father." She looked at him with a more direct interest. "Leslie
Head's father also&mdash;the boy that was shot near your campfire
the other night."</p>

<p>He said: "My campfire was out."</p>

<p>Her chin lifted with a certain resoluteness. Her voice at the
moment had the candid directness of a man. "I came here to talk
to you about that."</p>

<p>"How'd you know I'd be here?"</p>

<p>"I've been following you ever since you left Sam Torveen's
place."</p>

<p>Admiration was strong in him. She had a poise and a serenity.
Good breeding defined all the regular features of her face and
made them expressive and stirring. He kept his peace, waiting for
her to go on.</p>

<p>"Were you curious about that shot, Buck?"</p>

<p>He reached for his pipe and packed it and lighted it. He swept
a gust of good smoke into his lungs. His mind was on the
question, but he noticed the sudden gravity on her smooth cheeks.
He said finally: "I did a little looking around."</p>

<p>"You went down to the cabin?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Inside?"</p>

<p>He said, "Yes," again, very slowly.</p>

<p>Her question was rapid and concerned: "Did you find something
in that cabin, Buck? Something you put in your pocket and carried
away?"</p>

<p>Her hands, he observed, were long and slender and supple; and
she held them quietly folded on the saddle horn. A slanting beam
of sunlight reached through the trees to accent the yellow luster
in her hair; and that rich color deepened the ivory tints of her
skin. But there was something breaking through the rough man's
clothing she wore&mdash;the fire of a womanliness that touched
him and fed his senses powerfully. It played tricks with him,
unsettling the cool run of his thoughts, disturbing his ease. He
had known many women, but not the kind of a woman this tall,
graceful girl was.</p>

<p>She said: "Give it to me, Buck."</p>

<p>A slow wistfulness got into his answer. "Many people have
trusted me."</p>

<p>She straightened. Her words came back almost
impulsively&mdash;and quite direct. "I trust you, if that is what
you want me to do."</p>

<p>"What kind of a man was this Leslie Head?"</p>

<p>Her face was in the bright sunlight, but her thinking cast a
shadow across it. It wasn't fear he viewed there; it was the
memory of a thing bitter and unpleasant. She murmured: "Speak no
evil of the dead, Buck."</p>

<p>"He had enemies?"</p>

<p>"He had no friends."</p>

<p>The need to have things clear made him go on. "Did he live in
that cabin?"</p>

<p>"No. Up at the Head ranch."</p>

<p>"What would he be doing in the cabin, then&mdash;at
night?"</p>

<p>Her eyes remained on him, but she didn't speak and it was
Surratt who broke that long stillness. He relighted his pipe. His
head inclined toward the road running up to the Gray Bull peaks.
His words were faintly regretting. "For a fellow like me the
world is wide and all trails lead over the hill. I should be
riding now, for if I stay here the answer will be the same answer
as always. A man carries his fortune with him. It is like printed
instructions written on his chest, for everybody to see."</p>

<p>She said gently: "Then why do you stay?"</p>

<p>He said: "Sam Torveen did me a favor."</p>

<p>The softness, the melody of her voice was enormously stirring.
She was a woman, full of hidden riches for some man who one day
would capture the fidelity that was in her and command the high
loyalty of her heart. For that man, Surratt thought sadly, there
would be no more trails beckoning. She was the end of that man's
trail.</p>

<p>She said: "You pay your debts, don't you?"</p>

<p>"If I didn't there'd be no pride in me, and I'd be a miserable
man without pride. It is a thing my kind has to have&mdash;since
we have nothing else."</p>

<p>"I thought it was that way," she told him. "I thought so in
Morgantown, when you stood against Bill Head." She lifted her
arms and the round curves of her body changed. "Sam Torveen's all
right. You may doubt his crew, but Sam's&mdash;" She thought
about the proper word and afterwards looked at him with a small
surprise. "He's like you. You are a pair, except that he keeps
the world away with a smile&mdash;and you keep the world away
with a poker face."</p>

<p>"I like him," said Surratt.</p>

<p>"You're a pair," she repeated softly. She scanned the green
corridors of the forest with a quick glance. She dropped her
voice. "Bill Head's called for a meeting of the big ranchers
tonight, up at his house. Sam will want to know that."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him. As for the other thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said I trusted you," she interrupted. "Let it go like
that."</p>

<p>He nodded and pointed his horse back down the trail. But her
voice came abruptly after him, turning him back. She came on
until she was beside him once more. Interest was strong in her
and she studied this man with a strange emotion. His high, square
torso made an alert shape against the shadows of the trees; there
was a tough and resilient vigor all about him, a hard physical
power to his body. Discipline lay along the pressed lines of his
broad nouth, but a rash and reckless will was in his eyes,
struggling against the discipline. She saw it. His head, she
decided, would never betray him, for it was cool and
introspective. But a latent storminess, a subdued capacity for
terrific gusts of feeling, made him dangerous to others and to
himself. It was his heart that someday would betray him. These
were the things she thought in that little interval; and she
wished he might smile as Sam Torveen smiled.</p>

<p>She said: "I think your own eyes have warned you. But there
are many things about this country you don't know. And you have
made Bill Head your enemy. Bill is not a forgiving man. You ought
to remember that."</p>

<p>"I'll remember it, Miss Cameron."</p>

<p>"My name," she told him quietly, "is Judith."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I know. There was a woman in the Bible by
that name. I've often thought of her."</p>

<p>Her glance dropped and color came strongly to her cheeks. She
swung the pony with a long, graceful dip of her body and cantered
down the trail. He watched her until she vanished round a lower
bend, and then turned homeward.</p>

<p>He rode idly, the picture of her departure so vivid in his
mind that some of his customary riding vigilance deserted him.
When he reached the woodcutter's camp he pulled himself
reluctantly from his thinking and chose another route by which to
descend the slope. An increased heat lay trapped underneath these
trees, and the midday's sultry stillness was a thick substance
all around him. "The rights of other men," he said softly, "are
not my rights. When I have paid my bill to Torveen I ride away
from here." And he was wrapped in the somberness of that thought
when the reaching crash of a shot threw his pony back on its
haunches and whipped him forward in the saddle.</p>

<p>He had not been struck, but there was deep in his head the
long-planned reaction to just such a contingency as this. It came
to him now like a boxer's instinctive defense. Rolling on forward
across the saddle horn, he capsized and fell to the soft humus
soil and turned over and over until he crouched at the base of a
pine. His horse stood fast. The echoes of the shot went rolling
and ricocheting down the slope; it died out in little fragments
and eddies.</p>

<p>He lay with his head turned upslope, keening the hot twilight
of the trees. The sound had struck at him from his right side,
and therefore his eyes went to the higher ground, across the
brown roll of hummock and stump and deadfall. A mule deer came
scudding along the trail, its tail lifted, and plunged on to
remote shelter. Surratt's eyes focused on the fan-shaped
barricade made by the root system of a capsized pine; it was two
hundred yards away, on the high side of the trail. He edged away
from his protection and got to his knees and made a run for
another tree. Whipped behind it, he studied the slope again. When
he next moved&mdash;circling and bending as before&mdash;he kept
his eyes to upheaved roots. He side-stepped and reached a breast-
high deadfall. He crouched and ran with it, to the margin of the
trail. Paused for one long moment, he finally made one long dive
across the trail and dropped behind a stump. From this spot he
had a glimpse of the rear of the fallen tree's roots and saw
nothing. But there was a bowl where the roots once had been, and
in this bowl a man might crouch. Surratt drew his gun then and
broke for the adjacent pine. When he reached it he didn't stop,
but walked deliberately toward the bowl. It was a strange thing.
Perrigo sat on his heels in the bottom of this depression with a
rifle across his knees. He saw Surratt coming, but he didn't make
a further gesture.</p>

<p>Surratt walked down into it, coming against Perrigo. He was
breathing a little from his run and sweat had reached his face;
yet the stillness of Perrigo's attention, the bright and
malicious burning of the man's black eyes steadied the fresh,
strong pulse of his anger and made him alert.</p>

<p>"You've got some bad habits, Nick," he grunted. "And this is
one of them. I don't love a man that tries to get his turkey
cold."</p>

<p>Perrigo said: "Don't make that mistake, mister. If I'd wanted
to hit you I'd aimed at you."</p>

<p>"So maybe you're just trying to run a little scare into
me?"</p>

<p>Perrigo got to his feet. He put the rifle butt on his toe and
cupped a hand over the muzzle. His shortness made him tip his
head to reach Surratt's measuring inspection; it seemed to heat
the little man's wrath. He stepped backward. "I don't like
strangers. I'm tellin' you."</p>

<p>"I understood that last night," Surratt told him dryly.</p>

<p>"I don't get why you rode up there and met the Cameron girl,"
growled Perrigo. "It didn't look like an accident to me."</p>

<p>"It bothers you?"</p>

<p>Perrigo said, with a wicked calm: "A lot of things bother me.
I don't like you around. You know too much about that shot the
other night." His eyes pointed on Surratt, as bitter and
dangerous as the muzzles of a double-barreled shotgun. He whipped
out his thin question. "What do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"You got an interest in the matter?" inquired Surratt.</p>

<p>Perrigo pressed his mouth together. His dry features betrayed
a faint fear. Surratt saw that and marked it in his mind and
spoke again, somewhat more agreeable. "I'd suggest we get along,
for I'm staying on with Torveen awhile. But if we're not going to
get along I want to know that, Nick. When a man declares open
season on me I've got my own remedies. Two can play this
tune."</p>

<p>"You smell like a Head rider to me," stated Perrigo.</p>

<p>"You're dead wrong. I braced him the other day, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Men don't brace Bill Head like that," countered Perrigo.
"They don't get away with it&mdash;not unless it's a faked
scene."</p>

<p>"Do we get along or don't we?"</p>

<p>Perrigo blazed up. "The hell with you! You battered Chunk
Osbrook's face out of joint and you laid your tongue on the kid.
I'm warning you never to try that on me! I'm running that ranch
for Torveen. I tolerate no man on the place that rides in front
of me. I want that understood. If you stay, you take my orders.
You get that?"</p>

<p>"No," said Surratt.</p>

<p>A quick reflex of temper sent Perrigo's arm forward with the
muzzle of the gun. But he checked the impulse. Whiteness showed
on his cheeks and made the blackness of his eyes more
unreasoning. Violence shook him. "Then watch out for
yourself!"</p>

<p>"I wanted it clear," Surratt murmured.</p>

<p>"You got it clear," cried Perrigo.</p>

<p>He climbed from the bowl, and Surratt watched him go up to a
thick swirl of pine seedlings and pull out a horse standing
there. The little man trotted to the trail and galloped away.
Surratt went thoughtfully back to his own horse, following the
slope down. He came upon the meadow and crossed it to the ranch
house. The crew had gone, but Torveen sat in his office room,
sprawled out in a chair, somehow deeply engaged with his thoughts
and ruffled by them.</p>

<p>He said, with perceptible relief: "So you're back."</p>

<p>"Was there some doubt in your mind, Sam?"</p>

<p>Torveen shrugged his shoulders. "I couldn't blame you if you
kept right on going away from here."</p>

<p>Surratt sought his pipe and packed it. "I am to tell you that
Bill Head's called a meeting of ranchers at his place
tonight."</p>

<p>"So you met Judith." Torveen shifted his back against the
chair; he seemed at once irritable. "You get around, friend Buck.
You sure do get around."</p>

<p>"Any objections?" asked Surratt dryly.</p>

<p>Torveen lifted his green and slantwise glance. He didn't like
it. He showed his restless resentment. But then he got abruptly
up. "Oh hell, Buck, let it ride. I'm nervous as a cat. I've no
intention to rag a man like you."</p>

<p>Surratt smiled. "When did you have a good drink last?"</p>

<p>"If that helped any, I'd be drunk as a lord. So Bill's called
a meeting?"</p>

<p>"You going?"</p>

<p>Something in the question reached Torveen's sense of humor. He
grinned. "That wasn't why Judith sent the news along, Buck. No,
we won't be there. We'll be somewhere else, tonight." He drew a
long breath; he turned sober again. "I guess you'll have the
chance soon enough to find out what my hole card is. Stick with
me, Buck. This is going to be tough."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. BUSINESS AT NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">THIS was night again and the crew was in the
yard, waiting to go. A quick, cold wind flowed off the peaks;
there was no moon. Torveen stood in the doorway of his office
room, yellow light strongly shining against his roan cheeks.
Posted at the foot of the porch, Surratt could make out the man's
driving nervousness; there wasn't any fun in Torveen now and all
his motions were swift and short. He drew a last long breath of
smoke from his cigarette; he threw it out into the dust. His
voice flattened.</p>

<p>"You got any questions, Buck?"</p>

<p>"That's all right," remarked Surratt very quietly.</p>

<p>"It may be&mdash;it may not be. But, God, you're cool about
it! Well, let's go." Torveen jumped down from the porch and
traveled over to his horse, Surratt following. The group whirled
out of the yard, across the plank bridge and into the timber. At
the main road Torveen turned eastward and led his men up the
stiffening slope of the hills. They ran between the solid pines
and through a covering blackness, with only a dim steel-blue
strip of sky above. They crossed a covered bridge, booming deep
echoes out into the night. They seemed to pass along the edge of
a canyon, for Surratt could hear the rush of water down there,
even above the steady flogging rhythm of pony hoofs. His horse
was drawing for wind, but the pace kept on that way without break
during the best part of half an hour; after that they walked a
little way, surrounded by a dense blackness still&mdash;and
presently broke into the long canter, again covering the
miles.</p>

<p>They whirled suddenly out of the trees and pounded through a
narrow gap. A steady, down-scouring wind met them in the face,
with the chill of a higher elevation in it. There were a few
short and stubby second-growth pines vaguely standing along this
way, but these soon faded and they were riding across the face of
a rocky slope, the black and abrupt bulk of one of the Gray Bull
peaks running spirelike into the sky above them. Even without a
moon the bare talus fields of this area reflected a tawny radium
glow through the gloom. They plunged into a cold and damp mist
cloud and rode sightlessly through its muffling substance. But
somewhere along this stretch of road Surratt felt the grade level
off and tip downward. He knew then they had crossed the pass.</p>

<p>Without warning, they were beyond the mist. Torveen spoke a
slow order. Surratt piled into the rider ahead of him and reined
up abruptly. The crew had stopped behind Torveen, whose body
turned in the saddle, right and left. There was no talk, but the
labored breathing of the horses reached out and disturbed the
chilly dark. An opaque, triangular pattern just ahead seemed to
mark the presence of a defile.</p>

<p>A voice came stolidly from the near-by rocks: "Torveen?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>They passed into the defile and paced through it and emerged
upon what seemed to be a meadow. Alert to all this, Surratt
pulled up his chin and keened the night. And then he was relaxed
and amused, and puzzled. His nostrils told him the mystery; and
his ears told him. Another man walked vaguely into view, to
challenge as the first man had done. A white, moving mass stirred
along the earth, bleating up a confused, unmistakable sound. Here
were sheep, the smell of them strong in the wind.</p>

<p>Torveen's voice came back, pitched to a high and driving
restlessness. "You take the front, Nick. Rest of us scatter along
the edges of this band. Stay on the road all the way back until
we reach the turnoff to the upper meadow. Move along. Keep these
woollies from straying. Push 'em, but not too fast. Come on."</p>

<p>Surratt went into the meadow, sheering off from the edge of
the band. The sheep were already in motion, pressing through the
defile into the road. Torveen had disappeared and the others had
disappeared. Surratt turned and drifted. When he reached the road
he flanked the sheep and sat loosely in his saddle. Torveen's
voice came up from the rear. "Faster, Nick." Surratt saw the
blurred white stream bulge and break from the road, just ahead;
and he trotted that way and pressed the sheep back into the
straggling column. His horse didn't like the work and shied away,
but he squelched that with a few quick prods of his spur and went
idle again, amused to the point of silent laughter. At twenty-
five he had turned sheepherder, a job that all his cattle
training had taught him to despise. There was humor in this
situation for him, a kind of sardonic byplay on the swift
turnings of his own life. Yet his quick mind reached beyond the
humor of it and saw a reality that contained no reason for
laughter. He knew then why Sam Torveen had wanted help and why
Torveen had kept his silence until now.</p>

<p>Those pointed feet slicing into the pastures of cattle land
meant somebody's blood. It had always been so. Somewhere in these
hills lay a boundary line; imaginary, yet as broad and visible as
a painted stripe. Beyond that line sheep could not go in peace
and men could not herd sheep and live secure. This was a law that
stood on no statute book, but it was a law nevertheless, and one
that cattlemen would fight for more bitterly than any other. Buck
Surratt's life had been with cattle and with cattle people, and
he knew the iron steadfastness of the rule.</p>

<p>Long afterwards&mdash;deep in the midnight hours&mdash;they
reached the heavy timber and crept in scuffling confusion across
the covered bridge. The wind ran steady and cool, ruffing up the
spurious waterfall sound in the treetops. Sky's blackness
thickened, and the bleating of the sheep band ran the silence in
plaintive ways. The bell on the leading wether tinkled gently
back. Surratt was thinking that the smell of this night's traffic
would reach Morgantown before day came and that the invisible
telegraph would carry it to the remotest corner of the hills; he
was thinking that, solemnly reflective, when Penigo's voice
reached him. "We turn."</p>

<p>Surratt remained at his station, but another of the crew
galloped forward and began to curse in a slow, methodical
fashion. The pale stream bent. It vanished from the road into the
anonymous trees, going down some narrow trail. There was no room
here for straying and so Surratt dropped back into the dusty
rear, riding silently beside Torveen. Torveen said, wearily:
"What's the time?"</p>

<p>Surratt pulled out his watch and struck a match. "Near one."
The run of the hours surprised him.</p>

<p>"The longest night I'll ever put in," growled Torveen. In
twenty minutes they were through the trees, into another meadow
of those hills. The sheep faded across it and the crew came
trotting back, to collect around Torveen. He said: "Where's the
herders?"</p>

<p>A man roved up, afoot. "Here."</p>

<p>"There's a cabin across the way. That's your headquarters.
Sleep there, but don't be in it or around it by daylight. Camp
out in the woods then&mdash;and keep your rifles with you. I'll
come by after breakfast."</p>

<p>It was one of the two herders brought along with the sheep. He
said in an unemotional, faintly Irish-burred voice: "Indeed, Mr.
Torveen," and slowly dissolved into the dark. Torveen breathed a
weary order. "We can go home." He led the way straight down the
meadow and plunged into the trees, in a little while arriving at
the ranch. Surratt turned out his pony and carried his saddle to
the bunkroom. But he didn't stay there; he walked back along the
porch, hearing Torveen speaking to Perrigo in the office.</p>

<p>"I don't expect trouble tonight. But you'll ride the timber
and listen for it."</p>

<p>Perrigo came out, flicking a quick, black look at Surratt. He
went over the yard to the darkness of the corral and Surratt
heard him swearing at the horses off there. Afterwards Surratt
went into the office. Torveen sat in his chair, his body slack
and his usual cheerfulness entirely gone. The strain of the night
had broken up his roan face, it had scratched dangerously across
his nerves. The color of his glance was a pale green.</p>

<p>He said: "Well, you know my hole card now."</p>

<p>Surratt said, "Yes," imperturbably and got out his pipe. He
walked to the fireplace and tapped the bowl sharply against the
stones, and filled it and fired up his smoke. He turned to find
Torveen's glance narrowly set upon him.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'll want to know why I didn't give you a hint before
now," said Torveen. "Well, it was the idea of sheep. You're no
sheepman, anybody can see. And I figured you might ride off. I
don't like the damn blatting woollies myself."</p>

<p>Surratt drew a gust of smoke into his lungs and expelled it.
He said: "Ever been in a gunfight, Sam?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I've had some experience along that line," Surratt murmured.
"You will have some, soon enough."</p>

<p>"You get the idea here?"</p>

<p>"Sure. You're bringing sheep into cattle country. There's only
one answer to that. Hell's got no wrath like the wrath of a
stockman who sees woollies creepin' across cow territory. I see
what's happened tonight, and I see what's going to happen. What
puzzles me a little is your particular reason for bringin' this
grief onto yourself."</p>

<p>Torveen straightened. He was entirely serious, momentarily
drawn away from his worries. "Well, I'm still young, and a young
fellow has ideas&mdash;and some ambition. I've been a two-bit
cattleman ever since I took over this place from my dad. I don't
cut any great figure against the old-timers like Martin Head or
Cameron or Kersom or Hank Peyrolles. They were born and raised
with beef and they can't see anything else. They don't know
what's goin' on outside of these hills. They don't care. But I
know what's goin' on. Sheep's a crop that goes well with cattle,
and sheep are comin' in all around here. Hell, these hills are
swell for sheep. The way for a man to build himself a big ranch
is to run both. And sheep is the easiest way for a young fellow
to start."</p>

<p>"And the easiest way to lose his ranch," suggested Surratt</p>

<p>"I used to have friends in this country," commented Torveen
irritably. "Then I started talkin' sheep&mdash;and I've got no
friends now. You saw how those boys in the jail office regarded
me. Well, they knew I was stubborn and would follow my ideas. So
they scared off my crew. What I've got now is a bunch of men I'm
not proud of. But they're tough and I need that kind. Perrigo
used to ride for Head until he killed a fellow up there and had
to leave. The kid is a maverick I don't trust. He's wicked with
the gun and he's got no morals. Chunk Osbrook was fired off Ab
Cameron's place and came to me. You see the reputation I got?
Ed's the only hand of my old outfit that stuck." Torveen got up
and prowled the room with a surge of temper. "To hell with the
old-timers. We've brought in our sheep and the game's started.
We'll stand on our stack and play it strong."</p>

<p>Surratt studied this redhaired, electric man. He softly
suggested something. "You've got a good reason for wanting to
build up the ranch and swing your weight with the rest."</p>

<p>Torveen said impatiently: "There's no law against bein'
ambitious, friend Buck. I'm too young a man to be satisfied with
a two-bit spread." But he quit talking a moment, and the roan
color of his face began to surge down his neck. "Sure. I want a
big outfit and the money that goes with it and the pride of
walkin' like a man into Morgantown's bank. Ab Cameron can write
his check for six figures on a piece of butcher paper and cash it
anywhere in this state. That's what I want."</p>

<p>"The reason is clear to me," drawled Surratt.</p>

<p>It stirred Torveen's strange and moody temper. He was
recklessly angry. "You're too sharp with your eyes, Buck. You see
too much you shouldn't see in people."</p>

<p>'"You object to that?" countered Surratt quietly.</p>

<p>Torveen said at once: "I did you a favor, but I won't hold you
to it. You can ride any time."</p>

<p>Surratt removed his pipe. He laid it on the table and his tone
prowled catlike across the room's quiet "We'll consider you
didn't say that, Sam."</p>

<p>Torveen reared his head and his shoulders. A willful heat
sparkled across his green eyes. He wasn't Surratt saw, a cool
man; he was a fighter who could be baited into trouble. Yet even
as he saw this and marked it for the future, he noticed Torveen's
insistent sense of humor loosen the fighting streak along his
mouth. Torveen grinned frankly. "Think of you and me talkin' like
this! To hell with it Buck."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Surratt, and smiled again. "To hell with it.
We've got a little game of poker coming up and it won't be mild.
Maybe I can help out, for this is a game I've played before."
Then he added softly: "It will be strange to you, until you
learn. And when you learn you'll be a different man, with a
wisdom you'll wish you never had."</p>

<p>Torveen shook his head. "You're a tough one. A lot of livin'
has run over your shoulders. But it is queer to me you smile so
little and sometimes look so regrettin'." He shrugged his
shoulders and abruptly changed the subject. "You pounded the whey
out of Chunk Osbrook, and he's the kind of a boy that will mind
you and respect you for the poundin'. It is not the same with the
kid or Nick Perrigo. Maybe I don't need to tell you
this&mdash;keep your guard up with them."</p>

<p>Surratt nodded and left the office, strolling back to the
bunkroom. Perrigo was out on patrol and Ed stirred somewhere in
the yard. Osbrook had turned into bed; the kid sat at the table
playing solitaire. Pulling off his boots, Surratt saw the kid's
eyes reach him and show once more that sullen, sallow flash of
hatred, as wild and consistent as it had been the previous night.
Surratt pulled the blanket over him and shaded his eyes,
considering what he had to do. The kid was like a dog reverted to
wildness, cringing back from men but forever showing his teeth.
He needed another slash of the whip. Surratt let his hand fall
from his eyes. He rapped his order at the kid.</p>

<p>"Turn out that light, punk."</p>

<p>The kid put his elbows on the table and stared down, with a
quick breath disturbing his narrow chest. Surratt slowly reared
himself to an upright position; but he didn't have to speak
again. The kid bent over the lamp and blew out the flame.</p>

<p><br> The sheep had entered the hills without trouble, but not
without being observed. On a little bench near the pass, Judith
Cameron stood in the dark and watched the pale blur of the herd
fill the road and go bleating by. When they had disappeared she
turned away and rode rapidly through the rugged folds of this
upland country toward the Cameron ranch house. Lower down, near
the covered bridge, another spectator held himself back in the
brush and silently observed. And long after the sheep band had
turned into the upper meadow Blackjack Smith remained in his
covert and ruminated over its meaning, his big jaws biting into
his tobacco chaw.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. A MAN'S COLD WILL</h2>

<p class="first">OLD MARTIN HEAD, who was master of Crow Track,
sat on the west porch with a blanket covering his crippled legs
while watching twilight fade across the land far below him. The
lights of the Cameron ranch began to wink through a thickening
cobalt air and the whitewashed house of the Peyrolles, in the
valley beyond, slowly sank under darkness. Past the tangle of
ravine and river and steep pine slope, the distant desert lay all
blanketed in a faint silver mist. This world was at his feet, as
he wanted it to be; for Martin Head had been raised in the
Tennessee mountains and there was that strong instinct in him
against low lands.</p>

<p>Just before the final dark closed in, Old Martin saw riders
converge on the Cameron valley road and join and turn up toward
Crow Track. He swung his shoulders a little, calling for his son.
Bill Head came out and stood beside his father, saying
nothing.</p>

<p>"Company's coming," said Martin. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I asked 'em," explained Bill Head. "That all right?"</p>

<p>Martin Head rolled back against the chair. Silence enveloped
him and hid away his feelings and his thoughts. It did more than
that&mdash;it definitely pushed his son away from any hope of
affection. He gripped a cigar between his teeth, and above his
high cheekbones two powerful eyes narrowed against the night with
a kind of slit, Mongol passivity. A cropped black beard, like
General Grant's, concealed all expression; he was engrossed in
this colossal, brooding indifference when his neighbors rode up
this hill.</p>

<p>They hailed him and came to the porch&mdash;Cameron and Dutch
Kersom and Hank Peyrolles and Henry Ranier. Martin Head had known
these men for a good many years. Yet he said, "Good evening,
gentlemen," with the inflexible, courteous tone he used for all
men of whatever degree. Bill Head came forward then and got
behind the chair and lifted it and carried his father into the
living room. He put the chair beside the fireplace and stood
back, not exerted enough to show it by deeper breathing. The
visitors followed. Dutch Kersom, himself a burly man, spoke with
a touch of admiration.</p>

<p>"You're a powerful brute, Bill."</p>

<p>Martin Head said, not looking at his son: "The bottle, Bill,
and the glasses." Bill Head turned out of the room, leaving
behind him stillness that wasn't comfortable. Pine knots on the
fireplace hearth exploded, and the light swelled and rippled
across the low ceiling, against the whitewashed walls. Out in the
kitchen men were talking, and dishes clattered. Above the
fireplace a cavalry carbine and a saber with a heavily ornamented
hilt hung half crossed. Below the weapons was a lithograph of
General Jeb Stuart, under whom Old Martin had ridden during the
rebellion. There were no other pictures in the room, which was a
measure of Martin Head's mind. Beauty Stuart was a bright memory
to him and never would cease to be; and the Southern cause was
still a thing Old Martin believed in with the hard and full
partisanship of his nature. But of this he never spoke; for he
had come to a period of life in which the spoken word could not
cover all that he felt and remembered; and so, contemptuous of
the paleness of sound against the bitter, turbulent brightness of
things he carried in his head, he remained still. He had lost a
son in the rebellion; and afterwards had created two sons to
carry his name. His wife was dead and now one of his later sons
was dead.</p>

<p>Bill Head returned with the whisky; and poured a drink for Old
Martin, who waited until the rest had served themselves. He said
then: "My son Leslie's funeral will be in Morgantown tomorrow.
But do not bother to come. A dead man is dead, and the living
have too much to do to waste time on sentimental ceremonies."</p>

<p>All, save Ab Cameron, downed the drink. Ab Cameron was fifty-
five, but an old man in this rough country; he had a white and
narrow and sad face, with a long mustache stained a little on the
edges from tobacco; his hands were like those of a scholar, blue
veins showing through transparent skin. His voice was soft, it
was unassuming.</p>

<p>"It is a sad thing, Martin. God rest his soul."</p>

<p>But Martin Head's tone ran blunt and growling through the
room. "He lived in his own fashion&mdash;and died that way. In
bed, with a bullet through his chest and his own gun belt hangin'
on a peg, the other side of the shanty. No doubt he was thinkin'
of a woman when he died, as he was always doing."</p>

<p>Bill Head said resentfully: "He was your son."</p>

<p>"I keep rememberin' that," growled Old Martin. "He was my son,
but he was a worthless man."</p>

<p>The silence grew grayer. Peyrolles, who had a little more
feeling for the amenities than the rest of them, changed the
subject. "You wanted to see us, Martin?"</p>

<p>Old Martin's shoulders shrugged. "My son did. He seems to be
running this show." He leaned back in the chair and wrapped his
massive silence around him like a blanket.</p>

<p>Bill Head stepped forward, as though he wanted to free himself
from the wide shadow his father made across that room. His body
was a huge, straight column in the lamplight; color flushed his
fair skin and a stubbornness lay along the forward throw of his
chin, along the very broad lips. His eyes were light&mdash;and at
this moment rather calculating as he faced these older
owners.</p>

<p>"Ranier and I went up to Sam Torveen's last night to take this
Surratt back to Morgantown. Torveen made an issue out of it. I
didn't like the idea of a fight right there on his own doorstep,
so we didn't get Surratt That gives you an idea of Sam's frame of
mind."</p>

<p>A little interval of absorbed reflection came to the room.
Peyrolles smiled then in a tight, acid way. "The boy," he
murmured, "wants to be tough with us, does he? Well, Sam
Torveen's dad was a friend of mine, and I rode Sam in my saddle
when he was a kid a good many times. But I do not take presumin'
ways from any man, let alone this boy."</p>

<p>Dutch Kersom cocked his bullet-round head; not a great deal of
emotion got through that swarthy skin. "What's he stickin' up for
this newcomer Surratt for, I want to know?"</p>

<p>"Just one more maverick to add to that wild bunch he's got,"
said Peyrolles.</p>

<p>Ab Cameron's talk was uncertain. "I always used to like Sam. I
always thought well of his family. As for the men he's got in his
crew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They stink, for a fact I say," stated Dutch Kersom.</p>

<p>"Certainly," agreed Bill Head. His eyes weighed these people
and he played their tempers with a dexterity born of
understanding. "He needs them for the sheep he's bringing
in."</p>

<p>"Sheep?" said Ab Cameron. "It's all talk. The lad wouldn't try
it."</p>

<p>"You don't know Sam," remarked Bill Head.</p>

<p>Sheriff Ranier had remained thus far in the backgrounds He
spoke now. "Sam's stubborn. He don't change his mind."</p>

<p>"We will change friend Sam's mind," murmured Peyrolles, still
showing that faint streak of acid smiling.</p>

<p>"If he tries it," added Dutch Kersom, unemotionally.</p>

<p>"He's got the sheep all right," said Bill Head, driving the
information home in a quick tone. "They're up around the peaks,
waiting to come in."</p>

<p>"Where?" jerked out Peyrolles.</p>

<p>"I can't find out. They've got a herder posted on the peak
with a rifle and good eyesight. I don't want to get my men shot
up. Not yet."</p>

<p>It was as though the wind swung around from west to east. The
temperature of this room seemed to drop, and the air to become
cold and furious. These men had been idly discussing a
possibility they didn't believe would happen. Now they were faced
with it, and now they changed with the suddenness of their kind.
Bill Head knew it and saw it, and was pleased. They were good
men, large-handed and proud of their oral word, loving laughter
and freedom; they could curse and storm and fight passionately
when their authority was questioned, but they could be kind when
that had passed. Yet upon this one subject they had an adamant
singularity. A man who ran sheep became an enemy, no matter how
long he had been a friend; an enemy beyond the bounds of decency
or scruples. It was a passionate belief, so imbedded in them as
to be like a religious conviction&mdash;and their sense of its
rightness made them merciless. A man who ran sheep flew in the
face of clear warning, and he had no pity and no generosity
coming to him. Peyrolles bent in his chair, his desires impetuous
and glittering in his eyes; Dutch Kersom was stolid, as always,
yet Bill Head knew that this man's mind had locked out Torveen
forever. Ab Cameron bowed his pale, benignant face. He spoke in a
grieving way. "I am sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>"Sorry?" challenged Bill Head&mdash;and flung his willful
glance on Cameron.</p>

<p>"We will send an outfit up there and find the sheep," murmured
Peyrolles. "We will destroy them."</p>

<p>Sheriff Ranier said anxiously: "What do you think,
Martin?"</p>

<p>But Martin Head looked upon them with a fixed, hooded stare;
and not the power of all their eyes could detect his sentiments.
He said briefly: "It is my son's show."</p>

<p>A ranch hand came to the door and said laconically: "Man here
wants to see you, Bill."</p>

<p>Bill Head wheeled out of the room at a long stride. There was
a rider near the corner of the porch. He made a formless,
topheavy shape on the pony, and the darkness of the night covered
his identity. But when he spoke to Bill Head the low, vast roll
of his voice betrayed him.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you to come here," said Bill Head
irritably.</p>

<p>"Sheep's started in," said Blackjack Smith. "You wanted to
know that, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On the pass road."</p>

<p>Bill Head turned back into the house. He said: "The sheep are
coming in."</p>

<p>Peyrolles was out of his chair in a single motion. The angular
frame of the man bent and turned. "We'll stop that, now."</p>

<p>Bill Head said sharply: "Wait a minute," and checked Peyrolles
with a shake of his head. "We don't do it that way. Torveen's
primed for trouble tonight. He'll be waiting for it. No. Let him
bring his sheep in. There's plenty of other nights to come. We'll
do this in our own way."</p>

<p>Peyrolles' smile was a bright, sharp thing. "You got an idea,
Bill?"</p>

<p>Bill Head said: "When I call on you fellows for help I want to
know I'll get it."</p>

<p>"You'll get it," said Dutch Kersom. They all rose and stood a
moment; and they seemed to await Martin Head's final word. But he
said, "Good night, gentlemen," and nothing more, and then they
left the room. Bill Head went to the porch and stood there until
they had ridden away. Afterwards he came back into the room. He
rolled himself a cigarette and lighted it&mdash;and waited.</p>

<p>"Bill," said Old Martin, growling out his anger, "only a fool
would take a posse to Torveen's to get a man&mdash;and go away
without the man."</p>

<p>Bill Head's pink face showed a resenting defensiveness. He was
not quite easy in the presence of his father. He said: "I told
you Sam had fixed himself up to make a fight of it. Why throw
lead in his own yard?"</p>

<p>"You've been taught better," grunted Old Martin. "Never start
a play you can't go through with. Either you should have known
better than to have gone up there, or else you ought to have
taken this Surratt, regardless. So you made two
mistakes&mdash;going there underestimating Sam Torveen, and going
away with your hands empty. You backed down."</p>

<p>Bill Head flushed. He was restless and angry. "Never mind.
I'll take that Surratt when I want him."</p>

<p>"Who's this Surratt?"</p>

<p>"A stranger driftin' through the hills."</p>

<p>Martin rolled his shoulders. "It wasn't a stranger that killed
Leslie. Somebody did that who knew Les too well. Surratt's clear
of that."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"Then," said Old Martin bluntly, "what you want him for?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to have him strengthen Sam Torveen's hand
any."</p>

<p>Old Martin judged his son with a cold, black glance. There was
something unsparing in this man that would not relent, not even
for his son. "You're a schemin' man," he said at last. "I do not
trust your word. I have been harsh in my time and I've done
things I regret now. But they were honest mistakes. You're not
honest, Bill. I sit here tonight and listen to you speak about
sheep, and all the while you are not thinkin' about sheep but
about Sam Torveen whom you hate."</p>

<p>"One reason or another," said Bill Head coolly; "I'm after Sam
Torveen."</p>

<p>Old Martin's hands gripped the chair arms. He pushed himself
forward and let the full blast of his temper thunder out. "If
you've got a quarrel with the man, go out and settle it&mdash;but
don't lie about your reasons! God damn a man who's
deceitful!"</p>

<p>His voice rushed along the walls and filled the room
massively&mdash;and died to a creeping silence. Bill Head stared
at the floor with a still strain. He said, very quietly; "Yes
sir. You want me to carry you upstairs now?"</p>

<p>Old Martin remained crouched in the chair, inspecting his son
in that bitter, friendless way. "It is my opinion that Nick
Perrigo shot Les. I knew Perrigo well. A tricky little scoundrel
who worked for me long enough to hate all Heads, and Les in
particular. The man never forgot an injury and never forgave one.
If I had two sound legs I'd go find Nick and I'd kill him. Since
I cannot do it, you will do that for me."</p>

<p>Bill Head pulled up his chin and stared. "I'm to personally do
that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Les was no good," stated Old Martin. "But he had our name and
we'll see that it is protected. There's our answer to the hills.
You go get Nick Perrigo." Then he added with a dismal grimness:
"They are not Christian reasons, Bill, but they're honest
ones."</p>

<p>"If..." began Bill Head; and stopped. A woman's voice come
through the door. "Dad's gone home?" And afterwards Judith
Cameron walked in. She crossed the room, smiling at Old Martin,
and bent down and kissed him on a cheek. Old Martin sat
motionless, his hands still gripping the arms of the chair. He
was a seldom-smiling man, but when she drew back, laughing a
little at his stony manner, his eyes softened and were pleased.
He said, more brusque than usual: "Ab's gone. A girl like you,
Judith, has got no business rammin' around these hills at night
alone. Ride home with her, Bill."</p>

<p>Judith looked at Bill thoughtfully. She said: "Is he supposed
to be protection, Martin?"</p>

<p>Old Martin scowled at his son. "If he turns bad on you,
Judith, use a gun."</p>

<p>Judith walked out with Bill Head following. Martin Head lifted
his voice again and yelled: "Pokey!" A thin, time-whipped little
man came instantly in and stood in front of Martin Head, his
countenance faithful and sly and sad.</p>

<p>"Who rode up here with news for Bill?"</p>

<p>"Blackjack Smith."</p>

<p>Old Martin's throat growled. "We're havin' fine company on the
ranch these days, Pokey. Turn me around&mdash;and get out."</p>

<p>Pokey swung the chair toward the fire and left at a silent
shuffle; and took up a kind of sentry duty on the porch. Martin
Head leaned back against the chair, with his eyes on the
lithograph of Jeb Stuart. He spoke to Stuart, across time, as an
equal to an equal.</p>

<p>"There ain't as much honor and courage in the world as there
used to be, Beauty. And the fun is gone. You died young, which
was proper. It's hell to be old."</p>

<p>Judith and Bill Head went down the trail in silence until they
came to a meadow dimly shining in the night. Bill rode abreast
her at this place. He was disgruntled and irritated. "Was that
the sort of thing to say to the old man?"</p>

<p>"About your dependability, Bill? Well..."</p>

<p>"Judith," he burst out, "treat a man a little kinder!"</p>

<p>"You get kindness," she told him softly, "by being kind."</p>

<p>"You can cut the heart out of a fellow with your words," he
said, vehemently. "Good God, what do I have to do if I want a
little encouragement from you? Don't hold me off like that!"</p>

<p>Her talk was candid and hurting. "You don't like being held
off, do you, Bill? You like things all your own way. If a dog
doesn't come when you whistle, you whip him. If a woman doesn't
smile, you want to whip her."</p>

<p>He pulled in his horse and reached over to catch her reins.
"Listen, Judith. No man's going to stand against me, as far as
you're concerned. Maybe I'm not sentimental enough for your
fancy. But I can fight for what I want."</p>

<p>"You can use the whip," she retorted.</p>

<p>He spurred his pony over and caught her before she could lift
an arm. His gloved hand scraped across her face and pulled it
around; and he kissed her with a sudden brutality and let her go.
Her other arm came up then and she slashed him across the head
with her crop. His hat fell off and his pony fiddled away. He
started to swing toward her again, his breathing heavy and fast
in the quietness of the hillside. Her voice stopped him
definitely. "Quit it, Bill, or I'll follow your Dad's
advice."</p>

<p>Rage raked his voice: "What are you prowling around here at
night for?"</p>

<p>"I like to ride at night."</p>

<p>He said, wickedly: "The habit will get you in trouble, Judith.
Where were you the other night when Les was shot?"</p>

<p>She flung her horse at him and her crop smashed him violently
on the face again. And then, without speaking, she galloped down
the meadow and disappeared in the lower timber. He didn't follow;
he remained there in the meadow, holding a hand across his
stinging cheeks, turned mad by his injuries.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. AFFAIR AT MORGANTOWN</h2>

<p class="first">HUGHIE GRANT, who was a Crow Track rider, came
up the road from Morgantown and saw Nick Perrigo loitering there
at the Torveen gateway. Hughie Grant made a sweeping turn on his
horse and came to a stop; he had a big, weathered body and an
impressive coal-black mustache&mdash;and he rolled freely in the
saddle. He said, genially: "There's a fellow that used to work
for the Heads. Nick, I never liked you and you never liked me.
For a fact, nobody likes you. I'd guess you don't even like
yourself."</p>

<p>"Keep goin', Hughie," Perrigo said.</p>

<p>"You own this road?" suggested Hughie Grant, and reached into
his hip pocket. He hauled out a flat pint whisky bottle, holding
it up to the afternoon sun to measure its contents. He uncorked
it with his teeth and transferred the cork to his hand while he
downed a drink. He shuddered faintly and corked the bottle. But a
touch of magnanimity appeared to get possession of him then. He
urged his horse toward Perrigo and inclined the bottle.</p>

<p>"Have a little taste of the hair of this dog."</p>

<p>Perrigo said instantly: "No." Yet his eyes clung to the
bottle, and his hands moved and stopped.</p>

<p>"Hell with you, Perrigo. Proud, or something? Well, you never
could handle liquor anyhow."</p>

<p>Perrigo suddenly grunted, "Give me that," and seized the
bottle. He flung his head back, drinking with a sudden gusty
thirst. Hughie Grant's eyes narrowed and contained a shrewdness
that didn't belong to a drunken man. He said feebly: "Leave some
of that."</p>

<p>Perrigo lowered the bottle. He held it flattened against his
hand, darkly glowering over it. He stood this way, thin and
waiting and morose.</p>

<p>"You sure was dry," grumbled Hughie Grant.</p>

<p>"Ain't drank for six months, Hughie."</p>

<p>"Prohibition," said Hughie in disgust. "Well, give me my
bottle."</p>

<p>Perrigo tipped the bottle again quickly and drained it and
handed it back. A little flush of blood brightened the man's
honed cheeks. He scanned Hughie Grant angrily. "Why in God's name
did you come draggin' that bottle past me for?"</p>

<p>"It's my regret," stated Hughie Grant, "not yours.
Empty&mdash;damnation!" He flung the bottle over into the trees
and sat with his shoulders drooping and his eyes studying his
palms as they lay folded on the saddle horn. He waited a little
while; then looked at Perrigo and came to a decision.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blasted if I ride home on an empty stomach. Next
time, Nick, don't ask me any drink out of my bottle. I'm goin'
back to town for another one." He wheeled his horse down the
road. Ten yards away he turned. "You comin'?"</p>

<p>"For a drink?"</p>

<p>"What else was I talkin' about?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Perrigo. He went back into the trees and
got on his horse and came out beside Hughie Grant. They trotted
toward Morgantown, Perrigo dismally scowling.</p>

<p>"That shows you," pointed out Hughie Grant. "Six months
without a drink ain't good for anybody. Why stunt your frame like
that?"</p>

<p>"Booze," said Nick Perrigo in sultry disgust, "is my poison."
Instantly he hauled up to a stop. "You know that, Hughie. What're
we going to town for?"</p>

<p>Hughie Grant didn't look back and he didn't stop. He said:
"Don't bother me. On mature thought, maybe you hadn't ought to
come. Old Martin's there and so's Bill Head and the bunch."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Nick Perrigo, and came on at a rush.</p>

<p>"We just got through buryin' Les Head," reflected Hughie Grant
"I don't like that kind of work."</p>

<p>"You may be buryin' another," said Nick Perrigo, and all his
little features were violent and inflamed. "I've got no use for a
Head, nor for any Head rider."</p>

<p>"I'm one," pointed out Hughie Grant equably.</p>

<p>"What of it?" gritted Perrigo.</p>

<p>Hughie Grant's reply was summer-mild. "Nothin'. We was talkin'
about a drink wasn't we?"</p>

<p>So they trotted down the hill and rounded into Morgantown's
main street. Perrigo stiffened in his saddle and his free arm
began to swing forward and back, brushing his gunbelt at each
passing. Sunlight was a low flash in the west, and bright purple
currents of twilight flowed along Morgantown's south walk and
touched the men scattered there. Ranier loitered at the jail
office beside Old Martin Head's wheel chair. Nick Perrigo passed
him without a side glance; and he didn't turn his eyes at the
hotel where Bill Head stood in idleness. Crow Track riders
cruised this street and a group of them were at the doors of the
Elkhorn saloon. Perrigo wheeled in here and dismounted, a scarlet
flush crawling down his narrow neck. He left his horse at the
rack and went around the rack and stalked through the Crow Track
riders sightlessly, into the saloon. Hughie Grant followed him to
the bar. A man immediately lifted his bottle and slid it along
the bar, moving away from Perrigo. The humming thickness of talk
in here dropped definitely, and other men's faces wheeled in the
shadows of the place and watched Perrigo with an indrawing
interest.</p>

<p>Perrigo said to the bartender: "It'll be rye," and stared at
himself in the backbar's shining mirror; something in that
whipped and peaked reflection seemed to lift the hackles on his
neck. His eyes turned narrow and red. When the bartender slid
bottle and glasses down to him he helped himself to a drink and
hooked both arms on the bar's edge and lowered his face&mdash;and
stood that way.</p>

<p>Hughie Grant abruptly clapped his hands to his chest. He said:
"Now where's my money?" and turned to leave. Perrigo's hand
instantly shot out and seized Hughie Grant by the arm.</p>

<p>"Where you going?" demanded Perrigo.</p>

<p>"I'll be back," said Hughie Grant very softly.</p>

<p>Perrigo stared at him unrelentingly; and the room's silence
grew. Afterwards Perrigo released his grip. "You damn right you
will, Hughie. Or I'll come and find you. I don't drink
alone."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hughie Grant, and left the saloon rapidly. He
passed the Head riders and winked at them, and cut across to
where Bill Head was. He took off his hat and a fresh, full sweat
curled down his forehead. He wasn't drunk and never had been. He
let out a tremendous sigh, then spoke to Bill Head. "There's your
man, Bill. But, listen. I never do that again."</p>

<p>Back in the saloon Neal Irish, who ran the poker game,
suddenly laid down his cards. He said to the players, very
quietly: "Cash in your chips, gentlemen. Play is over for a
while."</p>

<p><br> Buck Surratt was in the Torveen yard with his back
propped up against a corral, enjoying the sunset, when Annette
Carvel came out of the trees at a rapid canter. She crossed the
yard to him and jumped from the saddle and took a pose of
interest there. He pushed himself to his feet then, saying
casually: "Hello."</p>

<p>Her hands rose in an expressive way to touch her hair and
sweep it back from the graphic outline of her face. Her lips
changed to a faint smiling; her shoulders straightened and the
light of her eyes became direct and personal, as he had noticed
it to be in Morgantown two days ago. He didn't quite understand
the frankness of that silence, nor could he perceive the change
that occurred in her. But the change was there, for this was a
girl sensitive and pliable to the ways of men; and her eyes saw
that Surratt was young and tall and that he smiled back.</p>

<p>She said: "Is Sam here?"</p>

<p>"Everybody's gone but me."</p>

<p>She speculated on him, her interest very strong. Against the
whiteness of her skin her lips made a full, soft, crimson
contrast. "My name," she said finally, "is Annette Carvel. My
mother and I run the dressmaking shop in town. You're Buck
Surratt, the new man."</p>

<p>He said, "Yes," and let it go like that, but her personality
came warmly across the space to disturb him. Her voice, when she
spoke again, dropped to a faintly husky note, approving and
gently inviting.</p>

<p>"You're very brave to stand against Bill Head."</p>

<p>He didn't answer, and he saw immediately how responsive that
pretty face was to the least change in her mind. Her lips moved,
they showed disappointment Her shoulders lifted. "Well," she
said, "then you'll have to do, I guess. Nick Perrigo's in the
Elkhorn saloon, drunk as a fool, and all the Head crowd is there.
They hate him, you know."</p>

<p>He said, "Thanks," gravely. She waited a little longer, her
expression hopeful and pleasing in the sudden fall of twilight.
Her breasts stirred to the lift and fall of her breath. She
wheeled away with a quick impatience and swung up to her saddle,
saying: "Sam would want to know about that. But if you're
alone..." Then she had a long, straight smile for him. "There's
always a dance in town on Saturday nights, Buck." Unaccountably
she laughed at him and galloped down the meadow, into the
trees.</p>

<p>Surratt tried another match on his pipe. The light ran along
the gravity of his cheeks and died, and he stood in the forming
twilight and thought of Annette Carvel's hands because they were,
to him, important. But it was a thought that faded swiftly into
the back of his head where so many other things were stored. He
turned to the bunkroom for his saddle and came out and caught up
his horse. When he was ready to ride he sat in the saddle a
moment, considering Nick Perrigo brought to bay in the Elkhorn
saloon. It was a picture very clear. Out of his memory he could
produce other pictures like this, the details blurred by
dissimilarity, but the central scenes all the same, all making
this dark pattern of a man backed up against a wall and other men
starkly waiting for him. Nothing changed. He went down the meadow
and through the trees and got to the road. Turning toward
Morgantown he had but one question in his mind: How had so wary a
hand as Nick Perrigo gotten into the trap?</p>

<p>When he reached Morgantown twilight had faded into another
black night, with a low young moon on the horizon shedding no
glow. The house lamps of the town were flushing through window
and door, laying yellow hurdles across the dusty street; men
strolled indolently through these alternate patches of light and
dark and made stray outlines in the deeper shadows, their talk
coming to him in murmuring eddies of vague sound. This was supper
hour, the hour of peace; but because the undertones of life were
always strong to him, he could feel the creep of suspense on this
street. He trotted on and curled into the hitch rack, the
undertow of his arrival leaving a lively wake behind. A few
riders stood outside of the Elkhorn's doorway and he knew, by the
way they turned, that he was identified. He walked by them, put
his shoulders to the doors and passed inside.</p>

<p>Before the doors had swung behind him he heard a man out there
say: "Go get Bill Head." The tone of it was eager, it was wicked;
and Surratt's lips thinned and were remotely touched by a smile.
He stopped here, undiscovered for a moment, to absorb the scene
before him.</p>

<p>He had not been wrong. Under the strong full light of the
saloon's bracket lamps was a scene that had nothing new in it.
Men stood loosely together in this room, faced toward the back
end of the place. There were thirty or more of them, all waiting
out the silence. Looking past them, over their shoulders, he saw
Nick Perrigo backed against the wall. Perrigo's insubstantial
body swayed from side to side, and the weight of his drawn and
lifted gun seemed to tip him forward. He stared at the crowd, but
it was the blurred, unrecognizing stare of a man blind drunk. His
voice came across the room, thick and past caring.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, why don't you come at me?"</p>

<p>The Elkhorn's bartender, standing with his hands flattened
against the bar, caught Surratt in the corner of his eyes and
turned to look fully; and opened and closed his mouth without
sound. Surratt spoke in a tone strong enough to carry across the
shoulders of this crowd to Nick Perrigo.</p>

<p>"You want to go back to the ranch, Nick?"</p>

<p>A ripple ran through that mass; and all those dark and eager
and partisan faces veered on him. Perrigo said:</p>

<p>"Who's talkin'?"</p>

<p>The crowd swayed. A little lane opened and a motion of defense
carried these men back toward the walls. He faced Perrigo down
the lane and saw Perrigo's bitter red eyes stare and find
nothing. Perrigo said again, plaintively:</p>

<p>"Who's talkin'?"</p>

<p>"Surratt. You want to go home?"</p>

<p>"Surratt," breathed Perrigo. "Get me out of here." And then he
swayed from the wall, all his will exhausted, and fell face down
on the floor.</p>

<p>The glow of the lamps sharpened everything and Surratt saw his
surroundings with a fatal clarity. The room was long and narrow,
the bar on one side and a row of poker tables on the other. For a
moment the Crow Track men remained as they had been, recoiled
from that little lane down which Surratt had his view of Nick
Perrigo. And then an unspoken thought stirred them, and the lane
closed up and Nick Perrigo was imprisoned behind the solid wall
they made.He heard men coming rapidly along the walk outside. He
heard their voices rising, suppressed and excited. But in here
the silence grew insufferably thin. He shook his shoulders a
little. His hand touched the butt of his gun and he said gently:
"I'm taking Nick home, boys," and he lifted his gun and moved
forward, his lips still pressed into that remote, constant
smile.</p>

<p>It was the weight of their numbers that held them uncertain
during this moment. Men in a mass always waited for the voice of
a leader to start them, for a sudden motion or a swift word to
start them. This was something the years had taught him and it
guided him coolly across the room to the solid edges of the
crowd. The moments were ticking on, and the stillness here was
ready to ignite and explode. He came against a man, not stopping
and not speaking. But the muzzle of his gun was against the man
and so was the full weight of his eyes. It was a trick, this
piling up of threat against one individual in a mob. Singled out
thus, the man wheeled and made a little break in the solid wall.
Surratt walked into it slowly; he pushed on and set all his will
against the next man. He had made a hole. But a moment later the
shifting pressure veered around him and the hole closed up and he
was locked solid within the Crow Track crew.</p>

<p>Somebody said angrily from the background: "What are you fools
doin' over there? Get at him!"</p>

<p>The weight of that purpose crushed against him at once. A man
in front threw his chest into Surratt and reached up with his
hands. Surratt smashed him over the head with the gun, knocked
him back, and shouldered on. Fury began to boil through the room,
talk rose gutturally. The fellow in the background yelled again.
"Get at him&mdash;get at him!" A hand reached out from Surratt's
left side and tore at his neck; he broke away from it and threw
his knee into a Head rider, who cried and struck him in the face.
Hands groped for him once more and this mob surged at him, and
men struggled against other men and were blocked by their own
closeness. Surratt lowered his head; he plunged on. He slashed
his gun barrel across a countenance so white and hating as to be
ghostly&mdash;he saw that face tip and drop. He got all his
strength together and braced his feet and whirled a complete
circle, beating them away. He felt the hot blast of their
breathing and the slanting blows they landed on his back. His
shirt was caught and torn, and he was caught around the neck
again, from behind. But he didn't stop; he squatted and bucked
his way ahead, carrying the man with him. He shook that
encircling arm free&mdash;and slugged a Crow Track rider on the
temples and slammed him aside. The back wall of the saloon was
before him. He jumped at it and put his shoulders to it&mdash;and
so faced them. Nick Perrigo was at his feet.</p>

<p>His gun held them off a moment, his lips holding that same
thin laughter; he reached deep into his lungs for the wind he had
to have. They were growling at him like wild dogs. The man by the
bar still kept up his insistent yelling, but those directly
facing him looked at the point of his gun and stood uneasy and
sullen and watchful. He dropped to his knees and got one hand
around Nick Perrigo's waist. He pulled the man half upright and
threw him over a shoulder&mdash;and stood erect with a hard
wrench of his muscles.</p>

<p>He remained like this, considering the saloon door thirty feet
yonder&mdash;with that crowd waiting stubbornly, savagely for him
to start back. Somebody suddenly jumped to the top of the bar and
reached out with his hand and killed the lights there; somebody
else ran along the opposite side of the room to repeat that
gesture and to at once turn the room dim and smoky. There was but
one lamp left burning, this directly behind Surratt. He laughed
at them then&mdash;openly&mdash;and swung about and lifted the
lamp from its holder. He yelled: "Fire!" and flung the lamp
straight into the heart of the crowd.</p>

<p>Glass smashed over the floor, the spilled kerosene exploded
into a pale flame that rushed up a man's oil-soaked coat. The man
let out a high-pitched yell and wheeled and slashed his way
through the crowd. A quick fire flashed and smoked in the sawdust
scattered along the boards, filling the room with its acrid
odors. This Crow Track crew was touched by a sudden terrible fear
and stampeded for the lone doorway. One rider alone pushed
through the crowd and tried to extinguish the fire spreading out
from the broken lamp. The uneasy, shuttering blackness of this
room was all at once filled with a savage, senseless grunting as
this Crow Track crew slugged its way toward the door. Surratt ran
straight for the thin glow of that doorway, ramming into the
stormy swirl of all those beating bodies. Tables fell and were
smashed. Somebody broke a window and jumped through; the swinging
doors were clawed down. The weight of that unreason squeezed
against Surratt. He bucked his way ahead, beaten by blind blows;
he stepped on a man who reached up and grabbed his legs. He had
to kick his way free. The pressure around the doorway was like
the pressure of a vice, and Perrigo's body put a dead weight on
his shoulders; and then the fierce drive of men at his rear shot
him through the doorway. He ran around the hitch rack and reached
the street&mdash;and stopped there.</p>

<p>The lights of the hotel and the adjoining stores laid a bright
spot in the dust. He was caught here, exposed and surrounded. The
up-running Crow Track crew saw him and wheeled to make a ring
that closed him in&mdash;and on the hotel porch Bill Head stood
and looked at him with a stubborn triumph.</p>

<p>"Put Perrigo down," Bill Head ordered. "You've had all your
fun."</p>

<p>It was a scene again, like other scenes on the back trail.
Darkness all about, and here one bright flood of light. Men were
watching him, the aroused instinct to kill stained somberly and
hungrily on their cheeks. There was a cripple in a wheel chair
next to Bill Head, an old man with a black beard and a black
glance cutting into him. That one bent from his chair and gripped
his hands on its arms, as though he wanted to throw his power
into the street against Surratt.</p>

<p>"Drop him," repeated Bill Head.</p>

<p>Blood dripped along Surratt's lips. The wild fury of the
moment ripped through him and recklessness had its way with his
cheeks, strengthening the smile so thin and permanent on his
lips.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "I'll finish this job."</p>

<p>Bill Head cried: "You want to die, you damned fool?"</p>

<p>There was a weight in Surratt's fist. His gun still hung
there. He threw Perrigo more securely over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"It's an even break," he said. "You want to try?"</p>

<p>"Grandstand stuff!" breathed Bill Head. He made a stiff and
enormous shadow in this yellow light He didn't move; the bully
cast of his features never changed. "Move up behind him,
boys&mdash;and get the gun."</p>

<p>"Is it the lamplight that makes you look so yellow?" murmured
Buck Surratt. The rage in him was enormous, without reason. But
he stood here and was trapped. He knew it. The crippled man
suddenly slapped both of his hands on the wheel chair and lay
back and seemed to grow furious behind his beard. Bill Head
looked down at the cripple, with a deepening of ruddy color.
Surratt heard him speak hotly to the cripple. "I play this hand
my own way, sir."</p>

<p>But there was interruption here. The circle broke and the
blocky shape of the marshal drove through. Bolderbuck came up to
Surratt. His face was without imagination, without the hint of
friendliness or anger. He ranged himself beside Surratt. He said,
clear enough for the street to hear: "Put him on his horse and
pack him home, son."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," challenged Bill Head. "I'm running this."</p>

<p>Bolderbuck turned in a manner that was like the settling of a
great weight. His voice remained wholly unmoved, it continued its
stubborn and polite run. "I handle the law in this particular
town, Mr. Head. Take your man and go, Surratt."</p>

<p>But a man cried out instantly from the ranks of the
surrounding Crow Track outfit: "No you don't, Mary Ann!"</p>

<p>Bolderbuck wheeled his square body again and faced the sound.
He said placidly: "I'll kill the one that draws a gun."</p>

<p>Surratt looked at Bolderbuck. He shook his head. "I'll
apologize for misjudgin' you," and carried Nick Perrigo across
the street to the horses. The crowd there gave sullenly; but it
gave. He threw Perrigo across his saddle and got up and
readjusted the little man on his knees crosswise like a bag of
flour. He caught the reins of Perrigo's horse and turned up the
street, bearing one burden and leading another. But he halted a
moment, the thin laughter growing stronger along his lips. He saw
Bolderbuck implacably holding that crowd still; he saw Bill Head
standing on the walk with a bilked rage flushing his big,
handsome face; and he saw the obscure glance of the cripple
shooting out at him from beneath those shaggy brows. It was the
cripple he remembered as he trotted up the street and left
Morgantown behind.</p>

<p>Bolderbuck held his position&mdash;and thus held the crowd in
place&mdash;until the echo of Surratt's pony vanished from the
night. He turned after that and walked through the circle,
ignoring it, and went on to the jail office. He sat down in a
chair and got out his pipe; and was smoking it in ruminative
silence, with his thick hands laced across his belly, when
Sheriff Ranier came quickly in and shut the door.</p>

<p>Ranier stared at Bolderbuck. "Why did you do that, Tom?"</p>

<p>Bolderbuck spoke around his pipestem. "I admire courage."</p>

<p>"The man's a fighter."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Bolderbuck.</p>

<p>Ranier was jerked by a nervous excitement. He fell into a
restless tramping, going around the room. His face broke and
settled and broke again, and his lips kept moving. He came to a
stand. His question burst plaintively out of him. "What are we
going to do, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Stick fast."</p>

<p>"No, you don't see it," exclaimed the sheriff. "The old ones
will fight for their cattle. They've held this country solid. But
there's a lot of young ones and poor ones who'll harken to Sam
Torveen's example. They've been still. They won't stay still when
they see this man Surratt laugh in Bill Head's face. They'll take
courage and swing with Torveen. My God, Tom, you know what a
neighborhood war does to you and me? Which way do we swing? Where
do we stand?"</p>

<p>"We stand fast," murmured Tom Bolderbuck, and kept on smoking.
Long afterwards he mused, half to himself: "It was pretty, the
way he stood out there with Perrigo on his back. It was
pretty."</p>

<p>On the street Bill Head threw a surly order to his crew. "Get
your horses and get out of here!" He swung about and showed Old
Martin the burning resentment that was in him. His tone was
stiff. "It's my understanding you don't approve the way I handled
this. Surratt's a gunman. It sticks out all over him. I won't be
baited into a fight he wanted me to start. There's other ways of
handling this. I wish you'd hold your judgment till this affair
is over."</p>

<p>"I'm staying at the hotel tonight," said Old Martin.</p>

<p>Bill Head started to wheel his father into the hotel. But the
old man's hand lifted in sharp dissent. He said gruffly: "Get on
home. Pokey&mdash;Pokey come here."</p>

<p>Pokey came up. He got behind the chair and pushed it into the
hotel lobby and down the hall to Old Martin's room. He closed the
door and stood waiting. Old Martin looked oddly at this little,
unimportant man.</p>

<p>"What you think of him, Pokey?"</p>

<p>"Surratt?" said Pokey. He let his eyes fall to the floor; he
was diffident and vaguely embarrassed. "Seems kinda like a tough
one, Martin."</p>

<p>"Tough!" roared Old Martin. "God blast you, Pokey, he stood
out there and he didn't care about the whole of Bill's pack
around him! He was laughin' at 'em in a way that made 'em cringe
back and think twice!" Storm rushed through Old Martin, and his
temper was a huge thing that crowded and heated the room. "And
it's our luck to have him against us when I'd give the world to
have a son like that."</p>

<p>"Bill was just bein' careful," said Pokey.</p>

<p>"No man has a right to be careful when another man calls him
yellow," growled Old Martin. "There's no way out of this for Bill
now. He'll have to face this Surratt across a gun. He's no son of
mine if he doesn't. Pokey, I'm sendin' you on a trip. You go
across the desert to where this Surratt came from. I want to know
all about him."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Pokey.</p>

<p>"Start tonight," said Old Martin, and sent Pokey out of the
room with a wave of his hand. After the little man was gone
Martin Head sat very still, thinking of what he had seen. It
impressed him enough to murmur: "One man&mdash;and he made it
stick. It is strange to understand."</p>

<p><br> Surratt came across the Torveen yard and lugged Nick
Perrigo into the bunkhouse. The kid was there with Ed; hey both
got up and stared. Surratt dumped Nick into a junk, turning back
without explanation. Torveen had heard him arrive and was in the
office doorway.</p>

<p>"I brought Nick home from Morgantown, dead drunk," explained
Surratt.</p>

<p>But there was a little light from the office shining on
Surratt's battered face and on his torn shirt. Torveen saw this
and pulled Surratt into the office. He rapped out his
question.</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"The Carvel girl came up here and said he was in town in the
saloon, with Crow Track on his neck. So I went down there. I had
to pack him out."</p>

<p>"With Crow Track there?" said Torveen.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Torveen stared. His eyes began to flicker. "It's all you've
got to say&mdash;and you're smilin'?"</p>

<p>Surratt shrugged his shoulders. "Bolderbuck surprised me. He
stepped in to help me out."</p>

<p>Torveen said: "Somebody must have got to Nick with a drink,
before he went&mdash;or he wouldn't have gone to Morgantown. He
knows better. Liquor's poison to him. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>His mouth was open like that, framing the word, when the
sudden boil of shot echoes came out of the north in subdued
eddies. He put out a hand to push Surratt aside, but Surratt had
already turned through the doorway and was running for his horse.
The kid and Ed came from the bunkhouse on the dead gallop. They
were all up in the saddles and turning into the meadow within
half a minute of that first sound. Torveen yelled back at
Surratt: "The sheep! I left Chunk Osbrook with the herders!" He
raced into the trees on the north side of the house, down a
narrow trail leading toward the upper meadows where the sheep
lay. It wasn't more than half a mile ahead, and the sound of
shooting there turned general and strong, many guns beating up
the darkness. Torveen had quit talking, but the kid came just
behind Surratt with a savage, jumpy cursing. Up there, two rifles
sent flat explosions through the blunter noise of revolvers.
Surratt heard them speak steadily for a matter of two or three
minutes, and afterwards heard them no more. The revolvers bore
down insistently for a little while, and a man yelled. That
seemed to be a signal, for the firing died out with a last
cracking shot.</p>

<p>They came into the meadow. Sheep milled whitely in front of
them, and Torveen had to turn aside and sweep around. There was a
crash of horsemen over on the left, flailing through the trees
toward the ridge. Torveen yelled: "Hey, Chunk!" He went on toward
the herder's cabin recklessly, calling again. Surratt said, "Be a
little careful, Sam," and brought up his horse and got down. The
kid went by him, still cursing; but Ed also stopped short and
jumped to the ground. He came abreast of Surratt as they walked
on toward the house. A sheep lay on the meadow, shot but still
moving. Surratt swept the edges of the far trees&mdash;and
listened and heard nothing. He came up to the house then and
found Torveen crouched down by the door. A match burst in
Torveen's cupped palms.</p>

<p>Its light glowed down on Chunk Osbrook's face. There was a
little glitter of blood on Osbrook's chest. One hand lay up over
the hole, as if to check the blood; but he was quite dead.</p>

<p>Surratt reached over and killed the match in Torveen's fist.
He raised his voice, calling through this thick dark: "Hey, you
herders&mdash;come up here."</p>

<p>"No," said Torveen, matter-of-fact with his words. "They'll be
running. It was Chunk who stayed to take the beatin'. Well,
that's one of us. They've got five more to go, Buck."</p>

<p>Surratt said: "Send one of the boys for my blankets. I'll camp
with the sheep."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. THE WAY OF A WOMAN</h2>

<p class="first">THEY got Chunk Osbrook's body across Torveen's
saddle. Ferd Bowie was swearing around the darkness; the others
stood grouped together, tensed to the night's mystery. A
disturbed bleating came over from the sheep, and the wind ran its
steady way through the trees. Powder smell faded from the meadow;
the last echo of the raiding party died up in the ridge.</p>

<p>"Crow Track," murmured Surratt. "They left Morgantown just a
little while ago."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Torveen.</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>"Met Hank Peyrolles yet?"</p>

<p>"In the jail office, other day."</p>

<p>"You'll know him better," stated Torveen. "Well, there's no
use waiting here. Those herders have bunched this job. I don't
blame 'em much."</p>

<p>They crossed the meadow and traveled back along the trail,
Torveen leading and Ed and Bowie holding Chunk Osbrook's body in
the saddle. Surratt followed with the extra horses. A coyote in
the deep timber broke the liquid run of these dark shadows with a
shrill half-barking call to the remote stars, invoking a far-off
answer. When they came to the ranch Torveen helped Ed carry Chunk
Osbrook to a storeroom beyond the kitchen. He came out of there
and closed the door quietly; and remained on the porch a moment
to roll a smoke. When he scratched a match across the boards the
light trembled in his fingers. Surratt stared at that sight with
a puzzled attention and then was relieved to know that anger did
this to Torveen, not fear. For Torveen's voice was packed with
hot emotion.</p>

<p>"Dog eat dog," he said. "Well, we'll have our turn at it You
sure you want to watch them sheep alone?"</p>

<p>"I'm a little harder to shoot at," Surratt remarked dryly, and
went into the bunkroom. Nick Perrigo lay where he had been
dumped, huddled and snoring. The kid sat at the table with his
sallow chin cupped in a palm. He stared at Surratt with the
vigilant watchfulness of a wild animal; and the smell of this
night's blood had put a cast in his eyes that warned Surratt. The
thing haunted Surratt as he rolled his blankets. He threw the
roll over a shoulder; he turned to the kid.</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty," said the kid reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Where's your people?"</p>

<p>Bowie shrugged his shoulders indifferently. "I dunno. Dead
maybe. Was in Oklahoma Territory when I run away."</p>

<p>Surratt found nothing on that face which pleased him. Ferd
Bowie was a white savage, and all the decency in him had been
starved out long ago. Yet something prompted him to speak a civil
word of advice. "Get out of this business. Ride over the pass and
put this country behind. If you stay you'll kill somebody, or
you'll be killed."</p>

<p>The kid said evenly: "That's all right with me."</p>

<p>Surratt left the bunkroom and put the blanket roll behind his
saddle. He went across to the office, seeing Torveen inside. "In
the morning..." he started to say. But he stopped and swung his
head to the far end of the office&mdash;and discovered Judith
Cameron posted quietly by the far wall. Surratt removed his hat.
"I didn't know I was butting in."</p>

<p>"That's all right," exclaimed Torveen. He showed a faint
embarrassment. "Judith rode down to pass a word with me. She's a
regular Indian for prowlin' at night."</p>

<p>"I'm going to the sheep camp," said Surratt. "Be back for
breakfast."</p>

<p>Judith Cameron came from the end of the room. She murmured:
"Wait a minute&mdash;I'll ride that far with you." She smiled a
little at Torveen. "Time to go home. Dad's a little touchy lately
about the way I drift."</p>

<p>"I don't blame him," said Torveen. "You worry me, too."</p>

<p>"Closing the gate on me, mister?" said Judith, swifter with
her smile.</p>

<p>Torveen flushed. "I'm thinkin' about you, Judith, not about
me."</p>

<p>Judith turned beside Surratt, near the doorway. For a moment
Torveen's cheeks were plain and unexpressive. But Surratt
observed something then that gave him the whole story of Sam
Torveen's heart. Behind the labored neutrality of expression
irritation stirred&mdash;a flash of jealousy showed. Torveen
tried to hold it out of his voice and wasn't quite successful.
"You're a handsome-lookin' pair, but that shirt's kind of
irregular, Buck."</p>

<p>"Remember what I told you," Judith said.</p>

<p>"Sure," grunted Torveen. "Better get goin'."</p>

<p>Surratt stood aside to let the girl pass out, and afterwards
he went to his horse. She walked around the house and presently
came riding back. Torveen remained in the doorway, closely
watching. When they started off he sent a call after the girl
almost humbly: "Good night, Judith."</p>

<p>She raised her hand to Torveen and said, "So long," in a way
that ran like a slow measure of music through Surratt's brain. At
the trees he dropped back to let her take the lead, seeing her
slim shape vaguely away ahead of him. They reached the sheep
meadow a little afterwards, and he came abreast of her again, but
there was nothing said and the silence was suddenly thick with
this girl's presence, rich and satisfying with it. He saw the
meadow cabin's dim outline reach forward&mdash;and felt a deep
regret then for the shortness of this ride. He got down and
pulled off his blanket roll.</p>

<p>"Good night," he said.</p>

<p>"I want to talk with you."</p>

<p>She followed him into the cabin. He tried a match against the
gloom and found a lantern sitting on a board table in the middle
of the place. When he reached down to lift the globe he felt it
still to be warm. A smoky yellow light flowed slowly through the
place and reached over to touch the girl. She leaned back against
a wall, her shoulders small and square and resolute against it.
Her hair was a fresh tawny gold in this obscure room; and the
shadows etched out the strong, clear candor of all her features.
There was a blend of things in her that troubled Surratt by their
fullness&mdash;a pride and an honesty and a deep, mysterious
grace of heart and body&mdash;that woke in him the flame of
hungers he could not understand. The knowledge of Sam Torveen's
latent jealousy oppressed him then, for he realized why Torveen
should feel that way about this girl.</p>

<p>Her voice ran the room gently; her eyes explored his face with
a soft, slow attention. "You were hurt tonight, in Morgantown.
They bruised you and wanted to kill you."</p>

<p>"We got out of it all right."</p>

<p>Her question came as a low whisper. "Will you get out of it
next time?"</p>

<p>"Next time? It's better that a man be blind as to the future.
Life's trouble enough without borrowing from tomorrow."</p>

<p>She shook her head, enormously sober. "There's a sadness in
you I do not understand."</p>

<p>"I want something I can't have."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I think," he said, carefully choosing his words, "it is
peace. I'll leave ambition to other men. To men like Sam, who's
staking his hide on it."</p>

<p>"You're staking your hide with him, Buck."</p>

<p>"That's friendship&mdash;not ambition. When this is all
finished I'll be riding on."</p>

<p>"You know why Sam's ambitious, don't you?"</p>

<p>"He's a young man and he's a poor man. It isn't money that
matters with him. It's standing equal with any other cattleman in
the district that matters. Something whips him on to that and
he'll never rest until he gets it. I can see the pride in him
that won't let him ask a woman to step away from a big house to a
little one. So he's going to get a big house first, before he
asks. I do not blame him&mdash;for you are the woman."</p>

<p>She murmured: "Yes, that's why he's doing it."</p>

<p>He watched her with a driving curiosity and could not
penetrate the hazel mystery of her eyes. Sam Torveen loved her,
but he could not break down her reserve to find how her heart
went. It was a thing strangely and powerfully important to him,
though he did not know why. He felt restless and depressed for
lack of an answer.</p>

<p>She said: "You know what this means, don't you? This band of
sheep in the meadow has made outcasts of you all. There were six
of you. Now there's five, and it will never end till you're all
dead or driven out. Why should you go on with it, Buck?"</p>

<p>He asked her abruptly: "What's your wish?"</p>

<p>"To see it stopped before somebody else dies!"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Things like this are written in the book.
Nobody can say Sam Torveen willfully started a war. It goes
deeper. These sheep are like time. They move on and nothing can
stop them. It's always been that way and always will be. If it
wasn't Sam who started this, it would be somebody else."</p>

<p>Her arms rose and crossed her breasts and she said in a small,
quick voice: "I am afraid."</p>

<p>They stood thus faced, deeply engrossed in each other, with
something strong and vivid and unsettling running between them.
He came around the table and looked down, and her eyes came up
and were very bright. He locked his big fists behind him solidly,
thinking that she was the full image of man's desire. The
strength of her presence rocked and tore at him; it was a hammer
beating at his strength; it was a wildness and a beauty lifting
him higher than he had ever been lifted. He said, blunt and
rough: "I think you'd better ride along."</p>

<p>"I do not think you know fear," she murmured, long watching
him. "But you're very lonely, Buck."</p>

<p>"Good night," he said.</p>

<p>Something quick and surprised widened her eyes. She looked
steadily at him a moment, reading his face; and she turned
immediately and went out. He didn't follow. Motionless by the
table, he listened to her pony trot around the house and go up
the hill trail. A little afterwards the echoes of the pony died
in the timber.</p>

<p>He thought angrily: "What did she see in my head then?" and
lifted his chin to catch the fresh rumor of a pony running
steadily up the meadow. He lowered the lantern's wick and stepped
back a pace, waiting out that arrival. But a moment later he
heard Torveen's voice call him. "That's all right. Buck." Surratt
reached over and turned up the wick again and found Torveen
framed in the doorway.</p>

<p>The mood of this man was written plainly on his face,
distrusting and aroused and angered; and Surratt understood
instantly that Torveen had been across the meadow watching the
cabin during Judith Cameron's visit. Faint anger stirred
Surratt&mdash;and went away; and he felt sorry for Torveen.</p>

<p>Torveen spoke unevenly: "I thought I'd drop over and see if
you was sure you wanted to stick it out here."</p>

<p>"It's all right. Don't be so damned spooky, either about these
sheep or anything else."</p>

<p>Torveen jerked up his chin. Irritation got the best of him.
"By God, Surratt, you're too clever at reading a man's
thoughts!"</p>

<p>"Steady up, kid."</p>

<p>Torveen came into the cabin, his nerves and his fears jerking
at him. He made a complete circle of the room; he swung on
Surratt, the ragged emotion in him pouring out.</p>

<p>"Listen, Buck. That girl's my life. It's been that way since
we were kids. There was a time when I stood well with the old-
time cattlemen in this country. I was welcome anywhere. But when
I got older and saw what a piddlin' spread I run it cut me pretty
deep. To hell with the money or the fame. But I've got to have my
part of this range&mdash;for Judith. I'm too honest to rustle, so
it's sheep. Now I'm an outcast and I've played right into the
hands of Bill Head, who's been wanting my scalp ever since I took
Judith home from the first dance. He's always laid for me and the
sheep give him the excuse he wants. Well, it's open season on Sam
Torveen&mdash;and I've made it that way because I won't be in the
position of poor white trash askin' a rich man's daughter to
marry me. I'm playin' my stack on this and God knows where the
end is. That's all right, Buck. It's all right&mdash;just as long
as there's daylight for me. She's the daylight. She's always
been."</p>

<p>"Told her this?" asked Surratt quietly. "You've got an
agreement on it?"</p>

<p>"What kind of a fool would I be to lay this war on her
conscience? Why do you figure she came tonight? To try to keep me
out of trouble. Well, we'll play it like this&mdash;all the way
through."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Surratt. He was smiling across the interval, a
little sadly, a little humorously. "We'll play it all the way
through."</p>

<p>Torveen scraped a hand across his cheeks and let out a long
breath. He stared at the floor with his shoulders wearily
dropped. He shook his head and came around the table. A grin
streaked wryly across this man's roan, fighting face. He put his
hand on Surratt's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I'm batty as hell. How long have I known you? Three
days. Well, I'd trust you to the end of creation&mdash;and that's
the way I've felt from the beginning. You're shoulders above the
pack, which includes me, and I'm proud of my luck in runnin' into
you. Forget it."</p>

<p>"Forget it," agreed Surratt quietly.</p>

<p>Torveen turned immediately out of the cabin, and a little
later galloped across the meadow. Surratt picked up his blankets
and killed the lantern. He walked from the cabin to lead his
horse around to the margin of the near-by timber, to put it on a
picket there. He drew his rifle from the saddle boot, strolled
twenty yards from the horse and spread his blankets just inside
the trees and rolled up for the night, the rifle above his head.
The stars were all dimly agleam in the black sky, scattered like
crushed diamond dust; the wind poured down these deep hills,
strong with the smell of pine and rich upland grasses. All his
bones were tired and his desire was for a dreamless sleep; yet he
lay there and knew that his life had trapped him again in the
strong jaws of friendship. He could not stand in the way of this
fiery, lovable Torveen who trusted him; he could not take away,
even if it were possible, the man's hope. Silence was his part,
as it had been before. He remembered then the strong, supple
shape of Judith Cameron against the cabin wall, and the curve of
her lips&mdash;and loneliness bore him outward on an ebb
tide.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. SECRET MEETINGS</h2>

<p class="first">SURRATT came down to the ranch house for
breakfast; and afterwards went over to a corner of the meadow
where the crew had dug a grave for Chunk Osbrook beside the
graves of other Torveen people buried there. Day's thick and
drowsy warmth already filled these hills, but the long shadow of
the pines covered this little cemetery with a cool, still
pleasantness. They brought Osbrook from the house and laid him in
the grave and were dismally silent awhile. Considering these odd
companions, Surratt understood something about them then. Tough
as they were, they had an ingrained respect for death. They were
embarrassed from knowing they owed Chunk Osbrook a more decent
ceremony than they could render. It was the sense of a lacking
propriety that held them thus paused here, waiting for Torveen to
say what should be said.</p>

<p>Torveen's gravity thickened on him. He looked around the group
and out upon the yellow meadow, and turned a little toward a
small headstone beside him, engraved: "Thomas J. Torveen, 1820-
1881." He considered the stone a moment.</p>

<p>"My father," he mused, "once told me the prime duty of a man
was to live in such a manner that dyin' would come easy to him.
These old-timers lived strong, but they all seemed to get fun out
of their days. They had a faith nobody could shake. I saw it in
old Tom many times, a stout belief that his ticket read all the
way through. He laid himself down without doubt and he died with
a smile, like he wanted to show me it wasn't much of a chore.
It's something that seems to be gone out of the world. I haven't
got it and I know few people who do have it. I don't know what
death is&mdash;I don't even know what life is. Maybe we'll find
out and maybe we won't. Chunk wasn't a bad boy. His riding is
done, and whatever else may come to him at least he's got a rest,
which is more than we can say for ourselves."</p>

<p>They waited a little longer, until they were sure he had
finished. Ed and the kid put their shovels into the fresh dirt
and began to fill up the grave. They worked at first reluctantly;
then faster, eager to be done with it. The others presently
stepped in and spelled them off on the labor. When they were
through they all walked back to the yard. Nick Perrigo sat down
on the edge of the porch, the aftermath of his drunk leaving him
shaken and white and physically ill. The thinness of the man was
more pronounced; his eyes burned. Ferd Bowie stood sullenly in
his tracks. Ed remained in the background, leaning on a shovel.
Sam Torveen scanned them with a practical glance.</p>

<p>"You want to remember," he warned them, "that this is the
beginning of something, not the end. There's five of us left, but
it won't stay like that. We're running sheep, which makes us
about as low in the scale of things, according to the view of a
cattle rancher, as it's possible to get. I'm not cryin' about
it&mdash;I'm just tellin' you the way the country looks at us. We
don't get any more mercy and we don't get any more warnings. Was
I a big cattle owner I'd probably feel the same way. If any of
you fellows want to drift over the pass tonight it's all right
with me."</p>

<p>"I've been considering the sheep meadow," reflected Surratt.
"I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Torveen.</p>

<p>"Too exposed&mdash;too easy to raid. Up on the ridge yesterday
I noticed another clearing along the edge of the river. That
yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's five miles away."</p>

<p>"Still, it gives us one less side to watch. We better move the
sheep up there tonight."</p>

<p>Torveen thought about it. Nick Perrigo lifted his head and
spoke sourly: "I don't take to the suggestion."</p>

<p>But Torveen finally nodded. "All right. We'll do that
tonight."</p>

<p>Perrigo reared up, crossed the yard to his horse and rode off.
Bowie went into the bunkroom, Ed walked around the house. Torveen
was remotely grinning. "You got this crew eatin' out of your
hand. They're not happy about it, but they're mindin' you after a
fashion." He came forward to squat in the sunlit yard and to draw
stray patterns across the dust with his forefinger. "Friend of
mine rode by last night who was in Morgantown when you put on
your party. The way he told it I wish I'd seen it. Seems like you
kind of printed yourself on this country's memory." He looked up,
bright and severe. "You damn fool, don't cut your string so thin
next time! It came near breakin' on you."</p>

<p>"It didn't."</p>

<p>"Supposin' it had?"</p>

<p>Surratt murmured: "Sometimes a man can't afford to think of
what might happen."</p>

<p>"And you smiled at that bunch," marveled Torveen. "You called
Bill Head yellow and he took it. I want to correct you on that
little point, for it's important you get the man straight.
There's no yellow in him. What you see is a cold brute patience
that never gives up and never gets tired. Any other man, even a
yellow one, would've been stampeded into a play last night. But
Bill will let the whole damn country consider him yellow and keep
drivin' at his purpose. You can set him back on his heels, but
you can't stop him and you can't swing him off his trail."</p>

<p>Surratt listened with an absorbing attention. He put this
picture of Bill Head back in his mind, to consider and to
remember.</p>

<p>"It ain't the sheep, with him so much," went on Torveen. "It's
me he wants&mdash;and my land. The Heads haven't got any open
range like this. My meadows shut them into the hills. Bill's been
lookin' my way for years. So, there's the story."</p>

<p>Surratt said: "I'll mosey back to the sheep."</p>

<p>Torveen had something else on his mind. He got up, choosing
his words with a great deal of care. "Like I said, you've printed
yourself on this country's memory. People think you know a good
deal about Les Head's shooting."</p>

<p>Surratt had turned away; but he swung about now and studied
Torveen thoughtfully. "Maybe I do," he suggested.</p>

<p>There was a definite worry on Torveen's homely cheeks.
"Anybody might have done that killin'. Les Head had few friends.
He was an insolent man and was hated for it. He was a man to
chase after women&mdash;and there's men who hated him for that
too." Torveen's eyes contained a studied, enforced
inscrutability. "For that matter I might have shot him myself. I
had reasons enough. I wouldn't go borrowing trouble, Buck, if I
were you."</p>

<p>"Maybe I don't follow you," said Surratt.</p>

<p>"Maybe you do," retorted Torveen. But he added: "It's bein'
said you've got some clue to the killin'. I wouldn't go turning
over old boards. Something might fly up and sting you."</p>

<p>"Were you on the ranch the night of the shot?"</p>

<p>"No," said Torveen, readily enough.</p>

<p>"Was Perrigo?"</p>

<p>This lime Torveen's answer came reluctantly. "No."</p>

<p>"Seems like everybody was ridin' through the hills that
evening," said Surratt.</p>

<p>Torveen's question went out of him like a shot. "Who
else?"</p>

<p>But Surratt only grinned at his partner. He went over to his
horse. Torveen called after him swiftly and imperiously: "Don't
carry your curiosity any farther, kid." Surratt made a stray
gesture with his hand and cantered away, his grin dying. He let
his arm fall briefly across his shirt pocket; then got out his
pipe and stopped in the trees to fill it. Down the trail he saw
the disappearing rump of another horse cutting crosswise through
the brush; he lighted his pipe and caught it tightly between his
teeth, riding on with a quick lift of his nerves. Coming out of
the trees into the sheep meadow he found Annette Carvel waiting
there for him.</p>

<p>She said frankly: "I thought you'd be back along this
way."</p>

<p>He tipped his stetson, and was at once afraid of this moment.
She wore a buckskin split skirt, heavily beaded, and a silk shirt
fastened at the collar with a dark string tie. Hatless under the
strong sun, her black hair glistened; and there was a shining,
eager recklessness all about her. He looked at her attentively
and saw that his glance was expected and awaited. Her lips, very
red, broke into a quick smiling, and then she was a woman fully,
lush with life.</p>

<p>She fell beside him, pleased and softly laughing; and rode
across the meadow to the little cabin. He waited a moment in the
saddle, but she said: "Are you camping up here now?" and got down
and went toward the cabin. He dismounted and stood by his horse.
His silence turned her head and her back-thrown glance was made
to please him, yet in a moment she shrugged her shoulders and
came back, to watch him with a growing soberness. Her eyes then
were very wistful; as though his silence struck her a blow she
didn't deserve. She was, he suddenly thought, a child loving
warmth and afraid of darkness.</p>

<p>She spoke in a way that was humble, that was disappointed:
"Men are funny. They keep thinking women are either bad or good.
And when a woman comes first to a man, the man always thinks the
woman is bad. Why is that? Don't you ever get tired of the same
old things said in the same old way?"</p>

<p>He said, gently: "Why ask me a question like that?"</p>

<p>"I thought," she murmured, "you were different. But then I
always think that. I guess there are no different men."</p>

<p>He said: "Let me see your hand."</p>

<p>She looked carefully at him, her head held a little to one
side. She put her right hand forward, and her cheeks filled with
color and her breath quickened. He took the hand, looked at it
and turned it over, and let it go.</p>

<p>"Why?" she breathed.</p>

<p>He reached up to his shirt pocket. But some impulse stopped
the gesture. He said: "Do you wear doeskin riding gloves?"</p>

<p>Her mouth opened. She drew in a quick, gasped breath. Alarm
sprang through her eyes and a pure whiteness covered her face,
turning her lips scarlet against such pallor. Her expression then
was haunted and miserable.</p>

<p>"Give it to me!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Does it belong to you?"</p>

<p>"Give it to me&mdash;please! It came from my store."</p>

<p>He said, in a regretting, apologetic way: "I'm sorry I
mentioned it. I have no desire to pry into anybody's life."</p>

<p>She had seen his hand touch his shirt pocket. She threw
herself against him vehemently and her fingers ripped at the
pocket and reached into it. He stepped backward and pushed her
hands down. He had to brace himself against the violence of her
body for a moment&mdash;until her burst of strength went away and
left her trembling there in front of him. She cried at him:</p>

<p>"I knew you had it&mdash;and I'm not the only one that knows
you have it! You won't give it to me?"</p>

<p>He said gently: "No."</p>

<p>She whirled back to her horse and got into the saddle. "You
can be killed for that!" she exclaimed and went across the meadow
at a full gallop, disappearing behind the trees.</p>

<p>Surratt remained in his tracks, somebody displeased at his own
conduct. He had no desire, he told himself strictly, to tinker
with people's secrets or crack the whip of fear over anybody's
head. Yet this was what possession of that doeskin glove in his
shirt pocket was coming to mean. In the beginning a pure impulse
had caused him to take that glove from the floor of that cabin in
which Leslie Head lay dead&mdash;a sudden and instinctive desire
to protect the unknown woman who owned it. But his mind, always
seeking answers, kept reaching into the mystery surrounding the
glove, and though he had thought this his secret, Annette
Carvel's warning seemed to indicate it was no secret to the
hills. So the glove became a major problem, a liability burning a
hole in his pocket. He had a duty here to its unnamed owner; and
that duty forbade him giving the glove to anyone else.</p>

<p>A threshing of brush behind the cabin wheeled him around. He
saw Nick Perrigo ride forward, anger making the little man's
eccentric face very old. Perrigo remained in the saddle.</p>

<p>"Surratt," he said, "you leave that girl alone!"</p>

<p>Surratt eyed the man carefully. "What's that, Nick?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," snapped Perrigo. "Don't encourage her to come to
you again! She's a kid any man can fool. She'll believe you if
you lie to her and she'll come to you if you smile..."</p>

<p>"Perrigo," ordered Surratt, "say no more on this subject."</p>

<p>"By God, I will! What've you got she wants?"</p>

<p>Surratt studied the little man. "My friend," he said quietly,
"if you ride through muddy places late at night and don't want
men to know where you have been, it's always a good idea to brush
off your pony's legs before morning comes. Have I said
enough?"</p>

<p>"You know too much!" said Perrigo in a lunging tone. "Your
eyes see too much!"</p>

<p>"Better let well-enough alone."</p>

<p>Nick Perrigo fell silent, struggling with the wicked flux of
his temper. He seemed to conquer it, for he said in a milder way:
"I have made many mistakes, Surratt, and my life has been no good
for anybody." Then the mildness, like a flurry of air, passed and
left him dismally antagonistic. "You've got my thanks for pulling
me out of Morgantown. That's all you've got. I do not trust you
and I do not like you."</p>

<p>"I doubt if you like anybody," observed Surratt.</p>

<p>"All men are dogs," grated Perrigo. "Leave that girl alone."
He quit on that warning and wheeled and charged back into the
trees.</p>

<p>Surratt stood quietly in the sunlight a little while, narrowly
considering the mad strangeness of this Nick Perrigo. Going back
into his memory he found no precedent; the man's distorted,
untrusting behavior was new to him, long ago warped by some major
catastrophe. The day had turned steadily hotter, the wind was
gone and far above him the Gray Bull peaks threw their angular
iron shapes against a flawless azure sky. The sheep lay scattered
along the meadow, browsing. On impulse Surratt stepped into the
saddle and swung north into the higher trees. There was no need
of guarding this flock by daylight; it was by night that men
brought trouble to men.</p>

<p>He cruised steadily along the shadowed aisles of these heavy,
red-haired pines and was touched by a pure ease. Now and then a
shaft of sunlight cut diagonally through some break in the
treetops and laid a yellow, sharp-edged pattern in the twilight
and burned brilliantly on the humus flooring and turned the
surrounding air a smoky blue. Dreaming stillness held the hills;
the smell of this forest was spiced and resinous and wild.
Somewhere to his left he began to pick up a long, low
murmuring.</p>

<p>It was middle-morning when the rising trail brought him out
upon another meadow making a tawny splash in the emerald
solidness of the hills. Traveling across it he brought up before
the unfenced rim of a canyon. Almost vertically below him, a
matter of six hundred feet, lay the sunless surface of a
river.</p>

<p>Across the way ran a spur of the foothills, considerably
higher than the ground upon which Surratt stood. The river swung
out of the high hills through a narrow channel that threshed up
its water and made white rollers glisten even in the dull light,
and passed below him smoothly for a quarter-mile and swung again
and went charging through a sheer break in the yonder ridge.
Looking far down there, Surratt saw three or four buildings of a
little settlement beside the edge of the river where it turned,
lost in the depths of this dark hole.</p>

<p>He wheeled to consider the meadow, which he had sighted from a
higher peak the day before and had considered as a good place to
hold the sheep. Then, the riding impulse strong in him, he tipped
into a yard-wide ledge cut against the face of the canyon and
began an angling descent to the river. At occasional muddy spots
in the trail he saw the round neat-cut print of deer side by side
with the heavy plantigrade tracks of bear. Twenty minutes
afterwards he stood at the margin of the river where it shallowed
across a gravel bar. He forded here, his horse splashing up to
its shoulders. On the far side he struck a wagon road and
followed it to the settlement.</p>

<p>It was a saloon and a store and one gray ancient house of
shakes and hand-hewn timber sleeping on the toes of the ridge
rearing high to the sky. The dusty road ran on along the edge of
the river, through the narrow chasm, toward the suggestion of a
gentler valley beyond. Surratt came to the saloon and drew in
there; three men sat on the porch, dark and obscure men,
enigmatically interested in him. When he saw them he knew their
kind; and looking beyond them to the saloon doorway he found the
gross and loose-tissued body of Blackjack Smith filling it.</p>

<p>Surratt got down and climbed the porch, remotely smiling.
Blackjack's liquid glance was wary and waiting; the pendulous
mouth shifted by degrees, neither friendly nor otherwise. Surratt
was quietly laughing then.</p>

<p>He said: "Hello, Blackjack."</p>

<p>Blackjack turned his head to the three men on the porch. "This
is Surratt," he grumbled, as though he added the information to
previous talk. All three looked at him alertly. Smith said: "Come
in, Buck," and retreated to the deeper shadows of the saloon. He
walked to the rear of the bar. "Still drinkin' corn whisky?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Your place, Blackjack?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Blackjack. "Mine." He seized a bottle and two
glasses and kept going down the bar to the back end. There was a
rear room there; he went into it and set the bottle on the table.
When Surratt came in, Blackjack called all the way through the
saloon to the porch: "Take Surratt's horse behind the shed." He
closed the door. "It's all right," he said to Surratt; and sat
down by the table and fell ponderously silent</p>

<p>Surratt grinned. "Glad to see me, Blackjack?"</p>

<p>"No," said Blackjack frankly, "I can't say that."</p>

<p>"This joint got a name?"</p>

<p>"This is Carson Ford."</p>

<p>"What's on down the river?"</p>

<p>"Cameron Valley," said Blackjack. "The Head outfit's above me,
back yonder is the hills."</p>

<p>"You always did like to get in the middle of a lot of beef,"
observed Surratt. "But this looks like an inconvenient spot for
your business."</p>

<p>"Better than it looks."</p>

<p>"Still like other people's beef?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" grunted the big man. Then he burst out: "You sure
have messed up the works for me. I'm gettin' along fine and now
here you are. I don't know why you come, but you sure make things
different."</p>

<p>"I'm not after you, Blackjack. We had our little battle once,
but that was a long time ago, across the desert."</p>

<p>"No matter," said Blackjack. "You make it tough on a man. You
know me. I always play the strong side of politics against the
weak side. Maybe I rustle a little beef, but I got a way of
finding friends to take care of me in case of grief."</p>

<p>"That's Bill Head."</p>

<p>"Sure. But you come ridin' through and damned if you don't
hook up with this Torveen and Bill Head's bound to have your hide
nailed to the side of his shanty, and I'm playin' with Bill in
this business."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," suggested Surratt imperturbably. He lifted his
glass and drank the pale corn liquor. Blackjack reared back in
his chair and pushed his arms in front of him. He said devoutly:
"No sir, kid. I don't want any more of your kind of battle. I
won't fight you. Not anywhere, any time. I want you to know that.
What'd you come to this country for?"</p>

<p>"A rest," murmured Surratt. "A rest I won't get. It's the same
old thing. Man that carries the gun dies by the gun."</p>

<p>Blackjack's tone was smooth and marveling. "Well, you take me
back just two years to another night. My God, you walk into
Morgantown and brace Head's outfit and carry Perrigo out. And you
get away with it! You always do. But I doubt your luck this time,
kid. You're buckin' too much. Sam Torveen can't stand against
these cattlemen. They're bound to wipe him out. It's all
arranged. I wish you'd get clear of it."</p>

<p>"Torveen," said Surratt quietly, "is a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Blackjack in a deep, regretting way. "That's
always your style. It's a funny thing. I'm no saint and you sure
chased me to hell and gone over a lot of acres. But I'm gettin'
older and there's things I admire against my will. You got what I
admire, kid&mdash;and I never thought the day would come when I'd
tell you that." He lifted his hands helplessly. "What'm I goin'
to do?"</p>

<p>"Play out your hand, of course."</p>

<p>"I'll never lift an arm against you, kid. Well, it's tough.
You'll make this country lift its hat to you before the music's
done. But in the end they'll get you. I know Bill Head."</p>

<p>Boots scraped across the saloon floor and a voice said
definitely: "Blackjack."</p>

<p>It was a voice Surratt knew. He looked up at Blackjack, who
had risen. Blackjack nodded. He said quietly: "That's why I had
your horse put out of sight. I knew he was comin', and didn't
think you wanted to meet him. There's the back door."</p>

<p>The big man opened the door into the saloon and slid through
and closed it. He said warily: "What's on your mind, Sam?"</p>

<p>It was Sam Torveen.</p>

<p>As quietly as possible Surratt left the saloon by the back
door, found his horse and left the settlement, recrossing the
river and climbing up to the meadow.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. IN DEEP NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">THE road through Cameron Valley passed within a
stone's throw of Ab Cameron's house, paralleling the river. It
was a well-worn road, the main artery into the hills. This way
the Heads always traveled, riding up from the desert to their
high ranch; the Peyrolles used it when coming out of their lower
valley to Morgantown, via the bridge here and the trail over the
ridge; and this way drifted many shadowy shapes bound for Carson
Ford and the Gray Bull pass and the lonely safety of the deep
canyons yonder. Tonight the traffic on the road troubled Judith;
many men were adrift, more frequently passing by, more hurried in
their pace. She had lived her life here and knew the moods of the
land better than her own moods. Intangible rumors flowed thickly
in this night, and the wind was telegraphing its messages from
canyon and peak.</p>

<p>She looked at her mother, who sat so placidly by the table,
engrossed in an endless knitting; and at her father seated at the
other side of the table. Lamplight touched up the benign
qualities of his face. His lips moved as he read the book in his
lap.</p>

<p>Her mother said unexpectedly: "You fiddle around so much,
Judith. Can't you rest your body?"</p>

<p>Steve Koemer, who was the Cameron foreman, came over the porch
and put his head through the doorway. He nodded at Judith. "The
Carvel girl's here."</p>

<p>Judith was half across the room before Ab Cameron's order came
quietly after her. "Wait." It turned her around. A little color
showed along the strong modeling of her features. She noticed he
showed his worry. "The Carvel girl," he said. "That trinket.
There's a word in the good book which describes her. What's she
doing here?"</p>

<p>"To talk to me," Judith said. Then she added more quietly:
"Sometimes I think I'm the only friend she has."</p>

<p>"You're not choosy enough," commented Ab Cameron. "You'll pick
up anything, sick cats and stray dogs&mdash;and a common girl
like this Annette."</p>

<p>"Ab," said Mrs. Cameron. For Judith's color had deepened. It
turned her lovely and resisting. Cameron spoke in an anxious way:
"Don't ride tonight, Daughter."</p>

<p>Judith went on out to the porch and across the yard. Annette
Carvel was a small, swaying shape on her horse. Faint moonlight
blurred the outline of her face. "Judith," she said, "I've
found&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>The men of the Cameron crew stirred near by. They were grouped
by the door of the blacksmith shop beside the road. They loitered
in the semiopaque shadows of the cottonwoods. It was strange,
this unrest that caused them to be here. Over the river's
murmurings came the swift echoes of a traveler pounding up from
the lower reaches of the valley. Judith moved away from the yard,
Annette following.</p>

<p>"Now," murmured Judith.</p>

<p>Annette's voice was low and uneven. "The new
man&mdash;Surratt&mdash;has the glove!"</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"Oh, Judith!"</p>

<p>"Do you think he knows who it belongs to?"</p>

<p>"He looked at my hands!"</p>

<p>"He looked at mine too, Annette."</p>

<p>"I had to tell him they came from my shop."</p>

<p>The arriving rider came up at a steady canter and called out
to the men at the blacksmith shop. "Hello, boys." He hurried on.
It was, Judith knew, the voice of a Peyrolles man.</p>

<p>The breeze was pleasant on her cheeks; and a current of
wildness came out of the black hill mass and woke a responding
unrest in her slim, smooth body. She was remembering Surratt's
shoulders against the sun and the sadness of his voice and the
sleeping danger behind the smoke-gray surfaces of his eyes. The
discovery of it had sent a small shock through her; the
remembrance of it freshened all her senses now. But she said
calmly: "We are safe with him, Annette."</p>

<p>"No man is safe," said Annette sullenly.</p>

<p>"He is."</p>

<p>"Don't trust him."</p>

<p>"I do, Annette."</p>

<p>Annette Carvel leaned down from the saddle and her white face
showed a dreamlike wonder. "No&mdash;never be like me, Judith.
That would break my heart. I went up to see him and he smiled at
me and I thought he liked me."</p>

<p>"All men smile at you, Annette. That is your fate."</p>

<p>"He asked me if I wore doeskin riding gloves! And apologized
for asking! Why did he do that? I tried to get the glove but he
wouldn't give it. Supposing somebody else gets it from him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Judith softly, "I think nobody will."</p>

<p>"People know he has it now. And somebody'll try."</p>

<p>Judith Cameron was a little angry then. "Annette, why do you
always throw yourself at men?"</p>

<p>"I guess," said Annette Carvel in a small, childlike tone, "I
want somebody to love me. Oh, God, Judith&mdash;I get so hungry
for that!"</p>

<p>"Annette!" breathed Judith, and reached up and touched the
girl's arm.</p>

<p>Annette pulled her horse about. "Mom will be worried about me,
and scold some more. But it makes me so desperate. I can't sleep
for thinking about that glove&mdash;and you, and me. Bill Head's
so damn cruel. He's going to kill Sam Torveen, I know that. And
he'll kill Buck Surratt. You see!" With that she stormed down the
road and raced across the bridge, the old structure rolling back
a long booming.</p>

<p>Steve Koemer drifted from the shadows, very tall, very quiet-
spoken. "She shouldn't be ridin' alone. Neither should you."</p>

<p>"Steve," Judith said, "what's happening?"</p>

<p>But he crawled into a reticence that could not be shaken. He
turned away. "I don't know, Miss Cameron."</p>

<p>She went on into the house and stopped and stared at her
father, bringing up his bland attention. She was angry then.
"Isn't there room enough in these hills for everybody?"</p>

<p>Worry was more clearly disturbing the clerklike gentility of
his face. "It isn't for me to say, and not for you to ask."</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" countered Judith. "Whatever happens, you must
share the responsibility. Sam Torveen has the right to run his
own range his own way. Chunk Osbrook has been killed. Isn't that
murder, Dad? Do you approve?</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron tried to catch Judith's glance; she showed
distress. Ab Cameron marked the page of his book and closed it.
To Judith her father had always been a fair and just and kind
man. His manner, as long as she could remember it, had been mild;
it had been serene, as though untouched by any trouble. But it
occurred to her now, with a definite astonishment, that worry was
real in him.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd been a boy," he reflected. "I'm getting along,
and some things I can't fight against."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>He looked toward his wife, quietly shrugged his shoulders. "I
suppose it is high time Judith knew. Well, Judy, our years here
have not always been pleasant. I am not the kind to wish for
fighting, and fighting is the breath of life to the Heads. I made
my peace with Old Martin long ago. Martin's the sort that has to
be king. It was twenty years back that he came here with six men.
Those hills up there belonged to me. But he had his mind made up
to possess them, so I sold them to him. I knew if I didn't I
should have a hard enemy. We have been good neighbors because I
have let him have his will. Peace meant more to me than war. And
still does&mdash;but Bill Head now repeats the whole thing, and
Bill is a less scrupulous man than his father."</p>

<p>"A brutal man," said Judith. "He whips his horses&mdash;he
whips anything that stands against him."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Ab Cameron quietly.</p>

<p>Judith flamed up at once. "I'd never, never let him use a
single man of our crew to put against Sam Torveenl Never!"</p>

<p>"No?" murmured Ab. He kept shaking his head; and to Judith he
seemed older than he was. "It is easy to say, Daughter. But you
know nothing of the will of the Heads. I have lived my life under
that will. It is a hard thing. This is why I wish you were a boy.
I have remained humble, because this someday will be your ranch
and I do not want you to inherit the Head anger. You could not
fight against Bill."</p>

<p>He left his chair and walked into another room. Judith said:
"Mother, how long has it been like this?"</p>

<p>"Your father," said Mrs. Cameron, "has tried to be a
Christian. In this country it has been hard to practise. I have
often seen him come home bitterly humiliated." She looked up at
her daughter and she smiled sadly. "He has had his troubles,
Judith, for he was never meant to live in a wild land."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," protested Judith.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron shrugged her shoulders, a gesture of resignation
Judith had often noticed before. "Life can't always be as we
dream it to be, in youth. Don't you get in too much of a hurry to
find that out." She quit talking, and her smile became dim and
impersonal.</p>

<p>Bill Head stood at the doorway, stiffly polite. He removed his
hat and said, "Good evening," and came in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron nodded. Rising, she went back into the kitchen
and swung the door behind her. Bill Head bowed a little, his
stiff yellow hair accenting the ruddy, bold health along his
solid face. He said to Judith, "I regret my temper. You can sting
a man hard sometimes," and stood waiting. But Judith kept her
silence, suddenly proud and cool in this uncertain moment. Bill
Head's hazel eyes were thoughtful. They were turning angry
again.</p>

<p>He said: "I have heard talk of a glove this Surratt's carrying
in his pocket. I intend to get it."</p>

<p>The devil of malice was in her. "So far, Bill, you haven't had
much luck with the man."</p>

<p>His light skin swiftly took on a deeper stain of color. A
dumb, wicked anger boiled against his setup barriers and showed
through. "I intend to get it," he repeated stubbornly. "Do you
want me to bring it to you?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"A woman's glove in Leslie's possession leaves scandal against
any woman who ever went with him. You know that. And you went
with him now and then."</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, "I went with him. For there were times,
Bill, when he was gay and charming. He treated a woman always as
she wished to be treated, neither more nor less. And he wasn't
brutal. He never was that."</p>

<p>"He was a devil!" ground out Bill. "I understand him and I
know it would be just his way, in dyin', to leave that glove on
the cabin floor to tell me he won something from a woman I
couldn't get."</p>

<p>"I'm the woman you mean."</p>

<p>He burst out: "How can I help believing it sometimes!"</p>

<p>"Believe it if you want," she told him. "Your opinion doesn't
matter to me. It never will."</p>

<p>His lips rolled and came together and he held himself in a way
that told her his desire was to beat compliance into her with his
big, savage fists. Yet even then he caught his rage and held it
in the full grip of his will. This, she thought then, was the
most dreaded quality in him&mdash;a stubborn streak that wouldn't
surrender. His voice was at once full of heavy authority. "You
have had your fun torturing me, Judith. I know that. But wait. I
have a turn coming."</p>

<p>He went out with his shoulders slunk forward, the darkness of
the night momentarily blinding him. He collided with a Cameron
rider. He put his hands forward and seized the man and tightened
his fingers into that man's flesh until the other cursed at him.
He threw the man aside and plowed on to his horse, galloping up
the road under the dim shining of the moon.</p>

<p>Some distance beyond the bridge he swung into the trees and
pulled to a walk. Darkness here was a dripping, curdled
substance; and out of that darkness emerged a cautious voice.</p>

<p>"Bill Head?"</p>

<p>Head threw his horse around, swinging to face the sound. He
drew his gun and trained it on the blackness. He said, "Yes,"
listening with his head cocked.</p>

<p>"This is a tip," said the voice. "Torveen's shifting his sheep
tonight. Going on up the hill to the meadow across from Carson
Ford."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"What do you care? Take it or leave it. Go there and you'll
see. Now ride on and don't be curious."</p>

<p>After Bill Head had circled around and gone up the
trail&mdash;quite a long while afterwards&mdash;the man came out
of the brush and rode down the hill. Near the Cameron place he
walked his pony and bent low in the saddle; at the bridge he dug
in his spurs and crossed on the gallop; and kept this fugitive
flight all the way up the ridge. This was the kid, Ferd Bowie,
racing home.</p>

<p>They had the sheep already moving away from the meadow into
the uphill trail. They were waiting for Bowie, grumbling and
restless from the suspense. Torveen said irritably, "Here he
comes," and they all turned to watch the shadow of horse and
rider break forward from the darkness. Bowie was breathing fast
when he stopped in front of them.</p>

<p>"Where the hell you been?" demanded Torveen.</p>

<p>"I got cut off by a couple fellows. Had to duck all over the
country. It was Hughie Grant, I think, and that-vblack rascal I
don't like&mdash;Steve Koemer."</p>

<p>"Get up there in front of the sheep," grunted Torveen.</p>

<p>Bowie vanished. Perrigo and Ed were already out of sight. The
sheep milled palely at the trees, feeding into a trail narrow
enough to hold them without flank-guards. The shuffle of their
hooves and the quavering, defenseless echo of their bleating
softened. Surratt followed, at once enveloped by a churned-up
forest dust. Torveen, behind him, swore in a jerky,
discomfortable fashion. "How long does it take a man to get used
to woollies?"</p>

<p>A slow wind ruffled its waterfall echoes through the treetops
again. A chill came off the Gray Bull peaks. Out of the
hills&mdash;out of the far sweep of canyon and ridge and pine-
deep&mdash;prowled the ghostly, abysmal feel of loneliness, of
mystery primitive and unsolvable. This was night, with night's
riddle walking on his nerves. It was, Surratt thought, the cold
touch of a nameless and timeless question, reaching out of a
black sky into a man's heart. His thinking went down a long
spiral, wistful and hopeless. There were no answers for him. A
little sunlight and laughter, the memory of a man's farewell grin
by campfire, the brief flash of a woman's shining
eyes&mdash;these were all he had or ever would have to answer the
riddle. Time ran on. His life was a series of stray pictures
fading out behind him; he rode now with a band of sheep, and
presently from some other hill in some other year, this too would
be a fading picture. There was a melody in the world, for he had
heard it, and there was some meaning for men in the world, for he
had seen other men's faces light up on discovering it. Neither
was for him; vaguely, as a traveler on a lonely trail, he had
seen the lamp-glow of hope far away&mdash;and then had passed
on.</p>

<p>"You can be damned silent when you please."</p>

<p>This was Torveen's voice in the rear; fretted and pitched to
uncertainty. Torveen was a man with ambition, and ambition made
men feel the risk and the disappointment of living too much. For
one without hope nothing much mattered. A day was a day. He
pulled himself out of this remote thinking with a real
effort.</p>

<p>"I was wondering," he said. "The big ranches all seem over to
the north, yonder of the river. What's the other
way&mdash;south?"</p>

<p>"Just hills and timber&mdash;and some small fellows running a
few cows in their vest pockets. What's that?"</p>

<p>Listening, Surratt heard nothing, and said so. Torveen swore
indistinctly. "I'm not a man to ride easy, like you. Some things
I will never understand. How could you smile at the Heads, with
Perrigo on your back and the wolves snappin' at your heels?"</p>

<p>"When you're a wolf, kid, you get to know wolves."</p>

<p>They drifted this way for an hour or more, the dust and the
sheep smell rolling back. Faint glittering patches of sky broke
now and then over them. It was colder; the wind had steadied to a
straight, westerly run. Through the trees Surratt saw a cigarette
tip jiggling. A horse sneezed.</p>

<p>The sheep walked faster and the shape of a rider floated down
the trail. "This," grumbled Perrigo, "is the place."</p>

<p>Surratt rode into the clearing. Ed and the kid came back and
all of them halted here on the edge of the trees. "You sure you
want to stick at this alone?" said Torveen.</p>

<p>"That's all right." Surratt walked his horse across the meadow
and stopped at its northern edge. The river murmured sibilantly
along its sightless bottom. Far below, the lights of Carson Ford
were winking through a thin fog mist. Torveen had followed. He
remained beside Surratt, indecisiveness plainly controlling him.
He scratched a match and lifted it to his cigarette; his cheeks
were strained, with none of his old laughter visible. When the
match died the darkness was a deeper thing. He watched the lights
of Carson Ford.</p>

<p>"They make a pretty show," he murmured.</p>

<p>"It's a land that gets under your skin," said Surratt.</p>

<p>"Yeah," murmured Torveen. He turned away, "I'll bring some
grub up to you first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>Perrigo's voice came across the meadow, curt and quick. "What
you doin' over that way, Sam?"</p>

<p>Torveen stopped. He said: "What?"</p>

<p>Perrigo's tone ran up the scale: "Surratt&mdash;that you?"</p>

<p>Surratt spun on his heels. Torveen grunted: "Surratt's here
with me." The sheep were shifting in the meadow, as they had been
before; but they were recoiling from the far trees, spreading
gently and uneasily this way. It was a sign. Surratt's eyes swept
that darkness with a risen vigilance. Perrigo's challenge slammed
across the darkness.</p>

<p>"Then who's walkin' in that yonder corner!"</p>

<p>Torveen became a hunched, moving shape. His voice was low; it
snapped back to Surratt. "Get out of here, Buck." He went
charging toward Perrigo.</p>

<p>Surratt stood fast, identifying a shape over on the southern
edge of the meadow; it moved away from the trees, and blended
with that darkness&mdash;and became distinct again. There was a
pressure yonder, pushing the sheep steadily. He lifted his gun.
He called: "Sing out, you over there," and stretched the barrel
on that shifting figure. There was no answer. But Ferd Bowie's
voice rose unexpectedly on his right, where Torveen was.</p>

<p>"That you, Surratt?"</p>

<p>"Shut up, kid." Surratt let a long moment run by; and
fired.</p>

<p>The shadow wheeled away; it faded and he saw no more of it.
But the long echoes of his gun struck all the surrounding trees
and woke a disaster latent and crouched on that southern side. A
voice, as calm and as sure as fate, said: "Push 'em over," and
riders slashed from the brush in one broadside rank and rushed
deliberately against the sheep. Dropped to a knee and coolly
sighting his target in this confusion, he saw the wool-white tide
break toward him, body jammed to body, a senseless bleating
lifting up. He fired then and discovered no break in that wall of
advancing riders. Torveen and Perrigo and Bowie and Ed let go a
solid blast. It rocked that line of riders; it broke that rank's
solidarity. Horsemen streamed tangentially against Torveen's
position and the night pulsed with the abrupt, opening explosions
of a general answer. One shot withered past Surratt. But then
another bullet sliced the ground in front of him and its sound
was on his right hand where he had no reason to expect hostility
to be. He swung that way, trying to penetrate the black. Dropping
alertly back on his haunches he saw the pale bloom of muzzle-
light flash up in the trees, not far from where Torveen should be
standing.</p>

<p>A sheep struck him and rolled him over on his elbows. He swung
himself to his feet, at once involved in this pale stream rushing
at him. He made three long jumps, was caught in the tide and
carried with it; and dug in his feet and lunged again. There was
a sapling pine at hand. He got behind this and put his arms
around it and braced himself there. Looking behind him, he saw
the end of Sam Torveen's woollies; they were at the lip of the
canyon and the leaders were falling over and the mass struggled
forward, confused and blind and witless, pressure throwing them
out into that space. He saw the white, solid glow they made at
the edge of the canyon, like water at the edge of a falls. The
sound of their bellowing and dumb whinnying was oppressive in his
ears. The thing turned him mad. He braced himself by the tree and
spotted roving shapes in the meadow. He fired and struck; a horse
went over in a sailing circle. Torveen and Torveen's men were
drilling away with their guns, and the attacking crew now was
scattered and withdrawing. An even, controlled voice rallied that
crew, in the trees.</p>

<p>"Back here&mdash;back here."</p>

<p>The voice bothered him, until his memory supplied a name. It
was Bill Head over there, faithful to his own stubborn
intentions. A few stray sheep ran the meadows in circles, and
dropped and struggled as they were shot down by the Crow Track
men. A bullet struck the tree behind which Surratt stood,
shivering it. Powder smell began to roll with the wind; Torveen's
furious calling sought out Bill Head and damned him and blasted
him. But the sheep in the meadow were nearly all dead and the
rest were at the bottom of the canyon, sending back no complaint.
Head's men remained screened by the far trees, taking desultory
shots in the darkness. They were moving around the brush and
Surratt thought they were swinging aside to have a try at
Torveen's position. Then Bill Head's voice came casually into the
clearing. "There's your sheep, Sam. It should be a hint to you.
If it isn't, I'll make it a little stronger in the near
future."</p>

<p>A round blast rushed from Torveen's position by way of reply.
A Crow Track rider at once swore in a stricken way and somebody
began violently to argue with Bill Head. The crew, Surratt
guessed, wanted to come on and finish the job. It was Head's
indomitable will that held them from that, for Crow Track's
firing suddenly ceased and the party retreated through the
timber. Listening closely, Surratt heard the bunch reach some
near-by trail and go along it without haste. In a little while
silence came fully to the meadow.</p>

<p>Torveen called out anxiously: "Surratt?"</p>

<p>Surratt left his tree, mind narrowing around the meaning of
those two shots thrown at him from the right flank, where no Head
rider had been. He walked across the meadow slowly and reached
his partners and identified the three dissimilar shapes of
Torveen and Ed and Perrigo vaguely grouped there. He couldn't see
Ferd Bowie at all. A long, prowling anger was in him then, but he
held his voice to softness as he called. "Kid."</p>

<p>Ferd Bowie answered, ten yards away. Bowie's feet were moving
along the brush, unevenly. "Yeah?" he said, and continued to
shift position.</p>

<p>"What was your idea of callin' to me just before the ball
started?"</p>

<p>Torveen murmured: "What's this?" Surratt saw him turn and step
nearer; Perrigo and Ed were swinging up, the sound of his voice
seemed to attract them. Ferd Bowie's feet were still fiddling;
his body remained out of sight. His answer was flat, it was
sullen.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to go throwin' any lead till I knew where you
was, Surratt."</p>

<p>"So," murmured Surratt. The others were listening carefully.
They were waiting for him to speak again. But he didn't speak and
the silence began to carry a strain. Perrigo softly
retreated.</p>

<p>Torveen rolled a cigarette in this stillness and struck a
match, which was pure carelessness; for the light made a plain
target out of him. Surratt saw the man's face to be loose and
discouraged then. In the following darkness Torveen spoke as
though all his energy were gone. "Well, we lost the sheep."</p>

<p>Surratt's tone ran out easy and gentle. "I told you this was a
wolf's game, Sam."</p>

<p>"What's left now?" said Torveen.</p>

<p>"Turn wolf."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. ODD ENDS</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT?" said Torveen.</p>

<p>In this darkness was a puzzle. Surratt's voice was changing;
it was amused now, seeming to catch the tune of a laughter he
felt. The group came nearer him, closely listening. "I told you,"
he murmured, "that this was a game no man learned except in
sorrow and when he learned it he wasn't the same man any more.
I'm telling you, because I know. Which road would Bill Head be
taking home?"</p>

<p>Torveen said: "He went down the hill, so he'll cross the ridge
and go around by Cameron's bridge."</p>

<p>"There's a closer way," Surratt remarked. He was smiling,
though they could not see that. "We'll ride a little."</p>

<p>Torveen broke in doubtfully: "Wait..."</p>

<p>"No," said Surratt, "you've got nothing to lose. This is my
fun."</p>

<p>He went into the trees for his horse and came to the meadow
and crossed it, waiting at the edge of the canyon for them to
follow. He said: "Perrigo, you and the kid ride in front of me."
They hung back a moment and he heard Perrigo's wind whistling in
his throat. His voice sharpened. "Go ahead." It pushed them
forward, into the slanting trail. They went down that uneasy
ledge single file, into the rustling blackness of the canyon. A
single sheep, somehow surviving the slaughter, stood halfway down
the trail. They drove it ahead and came to the margin of the
sibilant river. There was an eddy just above the ford and as they
took to the water, following the shallow gravel bar across, the
bodies of dead sheep drifted from the eddy and bumped them and
turned the horses nervous. They gained the far shore.</p>

<p>Perrigo was leading. But he stopped, not knowing what to
do.</p>

<p>"Take us the quick way to Head's ranch," ordered Surratt.</p>

<p>"There's Carson Ford," pointed out Perrigo. "It's Blackjack
Smith's town. We got no business passin' through it."</p>

<p>"Play a poor stack as strong as a big stack, Nick. Go
ahead."</p>

<p>They went along the road, swinging toward the settlement at a
steady canter. There was a light shining across the street like a
yellow fence; and a man came out of the saloon, warned by their
approach, and turned his face toward them. But they went through
Carson Ford without stopping, and on along the bend of the gorge.
A little later Perrigo spoke back to them: "We turn." His shadow
shot across this road, into another one slanting up the side of
the gorge's right-hand shoulder. The pace dropped to a walk. Five
hundred feet above the road, Surratt saw the river vaguely
shining below and the wink of the saloon lamps; afterwards they
passed into the trees.</p>

<p>Surratt said: "How far?"</p>

<p>"A mile."</p>

<p>"Push faster."</p>

<p>The wind scoured down this stiff-pitched slope and the touch
of the night was cold. After a while the slope leveled and they
were running freely through a black arch, along a corduroy trail.
They swung out of this presently and came upon another road
climbing from the lowlands. Directly above them the lights of the
Head ranch made bright beacons against an obscure sky.</p>

<p>"Watch out," said Torveen. "We're going to run into something
here."</p>

<p>Surratt pushed ahead of Perrigo and, thus leading them, came
into the Crow Track yard. The doorway of the ranch was open, a
yellow beam flushing out of it; and Surratt saw a man sitting
there on the porch. It was, he realized, the cripple he had seen
in Morgantown&mdash;Old Martin Head. But at the moment he was
keening the yard for deceit, his senses reaching swiftly out. On
the right stood a bunkhouse, vaguely showing its lampshine
through the windows. One solitary man walked forward from that
direction.</p>

<p>"Keep him under your wing, Ed," murmured Surratt.</p>

<p>Martin Head's body swung forward in the chair. His challenge
rapped them taciturnly. "Who's there?"</p>

<p>Ed had gone over to the advancing puncher. Ed's voice was a
murmur, soft and easy. Surratt's straying impressions came back
to him, with no discovered trouble. The place was unguarded. "Go
to the bunkhouse and drag out everything you can move. Put it all
in a pile. You'll probably find a kerosene can there. Dump it on
the pile."</p>

<p>Martin Head called: "Who's there?" He did not need to speak
again, for they crossed over the beam of light from the house,
plainly in his view. Surratt dropped from his horse and walked up
the steps.</p>

<p>"Your son," he said, "just paid us a visit and we're poorer
for it by a band of sheep gone over the cliff. Your ways are
severe."</p>

<p>"You've got the nerve of a better man," growled Old Martin.
His hands lay above the blanket covering his legs. The big,
square torso lifted and thickened. Even in a chair he was
impressive, with a quality of savage authority flowing from him;
it was easy to understand why other men feared him. One voice
rose from the bunkhouse area in bitter protest. The sound of
things being smashed came distinctly to the porch. Old Martin
said:</p>

<p>"I'd judge you better, Surratt, if it wasn't for the dog you
keep in your company."</p>

<p>Surratt had not known until then that Perrigo stood behind
him. The little man had crept that quietly up the steps. Turning,
Surratt saw a queer and mortal hatred pouring from Perrigo's eyes
across the interval to Old Martin. It was a strange thing to
see&mdash;the heights to which a man's passion could go. The
temper of this little man threw its toxin through him; it shook
his throat when he spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't forget you kicked me off this ranch once."</p>

<p>"Perrigo," stated Old Martin brutally, "I have ordered you to
be shot. Sooner or later my son will do that."</p>

<p>The quick swing of Perrigo's shoulders was something Surratt
expected and waited for. He threw his body against Perrigo and
reached out and caught Perrigo's lifting hand. He drove his knee
into the man's stomach, and got the risen gun with a wrench of
his arm. Perrigo fell off the porch; he landed on his knees and
crouched that way, sucking back the breath Surratt had knocked
out of him.</p>

<p>"No," Surratt said evenly.</p>

<p>Ed came around the corner. "You want that pile lighted
now?"</p>

<p>"Go in this house and find Bill Head's room and drag out his
personal belongings."</p>

<p>He was watching Old Martin Head, and there was an admiration
in him for the bulldog qualities he saw on that rocky face. Old
Martin's stare had a force that was like a physical blow.</p>

<p>"I thought you had nerve. What's a bonfire of personal
belongings? If I was in your shoes it would be man for man."</p>

<p>But Surratt was smiling and he was reckless and laughter came
out of him softly. "This is your ranch, I take it. Well, it is
your son and the men he led that I'm payin' my compliments to.
Not you. There's no point in this little visit&mdash;except a
warning to them."</p>

<p>Old Martin lifted his hand and pointed a heavy finger at
Surratt. "This was not your quarrel in the beginning. Why is it
now?"</p>

<p>Surratt looked at him, slow and soft with his answer "Torveen
did me a favor."</p>

<p>"So," grunted Old Martin. The sharpness of his glance was an
interesting thing. "I saw you smile in Morgantown. I see you
smile now. Is there that much fun left in life? It is no idle
question. I have long wondered."</p>

<p>Ed came from the house carrying a load of Bill Head's clothes.
They had lighted the bonfire, its glow brightly rising through
the dark. "The fun," said Surratt, no longer smiling, "lasts a
little while. It is something to look back on when a man rides
down the trail alone."</p>

<p>"You have a reason for coming here," growled Old Martin. "I
still do not understand what it is."</p>

<p>Torveen came away from the fire with the others. He said:
"They're comin' up the trail, Buck." He wheeled to the foot of
the porch and put his eyes on Old Martin. "You tell
Bill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You tell Bill," broke in Surratt evenly, "that no trail in
the world runs straight. Sooner or later it comes to another
trail, where other men ride. I have found it so. He will find it
so."</p>

<p>The plunder from the bunkhouse made a high broad blaze in the
night as Surratt ran to his horse. There was even then a
murmuring down the road and all the men here were anxious to go.
Torveen led them past the fire, into the darkness of the hills
again. Surratt crowded up against Perrigo, returning the man's
gun without comment.</p>

<p>He was laughing softly to himself as they ran down the stiff
slope. Carson Ford was directly below, but they came out of the
timber well away from the settlement, reached the gorge road and
cantered north with it as far as the Cameron bridge. They crossed
here, racing up another ridge. An hour afterwards they were
home.</p>

<p>Torveen said: "Nick, you'll take the first watch."</p>

<p><br> Surratt sat at the foot of the porch, under the late
afternoon's hard sunlight, with his pipe bitten between his
teeth, with the smoke rolling up from its bowl. Idle thus, his
mind kept returning to Ferd Bowie, and his glance lifted to the
far skyline and remained enigmatically there. The kid was twenty,
but all the evil ways of the world were known to him. There was
an excuse for this&mdash;for a wild life that knew no
gentleness&mdash;but nothing could excuse treachery. It was
Surratt's slow decision. He had a job to do here and hated
it.</p>

<p>Torveen came from the office and squatted in the yard. He
said: "I still don't get the reason why you went to Head's last
night."</p>

<p>"Bother you?"</p>

<p>"You're not a man to make idle moves," pointed out Torveen.
"You had some reason in your coco for doin' that. It's the reason
I can't get."</p>

<p>He held his peace. A horse in the corral began to lash out at
another horse and for a little while the whole bunch in there
whirled around the compound, beating up heavy dust</p>

<p>"An experiment," mused Surratt.</p>

<p>"Did it work?"</p>

<p>"We'll know more about that later."</p>

<p>Torveen grinned. "You're a hell of a mysterious guy."</p>

<p>"A good many things puzzle me, Sam," observed Surratt. "And
it's men that make the puzzles. I like to find out why."</p>

<p>Torveen's grin disappeared, leaving him uncertain and
irritated. "Well, Bill Head knocked the props from under us and
it looks like our move next, but I don't know what it is."</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>"Wait for what? They done what they wanted to do, didn't they?
They got rid of the sheep&mdash;and I'm busted. That's the end of
the story."</p>

<p>"You sure?" asked Surratt. But he shook his head and explained
himself. "We can do one of two things. We can strike back or we
can wait out Bill Head's next play."</p>

<p>"How'd we strike back?" demanded Torveen.</p>

<p>Surratt smiled in a tight, narrow way. "Turn Indian. In three
days, if we were industrious about it, we could tie up the roads
in these hills so tight nobody'd care to use 'em. Drop a shot in
front of a man ridin' along the trail and you make that man
pretty nervous."</p>

<p>"So, why not?" suggested Torveen, who always liked quick
results.</p>

<p>"Better to wait," opined Surratt shrewdly. "Have no fear. Head
will not let it stand like this. He's played his hand well. But
it is my observation that when a man wins one jack pot he never
has sense enough to quit tryin' for another."</p>

<p>"You don't know Bill Head."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;maybe not. But if he's as cool a fellow as you
suggest he'll lose no time catchin' on to the meanin' of his junk
burned in his own yard. I meant that as a little reminder of what
four stray men can do. It was a way of tellin' him that he didn't
win any battle by driving a band of sheep over the cliff. As long
as we stay in the hills neither he nor any man in his crew is
safe. It's an experiment, like I said. The experiment is to see
how long it takes him to find that out for himself."</p>

<p>"Then," said Torveen vigorously, "we've got no business
hangin' around here where he can hit us."</p>

<p>Surratt smiled a little. "When you set a trap, Sam, you got to
have bait. We're the bait."</p>

<p>Wang walked from the ranch kitchen, slamming the door behind
him. Surratt didn't pay much attention to this tall Manchurian
until he saw Torveen square around. Wang had a bundle wrapped by
burlap under his arm; he wore his good clothes. He stopped by
Torveen.</p>

<p>"I go and not come back. You pay me now."</p>

<p>Torveen got up. "Leavin'?" He looked at Wang carefully.
"You're too young a man to be goin' back to China yet, Wang."</p>

<p>"You pay me," said Wang distinctly.</p>

<p>Torveen said: "You been here twenty years, and now you pull
out on five minutes' notice. Why?"</p>

<p>Wang divided a black, fathomless glance between the two men.
Afterwards he looked to the ground. He gripped the bundle more
securely under his arm. His free hand rose and his finger began
to mark off each word he spoke, lifting and dropping. "Head boy
die. Osbrook die. By'm by more boys die. Too bad. You pay
me."</p>

<p>Torveen stared at Surratt. "He seems to have it figured for
himself." He went over the yard to the office. Wang turned his
glance on Surratt.</p>

<p>"You," he intoned, "you watch."</p>

<p>Torveen came back with a small stack of silver dollars. He put
them into Wang's reaching hand. He said, "All right, Wang,"
briefly and crouched in the dust again. Wang watched him a
moment, purely expressionless. Then he said, "G'bye," and walked
across the yard, toward the Morgantown road.</p>

<p>"First China boy I ever knew that wasn't loyal to his outfit,"
muttered Torveen.</p>

<p>"He's playin' his hunch," said Surratt. "No Chinaman likes to
fight a white man."</p>

<p>"How does he know there's goin' to be a scrap?"</p>

<p>"Any Chinamen in Morgantown?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Lots of 'em. Every ranch around here's got one."</p>

<p>"That's how he knows," said Surratt. He had his eyes on Wang,
watching that stolid shape trudge into the trees; and he saw a
rider come forward from the trees at a gentle trot and
immediately afterwards draw up to a discreet walk. Surratt stood
up. His pipe stiffened between the set of his teeth. Torveen had
his back to the newcomer, but the sound of the man's travel
reacted instantly on his high-strung nerves and made him
instantly rise as the newcomer crossed the bridge and entered the
yard. He was, Surratt thought, a cheerful young man with a very
matter-of-fact face. His eyes went around the yard observingly.
After a moment's pause he said, "How, boy," and remained in the
saddle, his manners keeping him there until an invitation came to
get down. Surratt studied Torveen to discover what the situation
meant. He saw Torveen relax a little and show friendliness.
"Mornin', George. What you doin' over here?"</p>

<p>George gave Surratt a square, frank look. "You're this Buck
Surratt?"</p>

<p>Torveen said: "This fellow's name is George Bernay, Buck."</p>

<p>"I keep a few cows over south of Morgantown," Bernay explained
to Buck, as though he wanted himself fully explained. "That is,
when I can find 'em. This fellow"&mdash;indicating
Torveen&mdash;"and me used to do our scrappin' together at the
Saturday dances."</p>

<p>"You can get down now," said Torveen amiably. "What's in your
craw?"</p>

<p>Bernay got out his cigarette materials and built himself a
smoke, squinting at his fingertips. "I'll stay in the saddle.
Your yard's full of fleas anyhow."</p>

<p>"Hell with you, George."</p>

<p>"Sure. Understand you lost a couple sheep." He was, just then,
licking his cigarette together, but his glance darted to Torveen
to catch the redhead's reaction.</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"Look in your crystal globe," grumbled Torveen, "and see if
you can tell us."</p>

<p>George Bernay lighted his cigarette and took a deep drag, and
seemed satisfied with his handiwork. He punched back the brim of
his hat; there was a white scar irregularly marked across the
sun-bronze of his forehead. "Something always comes next. That's
the kind of a country this is. Funny thing. Billy Temple and me
and Jud Horsfall was a-talkin' about you last night. Poor topic
of conversation, but we was. We sorta decided sheep wasn't much
of a crime."</p>

<p>"Your moral support helps a lot," said Torveen ironically.</p>

<p>"It ill beseems a sport like you to be a-talkin' of morals,"
chided George Bernay. "Well, just thought I'd mention it."</p>

<p>"So, what was it you come here to borrow?" demanded
Torveen.</p>

<p>"Listen to him," remarked George Bernay. "Fact is I just
wandered in to have a look at Surratt. Kind of captured my fancy,
that Morgantown business. Any man," he concluded idly, "who can
run his hand into a nest of bees and not get stung must have a
pretty shookum brand of personal medicine." He threw his
cigarette into the dust. He rubbed the scar with a slow finger.
"See that, Surratt? I got it one time when I almost licked Bill
Head. Some years ago when I thought I was fast enough to dodge
anything. Well, that's the size of my politics. If you see me
again at any time you'll anyhow know who I am. I'll report to the
boys that you look like you could fight. So long." He turned and
went off at a rocking canter and vanished behind the yonder
trees.</p>

<p>"The scoundrel always did talk in parables," complained
Torveen. "It'll take me a couple hours to get at what he was
tryin' to say."</p>

<p>Surratt was gently smiling. "He reminds me of a man I used to
know&mdash;a fellow you'd regret to leave."</p>

<p>"It's odd," observed Torveen, "that something always seems to
remind you of something you knew before."</p>

<p>Surratt gave Torveen a quiet, shadowed glance. "The morning
half of a trail is always fresh and full of new things, kid. But
the afternoon half is a tedious journey, for there's nothing on
it you haven't seen before. It's a fact I'm telling you. I hope
you never have to find it out for yourself. Where's the
boys?"</p>

<p>"Went below Morgantown to have a look."</p>

<p>"Let's have a little scout toward the high meadow."</p>

<p>"Company again," said Torveen and stopped his walking. A rider
came from the northern trees, out of the ridge that held this
meadow away from Cameron Valley. He kept a steady gait all across
the meadow, but his arm lifted as he approached. Torveen's manner
turned at once unfavorable. "I don't get this," he muttered.</p>

<p>The rider came up, a dark-jawed man with the accent of
nervousness about him. He stared briefly at Torveen and then
threw his attention toward Surratt. He reached into his shirt
pocket, producing a folded note. He bent down and gave it to
Surratt.</p>

<p>Surratt opened the note, his head bowed seriously over it a
moment. Afterwards he stared up at the rider. "Yes," he said
without expression and closed his fingers around the paper.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. ACTION</h2>

<p class="first">SHOWING an open relief, the rider pulled his
horse about and went away from the place rapidly. Surratt was
frowning at that disappearing shape, but he could see the sudden
red and violent flush creep across Torveen's roan cheeks. He said
to Torveen: "Who's that rider?"</p>

<p>"A Cameron hand." Torveen wheeled definitely toward Surratt
"Didn't you know it?" he said, challenge riding his tone.</p>

<p>"I wanted to make sure," answered Surratt. He folded the note
along its original creases, and refolded it, his eyes half shut.
Torveen's silence grew enormous, with an unspoken demand for an
explanation in it. The late, low sun threw its bombing brilliance
higher against the trees and shadows were beginning to spread in
blue, irregular pools at the lower edge of the meadow. Surratt
put the note in his pocket "I'm going on a little ride, Sam."</p>

<p>"Be back soon?" The indifference of Torveen's question was
strained and false; he stared down at the ground, his mouth
pressed together.</p>

<p>"I'll be late," Surratt said and went to his horse. He rode
away to the north, without looking back.</p>

<p>Torveen didn't immediately stir from his position in the yard.
He rolled himself a smoke and as long as Surratt remained in
sight his glance covertly followed. He dragged heavy gusts of
smoke into his lungs and expelled them vehemently. The flushed
anger remained on his face; he was like a boy then, sulky and
hurt and suspicious.</p>

<p>"So I guess," he grumbled, "I'm supposed to hang around till
somebody gives me different orders."</p>

<p>He dropped the cigarette and stamped it with his boot. He
wheeled over to his horse. In the saddle, he remained quiet a
moment and seemed to argue with his own impulses. But there was a
rankling emotion in him he could not help and could not kill. For
a little while he debated following Surratt's exact trail. Then
he rejected the idea, galloped over the meadow to the northern
ridge and entered the trees. There was a good spot on top of this
ridge, he knew, where he might stand and watch the Cameron
Valley. If Surratt was traveling that way he'd sooner or later
know about it He was a little ashamed of himself. Yet Sam
Torveen, so rash and ready with his impulses, was possessed by a
jealousy stronger than his shame. There had been in him since
boyhood a single-minded devotion to Judith Cameron; and there was
in him as well these last few days a devout admiration for Buck
Surratt. He owned a loyalty to both these people that had mixed
in it a possessiveness and a queer feeling of inferiority. He
could not explain these things to himself, yet it was true enough
that in Buck Surratt's slow talk and rare smile was a quality
that made him feel humble and somehow inexperienced; and always
he had seen in Judith a womanliness that everlastingly made him
doubt his ability to win her.</p>

<p>He was a very human man. And when he had seen Surratt and
Judith standing so serene and so fully wise, side by
side&mdash;these two whom he regarded as better people than he
could ever be&mdash;he had a deep and foreboding fear that he
would lose them both. Strangle the breath of that jealous thing
as he might, it came to life again and blew against his nerves.
His own loyalty was an absolute emotion; and he could not bear to
think of their loyalty to him being any less absolute. These two
owned a strength he had to share. To be left out of their
thoughts was like sunlight going from the sky.</p>

<p>Vague to his understanding, these queer and human reactions
pushed Sam Torveen up the side of the ridge, past the
woodcutter's camp, across the corduroy road and to the summit.
Jogging more leisurely toward a cleared spot on the ridge, from
which he might command a view of the Cameron buildings, a far
sound of ponies pounding through yonder brush arrested him. His
nerves had been cocked for trouble these many days; and now he
slipped off the trail and swung about and stared into the
thickening twilight.</p>

<p>They burst around the bend, these riders; three of them in
single file, with the leading man strained forward in his saddle
and the one at the rear lagging a little and keeping his glance
behind. It was that rear man, Perrigo, Torveen identified first.
He pushed his horse out of the brush then and into the path.</p>

<p>Ferd Bowie led the file. The sudden shadow of Torveen across
the trail wrenched Bowie back in the saddle and his arm dropped
and for a swirling moment some blind impulse trembled in him.
Torveen called again, more sharply. Ferd Bowie swore: "By God,
Torveen!" He hauled his horse to a plunging halt. Ed and Perrigo
overshot the trail and came abreast; all three of them stared at
Torveen. They were deeply breathing, they were charged with an
electric excitement.</p>

<p>Perrigo said: "We got to get out of here."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It's Peyrolles and his bunch comin' behind," growled
Bowie.</p>

<p>"Where you been?" demanded Torveen. "What you doin' over here
anyhow?"</p>

<p>The answer lagged. Perrigo kept stirring in his saddle. He
said at last: "That's all right, Sam."</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;come on," muttered Bowie. He moved his hand at
Torveen, he shoved his horse at Torveen. "This is no place to
stay."</p>

<p>Peyrolles was down the trail, riding fast with his outfit. The
sound of that pursuit was filling the stillness of this hill.</p>

<p>"How many?" Torveen snapped.</p>

<p>"Eight-nine, I guess."</p>

<p>Torveen said: "Get into the brush. We don't run. Why should we
run? Whose trail is this? To hell with Hank Peyrolles! Get in the
brush!"</p>

<p>"Here, here," grunted Perrigo. "You ain't..."</p>

<p>But Torveen stared at the little man savagely. "Run, if you're
afraid, Nick." Stung raw by his thinking, he went rash and wild.
There was no consideration in him. The injustice of the recent
hours was all that his head could hold; it could hold no thought
of safety now. Five minutes of reflection would have changed his
mind, but the moments rushed him to his decision and so he acted
on his strongest impulses. Ferd Bowie put his horse into the
brush, Ed soon following. Perrigo circled and got into the
timber. They were all out of sight save Torveen, who faced the
up-drumming echoes of the coming Peyrolles.</p>

<p>Perrigo said insistently: "Get in here, Sam!"</p>

<p>"I don't shoot my turkey without fair warnin'," retorted
Torveen bitterly. He stood up in the saddle, he sat down.</p>

<p>He drew his gun and rested it across the horn. Stiff and still
in the shadows, he watched the column of Peyrolles' men turn and
bend and rush forward.</p>

<p>"You're on my range!" yelled Torveen. "Turn around and get the
hell out of here!"</p>

<p>The sound of his warning flattened against that group; it
broke Peyrolles' outfit into fragments. Horses wheeled and bucked
against the dimming light; and riders boiled into the shelter of
the trees. Peyrolles was a defiant shape still on the trail. He
yelled: "You fresh young punk!" And then took a snap shot at
Torveen and threw his horse aside.</p>

<p>Unmoved by the shot and too stubborn to give ground, Torveen
began a steady firing.</p>

<p>Peyrolles' horse dropped without a sound and Peyrolles yelled
again. A rider behind Peyrolles slowly reeled out of the saddle;
then the trail was empty and the firing began to slash and strike
and cry through the thicket. There was no clear object on which
Torveen could pin a bullet then. He pulled against his reins,
reluctantly backing into shelter. He poised his gun, waiting for
a quick aim. Of a sudden a bullet whipping through these woods
slugged his shoulder with a definite blow. His horse kept backing
away; Torveen tried to lift his gun and could not. He tried to
seize the horn to keep from tipping, but his arm refused to obey.
He fell slowly out of the saddle and lay in the dust, none of his
muscles helping him. Somebody rushed at him through the brush. He
heard Nick Perrigo's voice taut and singing, calling his name;
the smashing echoes of this wicked fusillade grew deeper.
Blackness rushed across the world. He said in a windless whisper,
"Perrigo," and knew nothing more.</p>

<p>Leaving the ranch, Surratt went up to the near-by sheep meadow
and crossed it and entered that trail along which the sheep had
been driven the night before. He had read the note hurriedly.
Now, to make sure of what he had read, he pulled it from his
pocket and smoothed it. The writing was a woman's writing, the
paper was the sort a woman would use&mdash;and a Cameron man had
delivered it. So it seemed genuine. It read:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Unless something very urgent keeps you away,
please be at Carson Ford this evening at 7 o'clock. I've learned
something you should know. Remember what I told you the last time
I saw you.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Judith</span>.</p>

<p><br>
He lighted a match and touched the edge of the paper. He
stopped long enough to watch it char and drop to the ground; and
he got down and stamped it beneath his boot. The sun was gone.
The world swiftly turned blue and pale violet and a wind began
drifting down the slope. There was someone riding behind him
rapidly. He got into the saddle and pulled about&mdash;and
discovered Annette Carvel coming behind him.</p>

<p>She smiled at him frankly. "You going my way or am I going
yours?"</p>

<p>He lifted his hat to her, whereupon her eyes began to light
up. He said: "Which way is that, Annette?"</p>

<p>"Oh, any way. It doesn't much matter. I like the way you speak
my name."</p>

<p>She fell beside him as a matter of course. Her eyes strayed to
his face and studied it, the smile still softening her lips; and
then she settled back in her saddle and rode silently with
him.</p>

<p>She had a free, careless way that rose either from boldness or
from childlike faith. Curious always as to the motives of people,
he quietly considered this girl and remained puzzled. One thing
was strong in her, stronger than any other quality: a love of
life that made her eager and pleasing. The lifting of a man's hat
could make her gay, the quiet calling of her name could make her
eyes glow. In her vivid personality goodness and badness seemed
close together, so close that no man knew where one left off and
the other began, or if either mattered much. There were hungers,
he told himself, that sometimes made nice distinctions in morals
unimportant.</p>

<p>A mile onward she spoke to him very quietly: "Do I bother
you?"</p>

<p>It startled him. He said promptly: "No."</p>

<p>"That helps," she said candidly. "I don't want to be a
nuisance. But it was a nice feeling to talk to you the other day.
So I thought I'd like to do it again." Her eyes sought his face
for expression. "Don't you ever get lonely?"</p>

<p>"For what, Annette?"</p>

<p>Her shoulders stirred. She spread her arms toward the closing
twilight, as if to grasp something that could not be seen, could
not be captured. "Oh, there is so much in this world. It must be
so, or else why should people feel the loss of things they never
have had? That's&mdash;that's what I mean. Things just beyond you
that you'd go to find, if you knew where to find them."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands together, enormously pleased. "I knew
you'd be a help. Buck, where are they to be found?"</p>

<p>He hated to answer. But honesty compelled him. "You are going
to be older&mdash;and much sadder&mdash;before you get the truth
of that."</p>

<p>She had a way of pondering his words. She rode now in
thoughtful quietness, a faint scowl penciled across her forehead.
He could see that vaguely in the thickening shadows. They came
out of the trail into the upper meadow, where the sheep had been
destroyed. She followed him to the edge of the canyon. There was
a remote break in the hill solitude, a ruffling of faint sound
waves somewhere to the west. He listened carefully to them. The
lights of Carson Ford glittered far below. He got off his horse
and sat down at the edge of the descending trail.</p>

<p>"You're going there?" she asked him. "It's a bad place for you
to be."</p>

<p>"When it gets darker."</p>

<p>She dismounted and came over to sit beside him, near enough
for him to feel the occasional stirring of her shoulder. He
thought then that she had a high sensitiveness to the world; that
it kept troubling and lifting and turning her. Gray and steel-
black shadows were filling the canyon in a way that made it seem
without bottom. The murmuring of the river grew fainter below.
Her shoulder rested frankly against him. She was speaking with an
intensity that was strange.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm afraid of, Buck. That gloomy blackness down
there. It's so cruel. Like the end of the world. I hate the
thought of getting old. I lie awake at nights thinking about
it&mdash;that I shall get old and never be pretty again. And I
pray that before I get ugly I shall have found something. I don't
know what. But when people are young it is not just for sleeping
and eating. If there's a feeling like craziness in me I know it
was put there for a reason. Maybe for love, maybe for heartbreak.
But I know it wasn't meant to be bottled up. It would be cruel of
God to put so much feeling in anybody just to be wasted. I pray
that I may have whatever is meant for me before I grow old, so
that I can laugh and cry&mdash;and then be content. If it isn't
to be that way, I'd rather die now."</p>

<p>The fire and color of her words struck into his imagination.
She was a vessel full to spilling; her voice sang with the
richness of her desire. He sat bowed and taciturn and moved to a
pity that was infinitely tender. He could not tell her he had
seen the shapes of such dreams over his own campfire&mdash;and
had watched them fade; and that, save for the blind operation of
chance in a blind world, they would fade for her. Surratt heard
her voice lift to him, soft and whispered and urgent.</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>He swung toward her, puzzled again. Her face was round and
graphic in the smooth darkness. Her shoulders were turned to him
and she was waiting wordlessly.</p>

<p>He said: "It wouldn't mean anything."</p>

<p>That murmured, begging word came again to him. "Please!"</p>

<p>"Don't make a mistake about this, Annette," he told her. He
reached out and brought her forward with his long arms. Her face
was there for him; and then the wild, primitive fire of this girl
came through her lips and shook him more than he believed he
could be shaken. There was shock in that troubled and passionate
and desiring kiss. It woke something near to savagery in him. He
pulled her solidly against him and felt the deep willingness of
her response. He drew away and got to his feet, thoroughly
disturbed.</p>

<p>He said gruffly: "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>She was up beside him; her cheeks were pale in the faint
moonlight, her breathing very rapid. But he saw how she smiled,
so wisely, so sadly&mdash;yet so shiningly tender. "Sorry! Oh,
I'm not! It was like a world opening up for me! Don't be
sorry!"</p>

<p>"A man's kiss?" he said, more and more disturbed.</p>

<p>She murmured: "No&mdash;not just any man's kiss, Buck." She
came to him again and lifted on her toes, and her lips brushed
his cheek briefly and coolly. She was laughing in the darkness;
she was happy. "That's my thanks to you."</p>

<p>He said: "It would be safer for you, Annette, if you knew more
about men."</p>

<p>She walked away from him to her horse. "I know more about men
than you dream. But you are not like other men&mdash;and that's
why you've made me happy. This is one of the things I can
remember a long time from now, like I told you. You shouldn't be
sorry&mdash;and good night, my dear."</p>

<p>She was away in the darkness before he could answer. He got
aboard his horse and took to the narrow ledge leading into the
bottom of the canyon. He was remembering all this with a growing
wonder; it rode with him across the gravelly ford. But, going
down the dark river road toward the settlement, the tricky
qualities of this night aroused his attention and pushed the
recent scene to the back of his mind.</p>

<p>A hundred yards this side of the saloon he stopped to examine
the settlement carefully. Two horses stood in front of the saloon
and a broad beam of light ran across the road. One man loitered
on Blackjack's porch. Elsewhere he could see no life. Not
particularly satisfied, he advanced on the saloon, left his horse
and went inside.</p>

<p>Blackjack Smith was behind the bar, idly polishing a glass. He
looked at Surratt. His head turned and ducked toward the back
room. "Go in there."</p>

<p>"Blackjack&mdash;"</p>

<p>The gross-bodied man shook his ponderous chin. "It's all
right, Buck. I'm tellin' you."</p>

<p>Surratt walked to the rear room's door and opened it and
stepped inside. He closed the door quickly. Judith Cameron was
poised in a far corner, against a wall; and he saw the worry in
her eyes.</p>

<p>There was one moment then in which he was ashamed of himself
for his part in the scene at the top of the canyon&mdash;in which
he felt dismally angry for remembering the shape and force of
Annette Carvel's lips. For there was a fidelity in Buck Surratt
that governed him and kept him on a straight track; seeing Judith
across the room, fair and proud, he knew then where his faith
belonged and had belonged since the first meeting. He couldn't
help it. There was grace in her shoulders, a straight and shining
beauty in her eyes. It was the irony and strangeness of this
world that his idle drifting had brought him to these hills to
find her&mdash;and to know even then he had found her too
late.</p>

<p>He said: "When I got your note I started riding."</p>

<p>Her voice lifted curiously. "Note?"</p>

<p>"Your note."</p>

<p>She said: "No, Buck. I wrote none. But&mdash;is this
yours?"</p>

<p>He went across the room at a swift pace, suddenly aware of
trouble. He looked down at the paper she held. A few words said:
"Can you be at Carson Ford about 7 tonight." It was signed with
his name.</p>

<p>"This," he said, "is a trick. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened then and Bill Head walked in, his big
shoulders rolling. Blackjack followed through and closed the door
and moved over to a side of the room, his obscure eyes turned
beady with a growing interest. Bill Head's ruddy cheeks swung to
the girl, to Surratt. He said in a way that was too calm to be
real:</p>

<p>"I made a good guess. I guessed that you two people were thick
enough to answer any call the other might make. You remind me of
Annette Carvel, Judith."</p>

<p>She was speaking. But Surratt's attention was engrossed by
essential things; he was looking at Blackjack Smith now with a
smoldering, aroused interest. He stepped back against the wall.
His hand fell slightly against the cold butt of his gun.</p>

<p>Blackjack said: "Don't do it, Buck."</p>

<p>"That's the way you feel?" challenged Surratt.</p>

<p>Blackjack only shook his head; his pear-shaped cheeks were
solemn and wholly enigmatic.</p>

<p>Bill Head slowly said: "I told you, Judith, I meant to get
that glove from Surratt. You seemed to doubt I would. This is my
way of showin' you. You got the glove, Surratt?"</p>

<p>Surratt was idly murmuring: "You're a smarter man than I
thought. It is a mistake I made&mdash;to underestimate you."</p>

<p>"The glove," said Bill Head.</p>

<p>"No," replied Surratt, "I guess not."</p>

<p>This was all unforgettably clear. Judith stood beside him,
pale and still against the wall, her hands risen to her breasts,
her breathing soft and fast. Bill Head remained doggedly in the
center of the room, huge under the light, his purpose too plain
and too violent for anybody to mistake. Over in the corner
Blackjack Smith had established himself like an umpire, no
feeling and no partiality escaping him. Out in the saloon was the
scraping of feet&mdash;Blackjack's companions listening.</p>

<p>Considering all this, Surratt knew how inevitably he was
trapped. This was a pattern again and he felt himself answering
it in his old way. There were times when a man had to remember
the sweetness of life and use caution and quiet speech. There
were times when it was best to forget all that. He felt cool
reason creep away from him. He held his place, a bitter dissent
thumping along his arteries. He was then as he always had been in
time of trouble&mdash;and always would be&mdash;with a flame and
a savage pleasure having its way thoroughly with him. He was
smiling, though he did not know it. But Blackjack Smith, who knew
the man well, waited for the smile, and when he saw it he settled
back on his heels.</p>

<p>"Don't try it, Buck," he grunted. "There's other boys outside
the door, if you got that far."</p>

<p>"The glove," repeated Bill Head stubbornly.</p>

<p>Blackjack said: "Miss Cameron, you step outside a moment."</p>

<p>Judith's face swung around to Surratt, very pale. Yet it was
calm and it was held by faith. Surratt nodded, his admiration for
her deeper and deeper. He watched her walk across the room,
unhurried and slowly graceful, and leave it.</p>

<p>Bill Head spoke. "Put your gun on him, Blackjack. I'll get the
glove."</p>

<p>"Wait," ordered Blackjack. "Both you boys unbuckle your belts
and drop 'em right where you stand."</p>

<p>Bill Head stared at the big outlaw, taciturnly surprised.
"When did you get that idea? I've already told you what to
do."</p>

<p>"You'll do it my way," responded Blackjack evenly. "Drop the
belts."</p>

<p>Surratt's smile was long and thin and bitter-bright. He obeyed
the order; the belt, with the gun in it, dropped. He kicked it
aside. Bill Head still stared at Blackjack, a violent and
mistrusting consideration in his hazel eyes. "If I thought you
were fooling me, Blackjack..." But his massive shoulder rolled
back, and he unbuckled his belt and laid it on the center table.
"Maybe," he said narrowly, "this is a better way. You been making
some comments about my character. It will give me some
satisfaction to change your mind, Surratt."</p>

<p>The man had the strength of a rock-crusher. There was that
immense impression of power in Head's ropy shoulder muscles, in
the girth of his neck, in those thick wrists and fists which gave
to his arms the appearance of heavy-knobbed clubs. He had a
solidity and a massiveness, a body too vast to feel the hurt of
blows; his temper burned sullen and steady.</p>

<p>Surratt murmured: "It is my hope you enjoyed the bonfire."</p>

<p>That malice-pointed phrase visibly jabbed the man. He lowered
his shoulders and his knees bent from the pressure put on them
and he threw himself across the room. One remote cell in
Surratt's mind told him then he had made another mistake. Head
wasn't slow, he wasn't clumsy. Surratt started out from the wall,
but never got away from it. Bill Head slammed terrifically into
him and threw him back against it. Surratt's skull struck the
boards, his brain roared. Head's fists were like axes chopping
into his temples. They drove daylight and memory out of him.
Strength left his legs entirely, and thus blinded and stunned and
momentarily helpless he reached for Bill Head's waist and caught
at it to weather through the storm.</p>

<p>Head rapidly retreated, avoiding that grip. "Oh, no," he
grunted, and seemed to bear a respect for Surratt's tricks. He
poised this way, breathing fast. It was a moment's respite; the
mist cleared away from the room and Surratt saw the man teetering
for another rush. He dropped to his knees as Head flung himself
on. He caught Head like that, rolling his body into Head's legs
and completely upsetting the big one. Head went crashing into the
wall. The whole building shook.</p>

<p>Surratt rose and found himself steady again. He wheeled and
waited. Blackjack Smith came forward swiftly and lifted the lamp
from the table and carried it back to this corner. Once more
posted there, he held it high over his head to illumine this
scene.</p>

<p>Bill Head threw himself up from the floor, shaking his yellow
poll. He was turning slowly, he was for one slim interval not
quite on his guard. Waiting for that chance, Surratt plunged in.
He beat aside a huge arm and smashed the man full in the mouth.
His knuckles ripped across the other's lips as though they were
scraping back wet paper; and the bones of his hand seemed to snap
Head's teeth. He had his moment here and made use of it, driving
solid, savage blows at Head's chin, at his temple, at his eyes,
at his chin again&mdash;the dull and fleshy sound flatly horrid
in the room. Blood came rolling through Head's lips; his eyes
were aflood with a tawny rage. He cried out and steadied himself
against the wall and threw himself at Surratt again. Surratt
deflected one blow; but the next one, slashing through his
defensive elbow, hurled him back against the table. He carried
the table with him and went over with it, and under it.</p>

<p>Pulling around, he saw Head's feet walking forward. He threw
the table aside. A foot lashed out at him. He seized it, and
rolled, and brought Head down, that fall jarring all the
building. Head crawled at him and drove his fist across Surratt's
neck in the way he might have used a hammer. They were lunging
and wrestling wickedly around this floor, striking and missing,
and gutturally heaving up their hatred in bitter gusts, and
striking again. Surratt tore free from the man and rolled and
rose. He found Head slowly getting up. Crouched low then, he ran
on and met Head in the center of the room. He felt Head's fist
crack through his ribs and bury itself in his lungs, the pain of
that a pure agony. But he had forced Head backward and the man's
face tipped higher and Surratt ripped one stiff blow to the
shelving point of the exposed chin. Strangeness came all across
Bill Head's features, turning them wide and alarmed and
astonished. The will that held him up so hugely snapped like a
tight-draw wire. He went down on the floor and tried to crawl,
his breath large and groaning and incomplete. He did not get up.
Blood flowed along his cheeks freely; his body shook with some
involuntary spasm. Then he was wholly still.</p>

<p>There was that troubled silence, with the panting of the two
men springing through it. Surratt could find no room in his lungs
for the air he needed. A thousand needles stung his fists, and
all his face seemed broken and pulpy. Enormous weariness flowed
its cold way through his muscles. He hadn't the spirit to move;
and so he stood and stared down at Bill Head who was unconscious
on the dirty boards.</p>

<p>The silence was a signal to those beyond the room. The door
opened at a jerk and Judith Cameron came through. Turning toward
her, Surratt saw the dread in her eyes for a moment before it
changed to an inexpressible hurt. She cried: "My dear&mdash;my
dear!" And ran over to him, and caught his arms and looked up at
him. The reserve disappeared from her eyes, like the lifting of a
curtain. It was for a moment only; when it came back he was
stirred and shaken by what he had seen&mdash;and then ceased to
be sure that he had seen it.</p>

<p>His lips were difficult to shape when he spoke. His words
weren't clear. "I must look like the wrath of God. It's the way I
feel."</p>

<p>Blackjack Smith moved from his corner and tried to lift the
table. But its legs were broken and its top was splintered; and
he stared down thoughtfully a moment, still holding the lamp in
his hand. At the doorway Blackjack's men made a solid rank, all
their cheeks dark with interest. Judith Cameron slipped an arm
through Surratt's elbow and held her place beside him; her chin
lifted and there was something flowing out of her that called his
attention. Color had returned to her cheeks. She was proud
then&mdash;and quietly defying the threat in the room.</p>

<p>Surratt stared at Blackjack. "You were in on this. There's
your boss on the floor. You were the man that wasn't going to
lift a hand against me."</p>

<p>"And I didn't," said Blackjack. "Sure I was in on it. But I
had a little idea of my own, like you heard Bill Head remark. You
saw it didn't please him."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Blackjack was shaking his vast, pear-shaped countenance in a
bemused way. "I have known you a long while. Your way of fightin'
is familiar to me. The tougher things are, the better you are. I
have never known the man you couldn't whip. It was my desire for
you to whip this one here. It is a thing he needed, it was a
fight I wanted to see. Well, I'll remember it. You're a fellow
that no man ever forgets."</p>

<p>"Blackjack," challenged Surratt, "where do you stand?"</p>

<p>"And now that's a funny thing," sighed Blackjack. "It has been
the policy of my life to string along with the winnin' side. I
never yet broke that rule. I have played with Head in this matter
and made a comfortable thing of it. Nobody can say Blackjack's
been a fool. Yet here I am, partin' company with the man and
throwin' my meal ticket away. You're licked now and Sam Torveen's
licked, but I said I never would lift my hand against you again
and I never will. I guess I better start ridin' before Head sends
his boys after me. I do not understand it."</p>

<p>"Blackjack," murmured the girl. "You are not so bad."</p>

<p>"And not so good either," reflected Blackjack skeptically. "So
I guess that makes me out just another sucker, which I never
thought I'd come to be." But he stopped talking and looked at the
girl. He put his lamp on the floor, going to the door. He turned
there, his black eyes sharpening. He said to Surratt: "Understand
this, friend Buck. Bill Head will come after you with a gun." He
said only that, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Surratt turned across the room and bent over to pick up his
belt. The top of his skull pounded, and the drying sweat pulled
at his skin and its saltiness stung the mashed edges of his lip.
He had begun to stiffen up. Bill Head lay without motion,
seemingly without breath, plunged deeply into a slugged slumber.
Surratt considered him without anger; and turned toward
Judith.</p>

<p>She had retreated to a wall. She stood against it, hands
behind her. He saw a shadow of fear darkening the loveliness and
the candor of her eyes. It had not been there before. Her voice
whispered at him.</p>

<p>"I have to tell you this, Buck. The glove belongs to me."</p>

<p>He looked down at his belt. He buckled it on, his fingers very
awkward. Afterwards he reached for his pipe and packed and
lighted it. The smoke made a bland, pure relief in his lungs. He
clenched the pipe between his teeth and felt the steady, asking
weight of her glance on him. He pulled the glove out of his
pocket&mdash;a small doeskin riding glove&mdash;and crossed the
room and handed it to her.</p>

<p>She waited for him to speak. But he didn't. Long afterwards
she broke the silence gently. "No questions?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "There would never be a time when I'd ask
you a question about that glove. There won't ever be a time,
Judith, when I could bring myself to doubt you."</p>

<p>"Buck!" she called, almost crying.</p>

<p>She had a strength and a pride and a dignity. She had a
womanliness that touched his senses like tremendous music; it
turned all his past barren, it made him a hungry man now. But he
looked down. He said casually: "I'd better ride. Sam's not much
comfort to himself these days."</p>

<p>"You like him greatly."</p>

<p>"Yes." He looked at her and could not help asking what had
been in his mind since his first entry into the hills. "You do,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course." He listened to the tone of her talk; he watched
her eyes. But her answer was incomplete, he did not understand
it. Elusiveness controlled that even, soft voice. He shrugged his
shoulders and opened the door, observing that Blackjack and
Blackjack's men had gone out to the porch He walked with her that
far and saw her climb into the saddle. She lifted her hand at him
and said, "Good night," and galloped down the road. He went on to
the rack, mounting with all his muscles in protest. "So long,
Blackjack," he said, and trotted away.</p>

<p>He crossed the ford, climbed the hill and struck down the dark
trail. He had an hour's riding here, with time to revive the
powerful sensations of all this night's action. But weariness
grew greater in him and he was drained dry of feeling. So he rode
through the sheep meadow almost stupidly and came into the
Torveen yard. There were no lights burning.</p>

<p>He called out, "Hello," and got down. After that he wheeled
with a quicker step across the yard, the strong surrounding
shadows closing his throat to further sound. He went into the
office and struck a match. By the bright glow of it he saw the
room overturned and in confusion. It was for him a clear and
dangerous warning, compelling him to instantly kill the match. He
stepped back to the porch, crossed it to the bunkroom. He closed
the door here and tried another match, cupping it in his palm. He
let it burn only long enough for one brief and sufficient survey.
Here too was a stripped room.</p>

<p>Going back to the porch, he noticed then that the corral gate
was open, the horses gone.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. THE SEARCH</h2>

<p class="first">POKEY came into the Head yard with a good deal
of riding dust on him and went immediately to the house. This was
morning, but Old Martin still lay in bed smoking a cigar. Pokey
stood beside the bed, looking down at his boss with a plain
concern. "You sick?"</p>

<p>"I get tired sittin' in that confounded chair," grumbled Old
Martin. "You find out something about Surratt?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pokey. But he remained quiet a moment, the
information he had gathered still a little strange to him. He
didn't know that he could make it clear to Old Martin; it wasn't
clear to himself. "I went over the desert to Thunder Butte. They
knew him there, but it wasn't his town. So I crossed the hills to
prairie country and stopped at a place called Crow. I sat me down
in a poker game and kept my mouth shut. Well, that was his town
all right."</p>

<p>"Crow," murmured Old Martin. "Ain't been there for fifteen
years, which was when I ran down the Patton boys."</p>

<p>Pokey said: "Martin, he ain't no outlaw."</p>

<p>"I knew that before I sent you," retorted Old Martin. "I can
still judge a man."</p>

<p>"This Surratt's dad ran a big horse ranch yonder. He was a
tough one and he never stood back from anybody. The wild ones
over that way were always aimin' for him. As I get it, this old
man Surratt had his fun fightin' 'em, never asked no favors, and
never asked no help. So, a couple years ago they finally
drygulched him. It left this Buck Surratt under the gun. The way
the story goes he went out and found the fellow that did the
killin'&mdash;and left him right where he found him. But there
was always one more fellow to take up the trouble and come after
Surratt." Pokey's eyes narrowed at the wall, visualizing what had
happened. His voice was soft. "He had to meet and kill four men,
Martin. Which settled that particular wild bunch for good. Like I
said, I kept my mouth shut and played poker&mdash;but the man
left his mark on that town, for they're still talkin' about those
fights."</p>

<p>"But he didn't get any peace out of it," remarked Old
Martin.</p>

<p>"How'd you know that?" inquired Pokey, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Go on," growled Old Martin.</p>

<p>"No, he didn't get any peace. Seems like his reputation for
bein' fast on the draw spread with the wind. It was honey for the
bees. Pretty soon a lot of tough ones came driftin' in to have a
look at him. He had one more fight on the streets of Crow. Then
he sold his horse ranch&mdash;and drifted out. That's how he got
here." Pokey quit talking for a moment. He shook his head. Then
he said: "He's not the kind to run, Martin. What'd he do that
for?"</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Pokey?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pokey, "I don't."</p>

<p>Old Martin's eyes were black and bright behind thi cigar
smoke. "Never think the boy was runnin' from trouble. Never think
it. He was runnin' from himself."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Old Martin said quietly: "Surratt's smart. He saw the end of
the trail. So he pulled out. Listen, Pokey. When a man starts the
killin' trade it does something to his brain and it does
something to his sleep. He becomes a maverick wolf, he's kicked
out of the pack. He runs alone, with other maverick wolves
huntin' him. He quits bein' civilized, there's no trust for him
and no love&mdash;none of the things a man ought to live for. And
someday he dies up in the hills in the way a maverick wolf always
dies, miserable and tormented. Surratt knew that. He was runnin'
from it."</p>

<p>Pokey said, faintly regretful: "Well, he found no peace
here."</p>

<p>"No," growled Old Martin, "he didn't. It's the boy's fate. He
could run to the end of the earth now and it would catch up with
him. He knows it, too. I heard the sound of it in his talk the
other night. Pokey, there's the kind of a boy I'd like to've had
for a son."</p>

<p>These two men let the somber, silence drift on. Pokey held his
place by the bed, obediently waiting for Old Martin to speak, as
he had been doing for fifteen years. There wasn't much in this
little man except that implicit unquestioning loyalty to Martin
Head. Old Martin burst out bitterly: "It's a hell of a thing to
contemplate. Bill and Surratt are bound to meet. It can't be
escaped, and neither will avoid it. One of 'em will die."</p>

<p>"Unless Surratt runs again," suggested Pokey hopefully.</p>

<p>Old Martin stared at his henchman. He shook his head. He was
impatient. "You know he won't."</p>

<p>Pokey cleared his throat and showed diffidence. "There's
another way, Martin. Stop this fight with Torveen altogether. I
don't love sheep, not at all. But I saw sheep in the yonder
country. I guess sheep will come here, too. Not regardin' what we
do."</p>

<p>"Pokey," said Old Martin, "I have got to tell you something
you apparently ain't noticed yet. I own this ranch, but the
runnin' of it has passed out of my hands. The crew takes orders
only from my son. And my son will not take my orders."</p>

<p>"The pup," growled Pokey, displaying his first resentment.</p>

<p>Old Martin sat up in bed. "I have but one desire. Nothing else
matters, but on that one thing I will have my way. I can't get
Bill to act quick enough. Therefore, you must do it for me. You
take your horse, Pokey, and start roamin' these hills. Don't come
back until you've found Perrigo and settled him. You understand
what I mean?"</p>

<p>Pokey took the full, iron weight of Old Martin's glance
without flinching. He shrugged his little shoulders. He said,
mild and matter-of-fact: "All right, Martin."</p>

<p>"He is a dog to be put out of the way," said Old Martin
emotionlessly. "It's my full belief he killed Leslie and for that
I'll have my own kind of justice, without recourse."</p>

<p>He closed his mouth and leaned back on the pillow. Bill Head
walked across the living room and appeared at the door. Seeing
him, Pokey's eyes went shrewd with interest, for the scars of the
Carson Ford fight were livid and purple on that ruddy face. He
had taken a smashing. Pokey said: "What happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Another fine scheme that didn't work," commented Old Martin
ironically.</p>

<p>Bill Head stared dismally at Pokey. "Where you been?"</p>

<p>"That's his business and mine," interjected Old Martin.</p>

<p>Pokey turned out of the room. Bill Head wheeled and started to
follow and was halted by Old Martin's order. "Stay here, Bill. I
want to talk to you."</p>

<p>Bill said, "Wait a minute," and tracked Pokey to the porch. He
put out his big arm and shoved Pokey against the house wall. "You
runt, I asked you a question. Answer me."</p>

<p>Pokey's voice remained soft. "Your dad answered you,
Bill."</p>

<p>Bill Head's crushed lips curved and showed a savage impulse.
"You won't always have Old Martin to hide behind, Pokey. When
that time comes you'll answer to me."</p>

<p>"When Old Martin dies," replied Pokey, "I'll be going from
this ranch."</p>

<p>Bill Head swayed nearer the little man and his broad fist
closed and lifted; the desire to strike Pokey was clear in his
eyes. But Pokey looked back at Bill Head, strictly still, a gleam
creeping into his glance. Unaccountably, Bill Head wheeled into
the house again. Pokey went over to his horse and climbed to the
saddle, for a moment remaining thoughtfully there. Afterwards he
passed into the trees. He had been given an order, and it was the
habit of his life to obey Old Martin.</p>

<p>Bill went into the bedroom and took his sulky, angry stand.
His father had taught him as a boy to be silent and to be
respectful in front of older people, and though the time of his
obedience had long passed he still found the habit of attention
hard to break. Old Martin's eyes were biting into him, without
affection, without kindness.</p>

<p>"Bill," he said, "you were always a brute stubborn lad, no
doubt a quality you got from me. It was never that I blamed you
for. You have felt I cared little for you since you started into
manhood, and it is true and I think the time's come when you
should know why&mdash;for I doubt if you and I will have much
more to say to each other."</p>

<p>"Have we got to talk about that?" Bill asked.</p>

<p>"Stubbornness," stated Old Martin, "is a thing I do not
condemn, bein' a kind of courage in its way. But I never have
ceased to hate deceit&mdash;and you started lyin' to me young.
Maybe there were reasons I never understood. Maybe I wasn't the
sort of a father you could trust the truth to. At any rate,
here's my apologies for bein' the sort of a father that couldn't
draw better things out of you. It must be my fault, for Les was
no better that way. Yet there is one thing you got neither from
me nor from your mother&mdash;a streak of meanness that makes you
do brutal things deliberately. This is what I have wanted to say
to you, so that you'll know why I have no love for you as a son
and no respect for you as a man. I'd be sorry to see Judith
Cameron make the mistake of marryin' you."</p>

<p>"You're all through talkin'?" breathed Bill Head.</p>

<p>"No, you whelp!" thundered Old Martin. "I'm tellin' you this!
You have made a miserable mess with Torveen and now you've got
only one thing you can do, which is meet this Surratt who has
condemned you to the whole country. If you do not meet him and
settle that challenge I'll use a gun on you myself! No man is
going to carry my name around and let people spit on it! You
hear?"</p>

<p>"All your life," burst out Bill, "you've been obsessed with
somebody hurting the name of Head!"</p>

<p>"For fifteen years of my life," replied Old Martin grimly, "my
own sons have used that name shamefully. Go on away, Bill." He
stopped talking and passed a big hand over his eyes. His next
words were slow and gray. "Only God can pass judgment on you and
Les and me. If the blame's on me I'll bend my knees willingly to
a deserved punishment."</p>

<p>Bill Head went out of the room, out of the house. In the yard
he stopped to build a cigarette and light it. The smoke stung his
injured eyes; it built up the morose wrath all day accumulating
in him. He stood this way and watched one of his riders, Hughie
Grant, come up the hill.</p>

<p>Hughie Grant shook his head. "No trace of Torveen or any of
the crowd around their ranch. They skipped out."</p>

<p>"I sent Benny and Stuke Jackson to cover the upper trail. See
them?"</p>

<p>"No, I just been watchin' Torveen's house."</p>

<p>"I'll find him," grunted Bill Head. "Send somebody to cover
the pass road. Send somebody to scout the river. Then you go to
Kersom's and tell him I want him to be in Morgantown at
suppertime. Go on, Hughie."</p>

<p>He went to his own horse and trotted out of the yard. He was
in front of Ab Cameron's house twenty minutes later. He saw Ab
Cameron standing by a corral and called him over.</p>

<p>"I've got men all through the hills," said Bill. "He won't get
away."</p>

<p>"Peyrolles was just by," explained Ab. "He thought his shot
caught Torveen. There was blood in the brush this morain'."</p>

<p>"We'll find out."</p>

<p>Ab murmured: "Henry Tanner died a little while ago. It was
Torveen's bullet that got him fair. Peyrolles saw Torveen aim and
he saw Tanner fall."</p>

<p>"I want to see you in Morgantown at suppertime."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Cameron, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Bill Head sourly studied Ab Cameron. "You been hearin' about a
woman's glove Surratt was supposed to have found by Les
Head?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cameron and closed his lips.</p>

<p>"It was Judith's glove," said Bill Head. "She took it from
Surratt last night."</p>

<p>Cameron, said in a humble way, "God's pity," and walked off.
Bill Head watched him go straight for the house. It made him grin
to observe how Ab Cameron's face sunk, to notice how the old
man's pride fell. He galloped down the river toward Peyrolles'
place.</p>

<p><br> At first daylight Surratt shook himself from his blankets
and came out of the trees to Torveen's house close by; and looked
again through the place to verify his quick inspection of the
night before. There was nothing new to be seen. Torveen had
apparently taken his things and had run, the evidence of haste
clearly here. In the yard, Surratt had a careful look at the
ground. Pony tracks came out of the meadow from the ridge to the
house; and pony tracks swung away from the house, turning toward
the trees and the upper sheep meadow. Surratt followed these
prints into the trees, picked up his horse, and rode to the edge
of the meadow.</p>

<p>But caution came to him as he studied the green undergrowth
surrounding the meadow. A full day came up and sunlight was a
bright promise over the Gray Bull peaks; and the sense of trouble
was real enough to swing him completely around the meadow, via
the brush, and so arrive at the meadow's higher side, where the
trail struck into the timber again. There had been some confusion
here, marked by a scatter of men's shoe indentations in the
ground and a long, dragged pattern where something had been laid.
He got down to have a look at that, and found the dull, round
scum of blood drops in the dust. They had carried a man this far,
had put him down to rest. They had remounted and carried the man
on.</p>

<p>He continued this way. Sunlight rushed fully across the sky,
its strong color breaking through the close web of pine tops and
lifting the twilight in here one full octave of brightness. Dust
particles glistened in the windless air; heat began to come on.
It was those dust particles that, half an hour later, reminded
him to be on his guard. Bending with the trail, he saw their
increased, shimmering thickness in the soft forest atmosphere.
The tracks on the ground were too confused for him to read
anything more than a story of forward travel; but the suspended
dust&mdash;and its faint sudden smell&mdash;indicated a more
recent traveler. And then, from some yonder course of the trail,
he heard an approaching echo. He put himself instantly into the
brush.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later he saw a pair of riders drop down
the slope, traveling fast. He kept still until the sound was
gone. Out on the trail again, he pushed along faster and
presently reached the meadow hard by the river canyon. There was
a man out there on the edge of the canyon, about ready to tip
down the trail to the ford; this was a hundred yards away.
Surratt gently retreated without being seen. A little later,
again looking, he found the man had disappeared into the canyon.
But it was increasingly clear to Surratt that these hills were
being dragged by Head's men and that no trail was safe. So he
again took to the timber and wove his way laboriously around the
meadow and got to its upper side.</p>

<p>It was his guess that Torveen had traveled a straight course,
always deeper into the hills; confused and churned as now were
the prints of travel on the trail, he believed this way the right
one. But it was quite apparent that Crow Track was on this trail
too.</p>

<p>Obeying his judgment, he veered into the timber and began a
tedious march around brush clumps and deadfalls and rocky
hummocks, paralleling the trail. Half an hour later he cut into
the trail without intending to; and found that it swung from
north to south at this point, keeping beside the river as the
river also turned. The tracks still were heavy in the soft dirt.
Pulling away, he took the new direction, hearing ahead of him the
murmuring roar of water deeply in the canyon. It grew greater in
his ears and then its sound diminished as he got by it. The
morning went on, with an overhead sun throwing its thin golden
lances through the interstices of the trees. He cut back to the
trail again.</p>

<p>He had, he discovered, overshot the fugitives. The heavy print
of their retreat wasn't here. One rider only had passed this way
recently. Somewhere back down the trail Torveen had turned
off.</p>

<p>Time ran fast and he wanted to waste no more of it. Knowing he
did a reckless thing, he followed the trail back and ten minutes
afterwards came upon Torveen's turnoff. The redhead had swung
into the timber on the river's side; and Surratt was paused like
this, reading the story in the dirt, w'hen a faint rattle of
brush jerked him upright in the saddle. A rider suddenly appeared
on the trail fifty yards below him and swung to continue upward
with it</p>

<p>He saw Surratt there, a tall and stiff shape in the shadows,
and recognition jerked at him. He reached for his gun and wheeled
his horse smartly into the brush; and whipped two shots rearward
as he retreated, those echoes tearing the hill's dreaming quiet
completely asunder. The shots were wide of the mark and Surratt,
sliding away, heard the man crash downhill. He would, Surratt
understood, be back soon enough with other men to help him.</p>

<p>It caused him to travel faster through the brush and so reach
the river's edge.</p>

<p>Torveen's tracks tipped down a twenty-foot bank and were lost
in the gravel; but it was plain that the crossing had been made
here. Looking over the shallow water, Surratt saw the solid green
forest wall on the yonder side broken by a small aperture which
represented another trail. The rush of the falls was deeper in
his ears and he had only to look a quarter-mile downstream to see
mist curling heavily up from the sunlight where the fast-running
water dropped into sudden depths. But he had little time to view
it, for the thought of pursuit was strong in him now and the ford
was a risk he had to take and put behind him without delay.
Accordingly he slid down the bluff and pushed through the water,
the muscles along his back involuntarily tightening. He came out
of the water and rushed his pony up the bluff, into the timber
again&mdash;and stopped. Perrigo stood directly in the trail.</p>

<p>Perrigo shook his head solemnly. "That was a damfool thing to
do, Surratt."</p>

<p>"Where's Torveen?"</p>

<p>"We're camped a long ways off. I came back to cover the trail.
Knew we'd left tracks plain enough for anybody to follow. Been
four different men come out to that bank and have a look at the
river. You're the only one that's been brash enough to come out
of cover."</p>

<p>"Who was shot?"</p>

<p>"Sam."</p>

<p>"Bad?"</p>

<p>"Not good," grunted Perrigo. "Come on."</p>

<p>He went into the brush for his horse and afterwards took the
lead, running freely into the rising timber. He had some method
here, for afterwards he swung into the trackless pine deeps and
traveled at the same rapid pace until he reached some other dim-
traced way. This he followed for a little distance, and abandoned
it for the pines again, and again struck some trail. Thus
erratically was Surratt towed southward. They came finally to a
broad road and paused to reconnoiter it before crossing. Up its
length Surratt caught a glimpse of the Gray Bull peaks. Then they
were once more closed around by the somber pine blanket, running
constantly south. Surratt guessed they had traveled a good eight
miles when Perrigo swung downhill and reached the river. They
forded it without much prior inspection&mdash;Perrigo seeming to
feel himself on safer ground&mdash;and went a good two miles
along a narrow and rocky way. It was around noon when Perrigo
stopped and called down the trail casually:</p>

<p>"All right, Ferd."</p>

<p>Ferd Bowie put his head out of the brush. They went past him
and were at the river's bank, turning through what once had been
another channel but was now dry and half overgrown by brush. A
sheer rock wall confronted them and showed them a broad hole
smashed out by some ancient current. They rode into this tunnel
for a dozen yards and got down and walked on through the semi-
darkness. A piece of a fire burned on the gravel. Ed sat cross-
legged before Torveen, who lay in his blankets with his face
turned up. He seemed to be sleeping but the crunch of Surratt's
feet opened his lids. The pallor of the man was distinct. He
grinned remotely. His voice was only a whisper.</p>

<p>"Hello, kid."</p>

<p>"What were you doin'?" demanded Surratt.</p>

<p>Ed said: "We was bein' chased back by Peyrolles. Sam came up
and we made a stand of it, on the ridge near Cameron's." Ed
looked anxiously at Surratt. "The bullet hole looks to be near
his lungs. You know anything about those things?"</p>

<p>"Let it alone." murmured Torveen. "I can lick this."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Surratt quietly. "Sure you can." But he was
watching Torveen's lips settle and didn't like what he saw.</p>

<p>"Glad you got here," muttered Torveen&mdash;and closed his
eyes.</p>

<p>Ed stared at Surratt, secretively shaking his head. Looking
around the cavern, Surratt observed they had saved their blankets
and not much else. The place, even with the fire burning, was
damp and draughty. He stood a moment, watching the labored lift
and fall of Torveen's chest; and turned out to the mouth of the
hole, signaling Perrigo to follow. He stopped in the sunlight. He
filled his pipe.</p>

<p>"Got anything to eat?"</p>

<p>"No," said Perrigo.</p>

<p>"That boy needs a doctor."</p>

<p>"And how would you work that?" countered Perrigo. "Doc Brann's
the only one&mdash;in Morgantown. You got any ideas?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I'll fetch him."</p>

<p>Perrigo surveyed Surratt morosely. "You'd be nervy enough to
try. But it won't do. For one thing, these hills are full of Bill
Head's men. He's huntin' us. By the middle of afternoon every
stray rider in the country will be beatin' up the brush. No doubt
you can get through to town. How you goin' to find Brann when you
get there? The place is poison to you&mdash;you can't stick your
head out on Main Street without gettin' it shot at If you get
Brann, how can you bring him back without bein' followed? No,
Sam's got to tough this out alone."</p>

<p>Surratt said: "What's this Brann like?"</p>

<p>"A fat fellow with white hair. He's all right. This quarrel
don't mean anything to him, one way or another. His office is
over the bank. He lives up there, too. But you can't do it,
Surratt. You pushed your luck twice in Morgantown. It won't hold
up three times. Don't consider it."</p>

<p>"It will be late tonight before I get back," decided Surratt.
He smoked his pipe idly, and in equal idleness considered this
hideout. The timber reached down to the ancient river bed. A high
bank of gravel, studded with brush and seedling pines, locked it
in from the water. The river ran quietly past the far side of the
gravel bank and this gravel bank screened the tunnel from anybody
who might be across the river.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>"This is George Bernay's country. We're south of the pass
road. It is about twelve miles northward downgrade to
Morgantown."</p>

<p>"We'll try it," decided Surratt. "I don't like Torveen's
look." He knocked the ashes out of his pipe; he swung into his
saddle.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Perrigo. "You maybe might not find it easy to get
back. But Doc Brann knows this country. Tell him it's the place
where Modoc Niles' bones were found the year after Martin Head
had fence trouble with George Bernay's dad." Perrigo looked
carefully at Surratt. His voice softened and quickened. "What was
it you said about Ferd Bowie's callin' to you the other
night?"</p>

<p>Surratt's answer was dry. "It is my affair, Nick. I'll take
care of it."</p>

<p>Perrigo spoke in a grudging, reluctant way. "I'm forced to
admire a man that keeps his mouth shut." Then he said, more and
more taciturn: "If a bullet came at you from the wrong direction,
Surratt, it wasn't mine."</p>

<p>Surratt climbed back through the brush to the top of the
bluff. Perrigo watched him go, but a moment later he followed
quickly. Ferd Bowie was in the trail when Surratt went by, and
Perrigo came up to Bowie and stood beside the kid until Surratt
had vanished somewhere down the timber. Perrigo's eyes kept
watching Bowie. Bowie made an impatient swing with his shoulders.
He said: "What you want, Nick?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Perrigo. Yet he kept staring at Ferd Bowie, a
dead darkness making his glance wholly obscure.</p>

<p>Surratt took his way through the hills carefully and without
haste, knowing he could do nothing in Morgantown until darkness
covered him. So his trail was one that circled and zigzagged,
avoiding all clear country. In the early afternoon he had sight
of a small ranch sitting well down in a bowl-like meadow, with
men working in nearby corrals. Later he struck a road and was
careful to erase his prints when he crossed it. At five o'clock,
thus vigilantly riding, he came out on the timbered ridge back of
Morgantown and saw the settlement sitting all yellow and hot
under the harsh flare of a late sun. He sat down here and waited
the arrival of twilight, meanwhile observing riders come in and
increase the traffic of this town. At half-past seven, with the
shadows safe for him, he left his horse tied to a tree and
crawled to Morgantown's back end and made his way along a
between-building alley. He took his station at the corner of the
saloon; in the semi-darkness of his position he watched men
stroll by him, near enough at times to touch.</p>

<p><br> Pokey, who took Old Martin's orders always literally,
went directly from Crow Track to Torveen's and had a look at the
place. He picked up the churned marks of the departing crew and
followed them into the hills; a little after noon he stood at the
same spot on the river where Surratt had stood before crossing.
But Pokey avoided the ford and instead made an enormous detour to
the pass-road bridge and crossed there. It took him two hours to
get back to the place where Surratt and Perrigo had met. Here he
studied the tracks and softly pursued them. When they began to
break away into the timber he got down and led his horse and
patiently unraveled the puzzle.</p>

<p>There was no hurry in him and no uncertainty; for Pokey was a
methodical man who once had been an Indian scout and knew the
ways and the signs of fugitives very well. It was growing dusk
when he reached the pass road and saw the prints cross and
continue southward. Here, with the light too dim to read sign by,
he rolled up in the brush and fell asleep. There was no other man
in these hills who could have followed all the confused turnings
of that fugitive trail; to Pokey it was as clear as ink on paper
and he knew that if Torveen still camped in the hills he would
find him before noon of the following day. From time to time
during the night he was wakened by men riding by and he
understood they were looking for the hidden Torveen. Yet he never
betrayed his position and he took no interest in their searching.
He was, in fact, mildly amused at their noisy beatings through
the hills.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. THE REWARD NOTICE</h2>

<p class="first">STANDING at the corner of the saloon, obscured
by the building's shadow and one step away from the indolent
current of riders ranging along the board walk, Surratt saw both
Bolderbuck and Sheriff Ranier on the porch of the White House
Hotel across the way; and with them was the lank-shaped, sharp-
nosed Peyrolles. He watched them with a moment's interest,
observing Peyrolles' arms lift expressively as he talked. Then he
stood quite still, hearing steps in the alley behind him. He
didn't turn. A man circled him in this darkness and veered a
curious face at him and went on into the street. Surratt bowed
his head a little, bringing the hatbrim down in front of his
face. But he saw the man look back before swinging around the
corner.</p>

<p>The bank building was across the alley. Scanning its second
story, where Perrigo had said Doc Brann's office and living
quarters were, Surratt saw a light shining behind a drawn
curtain; and then, searching the alley for a side stairway into
the building and finding none, Surratt knew that his position had
become ticklish. To reach Brann he had to leave the alley, pass
the bank corner and enter the stairway from the main street.</p>

<p>He crossed the alley to the bank side&mdash;a matter of four
long strides. He meant to pause here and wait a moment before
stepping into the stream of ambling townsmen; but all this while
he had kept an eye on the White House porch and he saw Ranier's
head swing toward him and remain that way a moment. It was his
nearness to the bank door, Surratt guessed, that drew Ranier's
attention; and he couldn't afford to let that casual inspection
grow. Pulling down his chin, he turned the bank corner and walked
along the front side of the building. Light from the hotel flamed
over the dusty street and made a diffused patch on the bank wall.
He tipped his head away from the hotel and stepped into the
light&mdash;and passed beyond it and got to the building's
stairway.</p>

<p>He went up the stairs rapidly and stopped to inspect a single
hall with four or five doors. Brann's name was on the nearest.
The others were unlabeled; but at the end of the hall lamplight
and a woman's voice came through an open transom. He went forward
and knocked on Brann's door.</p>

<p>The odor of fried onions lay across the remnant of other musty
smells in this close, dark corridor. The woman's voice kept on
with an inexhaustible energy; the words were plain enough for his
listening, but his mind was narrowly on other things and he heard
only the outpour of tone. He had come from a cool night, yet he
had begun to sweat. He knocked again; and heard someone swing off
the street and start up the stairs.</p>

<p>He turned the door's knob and went into Brann's office, black
and faintly rank with the presence of formaldehyde; he closed the
door and put a slight weight on it, listening to these steps
arrive and pass by. A far door opened, the woman's vigorous talk
rising. The door slammed. Surratt came out of the office then and
considered this situation with a swifter, more aroused attention.
Sweat had gotten below his hatband; the palms of his hands were
soft. Save for the woman's room there seemed no other occupant up
here; he had little choice in this matter. He went down the hall
and knocked.</p>

<p>The woman opened the door, a buxom and ruddy and good-looking
woman. "Doctor Brann?" asked Surratt.</p>

<p>"If he isn't in his office or his room," she said, "you'll no
doubt find him at the White House eating. Or he'll be playin'
poker at the saloon. One of the two."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Surratt. The woman's eyes were interested in
him. She remained against the roomlight; a man at the back of
that room slowly turned to have his look at Surratt. Surratt
moved away. The woman came forward a step, calling after him.
"Well, it will be the saloon. You'll have to go get him if you
want him&mdash;he's liable to play cards all night. Be just as
well if he moved his office down there for that's where anybody
finds him most of the time."</p>

<p>"Thanks," repeated Surratt and kept on walking. At the head of
the stairs he stopped a long moment, considering. For him the
saloon was as far away as China; going into it was wholly out of
the question. He went down the stairs and stood in the smooth
darkness of the bottom landing. Three punchers went by, their
spurs dragging the boards. Looking across to the White House
porch he discovered the meeting over there had grown. The short,
chunky Dutch Kersom had joined it. And one other man had joined
it and now stood head and shoulders above them. Staring at
him&mdash;at this Bill Head who bulked so vastly against the
others&mdash;Surratt felt a quick, tense excitement seize him.
This game was getting dangerous.</p>

<p>He stepped back and plunged his hands in his pockets, and drew
them out. A whole column of cowhands whirled down the street and
came to a dusty halt by the saloon. One solitary rider came more
casually in the wake of the group. Abreast the lights of the
White House, this rider turned in the saddle and Surratt saw the
even, supple shape of Judith Cameron silhouetted there before she
passed on.</p>

<p>He advanced to the walk and headed for the alley. He kept his
face angled toward the bank window; and because he did so he saw
the white sign gummed to the glass. It stopped him completely; it
threw him for a moment off guard.</p>

<br>

<p><br>
He wheeled from that notice, passing around the bank corner
into the safety of the alley. He crossed the alley and stopped by
the saloon wall again. Judith Cameron left her horse farther down
the street and walked into the dressmaking shop with a quick,
striding step. He saw George Bernay for the first time, idly
smoking a cigarette over under the shadows of the board awnings.
His mind was running hard and fast and reckless now, for the town
was full of men and the weight of some deliberate purpose was
clearly here. The risk grew greater. He saw Ranier's exploring
glance reach out once more toward him. Ranier suddenly detached
himself from the cattlemen's group and started over the dust in
Surratt's direction.</p>

<p><br> George Bernay was on his ranch when news of Torveen's
flight reached him in the middle of the afternoon. He knocked off
work and rode around the country south of Morgantown until he
found Billy Temple and Jud Horsfall. They were two-bit ranchers,
as he was; they had all worked for one or another of the four big
outfits in the hills before setting up their own places. And they
were all sound friends of Sam Torveen. It was this that turned
them toward Morgantown&mdash;three men still young enough to feel
like fighting and still poor enough not to be worried over losing
very much. On the way into town they discovered the reward notice
tacked to a tree. They read it and rode thoughtfully on.</p>

<p>"Bill Head," reflected George Bernay, "always did enjoy
squashing bugs under his thumb."</p>

<p>"It's funny," considered Jud Horsfall, "how a man can get to
admire sheep when somebody tells him he mustn't."</p>

<p>"Don't let your admiration get the best of you," warned Billy
Temple. "We're pretty small onions in this vegetable patch. Look
what happened to Sam."</p>

<p>At the edge of town&mdash;it was six o'clock then they found
the street already filling up with riders from the big outfits.
It was a pretty clear indication of trouble. George Bernay said
as much. "Something up Bill Head's sleeve. We better not be
together. Suppose we float around and hear what we hear."</p>

<p>They separated. George Bernay left his horse in front of the
White House and went in for his supper. When he came out he met
Sheriff Ranier face to face in the doorway. Ranier started to go
by. But he stopped on impulse and considered Bernay with a
worried attention. "Go up to the office a minute, George. I want
to talk to you."</p>

<p>Bernay loitered on the porch, building himself a smoke.
Afterwards he ambled to the jail office and sat down in a chair.
It was five minutes or so before Ranier appeared. Ranier closed
the door, which was a thing that lifted Bernay's quiet
interest.</p>

<p>"George, what's going to happen?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Ranier walked around the room. He needed a shave and he needed
sleep. His eyes kept returning to Bernay, curious and troubled.
"These sheep and cattle wars are hell. I'm not fooled. Bill
Head's driven Torveen to timber, but that is not the end of it.
What're those boys cookin' up? This Surratt is a fox."</p>

<p>"He rides high, for a fact," assented George Bernay casually.
His glance measured the sheriff.</p>

<p>Ranier came to a stand. "I've been in other cattle-sheep wars.
It always goes the same. The big outfits are strong and they have
their way for a while. But sheep's a little man's easy crop.
There's a lot of little men down your way, George. Little men
never do love big outfits. What'll they do now?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said George Bernay laconically. He got up. "That
all, Sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more bitter than a neighborhood fight. I'm trying to
play things safe."</p>

<p>"When a man straddles the fence," suggested George Bernay, "he
can't keep from gettin' a sore crotch." He threw a sharp question
at the sheriff. "What happened to Torveen&mdash;you know for
sure?"</p>

<p>"We think Peyrolles shot him."</p>

<p>"Peyrolles?" murmured George Bernay. His eyes laid a faint
glitter on the otherwise blandness of his face.</p>

<p>Tom Bolderbuck opened the office door and walked in. He said:
"Hello, George."</p>

<p>"Hello, you baldheaded horsethief. Look, Tom. You a friend of
mine?"</p>

<p>"Think so," replied Bolderbuck imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Remember it durin' the next few days," said Bernay as he
walked out.</p>

<p>"What's that?" called the sheriff, plainly disturbed.</p>

<p>George Bernay strolled the street with a tight streak of a
smile on his lips. He was talking to himself. "The meek shall
inherit the earth, except that part of the earth which is cow
country." Peyrolles stood in front of the White House, waiting
for somebody. George Bernay only looked at him quietly and passed
by. One time he had been a Peyrolles rider and he knew the man
well enough.</p>

<p>Peyrolles saw him and said: "George."</p>

<p>Bernay turned. The tone Peyrolles used was the old tone of
command. It bit into George Bernay but he didn't show it.
"George," said Peyrolles, "we may need you to help out in this
business."</p>

<p>George Bernay murmured: "To hell with you, Hank," and walked
on. Under the board awning of the hardware store he stopped to
arrange himself against a post. He built a new cigarette and
dragged in its smoke energetically. Dutch Kersom was entering
town with his crew; they all wheeled by the saloon, ripping up
the dust. Kersom walked over to join Peyrolles. The sheriff and
Tom Bolderbuck came down from the jail office to join the two big
ranchers. The riders pushed into the saloon. This town grew
crowded, the sense of trouble was pretty definite. "And the
meek," murmured George Bernay, "shall get their pants shot
off."</p>

<p>Jud Horsfall came out of the saloon. He spotted George and
walked over. "This is maybe news to you. Bill Head met this
Surratt by accident up at Carson Ford and they had a fight.
Surratt laid Bill out. Why, my God, he must be the old
fruit&mdash;this Surratt."</p>

<p>"That," said George Bernay, "is the nearest thing to truth
you've said since you was seven years old."</p>

<p>"I likewise hear Blackjack Smith had a quarrel with Bill Head
and pulled out of the Ford with his bunch of plugs."</p>

<p>"Where'd he go?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," responded Horsfall, ambling away.</p>

<p>Sound rolled and boiled in the yonder saloon; and more riders
trotted out of the hills into this crowding street. Men tramped
ceaselessly up and down the board walks. All the store lights
threw bright beams into the dust, deepening the intervening
shadows. Annette Carvel came out of her dressmaking shop and
seemed to watch the night carefully. George Bernay dropped his
cigarette. He walked over. She saw him come, but she didn't pay
much attention to him. Paused before her, he removed his hat
carefully. Bronzed as he was by the sun, his face showed an
increased flush. He said rather diffidently:</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>She murmured, "Hello, George," and gave him a more deliberate
glance. Her arms were white in the light of the shop; her cheeks
were soft and pale, turning her eyes very black. "What are you
doing in town?" she added.</p>

<p>"Just lookin' around," he said.</p>

<p>Her glance left him and her thoughts left him. He felt that
indifference with a quick, deep regret. It had been this way for
two or three years&mdash;an emotion in him he could not express
to her. He was a man that made no show, who had no flamboyant
manners which could compete with all the striking riders of the
hills. Always realistic, George Bernay knew this girl was
attracted by a color he did not possess; he had no qualities to
draw her attention, so that she might really see him. Quietly in
the background, he understood where her likings lay and to whom
her smiles were given. In fact he understood more about Annette
Carvel than she dreamed; yet in the evening solitude of his own
ranch house he kept thinking of her&mdash;of the mistakes she had
committed, of the naive honesty which made her still so desirable
to him.</p>

<p>She uttered a small, quick sound of anxiety. Looking around,
he saw Bill Head ride into town with the Crow Track crew. Bill
Head swung over to the group of cattlemen on the White House
porch; the crew made for the saloon, a solid confusion rising
from the turning horses. One other rider paced down the middle of
the street and didn't stop. It was, George Bernay discovered,
Judith Cameron; she wheeled in at the dressmaking shop and jumped
to the boards.</p>

<p>"Annette," she said instantly, "what's happened?"</p>

<p>"You haven't heard about Sam Torveen?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"He had a fight with Peyrolles. They think they shot
him&mdash;Sam. He's gone from his ranch. With the crew."</p>

<p>George Bernay stepped backward so that the two women might
stand together; he kept his glance on Judith, stirred by the
picture she made in these moving shadows. She said: "Where is he
now?"</p>

<p>"They don't know," said Annette. Her tone was defiant then. "I
guess Bill Head would like to. That must be why they've all come
to town&mdash;to think up a way of catching him."</p>

<p>Judith turned. "George&mdash;you're his friend. Do you
know?"</p>

<p>"No," he murmured.</p>

<p>She was darkly thinking about it; and the stormy dignity of
her features impressed Bernay immeasurably. She was a woman who
could fight and still be a woman; it was a real distinction,
though he could not define it. Her eyes were on him again. "Will
you tell me, if you find out?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bernay, and watched the two women go into the
dressmaking shop. He ambled along the walk, toward the saloon,
noting the solid crowd inside. Across the street Bill Head talked
aggressively to the other cattle owners, his big hand dropping
with each word. It was, Bernay thought, the only way the man
knew&mdash;to use his strength to get things done. Ranier was
turning away from the group; he was coming across the street.
Halfway over he stopped dead, for Bill Head's voice jumped
arrogantly after him. "Come back here&mdash;I want you!"</p>

<p>Ranier turned in full obedience and went back; and then all
the group entered the hotel. Ab Cameron came out of the hill road
and pulled up at the White House. He got down so slowly that once
George Bernay felt sorry for the old man. Cameron was a mild-
mannered character who didn't belong with that pack. It was Bill
Head who bullied Ab into line; this was the way it had been for
years, as all the country knew. At the saloon's corner Bernay
turned to cross the street. A voice said softly to him then:
"Step back in the alley, George."</p>

<p>He was no fool, this George Bernay. He knew the tricks of the
land. And so he remained paused at the corner a moment, serenely
indifferent, while a group of Kersom riders passed. Afterwards he
dropped slowly into the alley&mdash;and discovered Buck
Surratt.</p>

<p>He could not help letting a quick warning fall out of him. "My
God, man, you don't belong here! Ain't you seen the price posted
on your head?"</p>

<p>"Go get Doc Brann and bring him up to his office. I'll be
there."</p>

<p>George Bernay grinned in a small, brilliant way. "All right,"
he murmured, and went instantly to perform the chore.</p>

<p>Surratt crossed the alley and stopped a moment by the bank
wall. The street was more crowded than it had been; but the
cattlemen had gone inside the hotel&mdash;taking Ranier and
Bolderbuck with them&mdash;and he felt fractionally safer. He
tipped his hat down, stepped around the bank wall and strolled to
the stairway. He went up, going into Brann's office. He lighted a
match and found Brann's lamp. The room, he saw, was typically a
doctor's room. He was waiting there in the middle of it when
Brann entered and closed the door and propped his round body
against it. He had a face that was half jovial and half
professional, with shaggy silver eyebrows; his hair was pure
white. He had his look at Surratt, seeming to be amused with what
he saw and knew.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't think you'd want to come back to Morgantown."</p>

<p>"You're Torveen's friend?" asked Surratt.</p>

<p>Brann shrugged his shoulders. "I'm supposed to be humanity's
friend, son. But when I get dragged away from a pat full house I
begin to doubt it. So Sam's been shot?"</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Why else would you venture into Morgantown?" retorted Brann.
He went over to his table and opened a doctor's satchel there. He
got a few things out of a cabinet, "A bullet
hole&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Lungs, I think."</p>

<p>"It hadn't better be," remarked Brann grimly. He reached into
his cabinet again. "Well, if I had five dollars for every bullet
hole I've treated I suppose I'd be in Vienna now studying
medicine under the famous ones, instead of practising buckshot
surgery out in the middle of the hills. Yet I doubt if I'd have
as much fun in Vienna." He snapped his satchel together and put
on his hat; he took a revolver out of his hip pocket and laid it
on the table.</p>

<p>"Better keep that," suggested Surratt.</p>

<p>"I never carry a gun except when I play poker."</p>

<p>Men were coming up the stairs. Surratt backed quietly to a
corner of the room; he stood against the wall, waiting like that.
But it was George Beraay who came in presently with two others
Surratt didn't know.</p>

<p>Doc Brann, observing Surratt's whiplike reactions, stepped
forward to stand in front of Surratt with a dim and kind and
skeptic smile printed along his fat lips. "I like you, son.
You're a dissenter, you don't conform easy to the ways of the
world. It makes your sleep bad but your days interesting. It's my
hope I don't have to fold your hands over your chest, though it
is a thin hope the way things stand. Now where's Sam?"</p>

<p>Surratt looked at the two strangers, whereupon George Bernay
said: "That's all right. This is Jud Horsfall. This is Billy
Temple. Doc knows 'em."</p>

<p>Surratt remembered what Perrigo had told him. "Where Modoc
Niles' bones were found."</p>

<p>"Way over there?" said Brann in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Be careful," Bernay warned Brann. "Don't let anybody follow
you in."</p>

<p>"Teachin' your grandmother to suck eggs?" retorted Brann.
"Surratt, you wait till I'm gone before you come. I make better
time alone." Saying that, he left the office.</p>

<p>"Time for me to crawl out of here," decided Surratt.</p>

<p>But George Bernay was grinning in an obscure, pleased way that
Surratt didn't understand; and Bernay spoke to the other two men.
"Well, that's the size of him."</p>

<p>"What?" said Surratt.</p>

<p>They were all looking at him, they were studying him with a
care that was strange. They were young and he saw a gleam of
recklessness appear in their watching. George Bernay said: "You
give a man hope, Surratt."</p>

<p>"I'd like to take back some grub."</p>

<p>Billy Temple broke in: "Think you can move Sam over the
pass?"</p>

<p>"Not now."</p>

<p>"Hell of a situation. I just found out what Bill Head's up to.
This gang in town is going to spread out and beat the timber all
the way to the Gray Bull peaks."</p>

<p>There was a man running up the stairs. These four swung and
became rigid. But the man went scuffling down the hall and flung
open a far door. They heard him say: "Belle, that fellow who came
here was Surratt They've found his horse back of town!"</p>

<p>The door slammed. Surratt was moving across the room in quick
strides. "There ought to be some windows in the back of this
place."</p>

<p>George Bernay hauled the office door open, stopping long
enough to say, "I'll get my horse and bring it around back," and
then ran down the stairs. Surratt pursued the hallway to its end,
rapidly, with Temple and Horsfall at his heels. He halted at the
door across from the lighted room. He put his hands to the knob,
but it didn't give. The man and the woman both were talking in
the other room and the man seemed to be coming out. Surratt
suddenly laid his weight against the panel, breaking the lock
with a force that shot bulletlike echoes through the building. He
ran across the darkness of this room toward its back window.
Horsfall was still with him, but Temple had stopped in the hall,
for the door of the occupied room opened and the couple were
looking at him suspectingly. Temple lifted his gun. He said:
"Hold it a minute."</p>

<p>The woman suddenly put herself in front of the man and slammed
the door in Temple's face. A minute later she had run across to
her own window and was yelling out of it into the alley.
"Hey&mdash;hey&mdash;hey!" Temple stood there in the black hall
and cursed himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Surratt reached the empty room's back window, opened
and slid through it and lowered himself the length of his
arms&mdash;and dropped. That long fall stung his ankles, and he
rolled in the dirt and remained on his side, hearing Jud Horsfall
plump beside him with a heavy grunt. The woman was still
caterwauling into the alley just around the building's corner;
she was waking the town.</p>

<p>"Now wouldn't you think she'd be a Christian?" growled
Horsfall.</p>

<p>George Bernay was across the street by the White House, up in
his saddle and moving quietly toward the alley, when the woman's
strident yelling sailed unexpectedly along the street. It was as
though the fire bell in the courthouse steeple started to ring.
The effect of it was like that. Men wheeled on the walks; men
poured out of the saloon&mdash;all rushing at the alley. The
woman bent far down from her window, flinging out her arms, her
hair falling wildly around her face.</p>

<p>"That man Surratt&mdash;he's back of the building."</p>

<p>George Bernay kicked his horse into the alley, into the
forming crowd. He couldn't make headway against that mob; and
Hughie Grant, a Crow Track hand always, suddenly bored a hole
through the confused and charging cowhands and reached up to
seize Bernay's bridle. He said, cool and alert:</p>

<p>"Where you goin', George?"</p>

<p>Bernay swore in a soft, violent way. He lifted his boot from a
stirrup and used it to smash Hughie Grant backwards. Hughie Grant
reached down for his gun; he wasn't angry, he was a little bit
amused. But he put the gun on George Bernay in a manner that
wasn't to be mistaken. "Stay there a minute, George, till we see
what this is all about."</p>

<p>Bill Head ran from the White House with the other owners; and
Bill Head's voice began to throw some sort of order into this
confusion. "Dan&mdash;go through the stable!" The alley was alive
with riders now, and a gun began to blast up that yonder
blackness. A little section of Crow Track hands raced past the
bank, into the stable. George Bernay folded his hands on the
saddle horn and looked down at all this with a pale, wild and
useless rage.</p>

<p><br> Flat on his belly in the darkness behind the bank
building, Surratt heard the pack rush into the alley and come
toward him. Horsfall crouched near him, breathing fast. Horsfall
murmured: "George better be here with that horse pronto."</p>

<p>"Too late now. You get out of here, Jud." Surratt sprang up
and ran on down the rear side of these buildings, into a
continuing blackness. He stumbled over broken boxes and loose
wire, aiming for the faint glow of light ahead of him, which was
the back entrance of the stable. He meant to get in here.
Horsfall trotted faithfully at his heels, and he threw a quicker
warning at the man. "Get out of here!" Next moment he dropped,
and Horsfall dropped. Men turned out of the alley into this back
area; and at the same time a group shot through the stable's rear
opening and blocked that way entirely. There was no chance to run
now, except away from the building toward the clutter of sheds
and corrals that occupied the narrow space lying at the foot of
the ridge. Sinratt threw this chance from his mind as being no
good. He lay still. Horsfall was murmuring in his ear.</p>

<p>"If they want it, by God they can have it!"</p>

<p>Crow Track had him trapped&mdash;and it went about its
business with a sure knowledge that it had. These men were
spreading around him, trickling up from the alley, moving away
from the stable door. They were boxing him. Someone in the alley
kept throwing out quick orders and afterwards Bill Head's voice
reached forward, very certain.</p>

<p>"Come out of there, Surratt."</p>

<p>Surratt held his tongue a moment, wickedly considering it. Jud
Horsfall, desperate and reckless in this trap, was again
whispering. "To hell with 'em!"</p>

<p>But in a moment Surratt quietly answered the call. "Where's
Bolderbuck?"</p>

<p>The marshal immediately spoke up from the stable door. "Here,
Surratt."</p>

<p>"You come up. I'll give you my gun."</p>

<p>Bolderbuck walked on. Surratt laid a warning hand on
Horsfall's back, pushing Horsfall definitely against the earth,
and got up and went over to meet Bolderbuck. He handed the
marshal his gun and turned Bolderbuck around. They went back to
the stable door together, through the forming clutter of ranch
hands and on out to the street. Light was shining here, with all
the crowding faces turned somber and sullen by it. The tide had
set out of the alley, men running up to thicken the surrounding
ranks. Bill Head plunged his way through and his ruddy face was
doggedly pleased. He said to Bolderbuck: "Bring him to the
hotel."</p>

<p>Bolderbuck had Surratt's gun still in his fist. He swung it
around the circle. "Make a track here," he said quietly.
"Surratt's going to the jail."</p>

<p>"Bolderbuck!" shouted Head, "you mind me!"</p>

<p>"Bill," said Tom Bolderbuck, "I still run this town."</p>

<p>He walked straight ahead, with Surratt beside him, the
unyielding breadth of his body making a hole in the Crow Track
ring. He got through with Surratt; and kept on toward the jail
office. Crow Track kept following, restless and on the edge of a
break, with Bill Head's voice low and furious in the background.
Bolderbuck didn't bother to look back. He went through the jail-
office door; and shut the door. He spoke then, with a little
restlessness in his voice. "Up the stairs."</p>

<p>They went up the stairs. Bolderbuck opened an iron-barred door
and stood aside and watched Surratt go through. He closed the
door and locked it. He put his back to the cell.</p>

<p>Crow Track boiled into the jail office below, the stairway
began to groan with their oncoming weight. Bolderbuck listened to
it for a dragging moment, and then turned and thrust Surratt's
gun between the bars. He said: "Slip this under the bunk
blankets. You're cool and I admire you. We've had luck so far,
but it may not last."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. THE TURNING HOUR</h2>

<p class="first">TOM BOLDERBUCK turned from the cell door to face
the length of this second-story jail corridor. Bill Head came up
the stairs, with Peyrolles and Kersom and Cameron and half a
dozen of the Head riders following. They came on until
Bolderbuck's broad shape stopped them; and they spread out and
filled the corridor completely. The dull light of the bracket
lamps shined incompletely across their brown and stubborn and
partisan cheeks. Bolderbuck, as immovable in his attitude as one
of the Gray Bull peaks, studied these men and understood the
narrow gleaming in their eyes. It was a stung savagery he saw and
carefully marked. His attention remained a moment on George
Bernay, who had followed this group; afterwards it switched to Ab
Cameron's mild, sad cheeks and then turned more fully to Bill
Head.</p>

<p>"Open the door, Tom," commanded Head.</p>

<p>Bolderbuck seemed to calculate the exact measure of danger
here; and some practical and very shrewd consideration evidently
tipped his mind. He said calmly: "No rough stuff, Bill," and
unlocked the door, entering the cell first. When Bill Head and
the other three owners had followed him Bolderbuck put up an
arresting hand at the rest of the crowd. "Stay in the
hall&mdash;you." Hughie Grant was in this group. He laughed a
little, but he didn't step into the cell. George Bernay worked
his way forward and got beside Hughie Grant at the doorway.
Hughie Grant looked at him, still grinning. "Don't make no plays
here, George," he said.</p>

<p>Bolderbuck stood solidly in his boots and watched this scene
with a dogged care. Surratt made a high, tough shape in the
middle of the cell, throwing back an expression purely smooth. It
held nothing that Bolderbuck could see. Bill Head had come to a
massive stop in front of Surratt. Peyrolles and Kersom were to
one side of him, old Ab Cameron remained sadly and unwillingly in
the background. Bill Head's ruddy face was bitter and brutal in
its show of triumph. He lifted his big fists and hooked his
thumbs into the armholes of his vest.</p>

<p>"You were up at Brann's office," he said, "and Brann's gone.
So you came to get him to go see Torveen, who's been shot.
Where's Torveen hidin'?"</p>

<p>"You've got a bright mind, Bill. You find out."</p>

<p>Bill Head's ruddy complexion thickened. The remark raked up a
resentment that changed the slant of his lips. He said, with a
softness that was wicked: "You'll tell me, friend Surratt. You'll
tell me."</p>

<p>"Bring a few more of your crew in here," suggested Surratt.
"It'll make you feel safer."</p>

<p>The cool rashness of that talk attracted Bolderbuck's
considering glance to Surratt. Surratt was faintly smiling; a
devil's temper plainly stirred behind the smoky color of his
eyes. The silence lay deep and heavy in the cell; beyond the bars
Head's men were as still as statues. Bill Head's face was a
furious red. His right foot moved a little backward and his right
fist jumped from its idle position, without warning of any kind,
and smashed Surratt on the chin. Surratt fell backward against
the cell wall; he dropped to his knees. His head sagged down and
he supported himself with stiff arms a moment, his shoulders
swaying.</p>

<p>"Do that again," growled Bolderbuck, "and I'll bend a gun over
your skull, Bill."</p>

<p>George Bernay's voice came into the cell, strained and
passionate. "Head, I'd like to kill you for that!" Hughie Grant,
beside George Bernay, abruptly cocked his eyes on Bernay. "Easy,
George. You ain't among friends."</p>

<p>Ab Cameron spoke out his sickened, heartfelt protest. "That's
no way for a white man to act, Bill."</p>

<p>Head and Peyrolles and Kersom swung on Cameron almost in
unison, angry at the interference; and Head rapped Cameron with
an insolent command. "Shut up, Ab." He wheeled to cover Surratt
with a sultry, desiring attention. Surratt got to his feet, he
supported himself against the cell wall. But to Bolderbuck it was
a strange thing how that faint, ironic smile came back to
Surratt; how it laid an irrevocable and relentless will across
the room, beyond the power of any man to stop. It was strong
enough to impress them all, for Peyrolles shifted his position
cautiously and Kersom stirred. Bill Head's profile was all solid
and somber. The desire was there to lash out and crush Surratt
again, but he kept watching Surratt's face and that desire seemed
to be swayed by another thought He threw a narrowing glance at
Bolderbuck.</p>

<p>Surratt was speaking. "I've been a long time figuring you out,
Head. In the beginning I misjudged you, but I've got you straight
now."</p>

<p>"It will do you no good," said Bill Head in a slow, snarling
way.</p>

<p>Surratt didn't answer. He stood straight against the wall, and
it was at once plain to them that a wild, killing impulse raged
in him. Bill Head stepped back a pace. He said, more under
control: "I've got fifty men in Morgantown. They're going into
the hills tonight. I can tell you now, Surratt, you're at the end
of your own rope&mdash;and Torveen's at the end of his." He
turned and thrust a long finger toward George Bernay in the
corridor. "You're in this, George. I'm givin' you just twelve
hours to get out of the country."</p>

<p>The motion of his arm sent all his riders down the corridor
and down the stairs. He left the cell, and Peyrolles and Kersom
went out. Cameron stood a moment longer, lost in some vague,
unhappy speculation of his own. At last he walked over to
Surratt. "You're an admirable man to know," he murmured, "and
I'll remember this many long days. But I have no recourse and
neither have you." He went away then, faintly unsure in his
walking. George Bernay didn't stir from the cell door.</p>

<p>Bolderbuck moved into the corridor and stopped by a window
commanding the street. He lifted the sash and put his head near
the opening, catching the talk that came from below. Crow Track
waited down there. His eyes were thoughtful as he came back and
locked the cell door.</p>

<p>Surratt said: "You want that gun back now?"</p>

<p>Bolderbuck showed a faint dissatisfaction. "The first dumb
thing I've heard you say. I didn't mention anything about the
gun, did I? You play your cards like they're dealt to you, my
boy, without askin' the dealer any questions. This thing ain't
over yet. I know what's in Bill Head's mind and I know what he's
apt to try to do. Maybe I can stop him. But I'm damned if I leave
a man in a cell without ways of protectin' himself at a time like
this." He stared at George Bernay. "You can stay up here for a
little while. Don't get any funny notions, you understand?"
Leaving his warning flat and final behind him, he descended the
stairway.</p>

<p>George Bernay grabbed the cell-door bars in his hands and
shook them with all his strength. It was the way he felt.
"Surratt, you can kick my pants off and I'd be relieved."</p>

<p>"What's below?" Surratt asked.</p>

<p>Sound kept boiling up from the street. George Bernay fixed
himself discreetly beside the window, having his look at the
crowd below. The outfits were assembling in a round, restless
formation. Bill Head stepped into the saddle; Peyrolles and
Kersom rode from some obscure angle of the town to join him. The
smell of a dry, scorched dust lifted strongly to George Bernay's
nostrils. Ab Cameron stood on the edge of the walk; and Bill Head
rode toward the older man, using an arrogant tone on him. "Why
didn't you bring your men along?"</p>

<p>"You got plenty men," Ab Cameron said agreeably.</p>

<p>"You can't dodge your part of this work," retorted Bill
Head.</p>

<p>"It's your work, Bill, not mine," suggested Ab Cameron.</p>

<p>"What?" said Bill Head. He swung his heavy body downward. He
was severe and he was threatening. "Don't tell me that, Ab. I'm
going to send a rider over to bring your outfit up to me in the
hills. All right, everybody."</p>

<p>They milled forward and fell into a column of twos and left
Morgantown at a wild gallop, like the outrushing of wind. Motion
and confusion and uncertainty went with them and peace flowed
along the street, the murmur of voices tentatively creeping
through the quietness. Townsmen appeared on the walks. Lights,
dimmed during the occupancy of the outfits, sprang up again.
George Bernay saw Judith Cameron come from the dressmaking shop
and hurry up the street; Ab Cameron saw her too, for he turned
down toward her, calling out in a strange, hopeless way:
"Daughter&mdash;go back." But it wasn't that scene George Bernay
was immediately interested in. Five men&mdash;five of Head's
men&mdash;remained by the jail-office door; they made a compact
and vigilant group there. George Bernay sucked in a long breath.
He reported what he saw to Surratt.</p>

<p>"Sure," murmured Surratt. "Bill Head wants to be certain I'm
in the cooler when he comes back." He walked around the cell; he
put his hands to the solid walls as he circled and he came back
and stood at the door. His eyes were restless; his muscles were
restless.</p>

<p>Bernay wheeled from the window and started down the hall. "See
you later."</p>

<p>"George," called Surratt, and brought the man to a halt.
"Don't," added Surratt, "try anything rough on Bolderbuck. That
fellow is white."</p>

<p>"This is no time to think of that," said George Bernay.</p>

<p>Surratt's voice hit him like the flat of an ax. "Bernay."</p>

<p>It widened George Bernay's eyes. It shocked him. "There's
never any time to forget a white man," said Surratt, cold and
exact with his words. "You remember that."</p>

<p>George Bernay walked down the stairs, not nearly as certain as
he had been a moment before. He paused in the jail office.
Bolderbuck sat before a flat desk, with his back to the wall and
his face bent on the open doorway. But the marshal's face was
heavy with his thinking, and he seemed only vaguely aware of
Bernay, who went on out of the place. Head's five men were
watching him carefully and Hughie Grant was grinning at him. He
went by them without comment, but Grant's amused advice followed
him down the street. "Don't be rash, Georgie, my boy."</p>

<p>Cameron and Judith had gone on to the dressmaking shop. That
way George Bernay turned, his mind marching nearer and nearer a
fixed conclusion. At the saloon corner he found Jud Horsfall
poised in the alley shadows. George said: "Come on&mdash;and
where's Billy Temple?"</p>

<p>"Down there," said Jud, pointing toward the dressmaking shop.
They fell in step and passed the saloon. One townsman came out of
the saloon, and through the momentary opening of the doors George
saw the place empty save for the bartender and Neal Irish, who
sat bowed over a game of solitaire. They turned into the
dressmaking shop. The two girls were there with Ab Cameron and
Billy Temple; and a woman&mdash;Annette Carvel's mother&mdash;sat
in the background, saying nothing.</p>

<p>Judith spoke to her father: "It will take you an hour to get
to the ranch and bring the boys back here. That's enough&mdash;to
get Surratt out."</p>

<p>Cameron showed his uncertainty and confusion, he showed his
age. "No," he said. "No, Daughter. I can't ask the boys to stack
up against Billy Head."</p>

<p>"I can!" said Judith. There was a vigor and a resoluteness
about the girl George Bernay profoundly respected then. She was a
woman, a full and gallant woman. There was a spirit shining in
her eyes now that brought his own stray thinking to that final
point beyond doubt. But Ab Cameron shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"They'd be gone by the time I got there. Bill Head sent a man
to bring them to him. Anyhow it would do us no good. They're
loyal to me, no doubt. But they've got to live in this country
and it would be hell to set 'em against the Head crowd and the
Peyrolles crowd and Dutch Kersom's crowd." The silence that
followed his statement seemed to arouse him a little. "You don't
know Bill Head," he told them simply. "If I crossed his desires
in this matter I'd have no men on my ranch within a week. Nor
would I ever be able to hire anybody. We cannot help
Surratt."</p>

<p>Judith considered her father in a quick, comprehending way, as
though she saw and felt what his life had been; and she touched
his arm, gently smiling. "I am sorry," she murmured.</p>

<p>George Bernay passed a long look to Billy Temple, and Jud
Horsfall came toward the center of the room, and then these three
men were silently, narrowly speculating. Horsfall softly
suggested the thought. "There's five of 'em up there in front of
that jail door, kid."</p>

<p>"It's Hughie Grant that's tough," pointed out Billy
Temple.</p>

<p>George Bernay said: "Well?"</p>

<p>The other people caught on then. The thing these three young
men were thinking became that plain and that strong. Ab Cameron
had a half-smoked cigar in his mouth. He lighted a match; his
fingers shook. He turned the full worry of his eyes on George
Bernay. "I'd advise you not to try. I have seen a good deal of
tragedy in this country. We're all seeing some now. Sam Torveen's
about run his course and I strongly doubt if Surratt gets out of
that jail alive. Even if he does, nothing can change the end of
this affair. This is cattle country. Sheep will never come. The
big outfits won't permit it&mdash;and Bill Head speaks for the
big outfits. You will be one more outlaw, to be treated as such.
Don't think of it."</p>

<p>But George Bernay said to Temple: "We'll walk up behind the
buildings on the north side and come out there, across from the
jail."</p>

<p>Annette Carvel's face turned to George Bernay; it was white
and round and surprised. Her lips opened. She seemed to be seeing
him for the first time. Her eyes took him in carefully, as they
would a stranger. Billy Temple said again: "It's this Hughie
Grant..."</p>

<p>"I'll have a look at his hole card," murmured George Bernay.
"He seems pretty proud of it. The back door, Jud&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, George!" commanded Judith.</p>

<p>He said: "Judith, that fellow Surratt's my friend, and I don't
know why. It's a thing that gets you. There's no fear in the man.
Why, hell, I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bit the sentence between his teeth and he leaped for the
doorway. There was a shot's solid smash filling the street, and
one replying echo, and the sudden short rush of horse's hoofs,
and a man's voice laid a massive unhurried order across
Morgantown. George Bernay went through the doorway. He trotted up
the street, colliding with other townsmen coming out of the
buildings into the lamp-softened shadows. Even as he ran, he saw
horsemen close in on the jail door and surround the five Crow
Track hands. There was no more gunplay. Forty feet away, with
Horsfall and Temple at his heels, he identified the enormous,
shapeless bulk of Blackjack Smith. Blackjack had four riders with
him; he had dropped out of the darkness without warning. It was
his lifted and pointed gun that seemed to hold Head's men
thoroughly silent by the jail wall.</p>

<p>One of Blackjack's men turned in his saddle. He called at
Bernay: "Hold up!"</p>

<p>George Bernay yelled: "Hey, Blackjack!"</p>

<p>Blackjack didn't look around. But he identified George
Bernay's voice and his voice accepted Bernay. "You'll do, George.
Get in here and drop these fellow's belts for me. I hear
Surratt's upstairs."</p>

<p>Bernay pushed his way through the horses. Four of Head's men
were motionless against the jail wall, their hands risen. The
fifth man lay on the board walk. He was on his back, rolling from
side to side. Looking down briefly into that set, gritting face,
Bernay marked Hughie Grant with a cold pleasure.</p>

<p>"He ain't hurt much," said Blackjack indifferently.</p>

<p>"I'll write your ticket!" gasped Hughie Grant.</p>

<p>"My ticket," said Blackjack, "was written before you were
born. Stay around here, boys, while I go inside." He dropped to
the ground with an agility strange to so ponderous a shape. He
stood a moment, watching George Bernay strip away the gun belts
from these Head men and throw them far out into the street; and
darkly and taciturnly he enjoyed that scene for a moment.
Afterwards he entered the jail office. Bernay followed.</p>

<p>Bolderbuck hadn't risen from his chair. He sat there and
looked at the two men with a glance that was unreadable, that was
shrewd and stubborn and fixed. Blackjack shook his head; there
was a small regret and a perceptible courtesy in his words.</p>

<p>"You know me, Tom, and I know you. But I heard Surratt was
here and I want him out."</p>

<p>"The man's got friends in strange places," observed Bolderbuck
quietly.</p>

<p>"It's his way, Tom."</p>

<p>Bolderbuck bent forward. He put his elbows on the table in
front of him and lowered his cheeks. He remained so, engaged with
his difficult thoughts. Blackjack stood mountainously calm,
letting the marshal have his silence out. When Bolderbuck reared
back in the chair there wasn't any change in his manner. The
crisp blue of his eyes steadied on Blackjack. "Surratt's in jail
on a warrant, which is legal and proper. I've been a peace
officer pretty near twenty years and in that time I never let a
man go and never lost one. I'm kind of pleased to think of the
record."</p>

<p>Bernay started to speak, and changed his mind. For
Bolderbuck's hand had shifted up to his vest, to the thin silver
crescent that was his badge of authority. "As long as I'm marshal
I'd see you in hell before I gave Surratt up. But it works the
other way, too. The boy is in a death trap up there. I cannot
protect him against what Head plainly intends to do. I do not
know of any other answer to this." His fingers touched the badge
and unsnapped it. He laid it on the table, beside a ring of keys.
"When a man can't see his way in a plain light it's time to quit.
So there the star lays and there's the keys."</p>

<p>Bernay reached for the keys and walked up the stairs.
Bolderbuck shot a frosty glance at the silent Blackjack. "Head's
a pretty powerful enemy for you to be makin', Blackjack. You've
had your parsnips well buttered, till now. You're goin' to
discover what trouble is."</p>

<p>Surratt came down the stairs with Bernay behind him. He looked
at Blackjack and saw how it was. He turned to Bolderbuck. "Tom,"
he said regretfully, "this is a thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your luck still holds," commented Bolderbuck. "I'm pleased
with the way it goes. But you better be on your horse soon."</p>

<p>Surratt went out of the jail office into the shadow-thickened
street; and was smiling as he went to a Crow Track horse and
stepped up. Blackjack and Bernay had come from the office. It was
quiet here, with a little group of townspeople collected by the
White House and looking soberly on.</p>

<p>"Blackjack..." said Surratt.</p>

<p>"Go on," grumbled the big man. "Go on and ride. I never
thought I'd live to see the day I'd do this."</p>

<p>George Bernay felt the pinch of time. "You better dust, before
somebody comes pouring down that road."</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" Surratt wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Not with you," Bernay instantly answered. "Get Sam out of the
country&mdash;don't delay it. And so long."</p>

<p>Surratt turned from the group. But he halted here a moment,
for his name had been called. Judith Cameron came riding fast up
the street. She stopped beside him and her voice dropped low and
none of that group heard what was said then. In the end she
turned with Surratt and they both rode out of Morgantown.</p>

<p>Blackjack was in his saddle. George Bernay had turned to
Horsfall and Billy Temple, and presently these two went back down
the street on the run. Blackjack stared at George Bernay, not
understanding. He said: "What's this now?"</p>

<p>But George Bernay didn't answer till Horsfall and Temple
returned with their own horses and his. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Company for you, Blackjack."</p>

<p>Blackjack said sourly: "We're no company for you boys."</p>

<p>"Go along," said Bernay; and then that group whirled away,
into the hills. Hughie Grant sat propped against the jail office,
cursing at them, but none of the other Head riders went over to
pick their guns from the dust until Blackjack's group merged with
the night.</p>

<p>Inside the jail office, Tom Bolderbuck lighted himself a fresh
cigar and stood up. He ran his finger across the badge which lay
on the desk. He had no regrets. A literal-minded man to the
extreme, he never crossed a bridge until he reached it&mdash;and
this bridge he had crossed because there was no other way. Yet he
was displeased with himself and didn't know why. He left the jail
office, passing the Crow Track men without a backward look. Bill
Head's wrath would visit him soon enough he realized; yet he went
to the hotel porch and sat in a rocker there and somberly smoked
his cigar.</p>

<p>A mile from Morgantown George Bernay said to Blackjack,
"Wait," and his order stopped the party.</p>

<p>"You ain't in a hurry to go anywhere particular?" suggested
Bernay.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Turn here then," directed Bernay; whereupon the group entered
a trail and vanished toward the south.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. DEATH COMES TO A MAN</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as they got beyond Morgantown, Surratt
left the pass road. Faint moonlight seeped through the trees,
showing him the vague arch of another road leading into the
south. Judith said: "Where are we going, Buck?"</p>

<p>"To a point on the river where a man named Modoc Niles was
killed."</p>

<p>"There?" she murmured. Afterwards she added: "I know the
way."</p>

<p>"Take the lead. I'm just going at it blind."</p>

<p>They ran on through the crisp and pungent night for a matter
of three miles or so before she turned to the east and fell upon
a corduroy trail leading into the higher hills. They passed much
later a ranch house in a low meadow, from which a single light
was cheerfully shining. "Billy Temple's place," she said, over
her shoulder. Then they were in the solid trees and no light got
through this green wall to show them the way. The trail turned,
but they left it and pursued a narrowing slash upward. At one
point they stopped to let the horses blow and Surratt's attentive
ears quested the far, deep stillness for the sound of Head's
searching scouts. Judith's voice was as soft as a breath of
wind.</p>

<p>"I think they've not had time to spread down this way."</p>

<p>They continued, walking where the hill slopes sharply tipped,
cantering when the ground ran level. It was a half-hour later
that Surratt saw a streak of moonlight coming down through the
pines and knew they were at the edge of a north-and-south road of
some consequence. His senses lifted at once; for a rumor struck
forward definitely. He said, "Wait," and drew in. There was a
strengthening echo over on the left; Judith came beside him then,
and her hand reached out and fell on his arm, the pressure of her
fingers tightening as the moments dragged. Riders&mdash;two or
three of them&mdash;went by on the road, vaguely visible through
the brush. They waited until the sound had faded, then crossed
the road and kept rising with the slope. Head's men were
spreading fast, laying a loose net through all the hills;
thinking of this, Surratt's attentive senses reached more keenly
into the tricky, felt-thick shadows. But there was a part of his
mind free to have its way with him, and that part was filled with
the strange and strong impressions of this girl. Her shoulders
swayed faintly as she rode and he saw now and then the trim
outline of her head turning gracefully. The tone of her voice,
when she broke the long riding silence, was a tone that struck
soft and clear and vital across all uncertainty.</p>

<p>She had stopped with a warning abruptness and she was bending
forward. Brought stiffly up, he saw a meadow's yellow glow
directly to the fore&mdash;and the blurred, still shape of a
horseman in it. This was only a hundred yards away, near enough
to betray to that one the steady draw of their horses' breathing.
Yet the man, poised as though listening, seemed not to hear it;
and presently he slid on across the meadow and vanished with a
minute rattle of the surrounding thicket. Judith veered around
the meadow, holding her pony to a slow walk. The meadow dropped
behind and afterwards the sightless trail fell between tall
shoulders of rock. Sparks shot up from the shoes of Judith's
animal, creating a pale spray of light, and the sound of that
concussion rode the stillness hugely. They were out of the
defile. The ruffled run of water came to them softly
then&mdash;and the faint odor of wood-smoke was abroad. Judith
stopped here and Surratt went ahead of her. It was for only a
dozen yards. Halted, he sent a small, gentle challenge at the
blackness.</p>

<p>"Nick."</p>

<p>The answer seemed almost under his feet; and it came in a rush
of expelled breath. "That was close," sighed Perrigo's voice.
"Who's with you?"</p>

<p>"Miss Cameron."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"Somebody riding around here, Nick. We saw a fellow cross a
meadow just below." He went on with Judith, dropped down the
short bluff and followed the gravelly bottom of the old-time
river bed. A remote glow indicated the mouth of the cavern, with
a shape angularly placed against the glow. Ferd Bowie's challenge
met them as they got down.</p>

<p>"That's all right, kid," grunted Surratt. He took Judith's arm
and led her into the cavern. Around its quick bend firelight
jumped freshly at them and the pungent smoke was thick here. Ed
and Doc Brann stood close by the fire; Sam Torveen was a shape
under the blankets, his head turned their way. Judith dropped
down to her knees, and Surratt heard her voice break and be near
to crying. "Oh, Sam&mdash;what have they done to you?"</p>

<p>All of them were watching Sam Torveen's gray face brighten.
The presence of this girl was a warmth that smoothed and softened
his pain. The deep dark-drawn lines of his face eased. There was
a faint loosening of his lips into the old, skeptic smile. His
one good arm reached up and touched Judith's shoulders. "Honey,"
he murmured, "I'm sure glad you're here, but it's one hell of a
place for you to be."</p>

<p>Judith wheeled toward Brann. "Be honest&mdash;how bad is
this?"</p>

<p>"He's all right," said Brann casually. "It was a lot of blood
he lost."</p>

<p>Sam Torveen never let his eyes turn from Judith. Hope was
strong in them and pleasure put spots of color on his drawn
cheeks. "It's a help to know you thought enough to come," he said
humbly.</p>

<p>"Sam," she murmured; and then she was quietly crying. Bending
her head she kissed him on his stubbled chin. Surratt jerked
around on his heels and walked back to the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>He stood there, glowering into the liquid blackness, with a
still more profound blackness in his brain. He got out his pipe
and automatically packed it. The light of the match, when he
lifted it to the pipebowl, showed the bony set of his jaws. There
was a pattern to a man's life and it never changed; there was a
fate that covered him from beginning to end and neither hope nor
bitter fighting could temper that. He dragged the smoke heavily
into his hale lungs, all wild and savage-tempered and reckless
from knowing he never would have this girl. His eyes, against his
own wishes, had looked ahead and saw some faint gleam of luck. He
knew definitely and bitterly now that he had fooled himself. The
morning half of the trail was always bright with the newness of
things, and the way was fresh and full of pleasant prospect. The
second half was only regret for what had been and what never
would be. He was on the afternoon side of his journey now, with
no shade for a traveler along this way until the final sundown
came.</p>

<p>Perrigo glided softly out of the night. Ferd Bowie came from
somewhere and remained vaguely behind Perrigo. Brann and Ed and
the girl walked from the tunnel. They made a loose group
there.</p>

<p>"Can we move him?" asked Surratt.</p>

<p>"No," said Brann, "you can't. The boy's lost too much
blood."</p>

<p>"Where'd you want to move him?" asked Perrigo.</p>

<p>"Over the peaks, out of this country." The bowl of Surratt's
pipe cut a round, crimson hole in the shadows. "It's not my habit
to give up easy, but Sam's lost this fight. Bill Head's throwing
forty or fifty men into the hills. It is only a question of time
till we're found. I wouldn't want Sam to get in their hands now,
not with one killing to his credit and a bunch ready to settle
that score."</p>

<p>"You can't move him," repeated Brann very definitely. "He's
unable to ride or walk."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to play our white chips like we were proud of
'em. Put out that fire, Ed."</p>

<p>"Nobody can see it."</p>

<p>"No, but you can smell it for a mile."</p>

<p>They stood thoroughly still for a little while, having nothing
to say. Surratt watched Ferd Bowie's thin shape sway and swing.
The kid went away, his boots scuffling up a small noise. Perrigo
turned to follow. Brann murmured, "Well, we'll make a night of
it," and went back into the cave with Ed. Judith remained. It was
long afterwards when her voice came to him, low and rather
sad.</p>

<p>"It's like a light going out, Buck&mdash;when you give up
hope."</p>

<p>He stared at the shapeless bulk of the gravel bank which
separated this old stream's course from the river. A tempest
stormed up from that wild, lonely place in him which lay beyond
his will, out of that very core of his body where were bred his
most reckless angers and his gentlest regrets. He bit his jaws
against it. "You had better be riding back."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'm staying here."</p>

<p>He said, "All right," and moved away from her to the gravel
bank. He sat down there. She stood a moment, uncertain and
silent, and then came forward. She settled beside him, her
shoulder against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You don't mind?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He put his hands across his knees and locked his big fists
together. Her hand came out to touch his fists; and the coldness
and smallness of that hand did strange things to him, past his
understanding. He put it between his palms.</p>

<p>At once she turned, and he saw the pale oval of her face come
near to him and rest on his chest Her body tipped in and she was
crying in a silent intense way that shook all the courage and
pride and serenity out of her.</p>

<p>He laid his arms around her, holding her thus against the
moment's despair. He had never seen Judith cry, he had never seen
a break in her strength before&mdash;and it was hard for him to
endure, this hurt he could not help.</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on with an instant's immeasurable clarity. He
had held Annette Carvel this way and felt the frank, passionate
offering of a girl he didn't want Stirred as he had been, he had
felt only a pity. But in his arms now was a sweetness and a
richness that filled all the empty places of his body, allowing
him for tins short fragment of time to know what completeness
could be. This was the full treasure of a man's dreaming. The
best of his life was here at this moment soon to pass away. For
he knew he would never hold her again and he knew that the rest
of his days would be deeper in want from the memory of this. The
fragrance of her hair touched his senses. She lay quietly in his
arms, the rhythm of her breathing growing calmer. He had no way
of stopping the one desire he felt; and so he said, "Judith," and
when her face lifted he kissed her. Her lips were cool and firm
and not afraid; and there was something in her that made him
savagely happy&mdash;a quality that through the years would never
grow less, something she could give to a man, yet never lose. She
straightened and sat beside him again, not speaking. But he
wasn't ashamed and he felt no need to apologize.</p>

<p>He said, quietly: "Sam's all right. There's still a trick or
so I can try."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I quit asking questions about tomorrow a long
while ago."</p>

<p>She said gently: "You're a very wise man, Buck. But not wise
enough to know why I should be crying now."</p>

<p>"Luck," he murmured, "comes even to the poorest of us. I had
mine just now. It is a thing to remember beside many a
campfire."</p>

<p>She rose swiftly and went back into the cave.</p>

<p><br> At noon of the following day Pokey crawled to the edge of
the river and saw, diagonally across the stream, the face of the
tunnel. Surratt stood there in the heavy sunlight with Judith
Cameron, and the sight of the girl jerked up Pokey's eyebrows and
left him slowly considering it. He had his rifle with him and
when, half an hour later, Perrigo came out of the farther trees
and dropped down the bluff to the tunnel, Pokey lifted his gun
and had a clean chance at the little man. Pokey lined him up
through the sights; he took up the trigger's slack and suspended
his breath for the final pull. But he never made it. Instead, he
lowered the gun and had a little talk with himself. He shook his
head with some disgust and crawled back into the timber. After
that he rode a mile down the river, crossed over and approached
the hideout again. Putting his horse in the brush he squatted by
the edge of that trail which led to the hideout, waiting with an
inevitable patience.</p>

<p><br> When Perrigo came up to the tunnel, with Pokey's distant
gun trained on him, he had completed a morning's swing through
the hills. He crouched in front of Surratt and the girl, resting
himself. Sweat ran freely along his very dark and very thin
cheeks. "Plenty tracks around here," he said. "That fellow you
saw last night in the meadow was within a hundred yards of this
spot. A big bunch has been see-sawin' back and forth about a
half-mile below. They keep cuttin' a higher trail each time. I
saw men over on the pass road. The fords are pretty well covered.
No chance of sneakin' over any bridges either. I think Head's
workin' the country from the falls this way, piece at a
time."</p>

<p>"Methodical," commented Surratt.</p>

<p>"One time I had my gun pointed on a fellow not more'n seventy
feet off," grumbled Perrigo. "He was scoutin' alone." He looked
at Judith. "One of your dad's men. He up here?"</p>

<p>"Bill Head sent for the men," said Judith bitterly. "Dad has
no say in the matter."</p>

<p>"Your father," grunted Perrigo, "has been under the Heads a
good many years. He never had the claws and teeth to fight back.
Where's Ferd?"</p>

<p>Surratt had started into the tunnel, but he wheeled when the
question came. "He left here an hour ago, to hunt for you. Didn't
see him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Perrigo. He considered that a long while. His face
turned thin and noncommittal. He met Surratt's glance. "No," he
repeated more slowly, "Ferd never went down that trail. His
tracks don't show."</p>

<p>Judith knew what they were thinking. She said: "I have always
thought Sam made a mistake using that man. He was nervous as a
cat around here this morning." She stopped, then burst out: "You
don't think he'd betray Sam?"</p>

<p>"Not Sam," countered Perrigo.</p>

<p>"Who, then?"</p>

<p>Perrigo put his finger out toward Surratt. He didn't say
anything. He slapped a hand sharply across his thigh and stood
up, going back to the trees on foot. He was traveling at a sort
of crouched dogtrot when he vanished in the green
undergrowth.</p>

<p>"There's another man I doubted," murmured Judith. "Somehow, I
don't now."</p>

<p>They turned into the tunnel. The closeness of water made it
damp and chilly in here, and the light was bad. Brann sat on the
gravel with his coat collar turned up. His eyes were bloodshot
from smoke and want of sleep. Ed was in another corner of the
tunnel, dead to the world after putting in half the night
patrolling. Torveen lay quietly underneath his blankets, but he
grinned at sight of Judith.</p>

<p>"No chance of getting back to town before dark?" asked
Brann.</p>

<p>"Hills are full of Head's men," countered Surratt "You tired
of waiting?"</p>

<p>"I left a full house on Neal Irish's poker table," grumbled
Brann. "I&mdash;?"</p>

<p>A far-off shot's echo stopped his talk. It came through the
cave's dead air and turned them all. There was a second echo, and
a third one, with a deliberate space of time between. Somebody
deeper in the green slopes was signaling. The group held that
attitude of waiting, constrained by the meaning of the sound.</p>

<p>"Gettin' nearer," observed Brann.</p>

<p>Judith looked at Torveen, a darkness across her fine gray
eyes. "I hate to think of you being caught like a rat in a trap!
What would happen if we went out and found Sheriff Ranier and
surrendered to him?"</p>

<p>But Brann and Surratt and Torveen said, "No," almost in
unison. The unanimity of their reactions surprised her. She
looked at Surratt and found him humorlessly smiling. "Surrender
isn't in the book of rules Bill Head carries, Judith."</p>

<p>"Ranier," grunted Brann, with the full shading of contempt,
"is a weathervane."</p>

<p>Judith said nothing more, but her eyes glowed with a fresh
anger, and her shoulders straightened and color came to her face.
Surratt watched this, his faint smile turning sad. "Don't worry,"
he counseled her quietly. "There's one more deal left in the
deck."</p>

<p>Torveen turned his face toward Brann. "Brann," he said, "look
at those two people. There they are&mdash;the two finest friends
I've ever had. By God, I'm happy for my luck&mdash;and I don't
know what I'd do if I lost 'em. Don't they make a fine pair,
Brann? Look at 'em!"</p>

<p>Brann said, "Uhuh." He had his glance on Surratt and the
girl&mdash;a quick, keen glance&mdash;and dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>Surratt swung away, his question brusque. "What time is
it?"</p>

<p>Brann looked at his watch: "Past two-thirty. Long day."</p>

<p>There was then the full rush of a shot's report, so near at
hand that it rang against the rock walls. One shot and only one.
Brann jerked himself upright; and Ed, sound asleep a moment
before, sprang out of his blankets. Surratt was instantly on his
way down the tunnel. He threw back a curt order, "Stay here," and
halted at the edge of the sunlight a moment. But he thought he
knew where that shot came from and ran up the side of the bluff
and entered the trail. A horseman went smashing through the
yonder brush. Perrigo's voice, beyond sight, was thin and fading;
guided by its diminishing tone, Surratt plowed his way into the
thicket There was twenty yards off the trail, a small clearing.
Coming upon it with a rush, he found Perrigo lying there, trying
to support himself on an elbow. When he saw Surratt his elbow
collapsed and he fell on his shoulder. "Watch out, Surratt!"</p>

<p>Surratt bent. "He's runnin'. Who was it?"</p>

<p>Perrigo began to cough in a slow, terrible way. Fear sprang
into his black eyes and dilated them tremendously. He choked off
the cough, little body racked by that effort "I knew it would
come like this someday."</p>

<p>"Bowie?"</p>

<p>Perrigo said faintly: "Him&mdash;no. Never mind. Damn Martin
Head&mdash;he knew! He knew all the time! There's a terrible man
to have against you."</p>

<p>Blood bubbled through a small round hole in Perrigo's chest.
Perrigo lifted his head and saw that rent in his lungs and his
hand reached up to cover it, like a gesture of decency. His lips
stretched, they sagged at the corners; yet watching him, Surratt
observed the fatalism and the grit at the bottom of Perrigo's
nature come up to fight this mortal darkness into which he was
slipping. Perrigo's voice kept ebbing, even while the desire to
talk powerfully urged him. "Listen," he murmured, "I shot Les
Head. It was why I mistrusted you. Thought you knew I'd done it.
Surratt, keep watch over my girl."</p>

<p>"What?" said Surratt.</p>

<p>"Annette," murmured Perrigo. "That's my secret and Mrs.
Carvel's. Annette don't know, but she's my girl. It was a mistake
of long ago, and it has been on my mind a long while. She was a
kid that grew up like a flower wantin' sun. She trusted men too
much, and always wanted men to like her. I saw that coming up
with Les Head, who was a dog and took what he could get. I have
no regrets for puttin' him out of the way. It was why I did
it&mdash;so he'd never hurt her."</p>

<p>He stopped a moment, bitterly holding himself alive. His voice
afterwards was merely a suspiration of falling breath. "I have
had her on my mind since she got to the age of attractin' men. By
God, Surratt, I have hated all the breed of men, out of fear! It
is why I disliked you. But it was a mistake, for I've watched you
and found you an honest man. If you wasn't, you wouldn't be here
fightin' Sam Torveen's fight. You take care of her for me,
Surratt I remember seein' her go to school when she was seven,
with a red bow in her hair. Hell is a place that has no worries
for me. I've had my hell watchin' a daughter I couldn't
own..."</p>

<p>Looking down at him, Surratt saw that he was dead.</p>

<p>He heard a sound then, small and scurrying; it struck the back
of his neck, and pure reaction rolled him aside and
around&mdash;thereby avoiding the bullet that scuffed up a thin
furrow of soil where he had been. The rush of the shot filled the
little clearing; and Ferd Bowie was there at the edge of it, his
gun wheeling to catch Surratt's awkward shape on the ground.
Surratt reached and seized the butt of his revolver and snapped a
quick shot. But it had been a chance aim and it went wide. Bowie
ducked his head as that bullet's breath poured along on his cheek
and then he whirled, as though his nerves and his courage could
not hold him against Surratt's firing, and crashed out of sight
in a low long dive. Surratt tried that area with a second bullet.
He was on his feet, running against the brush. He heard Bowie
cursing off there, behind the trees&mdash;and he stopped, faced
by the risk of another ambush. Bowie had reached his horse. In a
moment he was in the deep timber, racing away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. CORNERED</h2>

<p class="first">HE looked back at Perrigo lying sprawled in that
senseless, bottomless sleep, and for a moment he permitted
himself to feel the tragedy of Perrigo's life, as Perrigo had
felt it&mdash;the defeat and deep loneliness which so long had
racked that small frame. Judged on the scales of human behavior
this man had been bad and his snuffed-out life was no loss to the
hills; yet he had died thinking of a little girl with a red bow
in her hair walking under the sun, clutching at that memory with
the regret common to all men, good and bad alike. For a moment
Surratt understood this and for a moment he gave Perrigo his due;
then he closed it out of his head and turned back to the cave,
knowing then what his own duty was.</p>

<p>Judith and Brann and Ed were at the mouth of the cave. He
said: "We've lost Perrigo."</p>

<p>Judith's eyes clung to him, wide and dark. But Brann didn't
seem surprised. "What was those other shots?"</p>

<p>"That was Bowie having his say," murmured Surratt. "But he
missed me&mdash;and he ran."</p>

<p>"The dog," murmured Ed, "will give us away."</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>"After three," said Brann.</p>

<p>"The shots have already given us away," reflected Surratt.
"Anyhow, the fellow that got Perrigo knows we're around here.
Crow Track will come over and beat up this section. It's four
hours till dark. Brann, when can Sam be moved?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, maybe&mdash;but not under his own power."</p>

<p>Surratt turned into the tunnel. He had to stand a moment near
Torveen before his eyes adjusted themselves to the semidarkness.
Torveen's face, turning around to him, was strained and
depressed.</p>

<p>"Somebody got Perrigo from the brush&mdash;and Bowie's run
away."</p>

<p>"I heard the shootin'," sighed Torveen. He tried to lift
himself&mdash;and fell back, breath thumping in and out of him.
"I'd just as soon be dead as this!"</p>

<p>Surratt noticed the feebleness of the man then. Brann hadn't
told them the whole truth concerning Torveen's condition. He
said, "You hang tight," and picked up Torveen's gun belt. He
thumbed half the cartridges from their loops and put them into
his pocket</p>

<p>"Kid," said Torveen, "we've played out our string. I think you
better dust over the pass and be on your way."</p>

<p>Surratt grinned. "I've observed Bill Head to be a man who gets
his ideas on the third bounce. It's the way we work this now. But
you'll have to grit your teeth to it, Sam."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Surratt turned back to the mouth of the tunnel. Ed had gone
off somewhere, leaving the girl and Doc Brann here in the hard
sunlight. The smell of the late day was resinous; the air clung
to the ground, motionless and smoky and hot. There was, he
observed, a fear in these two people. Brann's indifference
couldn't hide it, and Judith Cameron's eyes were dark with what
she thought. He said to Brann: "I can give you tonight&mdash;I
think I can. But it is all I can give you."</p>

<p>"How'll we move him?" grumbled Brann. "He's weak as a dragged
cat. The boy's hurt, you understand?"</p>

<p>"Let him take his choice of chances," said Surratt evenly.
"There's little left to choose from. You've got tonight."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm giving it to you," explained Surratt. "When dark
comes you fix a way of moving him. Not farther up the hills, like
Head might expect, but back down. It is around six miles, I'd
guess, to Temple's house. How could Head think of him bein'
there, that close to Morgantown?"</p>

<p>"No," said Brann, "I&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But Surratt spoke with a real anger. "I thought you were a
poker player!" He turned instantly away from them. Judith called
his name. He didn't look back; he kept on, going up the bluff and
into the brush where the horses were. Ed was there, standing
without much purpose against his pony. Surratt swung into his
saddle. "Ed," he said, "if you hear firin' after dark tonight, up
in the north, that's your signal to get out of here." Judith was
once more calling; he heard her running up the bluff. Turning his
horse, he drove through the brush and reached the trail and
galloped along it.</p>

<p>When he had gone two hundred yards he slid into the trees.
There was a ridge rising in front of him, a piece of high ground
separating this region from the pass road. He headed that way.
Now and then, down some narrow vista, he got a quick glimpse of
the sun, harsh and glittering in the west. The river was on his
near right, sinking slowly into its deeper bed. Twenty minutes
after leaving the hideout he came to a trail cutting across his
route, a thin and winding alley through the forest twilight.
Riders, he observed from the marks in the humus soil, had been
this way during the afternoon. He crossed the trail and
disappeared in the rising tangle of the ridge.</p>

<p><br> A mile from the scene of Perrigo's shooting, Pokey
abandoned his brush riding and took the trail leading to the pass
road. He had heard the subsequent firing&mdash;which was the
swift duel between Surratt and Ferd Bowie&mdash;and he had been
puzzled by it. Yet he felt himself safe, for Head riders were
crossing and recrossing all this area with an increasing
regularity, and his judgment told him none of Torveen's remaining
party would venture after him. So he rode along at a casual gait,
his little body humped over and his toes pointing outward, deep-
sunk in his own strict reflections. There was a conscience in
this wiry little man and an imagination, yet Perrigo's death
affected him only remotely. For at bottom, Pokey was the henchman
forever bound. Martin Head's word had been law with Pokey for
twenty years and the knowledge of his exact obedience to that law
was his pride. Martin Head had been injured by this Perrigo;
therefore Perrigo was an enemy. Martin Head, terrible in his
sense of right and wrong, had told Pokey to find and kill
Perrigo; therefore Pokey went out to obey with a faithfulness
that was almost oriental and a lack of compunction that was pure
fatalism. To Pokey, Martin Head was God.</p>

<p>Bill Head, Pokey knew, had established a kind of headquarters
on the pass road; that way Pokey drifted. But before he got there
he swung to go up a little ridge whence he might have a view of
the back trail. It was always his custom to keep his rear well
guarded. From his vantage point he saw a group of men over on the
pass road, less than a mile removed, with riders coming into the
road, at intervals and other parties leaving on fresh scouts.
Having no love for Bill Head, Pokey remarked all this confusion
with a critical eye; they were blotting out the scent with their
ceaseless blundering. Afterwards his glance swung around and then
he saw a horseman coming along the same trail he had used,
apparently bound for Bill Head's location. He would have put the
man out of his mind had it not been for the way in which that
rider kept ducking off the trail at intervals. It was a
nervousness that could belong to no Head rider. When the fellow
got a little closer Pokey put his attention on the horse, which
was plainer to his eye than the rider. There wasn't a horse in
the country Pokey couldn't identify at a distance by its gait and
color and height; and immediately he recognized Ferd Bowie's
long-barreled pearl gelding.</p>

<p>Pokey's eyes winked carefully. He thought he understood what
Bowie was up to, for Bowie had no standing among honorable men
anywhere. Whereupon Pokey searched his mind for Old Martin Head's
will in the matter and his own inclinations. He came to a prompt
decision, cut down the ridge and stationed himself slightly to
one side of the trail. When Bowie came around a farther bend
Pokey moved into sight and stood quietly there.</p>

<p>At sight of Pokey, Bowie jerked back in his saddle. He was
fifty feet away, and for a time Pokey thought the angular, gray-
faced kid meant to bolt into the brush. He called out then.</p>

<p>"Where you goin, Ferd?"</p>

<p>"Pokey, I want to see you," said Bowie.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pokey. "Only it's a poor place for you to
be."</p>

<p>Bowie was cocked in his saddle, ready for trouble and
suspecting it. But there was a stronger desire in his narrow
head. That desire kept him from running. Pokey's hatbrim dropped
against the low-thrown shafts of sunlight; nevertheless his
glance clung to the least jerk of Ferd Bowie's high-strung
muscles. He had no faith in the kid.</p>

<p>Bowie said: "I've had enough. I'm pullin' out of here."</p>

<p>"Turn and go the other way," suggested Pokey. "Or you'll get
shot on sight."</p>

<p>"I can take care of myself. I want to make talk."</p>

<p>Pokey said nothing; the set of his face was sad and bland and
unrevealing.</p>

<p>"You want to know where Surratt is?"</p>

<p>"Why you tellin'?"</p>

<p>"You want to know?" insisted Bowie. He looked around, his
nervousness a growing thing. Then the long, pallid and savage
face whipped disconcertingly back on Pokey. "Go up this trail
three miles to the river bank. They're in that cave by the
bend."</p>

<p>"You're sellin' out Sam Torveen?" murmured Pokey. "A handsome
thing, Ferd. To sell out a man that fed and kept you. A handsome
thing."</p>

<p>"Surratt's there," said Bowie, the name emerging from his
throat in a hateful way.</p>

<p>Pokey's lips turned faintly at the corners. Little as he liked
the kid, it was always his way to keep an open mind toward the
sins and errors of men, to be slow in condemning them. But there
was with him, as with all the riders in this Western country, an
implicit adherence to one range commandment, the betrayal of
which put a man past mercy or charity. Torveen had rested his
faith in this kid, and now Ferd Bowie was betraying him. He said,
with a softness that should have warned Bowie beyond a doubt:
"Ferd, I'd hate to stand in your shoes at judgment seat."</p>

<p>Bowie bent forward in his saddle and stared across the
interval with a consuming attention. "It comes to me, Pokey,
you're Martin Head's man but no friend of Bill Head. Maybe I
should have thought of that. Never mind. I'll find somebody
who'll take my word to Bill."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pokey. "Sure."</p>

<p>Silence came on in a tight, brittle way. Bowie wanted to get
off the trail, but motion had become in the last ten seconds a
risky thing. He was no fool and he saw how still Pokey remained
and how wickedly calm Pokey's cheeks were. He pulled back on his
reins and the pony stepped to the rear until it struck a clump of
brush. Not daring to look about him to find a quick way of
getting away from this spot, his nerves began to break. "Pokey,"
he called out angrily, "go on."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Pokey and wheeled his horse.</p>

<p>As he turned, his arm fell and rose with his gun and he put
three bullets, one upon another, into that narrow swaying body
down the trail without compunction and without pity. His third
shot caught Bowie as the latter made one vain, agony-driven
effort to lift his gun. It was half risen when he died suddenly
in the saddle, and fell out of it to the ground.</p>

<p>Pokey studied the lumpy shape of the kid a moment, hearing the
echoes of this shooting roll and break and fade in the far
corridors of the hills. He replaced the empty shells in his
weapon with full loads and seated it in its holster; and trotted
on toward the pass road.</p>

<p>When he came out upon the road he saw Bill Head and Hank
Peyrolles standing close by, surrounded by a waiting group of
riders. The crews of Head and Peyrolles and Cameron men were all
mixed up here. Kersom and Kersom's hands seemed to be off on
another scout.</p>

<p>"What was that shootin'?" demanded Head.</p>

<p>"Seemed like it was off yonder," remarked Pokey and vaguely
smoothed his arm against the low, flashing sunlight.</p>

<p>"Where you been?"</p>

<p>"Just lookin'."</p>

<p>"See anything?"</p>

<p>"No," said Pokey. "Not a thing."</p>

<p>Bill Head's eyes considered Pokey without faith. Riders began
to come out of the timber and collect here, brought back from
their searching by the sound of the gunfire.</p>

<p>"I'll be going," suggested Pokey, turning his horse.</p>

<p>Bill Head stopped that with the bluntest possible command.
"You stay here. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned as though struck, his glance rising to the heights
of the timber-clad ridge rising up on the road's south side. All
the horses were pitching, and this group began to boil and run
for the brush. Out of that high timber some man's long-range
bullets began to arrive with a steady "spang," slanting into the
road. They ripped up cloudy banners of dust; they made little
dimpled whorls of dust When they struck straight they had flat,
snapping echoes; when they richocheted they whipped up a weird
whining. This lead was landing above the riders, reaching no
target; it kept hitting that same general spot, coming no closer.
Pokey noticed that before he broke for shelter; noticed and
considered it. All the riders were rushing into the thicket and
Bill Head's voice started to crack around him like a whip. "Come
over here! Get off that road!" The firing kept on, with the
spaced regularity of a hammer driving down a nail. But it lifted
from road to brush, the slugs spitting through leaf and cutting
across tree bark. One horse let out a quick grunt and fell,
throwing a Crow Track man forward on his face.</p>

<p>Peyrolles, by nature excitable, kept ducking and throwing up
his hands. "By God, it's them! It's them, Bill! We got our cats
up a tree!"</p>

<p>Head growled: "Shut up." He listened to the gunfire, his
florid skin redder than it had been. A bullet left its breath on
him in passing by; he moved without haste to the nearest tree and
leaned behind it a moment, to continue his visual search of the
heights of the ridge. He couldn't see well from his position, so
he walked to the edge of the road and squatted down and thinly
parted the thick sheaves of a hazel bush. He gestured at
Peyrolles, who crawled cautiously over. "Watch," said Head.
"You'll see smoke curling."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Bill Head walked back to his tree. He was of a sudden pleased
and eager. "He can't cross this road without bein' seen. He can't
run over to the river without bein' seen. Take your boys around
that ridge and cut him off on that side."</p>

<p>"Him?"</p>

<p>"Surratt's doin' that," said Bill Head. "Everybody come
here."</p>

<p>Pokey, aloof from this council, watched the group collect.
Bill Head laid orders urgently about him. Peyrolles took his men
and rode farther down the thicket, then went over the road at a
rush. Bill Head ran to his horse as though anxious to have his
fun. He had ten riders beside him when he broke through the brush
and raced across the road to the yonder timber. The few men left
behind moved away from Pokey toward the bridge, keeping to the
shelter. Pokey remained indifferently in his saddle. He rolled
himself a cigarette and lighted it, quietly listening to Head's
hands crush on up the slope of the ridge. There was a calling
over there. The shots of the hidden riflemen laid long, clear
bars of sound across the still air and were silent for a while.
All at once the sun dipped below the western line and its golden
flash went out of the sky and a quick, pure-blue twilight ran
through the alleys of tins broken land. Pokey kept on smoking,
plunged into his own obscure thoughts. Once he faintly smiled,
which was rare for him.</p>

<p><br> On top of the ridge, less than half a mile away, Surratt
watched Peyrolles' column enter the trail which circled the
ridge, and saw a second wave of riders afterwards cross the road
and step into the timber directly below him. He knew the meaning
of this maneuvering, but he remained awhile behind the bulwark of
a deadfall. The sun was gone, with the quick powder blue of a
timber country twilight flowing fast down these slopes. Head's
fighters were crawling up through timber and thicket, well
hidden, yet betrayed by the rattle of their progress. Now and
then a voice lifted in that direction, its echo long floating in
the soft air. The road below him was a pale-yellow streak turning
sinuously downward toward Morgantown. Almost directly below stood
the gray covered bridge crossing the river. A few hundred yards
behind him the ridge dropped away to the water, but he already
knew he could not find a footing down its stiff face. To reach
the river he had either to descend to the bridge or retrace his
path down the south side of the slope. The bridge route, he
understood, was closed to him; for he saw the occasional stir of
a man in the brush by the road, with one figure indistinctly
appearing at intervals at the corner of the bridge itself. As for
the other route&mdash;down the side of the ridge&mdash;he
realized Peyrolles was rapidly sweeping around it to cut off his
retreat.</p>

<p>That man at the corner of the bridge had raised some sort of a
target. He began sending his shots up through the dimming air,
dropping them wide of Surratt. The rattle of the climbing Head
men was more distinct. He ducked away from the log, dropped down
a small ravine and picked up his horse. In the saddle, he
continued with the ravine, passing through satin-blue shadows
spreading wider and deeper along all these secretive reaches.
Somewhere a coyote lifted its wild wail to the high arch of
infinity and something in that ancient call grimly reminded
Surratt that he too was a member of that fraternity of the lost
and the hopeless. But he had come here to stir up a steady
firing, so that all Head's exploring men might be drawn back, so
that the way would be clear for Sam Torveen's retreat. He seemed
to be achieving his purpose.</p>

<p>The ravine became impassible, and he left it and swept
leftward toward the river, still descending through the pines. In
a quarter-hour darkness was definitive with a thin pale rind of a
new moon slung low in the sky. Its faint glowing gave this
darkness a vague silver luminosity treacherous to the eye,
exaggerating distance and nearness alike. He had scarcely reached
the bottom of the ridge when he made out Peyrolles' swift
advancing.</p>

<p>The river was a slow murmur near by. He went that way, along a
minute trail, and got to the graveled margin of the water. The
far bank was a wall of shadow and the sluggishness of the river's
running at this point warned him that it was a slack pool too
deep for fording. Downstream, in the direction he meant to
retreat, he saw a vague pillar rise high against the sky; and had
a foreshadowed thought of trouble then. Leaving his horse in the
brush he walked across the gravel until that pillar stood before
his face. He laid his hand on it to discover the truth of his
situation. The toe of the ridge dropped straight into the water.
To pass it he had to swim around.</p>

<p>He stood here a little while, his mind searching fast for
other ways of escape and finding none. To turn and go up the
river's bank was to tow Head's men toward the tunnel. Otherwise
he had no way of breaking through the cordon thrown around him
except by putting away from shore, drifting down beneath the
bridge and thus past the guard placed there. He had no liking for
water and no skill with it, but this was the way it had to be.
Cinching up his gun belt, he waded into the river. He was
shoulder deep when the current lifted his feet and turned him
along the smooth face of the cliff.</p>

<p>He rolled on his back to float, but the weight of his gun
pulled him at once below the surface and instantly his fear of
water became a thorough panic. He came up with his arms slashing
enormous echoes through the night. He had been bumping along the
edge of the cliff, but now that had drawn away from him and a
quicker current threw him apparently into the center of the
channel. He had, in this downbearing blackness, one hot and
terrible moment; and then his sanity returned and he rolled with
the current, quietly stroking.</p>

<p>They had lighted a fire on the road to make a barrier he could
not pass. When he drifted below the toe of the ridge he saw a
yellow, shuttering shaft of that light reach down and play a
searchlight beam on the water's surface. Drifting toward this
bright area, he let himself sink; when he came up again he was
floating under the bridge, with the treading of some of Head's
men plain in his ears. There was a grumbling of the current
ahead, a lash of water against rocky shallows. Kicking his body
around, he swam strongly for the bank. His boots touched bottom
long after; when he finally walked out of the water he stood at
the base of a low willow bank two hundred yards below the road
and its fire.</p>

<p>He sat down and pulled off his boots and drained the water
from them; and he remained here for a matter of minutes, ashamed
of that little interval of dread he had experienced out in the
current. Somebody on the yonder ridge sent three spaced shots
across the darkness, the echoes long rolling through the hills. A
voice kept calling. He got up then and climbed the bank. Groping
through the trees, he came upon a trail and pursued it back
toward the pass road; within twenty feet of the road he dropped
to his knees. The fire was directly ahead of him, the shapes of
men crouched in the brush illumined against it.</p>

<p>He saw no horses here. Therefore he swung away, sliding
carefully from tree to tree. Near the road, seventy feet or so
below the fire and in a little cleared patch between the pines,
he found the horses. Nobody apparently guarded them, though in
this blackness he could not be sure. Bill Head's voice kept
calling along the ridge across the way&mdash;that sure bull-deep
tone heavy and recognizable. Surratt walked into the little
clearing swiftly and reached the nearest horse. He was up in the
saddle; he was turning away, the horse uncertain and unsatisfied
with its strange rider. But he hadn't moved five feet before a
shapeless shadow sprang from the earth and stood directly
underneath him. The man's voice sang out in an alarmed way:</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;who's this?"</p>

<p>Surratt hauled the horse around and struck straight into the
brush. He bent low, with his body turned and his gun lifting. He
saw the man's revolver lick a purple streak across the dark; and
then he fired at the streak and heard the sharp, astonished grunt
of that man's breath. He slashed on through the brush and reached
the road. All those hands by the fire were running straight down
the road; and Head's voice grew enormous up on the hill.</p>

<p>"What fool&mdash;!" The light of the fire reached vaguely out
toward Surratt; he was dim in it, but still to be seen&mdash;and
all the men had stopped their running. Fading on, Surratt rushed
into the thicket again and heard the lead of their shots scurry
and groan along the dust near by. He was out of that and beyond
that when he came to the road once more. He kept to it now,
racing downgrade for Morgantown. From the receding distance he
made out Bill Head's booming yell rally up the crew.</p>

<p>Pokey, situated by the fire, saw Surratt vanish. Alone of the
watchful group stationed here, he kept his place while the rest
of them laced the night with their shots. Bill Head came smashing
down the side of the ridge, howling at his men to follow. Pokey
listened to all this, his little face taciturn against the light.
Of a sudden he rose and dropped silently back to his horse. Forty
minutes later he stood in the living room of the Head ranch,
quietly reporting to Old Martin all that he had done.</p>

<p>When he had quite finished he looked away from Old Martin, for
there was something so fierce, so blazing and so strange in the
old cattleman's eyes that Pokey felt an unbearable shock.</p>

<p>"Pokey," said Old Martin, "get out the buckboard and drive me
to Morgantown."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>17. THE SUDDEN TURN</h2>

<p class="first">TWO miles of steady running took Surratt beyond
the sound of pursuit and it brought him to the edge of a vague
side road reaching out of the southern broken land. He stopped,
the racing recklessness in him settling down. He was at once raw
and cold from his water-sogged clothing, but he listened to the
rear for a few steady moments and heard nothing that indicated
Bill Head was coming down. Considering that carefully, Surratt
turned into the side road and followed it.</p>

<p>He knew little about this country and therefore had to fall
back on his riding sense. He had gone, he supposed, two or three
miles when he reached a stumpy clearing. The road simply
disappeared, but Surratt swung to the east&mdash;in which
direction the river lay&mdash;and explored the edges of the
meadow until he found a break in the trees. This he took.</p>

<p>The going was slow and there was always the hint of stray Head
riders to keep his senses honed sharp. Yet he thought he had
succeeded in pulling all those exploring men over to the main
road by his recent feint, and so he traveled with less caution.
About an hour later he broke through solid brush and came upon
the river. When he got his bearings he turned upstream, skirting
the bluff of the river until he saw the mouth of the dry channel
break through the silver-shot darkness. Here he halted and sent a
quiet challenge forward.</p>

<p>He waited a long two minutes and heard no answer. Pushing down
the bluff, he rode to the mouth of the tunnel. The smell of
woodsmoke lay thinly in the air, but he could see no reflected
glow of fire. He walked into the tunnel and turned its bend and
faced pure blackness. He said: "Torveen," the echo of his voice
striking the blank walls. He struck a match. Its glow threw a
flickering beam down upon an empty gravel floor; the charred
circle of a dead fire lay on the gravel, and beside it the
scooped-out spots where Torveen's bed had been. There wasn't
anything here.</p>

<p>He left the tunnel immediately, satisfied they had retreated
to Temple's ranch according to plan. And he turned that way with
a slow satisfaction, drifting with the descending slope and
crossing the meadow wherein, the night before, he and Judith had
seen the Head rider posted. Beyond the meadow he entered the
solid, black belt of pines. The trail was clear; he went along at
a trot.</p>

<p>Water kept rolling down his skin, the night's slow wind turned
him more and more cold, and his thoughts could find no breach in
the wall Bill Head had put around Torveen. The bitter fact was,
Torveen had been whipped. He had been driven off his ranch and
could not return to it, and all that this night's riding had done
was to give Torveen a temporary and fugitive safety. In Temple's
place he could weather through his bullet wound; but when he was
able to again ride there would be no safe road for him except the
road that led across the pass to another land. Sam Torveen had
shoved his chips to the middle of the table and made his bet. But
Bill Head had drawn the better hand, leaving Torveen a ruined
man. There was no way left to fight Bill Head, except by rousing
the two-bit ranchers who believed, as Torveen believed, in free
opportunity. But the weight of Head's riders kept them still;
they had not come to Torveen's side.</p>

<p>For himself, Surratt acknowledged, it made no great
difference. This was an episode that had neither more nor less
meaning than any other. Beyond the pass lay another land, another
day, another episode. But for Sam it meant the end of his fortune
and his hope. And then, questing through this deep, dismal reach
of pines, Surratt understood something else with an inexorable
clarity. Torveen's faith was in him and he had no alternative but
to face this trouble to the last end.</p>

<p>There was one way he had always known could be followed, which
was the way an outcast might use to ride by night, to shoot from
ambush, to raid the big outfits at weak places, to strike and
retreat and strike again, to throw this country into fear and
confusion; to make men afraid of the daylight and leave them
sleepless at night. It was a way of ruining the country. But it
was not Surratt's way. He could not play that stealthy, prowling
part. His trail had to be open and his actions plain to all men.
And, as he came through the trees and saw the dark outline of
Billy Temple's house sitting in the sloping meadow below, he
realized there was only one opening Bill Head had honestly left
him, only one opening he could honestly take.</p>

<p>He had seen this coming. Whatever the results, whatever
bearing it might have on his own fortunes or Sam Torveen's
future, he had to accept the challenge of Bill Head's personal
hatred. Bill Head had put him in the light of an outlaw and if he
ran from it the thing would follow him like his own shadow the
rest of his days. Moreover, he had in public named Bill Head
yellow and Bill Head sought him now to answer that. He could not
run from his words; he had to stand by them. It was once more the
old, old pattern that never changed. There was a pride in men
that terribly ruled them. Just or unjust, it governed them and
gave to their lives a dignity they had to have.</p>

<p>He came softly across the meadow, sending his call against the
lightless house. "Torveen." He waited there, feeling at once the
emptiness of the place and not understanding it. A dog rushed
forward from the house, snarling dismally at him. He called
again, "Torveen," and rode on to the porch. He got down here,
with the dog circling his feet. Crossing the porch, he stood by a
closed door and tapped it and had no answer. He opened the door
and saw a vague white square of paper sway loosely on the panel.
When he called Torveen's name again, his voice ran dismally
through the house; he knew definitely then that this place was
deserted. He reached over and pulled the paper from the door and
stepped inside to light a match. One word alone had been written
on the paper: "Morgantown."</p>

<p>Whether it was for him or somebody else he didn't know. He
whipped out the match and stood there, puzzled and thoughtful.
There was warmth in this room that signified recent use; and a
faint eye of light crept through a corner stove. He turned back
to the porch and sat down to remove and drain his boots again.
The dog crouched in the near-by dust, gutturally displeased.
Surratt rose and went to the floor, to dig out of the panel the
tack which had held the paper; he refixed the paper on the panel.
Afterwards he went to his horse, swung up and left the yard. He
was thinking now of Torveen, who had been in bad shape; maybe
Brann had taken him to Morgantown as a last resort. At least he
could think of no other meaning the single word might convey, and
so he swept down the plain road toward town.</p>

<p>He went at a slow canter, feeling the weariness of his horse;
and it occurred to him then that he was weary too, in a way that
sleep could not help. The wind roved the pine tops, lifting up a
steady, abrasive sound. It was, he judged, near eleven o'clock;
and strangely his thoughts turned to Judith Cameron and her face
was clear to him in the darkness, and the memory of her voice
laid a soft and stirring and sad music in his mind. It was still
with him, that melody, when he came out of the timber and found
the lights of Morgantown below him.</p>

<p>All trouble, he recalled, struck at Morgantown from these
hills&mdash;which would be therefore the quarter men watched. So
he cut across the pass road, circled behind the buildings and
came out at the lower end of the street Paused, he scanned the
street carefully.</p>

<p>But it .was silent and almost empty. People were not
sleeping&mdash;that he knew from the lights shining angularly out
of shop and second-story windows. They were awake and waiting for
the result of that quarreling up in the hills. This was
Morgantown, a cockpit of cattle wars. Of the merchants and
hangers-on here he had no fear, for they were like merchants the
world over, keeping their opinions hidden from the partisans who
rode so recklessly back and forth. It was Head's men he visually
sought; and he saw none. A figure came through the saloon doors
and turned upward along the board walk, passing the bank. Two men
sat quietly on the porch of the White House. Somebody somewhere
plunked casually at a guitar, and water spilled liquidly into a
near-by drinking trough and made pleasant echoes. The smell of
dust was in the slow wind. The door of the dressmaking shop stood
open, a full lamplight streaming out.</p>

<p>He rode up the street, in the center of the street, and came
abreast of the light and turned to catch the view of Annette
Carvel standing inside. He was about to stop there when a voice
came casually to him from the porch: "Surratt."</p>

<p>He rode over; and wet and hungry as he was his nerves began to
whip up coolness and a restlessness. Old Martin Head sat there,
blanketed in the dark, with Tom Bolderbuck beside him. It was
Bolderbuck who had spoken, for he spoke again, the tip of his
cigar throwing a faint glow back upon the solid, enigmatic
surface of his face. "Why?" said Bolderbuck.</p>

<p>"Torveen here?" said Surratt</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Old Martin Head's big torso tipped away from the chair. His
head bent forward and Surratt felt all the tremendous power of
that man's eyes strike against him, searching for weakness,
searching for truth, searching for something. The saloon doors
squealed behind Surratt. He threw a quick glance over there, to
see Pokey coming across the dust. But Pokey recognized him and
the shock of that threw the little man back on his heels, as
though he had checked himself on the edge of some sharp drop. He
remained thus frozen for a moment, letting Surratt's aroused
attention have its way. Afterwards he drawled mildly: "That's all
right," and walked a wide circle around Surratt and got to the
hotel porch. He sat down, spreading his arms along his legs, so
there could be no mistake about his intent.</p>

<p>"Surratt," said Bolderbuck evenly, "you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Old Martin Head interrupted with a curt, over-riding grunt.
"Be quiet, Tom!"</p>

<p>Surratt flashed a long, careful look around him, rummaging all
the shadows of doorway and alley. He was straight in the saddle
and his shoulders were faintly swaying. This was a situation that
keened him and brought up the latent rashness that so unquietly
slept in him; and it was strange how ease came back and how
pleasant the details of life became. He was faintly eager; he was
faintly smiling. Old Martin sighed and relaxed against his chair
when he observed that smile.</p>

<p>"Anything more to say, Tom?" suggested Surratt.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Surratt wheeled, crossing to the dressmaking shop. He got out
of the saddle; he stood there by the horse a little while,
depending on his questing senses to bring him such rumors of
trouble as might be hidden in this sleepy town. But he had no
warning. The stillness was an undisturbed stillness. He went on
into the shop.</p>

<p>Annette Carvel had her back to the door. She heard him come
and she turned, and all at once her face&mdash;so responsive to
her moods&mdash;registered inexpressibly the swing of her
emotions. The light of pleasure and relief was there and the way
of her heart was there for him to see; but that was only for a
moment. It fled before a strange, startled fear. She said,
throwing the words out with an expelled breath: "You shouldn't be
here!"</p>

<p>"Annette," said a woman's voice. Turning, Buck discovered Mrs.
Carvel in the doorway of another room.</p>

<p>"No, you shouldn't!" repeated Annette, almost in a cry.</p>

<p>"Who's in town?" asked Surratt quickly.</p>

<p>"Old Martin."</p>

<p>"Anybody else?"</p>

<p>"No," she murmured. "But they'll be back."</p>

<p>"Torveen&mdash;Brann? Miss Cameron? They're not here?"</p>

<p>"No. Where are they?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, listening to the fall of a horse's hoofs in
the street. The horse stopped somewhere above the shop. There was
no other sound just then. He had something in his mind and didn't
know how best to say it, though he understood he had it to say.
He looked at Mrs. Carvel; he took off his hat. He said quietly:
"Nick Perrigo was killed this afternoon."</p>

<p>He was immediately to know what that news meant to her, for
her lips came together and the straightness went out of her body.
She put a hand against the door casing, lowering her head.
Annette turned her curious eyes from Surratt to her mother. She
said: "What is it?"</p>

<p>"In his fashion," reflected Surratt, "he was honest. I saw him
die, and he died regrettin' many things."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carvel rose. She looked at Surratt in a way that hurt him
and saddened him immeasurably. It was a sorry thing to stand
before this woman and watch old tragedy rise in her eyes. It was
there. But he kept thinking of Perrigo and of Perrigo's regret;
and he felt bound to represent that little man truthfully. It
turned him toward Annette. "He liked you. He said he remembered
you best as a little girl wearin' a red bow in your hair."</p>

<p>"Me?" she said, deeply puzzled. "Me."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Carvel was near to crying. She said, "Thank you," in
a muffled voice and walked back into the other room. Surratt's
attentive ears kept registering the rise and fall of talk on the
hotel porch. The run of time bothered him, and his nerves were
stretched by a strain he felt and could not identify.</p>

<p>Annette Carvel murmured: "I don't understand."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Never mind. Maybe it will help you to know
that the glove found on Les Head's bunk meant nothing. You're
loyal to your friends, Annette. It is a strong light in a dark
place. If you ever find a man you can put that loyalty on he'll
be lucky."</p>

<p>She turned slowly away from him and walked to the end of the
room. "Please, Buck," she said. "Please."</p>

<p>The sound of talk ceased, up by the hotel. There was a man
moving idly past the dressmaking shop. These little impressions
piled up and made a heavy weight on his nerves. He swung and went
out of the shop, on out to his horse. The idling man was below
him, under the porch awnings. Surratt turned to catch his foot in
a stirrup, and his glance crossed to the hotel. He let the
stirrup go and stood frozen there; he stepped away from the
horse, into the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Bolderbuck and Old Martin still remained on the hotel porch.
But a third man was standing before them now, his back swung on
Surratt. Old Martin spoke, distinct enough for Surratt to
hear:</p>

<p>"Turn around, Bill."</p>

<p>Bill Head said: "What?" but his great shoulders made a
wheeling gesture and the ruddy, florid cheeks came about He saw
Surratt. The next moment he had crossed the walk in long strides.
He came to a halt, out in the middle of Morgantown's dusty
street, facing Surratt.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>18. SO LONG!</h2>

<p class="first">THUS separated by an interval of thirty yards,
they faced each other on Morgantown's street, with the store
lamps shining softly upon them, with a fatal stillness falling
around. Part of that stillness, Surratt understood, was the
result of his senses slowly shutting out all unimportant details.
He had been through this before and the story was the same now:
everything faded except the shape of the man in front of him, and
the energy of his body collected and seemed to pour into those
few muscles he had to use. Bill Head was a magnified object down
the street, the rise and fall of his chest and the faint shift of
his shoulders magnified as well, and suddenly very important. He
vaguely saw a horseman come into town and pause by the jail, and
ride away. Around him, in the shadows of the board awnings, men's
feet scraped a little, and then ceased to scrape. The smell of
death was a thing that traveled fast. But his vision continued to
narrow and his feeling of enormous solitude increased, and
presently it was as though a black, high wall surrounded Bill
Head and himself.</p>

<p>Bill Head called: "Surratt, what are you doing here?" But it
wasn't in the tone of a question. It was the way a man would
speak when lifted to unbearable heights of temper. He was a
mauling man whose strength always had won its way. But here stood
one who had whipped him in the Carson Ford saloon and had escaped
the search of fifty riders, and the memory of that had its
stinging, maddening way with him.</p>

<p>Surratt didn't answer; for talk was a useless thing now. He
made a slim, straight shape in the mellow lamplight, with his
arms hanging straight beside his wet clothes. His shoulders were
thrown faintly forward and the weight of his body was a set,
arranged weight</p>

<p>Bill Head spoke again. "Surratt!" There was no purpose in that
talk. It was only a vehement sound. His head tipped downward but
his stare remained a fixed and calculating and wicked pressure
against Surratt; and the ruddiness of his broad bold face was
less than it had been. Surratt made no move. His purpose locked
him viselike there. But then he saw Bill Head's lips faintly stir
and stretch at the corners. It was a signal. It was a clear
signal that Surratt had seen often before in other men waiting
before him. And, seeing it, he reached for his gun and beat Head
to the draw.</p>

<p>But it wasn't his shot that first shattered the silence.</p>

<p>He was lifting his gun for a deliberate aim when Bill Head
began firing in a headlong way, throwing his lead in the same
manner he threw his fists, a hot and thoughtless desire to
destroy riding him uncontrollably. Dust sprayed up in front of
Surratt; there was the breath of a bullet on his right cheek as
it went by. These two reports were huge and thunderous in the
town, slamming against the building walls. Surratt's eyes were
pinned to that wide chest. He sent his bullet at it
coolly&mdash;and sent no more, for his faith was that certain.
Bill Head's arm stopped rising, his shoulders quit swinging; he
froze in a queer, hunched posture and his face betrayed an
unbelieving astonishment. A man somewhere in the shadows groaned
at what he saw, and then Bill Head gave way at the knees and
dropped awkwardly on his face. He was dead when he struck the
ground. His hat rolled off his head; he lay that way, his face
against the ground, his yellow hair shining with the dust.</p>

<p>For Surratt blackness rushed away and he was aware of all the
dangers surrounding him. He made a complete wheeling circle, his
gun raking all the shadows. There were townsmen crowding the
walks, their faces dim and twisted by this scene. Annette Carvel
was in the doorway of her shop, both hands clinging to the casing
and a fright stamping a death's pallor on her graphic cheeks.
Surratt threw his attention over to the White House porch. Pokey
was on his feet, motionless. Bolderbuck had retreated to the
hotel wall, where he remained in formidable quietness. Old
Martin, in his chair, made no motion whatever.</p>

<p>Surratt walked that way and stood before the porch steps. Old
Martin's eyes were hard to meet then, so bitter and blazing was
the spirit rushing out of them. It was plain to Surratt at the
moment that the man silently cried out for a return of his own
vigor, so that he might answer for his boy dead in the dust. But
he fsat there, gripping the arms of the chair, locked in a
tumultuous hell&mdash;a fighter who could not light and
destroying himself from the thought.</p>

<p>Surratt shook his head. "It will do no good to say that I'm
sorry. I came to this country without malice. I took the side of
a man who befriended me. This is the end of that business, as is
always the end. I cannot regret it now. Maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sound up the street wheeled him around at once, and he
discovered a column of horsemen entering the town. There was
something lashed between the two leading horses, and after that
he identified George Bernay and Blackjack Smith riding to either
side of the burden the horses carried. It was a stretcher. He
knew what it carried then, but he held his place. Doc Brann broke
from the column and came on. He stopped before Bill Head's body;
he looked at it. Afterwards his glance, turned to a grim
brightness, jerked up to Surratt. He got off his horse and knelt
down; his hand professionally touched the dead man's chest, soon
coming away.</p>

<p>The column halted before the White House and broke to see what
lay on the dusty street. George Bernay said: "Why, my
God&mdash;!"</p>

<p>It was Sam Torveen who occupied the improvised stretcher
lashed between the horses. He couldn't turn himself to see this,
and his voice lifted weakly. "What's happened?"</p>

<p>Then Judith Cameron came from the rear of this group of men
and paused to show Surratt a strange long glance, and rode
rapidly down to the dressmaking shop. Another rider galloped out
of the hills and was yelling when he struck the street. "They're
comin' in!"</p>

<p>George Bernay's words jumped out of his throat. "Get Sam into
the hotel!" He was down from his horse, unlashiug the stretcher.
Temple and Horsfall sprang out of their saddles, and the three of
them took the stretcher and carried Torveen into the hotel. Small
ruffles of steady sound broke away from the heights above
Morgantown; and the yelling messenger charged along the dust and
howled at Blackjack Smith, who sat so mountainously calm in his
saddle.</p>

<p>"They're comin' in!"</p>

<p>Surratt had his careful look at the crowd. Blackjack and
Blackjack's four men he knew. And Torveen's three particular
friends he knew. But these others were strange to him. There were
about twenty of them, all solemn and a little disturbed.
Blackjack shifted his gross cheeks toward Surratt. He said
briefly: "What you want to do?"</p>

<p>"Get down the street."</p>

<p>They heard him. They rode by and formed behind him, and he
looked around to see how quietly they arranged themselves
underneath the board awnings, and out across the street. He said
evenly: "That's all right. Don't start any shooting until they
do." For he knew who was coming; the smell of trouble was as
clear to him as the odor of the disturbed dust curling up from
the street.</p>

<p>Bernay and Billy Temple and Jud Horsfall came out of the White
House on the run. They went up to their saddles and rode over to
Surratt, turning beside him. George Bernay was a reckless man
now; whitely grinning. He said: "These are my friends. Buck.
They're also Sam Torveen's friends. Just a bunch of two-bit
ranchers like me. I been ridin' ever since last night, to find
'em. We went up to the tunnel. You'd just left." He laughed
outright. "Well&mdash;here's five horse thieves, twenty poor
white trash, and a guy with a reward on his head. It's enough to
make the angel Gabriel weep. Can we do it, Surratt?"</p>

<p>The question was suddenly high and thin. The man was game, but
he wasn't sure. Surratt said softly: "We'll see," and watched
Bill Head's men tip into Morgantown's street and ride fast
forward.</p>

<p>Peyrolles and Dutch Kersom were leading the outfit; and both
men discovered at once what faced them on the street. Peyrolles'
arm shot high, to stop that rapid riding. They had gotten as far
as the bank when they halted. Peyrolles bent in his saddle. He
yelled excitedly: "If you boys want it, you can have it!"</p>

<p>Kersom said nothing. Sheriff Ranier worked his way forward
through the riders and came abreast of Peyrolles. "Wait," he
asked. "Wait a minute."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" yelled Peyrolles.</p>

<p>But Dutch Kersom suddenly pointed at Bill Head's body lying in
the dust. It was a thing none of them had so far seen. Peyrolles
stared down and his lantern jaw closed and his teeth snapped
distinctly. Hughie Grant pushed forward, the coolest of the Head
men. He put his arms across the saddle horn and had his look at
Bill Head; nothing changed on his face. But he did something none
of the rest of them had done. He lifted his hat in a way that was
a gesture to the dead man and clapped it back on his head. His
eyes threw a narrow glance across to Buck Surratt; he was quietly
mad then. It was in his voice.</p>

<p>"You damn gunslinger, who asked you to come here?"</p>

<p>Surratt felt the high storm coming on. His men were shifting a
little behind him; they were unsure, as was George Bernay. In
front, the collected riders of the big outfits were slowly
drifting, making a line wall to wall. Hughie Grant wheeled his
horse onto the walk and wheeled again and faced Surratt at an
angle. Peyrolles and Kersom both shifted away, sliding back into
the mass of riders. Ranier rode up to the White House porch, to
get out of the firing. In that space between these two factions
was only Bill Head's prone body. The silence held on like this,
screwing tighter, turning thin and thinner, becoming unendurable.
Surratt swung his head toward the hotel porch, toward the obscure
shape of Old Martin Head there. His talk was even and sad then,
and very quiet.</p>

<p>"How many men do you want to die? This was your son's war and
he's dead and that's the end of his pride. You can make this
street a cemetery if it is your wish, but you'll settle
nothing."</p>

<p>He had no answer from Old Martin. But Peyrolles, his
excitability carrying him beyond thought, suddenly shouted: "Let
the man have it!"</p>

<p>Old Martin's voice unexpectedly growled across the street with
a strength and a taciturnity that stilled them all. "Peyrolles
and Kersom&mdash;come here. I want you. Surratt, you come
here."</p>

<p>Surratt walked across the dust. The other men were coming, but
Old Martin Head stared at Surratt, the sore pride in him burning
brightly. He said: "Push my chair into the hotel. I want
Bolderbuck and I want Ranier. Bernay, come with us."</p>

<p>They all came along, the men Old Martin had named. They
followed through the doorway. Surratt turned the wheel chair
around; he stood near Old Martin, and he looked down at the man
and saw the fire die out. Old Martin was speaking in a lost,
defeated manner.</p>

<p>"I had three sons. One of them died for the South, a long time
ago, and his memory is still fresh to me. It is all I have to
remember, for my other boys were no good. They're gone and I'm a
pretty old man and loneliness is a terrible thing. I've lived
beyond my time. If I was a younger man, Surratt, I'd fight you
for the joy of it&mdash;because fightin' was life to me, as
fightin' is life to you now, though you do not recognize that
thing in yourself. Few men do."</p>

<p>Peyrolles said angrily: "There's the man that killed your son,
Martin."</p>

<p>"My son," said Old Martin quietly, "set the tune and he had to
face the music out. The draw was even and Surratt stood his
ground, as he had to do. I'd despised him if he hadn't. This is
the way men have to act when the time for talkin' is all over. It
is hard, but it is just. Now, Hank, we are going to make a
decision here that will stand in my lifetime and yours. After
that it does not matter. This is a young man's world and neither
you nor me has a right to fence in all the water holes. So this
is the way it is to be. Draw a line from Gray Bull peaks to the
Cameron ridge. North of that line stays cattle; it stays cattle
because we live over there and Dutch and Ab lives over
there&mdash;and cattle is our life. South of that line sheep may
come, and the young men may have their day. The fight is
over."</p>

<p>Peyrolles' long jaws made a wicked, stubborn slant "Not for
me, Martin."</p>

<p>Old Martin rolled his shoulders. "I'm drawing my men out of
this. Ab Cameron never wanted any of it. So where do you stand
with your crew of ten and where does Dutch stand with his crew of
nine? Surratt, you take those boys George Bernay brought you and
ride over to Hank's house and burn it down. How'd you like that,
Hank? The Head outfit will help you no more."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," muttered Peyrolles dismally.</p>

<p>"Go out and tell everybody to go home," growled Old
Martin.</p>

<p>Peyrolles turned his eyes toward Dutch Kersom, but Kersom was
a studying shape in the background. He met Peyrolles' glance and
merely lifted his shoulders. It angered Peyrolles immeasurably.
He said: "Why don't you speak&mdash;you've got a tongue."</p>

<p>"I guess," said Kersom laconically, "we mind Martin."</p>

<p>Peyrolles ground his reluctant surrender between his teeth,
"Let it be so," and shot his undimmed hostility at Surratt. "Stay
on your side of that line," he added. He turned on his heels and
walked out to the porch. All quiet in the room, they heard him
speak irritably to the crews.</p>

<p>Old Martin looked about him to find Pokey quietly posted in a
corner. "Get the buckboard. I'm going home."</p>

<p>Surratt's talk was soft, it was sad. "For all that's happened
to you, for my part in it, I give you my regrets."</p>

<p>Old Martin shrugged his shoulders. "Things happen. It's the
best any man can say. I should like to've had you for a son.
Pokey&mdash;get me out of here."</p>

<p>Surratt swung and went across the lobby, George Bernay with
him. They passed down a hall and stopped at a doorway. But
Surratt didn't go in, for he saw Sam Torveen lying sound asleep
on the bed, his arms flung out with the looseness of deep
exhaustion. It made Surratt smile quietly to see that. "It was a
chance&mdash;and it's all right now," he murmured. He went to the
porch with George Bernay. Men were lifting Old Martin into a
rig.</p>

<p>Bernay said: "So what now?"</p>

<p>Doc Brann came over the street. He stopped beside Surratt. "Go
up to my office and pile into the bed there. You look like
hell."</p>

<p>"For a fact," agreed Surratt. Weariness was like lead on his
shoulders and he hadn't answered Bernay's question. He turned on
the man, the smile remote and inscrutable. "Never be curious
about tomorrow, George. It's bad enough when it comes." He left
Bernay and crossed to the bank building. All the outfits were
leaving Morgantown slowly; and Bill Head had been taken from the
street, the spot where he had fallen ringed around by a group of
curious men who eyed Surratt as he passed by. Before he turned up
the bank stairway he saw Judith Cameron come from the dressmaking
shop and meet Ab, who appeared on this street for the first time
since the shooting. He went on up to Brann's room. There was a
bottle of whisky sitting on the table, thoughtfully placed there.
He helped himself, lifting the bottle to the corner of the room
in a kind of salute to some thought in his mind; and had a long
drink. Afterwards he peeled off his wet clothes and rolled up on
the bed. He was thinking, as he fell asleep, of the trail he
would be taking the next morning over the Gray Bull pass.</p>

<p>z</p>

<p>When he awoke he found Doc Brann sitting indolently in the
room, obviously getting the full savor out of a morning cigar.
Brann chuckled faintly and pointed at Surratt's clothes. "I dried
'em out. You'll find a razor and soap in the corner. Man, you
been dead to the world." He fell silent then, but his eyes kept
studying the tough, flat planes of Surratt's body and a long
while afterward he added in a puzzled way: "I do not know where
your power comes from. You're a deceptive man, Buck. The dynamite
don't show."</p>

<p>Surratt shaved and made a smoke; and turned to look out of the
window with an exploring glance. It was clear to Brann at the
moment that Surratt's thoughts were gone from the room. Surratt
put his hands into his pocket and rattled up some loose change.
He said: "How's Sam?"</p>

<p>"All right," murmured Brann. "What you going to do now?"</p>

<p>But he knew the answer. Surratt had the way of a man who was
finished with a chore. He stood before the window, uncertain and
obviously restless&mdash;not knowing where to put the
accumulating energy of his body. Brann read the regret in that
smoky glance, and because he was a shrewd man he read something
else as well. There was a quality in Surratt that Surratt himself
never recognized&mdash;a flame that burned steady and clear and
would not permit him to be satisfied with the ordinary rewards of
life or the ordinary activities of men. Surratt thought he hated
fighting. But this was self-delusion. For there was a hunger in
him for some kind of attainment, for some kind of perfection, for
some kind of final victory. It was like the dream of the
prospector who sought the Mother Lode. And it put a terrific
unrest in Surratt and would never let him be still; it made him
fight, it took him into strange countries eagerly, it laid
laughter on his face when trouble piled up and the end of all his
searching seemed just beyond that trouble, and it brought out
that deep wistfulness when, at last seeing no victory here, he
rode on to another country. This, thought Brann, was the riddle
of Buck Surratt. It made Brann quietly shake his head. He
repeated his question: "What you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"I'm bound over the pass this morning," murmured Surratt. He
looked around at Brann, faintly apologetic, faintly smiling. "The
morning half of the trail is always pleasin' to the eye. A man
can hope."</p>

<p>"One of the boys brought your horse down from the river," said
Brann gruffly. "It's at the stable."</p>

<p>Somebody came up the stairs; and presently Pokey entered
Brann's office. He nodded diffidently at Surratt. "Old Martin,"
he said, "would like to see you before you go. He's at the
ranch."</p>

<p>"How," demanded Surratt with some wonder, "does he know I'm
leaving?"</p>

<p>It made Brann shake his head again and say something that
Surratt didn't understand. "Because," he remarked gently, "he
knows you&mdash;like I know you."</p>

<p>"Pokey," said Surratt, "tell Old Martin I regret whatever hurt
I've caused him. Tell him he's the sort of a man I'd like to ride
for. And tell him so long for me." He turned suddenly from the
room and went down to the street. He walked up to the stable and
found a hand there. "Do me a favor," he asked the man. "Saddle up
for me. I'll be soon back."</p>

<p>Fresh, long sunlight came out of the east. The morning was
still cool and the rising, pine-banked slopes were a dark,
summer's green. Dust and pine resin and the scent of leather and
horseflesh&mdash;this made a keen blend to his nostrils. The
world was fresh; and the restlessness, the undimmed hunger in him
was livelier and more urgent than it had been. He crossed the
yellow street, wherein Morgantown's people moved casually, and
went into the hotel for his breakfast. There had been hell on
that street the night before; but today it was a forgotten thing,
which was the way life moved. The great moments and the brutal
moments were like fire flares against a night sky. But then the
flares died and the even run of plain things and plain hours came
on. After he had finished breakfast he loitered, contrary to his
custom, at the table a little while. He had a hard chore to do,
and hated it</p>

<p>But presently he got up and crossed the lobby to Torveen's
room. The door was open and Judith Cameron and George Bernay
stood inside. The talk quit instantly when he appeared there; it
quit instantly and brought up his slow smile. "Talk of the devil
and he's bound to come."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Torveen gruffly. There was a little color in his
face. They had propped him up in the bed a few inches. Judith
wheeled to a corner of the room, behind Surratt. She remained
there, the sense of her presence very powerful to him. But he
kept his glance on this strange Sam Torveen who looked irritably,
cheerlessly back.</p>

<p>"Well," said Surratt.</p>

<p>"Sure," growled Torveen. "I know. You've had your fun and now
you've rolled your blankets and in a minute you're long
gone."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Surratt quietly. "I always was a fiddle-footed
man." His grin turned strong and brilliant across the bronzed
outline of his face. It destroyed the gentle gravity; it hid what
his eyes might otherwise have said. "Put this down in the book,
Sam. You're the first redheaded sheepherder I ever knew."</p>

<p>"What'll I do for thankin' you?" muttered Torveen. And then
George Bernay suddenly left the room.</p>

<p>"Never mind it, kid," suggested Surratt. "We've had our
fun&mdash;which is enough."</p>

<p>Torveen showed a little curiosity. "One thing has puzzled me.
This Blackjack Smith. Where did you know him before?"</p>

<p>"In my country, across the desert," smiled Surratt. "He was a
rustler. We had our own private war&mdash;and then he left, and
came here." He watched Torveen a moment. "Speaking of that, kid,
what were you doin' down in Carson Ford that afternoon?"</p>

<p>"You were there?"</p>

<p>"In the back room, talkin' to Blackjack till you arrived."</p>

<p>"I wanted help from the man," explained Torveen. "I was in a
frame of mind to dicker with even a rustler for a little help.
But he didn't commit himself."</p>

<p>Surratt grinned. "He's in a jack pot now. He won't rustle off
a friend, and he's made a lot of friends in this ruckus."</p>

<p>Judith said, behind him: "Buck."</p>

<p>It turned him around and it erased his grin. Looking at her
now, he had no laughter in him. "Buck," she said carefully, "the
glove was an accident. I'm telling you this because you never
asked. It was a glove I long ago lost. Les always kept it in his
pocket. You found it on him?"</p>

<p>"On the floor."</p>

<p>"It would be like him," she murmured. "He hated Bill and he
knew Bill wanted me. I think he took the glove out of his pocket
before he died and put it on the floor, where it would be seen.
It was his manner of torturing his brother, of trying to make
Bill believe he had a way with me Bill didn't have. That was
Leslie always. I don't think he ever stopped to consider how that
would hurt me. It was Bill he wanted to stab once more, as he had
been doing all his life."</p>

<p>"I have never doubted you," said Surratt very quietly; and
turned to Torveen. "Well, I wish you luck. The both of you. It
has been my fortune to have good friends. I can say no more."</p>

<p>Torveen let out a long, ragged breath. He turned his eyes from
Surratt to Judith in the background. When they came back to
Surratt again they were full of shadow. His lips pressed thin
and, until he spoke, the quietness of the room was deep and
thick. "Some men," he said, a wonder in his voice, "were made to
ride high and handsome and leave a trail behind that never dies
out. How can a man forget you, kid?"</p>

<p>Surratt said, "So long, Sam," and swung around to leave this
room rapidly. But he stopped in the hall, for Judith had
followed. She closed the door and put her back against it, with
her arms behind her; her face lifted toward him, with an
expression below the strange darkness of her eyes he could not
read, could not understand. He did not try to understand, knowing
it would never help. Her presence, as always, stirred up a call
in him that could not be answered&mdash;and turned the thought of
tomorrow wholly empty. She was a treasure, he told himself, such
as he might dream of but never possess; and he realized then that
the memory of her standing so fair before him, so proud and
reliant and so rich with the grace and fire of a woman, would be
a light shining through the shadows wherever he went.</p>

<p>But he said nothing; he had his long look at her and bowed his
head quietly and went across the lobby. Hi heard Sam Torveen
calling out of the room in a strong, urgent way: "Judith, please
come in here."</p>

<p>Surratt stopped a moment on the porch. Annette Carvel was
there with George Bernay and he thought he saw something in the
girl's eyes as she looked up at Bernay that was good for both
these people. He smiled at her and took Bernay's hand, who seemed
to want to speak. Surratt shook his head and went on across the
dust to the stable. He climbed into the saddle and swung out, the
urge to be on his way powerfully impelling him. People were on
the street, and he saw Doc Brann look down from the second-story
office window. Surratt lifted his hand toward Brann, and lifted
it to the town&mdash;to all that it had meant to him&mdash;and
grinned again. He said, "So long," and rode away.</p>

<p>When he reached the trees he was no longer smiling. The
coolness was already gone from the day and he rode on through a
murmuring, drowsy forest shade. He passed the side road into
Torveen's place and remembered the events surrounding that ranch
as though they had occurred long ago. He passed the trail into
the sheep meadow and later the bridge under which he had drifted
to escape Bill Head's trap. A little of that night's excitement
came back to him&mdash;and then went away; for this was turning
already into just another episode on his back trail, with its
confusion and its excitement and its tragedy becoming even now
indistinct. He had come into the country as a stranger and for a
little while he had known its ways, and now he was a stranger
riding out.</p>

<p>Still thinking about that he reached the heights of the pass
road about ten o'clock and saw a flat plain running far off to
the east, with the glitter of sunlight all along it and a heat
haze rolling up on its far boundaries. He turned to have his last
look at the green hills and then, shrugging his shoulders like a
good gambler who had lost, he pushed onward, bound for the
distant plains. The Gray Bull peaks threw a shoulder against the
road here, and the road curved about it; and when he made the
bend he saw Judith Cameron waiting there in her saddle.</p>

<p>Surratt stopped, twenty yards away. But Judith came up and she
was smiling strangely at him, the shadows gone away from her
splendid eyes. She said, with a gentleness that was like melody:
"You are so wise, Buck. And so blind."</p>

<p>His reply was suddenly full of storm and anger. "I never knew
where your heart was, Judith, but I know Sam's feelings very
well. And I don't steal from my friends."</p>

<p>She slipped out of her saddle. She said: "Get down, Buck. Get
down." Her lips were fresh and curved and red from her thinking.
He got down and came up to her. All the desert below threw off a
burning yellow light; the road ran across it, dwindling out into
the remote distance. Judith's voice came over to him, like a
demand.</p>

<p>"You are not looking at me. You're thinking of the trail and
what lies beyond the next hill! Pull your head down and look at
me!"</p>

<p>He said slowly: "You know what I am, Judith."</p>

<p>"Better than you do. And Sam knew better than both of
us&mdash;and so he told me to follow you and find you." Her tone
dropped to a remote whispering. "I should have done it, anyway.
My dear, what are you looking for that makes you so restless, so
sad?"</p>

<p>He was like a gambler, so stoically trained to bad fortune
that he could not trust his change of luck. He reached out and
took hold of her shoulders, full of doubt, darkly uncertain. "It
is a hope," he said quietly, "I never permitted myself to have,
Judith."</p>

<p>She said: "Why am I here then?"</p>

<p>He reached down and kissed her. The richness and fullness of
that experience altogether unsettled him and set him back on his
heels. Her smile was soft and shining and at once he saw that all
her loyalty, reserved for some one man alone, came out of her
gray eyes to him as a proud gift. It was a thing that entered him
and quenched his hungers and made him suddenly understand what
his long searching had been for. He knew then that was, for him,
the end of the trail.</p>
