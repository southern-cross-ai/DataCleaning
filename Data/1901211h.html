 The Tocsin</b></h2>
<p> The boat drifted on. In the distance a ferry churned its way across the river.
 From the farther shore the myriad lights of Brooklyn flung a soft glow into
 the sky, like a canopy between the city and the night.</p>
<p> And in the boat two figures merged as one in the darkness.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Marie!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale whispered. His arms tightened about her. &ldquo;Marie!&rdquo;</p>
<p> She made answer by a little pressure of her hand.</p>
<p> He looked behind him&mdash;in toward the nearer shore. Somewhere back there,
 somewhere amongst those irregular outlines that thrust out points of deeper
 darkness into the black, mirror-like surface of the water, was the old pier
 from beneath which they had escaped, and, above the pier, the shed where but
 a little while ago&mdash;or was it hours, or a lifetime ago?&mdash;Clarke,
 alias Wizard Marre, alias Hunchback Joe, had played his last card, and lost.</p>
<p> A grim smile touched Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips. Inside that shed the secret
 service men had found their quarry&mdash;dead. They were there now. In their
 hands lay the evidence that solved the murder of Jathan Lane; and in their
 hands, too, was the murderer himself&mdash;only Wizard Marre had taken the
 easier way, and was dead.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s smile softened. Inside that shed at the present moment
 there was commotion enough and light enough; but he could hear nothing, and
 he could see no light. The Tocsin here and himself were too far away. Too far
 away! Yes, that was it&mdash;at last! Too far away from the old life&mdash;forever.
 The road of fear lay behind them, and she was free, free to come out into the
 sunlight again. She had said so herself in that letter he had read at the club
 only a few hours ago. Free! Life lay before them now&mdash;and love. With the
 death of Wizard Marre there could now be an end of his, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s,
 own r&ocirc;les of the Gray Seal, and Larry the Bat, and Smarlinghue, and&mdash;no,
 not hers as the Tocsin, that could never change or terminate, for she would
 always be the Tocsin to him.</p>
<p> The Tocsin! Memory came surging upon him. That night in the long ago, before
 he had ever seen her, when he had known her only as the woman who addressed
 him as &ldquo;Dear Philanthropic Crook&rdquo; in those mysterious notes of
 hers that, supplying the data on which he had acted, the data for those &ldquo;crimes,&rdquo; where
 no crime save that of rendering abortive the crimes of others had ever been,
 had made the name of the Gray Seal anathema to police and underworld alike;
 that night when, besides a note, he had also found a gold seal ring of hers,
 a dainty thing that bore a crest, a bell surmounted by a bishop&rsquo;s mitre,
 and underneath, in the scroll, a motto in French: <i>Sonnez le Tocsin!</i> It had
 seemed so apt! Ring the Tocsin! Sound the alarm! Always her notes had done
 that&mdash;calling the Gray Seal to arms that some one else might be the better
 or the happier for what she bade him do. The Tocsin! The word had seemed to
 visualise her then, and, knowing her by no other name, he had called her&mdash;the
 Tocsin.</p>
<p> She stirred a little in his arms.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What time is it, Jimmie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p> He shook his head. Time! What did time matter now? To Marie LaSalle, who
 once had lived in hourly peril of her life as Silver Mag in the days of the
 old Crime Club, and later, yes even until to-night, had again been forced to
 live under cover of some r&ocirc;le which she had never divulged to him and
 which he had never penetrated; and to him, Jimmie Dale, in whose ears need
 never sound again that slogan of the underworld, &ldquo;Death to the Gray Seal!&rdquo; that
 reached to every nook and corner of the Bad Lands&mdash;to her and to him what
 did time count for now, save as a great, illimitable mine of happiness, a wealth
 beyond all telling that they were to spend <i>together!</i></p>
<p> She spoke again:</p>
<p> &ldquo;What time is it, Jimmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p> And now he answered her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said happily. &ldquo;It was just midnight
 when the shed back there was raided. Since then there hasn&rsquo;t been any
 such thing as time, Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p> From somewhere across the water, faintly, a tower clock struck the hour.</p>
<p> &ldquo;One o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as though in dismay. &ldquo;We
 must be getting ashore. I&mdash;I did not think it was so late. And please,
 Jimmie, I&rsquo;d like to row the boat. I&mdash;I feel quite&mdash;quite cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He felt her shiver a little in his arms.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Cold!&rdquo; he echoed anxiously; and then, as he released her: &ldquo;All
 right, if you really want to. It isn&rsquo;t very far. And I guess it&rsquo;s
 safe now. Pull in and skirt along the shore until we can find some good place
 to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She nodded as she picked up the oars, then turned the boat&rsquo;s head in
 toward the shore and began to row.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved back into the stern of the boat and settled himself in
 his seat. He watched her, drinking in the lithe, graceful swing of her body,
 the rhythmic stroke of the heavy oars. He could not see her face for the night
 shadows hid it, but he could see the poise of her head and the contour of the
 full, perfect throat. And he clasped his hand behind his head, and a great
 happiness and a great peace fell upon him.</p>
<p> It seemed somehow as though the voyage of this little boat in which they
 had fled out here into the night for safety epitomised a voyage of great immensity
 that had begun in the very long ago, a voyage of interminable night through
 which his eyes had been straining and his soul had been yearning for a glimpse
 of the beacon light that should signal the approach to a wondrous Port of Dawn.
 And now the voyage was almost at an end. Marie there at the oars, and the peace
 and quiet around them, was the beacon light at last; and they could no more
 lose their way because the way was charted now to that Port of Dawn where there
 was no more any strife and peril and sordid crime, and where only love was.</p>
<p> He smiled at his fancy, and suddenly laughed out into the night.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Keep in a little to the right, Marie,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
 something that looks like a low wharf ahead that ought to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes; I see it,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale sat abruptly upright in his seat. Perhaps it was only the rasp
 and creak of the oars in the rowlocks, but it had sounded so <i>human</i>&mdash;like
 a short, quick, suppressed sob. He leaned forward.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Was that you, Marie?&rdquo; he asked quickly. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p> He could not see her face. Her voice came back to him steady and untroubled:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Nothing, Jimmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Across the night, far up above them and in the distance, a great bridge stretched
 from shore to shore, its arc of sparkling lights like a tiara crowning the
 brow of the heavens. Faintly there came the roar of traffic, ever restless,
 ever sleepless. A trolley clanged its way unseen somewhere near the shore which
 the boat was now rapidly approaching; and here, where the lights showed but
 sparsely, many buildings, small and large, loomed out in queer, grotesque and
 fanciful shapes.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s dark eyes lighted. All this was as it always was and
 always had been&mdash;only it was <i>changed</i>. It held a promise now that it had
 never held before. He felt his pulse beat quicken.</p>
<p> The Port of Dawn!</p>
<p> &ldquo;Here we are, Marie!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p> The bow of the boat touched the edge of a low wharf&mdash;and then Jimmie
 Dale, like a man stunned, bewildered, his mind and brain in turmoil and riot,
 was standing up in the stern of the boat. Quick, like a flash, the Tocsin had
 lifted the oars from the rowlocks, flung them away in the water, and, springing
 to the string-piece of the wharf, had pushed the boat out again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jimmie! Oh, Jimmie!&rdquo; Her voice reached him in a low, broken
 sob. &ldquo;There was no other way. It&rsquo;s in your pocket, Jimmie. I put
 it there when&mdash;when you were&mdash;were holding me.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Marie!&rdquo; he cried out wildly. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, what
 are you doing, Marie!&rdquo; He flung himself upon his knees and began to paddle
 furiously with his hands. &ldquo;Marie!&rdquo; he cried again.</p>
<p> A shadow flitted swiftly along the wharf shorewards; it grew filmy and mingled
 with a thousand other shadows&mdash;and was lost.</p>
<p> She was gone! The Tocsin was gone&mdash;as she had gone so many times before.
 He paddled on with his hands, but the act was purely mechanical. Gone! A cold
 chill was at his heart; an agony of fear seized upon him. Gone&mdash;when life
 in all its fulness....Gone! Why? An abyss seemed to yawn before him.</p>
<p> After a time the boat bumped against the wharf. He sprang out and ran madly
 to the shore. He found himself groping like a blind man amongst buildings,
 in alleys, along dimly lighted streets. And then suddenly he stood still with
 the consciousness of stark futility upon him. Had he learned no lesson from
 the past? It was useless to search for her. He might have known that from the
 first! He <i>had</i> known it, only&mdash;only things had seemed so <i>changed</i> to-night.</p>
<p> Fear took its toll of him again. It brought the sweat beads out upon his
 forehead. <i>Fear for her</i>. Subconsciously he realised now that something, somewhere,
 had, after all, gone wrong to-night; that she was still in danger, a danger
 that she still meant he should not share. No other reason save that brave,
 unselfish love of hers would have prompted her to this.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in your pocket, Jimmie.&rdquo; Her words came back to
 him.</p>
<p> He searched quickly, and with a sharp little cry of pain drew out a sealed
 envelope. Under a street lamp in a deserted street, he tore it open. Words
 that he had never thought to see again danced unsteadily before his eyes.</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;Dear Philanthropic Crook&mdash;since you <i>must</i> be that again,&rdquo; he
 read. &ldquo;I do not know under what circumstances you will receive this.
 I only know that before the night is over I shall be with you, and we will
 be together&mdash;for a little while. And, Jimmie, I am writing this instead
 of telling you what I must say, because I am afraid of myself and our love,
 afraid that I would not be strong enough to hold out against the plea of our
 hearts that at all costs we should remain together, and against your arguments,
 and perhaps against your physical restraint&mdash;for you <i>are</i> masterful, Jimmie.
 I cannot bring you any more into the shadows in which I know now I must live
 again. I must not, Jimmie; for it might only too well mean your certain destruction,
 the certain revelation to both the police and the underworld that the Gray
 Seal and Larry the Bat and Smarlinghue are none other than Jimmie Dale, the
 Riverside Drive millionaire and clubman. You see, I am writing without reserve,
 putting upon paper what has never been put upon paper before, because I know
 that in some way I shall personally place this letter in your possession, and
 that no other hands shall touch it and no other eyes shall see it save yours
 and mine.</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;I am writing this half an hour before midnight, while I am waiting
 for midnight to come with its disclosure at the old junk-shop on the East River
 that Hunchback Joe is Wizard Marre&mdash;and Clarke. And only a day or so ago,
 Jimmie, I wrote you another letter telling you that once Clarke was in the
 hands of the police I would be safe for always. And Clarke <i>will</i> be caught to-night,
 and you will believe that a new world stretches before us, and that all our
 hopes and aspirations are to come true at last, and you will be happier perhaps
 in that moment than you have ever been before. Oh, Jimmie, it is so hard even
 to <i>write</i> this, for I love you so; but it is because I do love you with all
 my heart and soul and life that I will not, shall not, must not let a breath
 of suspicion exist that there is anything between Marie LaSalle and Jimmie
 Dale. God keep and guard you! I shall pray always and always for that. And
 some day, some time perhaps&mdash;no, not perhaps, but surely, surely....</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;Jimmie, I did not mean to write like this. Listen! You know, through
 the letter to which I referred above, why during all these past months I have &lsquo;disappeared.&rsquo; You
 know that I was the <i>only</i> one who could identify Clarke as one of the leaders
 of the old Crime Club, and that it was a question of my life or his. You know
 that he went into hiding, and that there followed attempt after attempt upon
 my life. And then I &lsquo;left the city for an extended trip,&rsquo; as my
 bankers informed you. And while you sought to find me, which, for the same
 reasons that still exist to-night, I could not let you do, I fought Clarke
 under cover with his own weapons. A few days ago I believed I had won; it seemed
 only a question of hours. I had placed Clarke in his true person as Marre,
 the shyster lawyer, and in his other alias as Hunchback Joe. And then suddenly,
 as though he had never existed, I lost him.</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;You now know why. He and some of his band were at work under the bank
 making that opening into the president&rsquo;s private office that resulted
 this afternoon in the murder of Jathan Lane. I was too late to prevent that,
 but almost immediately afterwards I picked up Clarke&rsquo;s trail again. I
 found out that in some way, to cover their own tracks, to end all investigation,
 false evidence was somehow to be planted, and that to bear this out another
 murder was to be added to that of the bank president. Jimmie, what could I
 do? I could not stand passively aside, even when by so doing my own victory
 was assured. I had to go on. It was to save a man&rsquo;s life. There was a
 way to get the information necessary to forestall them, though it involved
 a risk that I would otherwise never have taken. In a measure I succeeded; I
 learned how the papers and money, and the black-jack with which the murder
 was committed, were to be placed in Klanner&rsquo;s, the bank janitor&rsquo;s,
 trunk in his boarding house, and that the man was to be lured into Baldy Jack&rsquo;s
 dance hall, where, in a riot staged for the occasion, their victim, apparently
 an innocent bystander, but with his reputation further blasted by being found
 in that unsavory resort, was to be shot. A dead man could refute no false evidence!
 I managed to get word to you, and, thank God, in time. But <i>I</i> was caught&mdash;and
 in my own character of Marie LaSalle. I was carried to one of Clarke&rsquo;s
 lairs, and left there a prisoner. They meant to finish me when the rest of
 the night&rsquo;s work was over.</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;But I must hurry on, Jimmie. It is getting late.</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;As I shall have been with you for a little while before you will have
 read this, you will know of course that I escaped. I have no time now to tell
 you how. The details do not matter. What matters is this: That while, before,
 Clarke was the only one who had any concern in putting me out of the way, and
 that for his own personal safety, that enmity is now transferred to an even
 more formidable enemy&mdash;those, and particularly one, who during the last
 year have been associated with Clarke. They will be actuated by two motives.
 First, revenge for the trap that will place Clarke in the hands of the police
 for the murder of Jathan Lane, and revenge for my interference in their attempt
 upon Klanner; and, second, the fear&mdash;a much more potent motive&mdash;that
 I know far more about them and who they are than I really do, the fear that
 I am in possession of all the knowledge needed to place them too behind the
 bars of the death house in Sing Sing. I do not know them, Jimmie&mdash;except
 one man, and that man I am not sure of at all. He is a bigger, brainier, far
 more crafty man than ever Clarke was, and far more powerful. There are times
 when I think I know him, and times when I am equally sure that I do not. I
 have come to call him the Phantom. If I am right, he has a score of aliases,
 a score of domiciles, and possesses the facility of appearing convincingly
 in each one of a bewildering number of different characters. I said that they
 had caught me in my own person. I do not need to tell you now, Jimmie, that
 if I were to go back to New York and resume my life as Marie LaSalle it would
 but be going to certain death.</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;Just one thing more. I do not believe that the bank&rsquo;s papers,
 valuable as they were, that they took from Jathan Lane in his office, were
 the sole motive for his murder; indeed, I am not sure that they were the <i>real</i> motive. I do not know, of course. But I overheard snatches of something about
 a safe at Jathan Lane&rsquo;s house to-night at two o&rsquo;clock, something
 that was to have its fulfilment later in a rendezvous at half-past three with
 an old acquaintance of yours, one Gentleman Laroque. I may be quite wrong;
 it may be that, even if I am right, my escape and Clarke&rsquo;s capture would
 effectually put a stop to anything further they might have schemed to do; but
 if there <i>is</i> anything in it, and if they go on, there will be others at Gentleman
 Laroque&rsquo;s who are not expected&mdash;the police. I will see to that.
 And so, perhaps, Jimmie, even to-night, after all, something may happen that
 will point the way to this Phantom and those with him&mdash;and to happiness
 for us.</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;And now you must not be too anxious, Jimmie. In a measure I am safe.
 They have never penetrated the r&ocirc;le which I have been playing, and I
 do not think they ever will. And you are going to help me, too, Jimmie, whenever&mdash;oh,
 Jimmie, those old days!&mdash;whenever I can &lsquo;sound the Tocsin&rsquo; without
 allying you with me in the eyes of those upon whom Clarke&rsquo;s mantle has
 fallen.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale raised haggard eyes. The signature seemed somehow blurred. &ldquo;Marie...Marie...!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
 The Gray Seal</b></h2>
<p> For a time Jimmie Dale stood motionless under the light, then he started
 automatically on along the street. He tore the letter into small fragments
 and the fragments into tiny shreds as he went along. The world seemed a void.
 No, not that! It was more as though fate jeered at him ironically. He was exactly,
 in respect of the Tocsin and in respect of the fulfilment of his hopes and
 plans, where he had been yesterday and a thousand yesterdays ago.</p>
<p> He walked on. The tiny shreds of paper, a few at a time, fluttered from his
 fingers and were lost. Mechanically he found himself boarding a street car.
 Thereafter he sat, his strong jaw clamped and hard, staring out through the
 window.</p>
<p> Who was the Phantom?</p>
<p> Twice, at long intervals, he changed cars. Finally, far uptown, he alighted,
 and, traversing several blocks, paused in front of a large corner house in
 a most select and exclusive neighbourhood. Ostensibly, had any one been observing
 his movements, he had paused in order that, under the street lamp, he might
 consult his watch. It was a quarter of two. A smile, half grim, half whimsical,
 as though he were suddenly aroused from some deep reverie to actual physical
 reality, flickered across his lips. The house on the corner was the residence
 of Jathan Lane, the bank president, who had been murdered that afternoon.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale replaced his watch, and nonchalantly turned the corner; but the
 dark, steady eyes were alight now, sweeping the side street in every direction.
 His glance detected and held for a bare instant on the black mouth of a lane
 that showed at the rear of Jathan Lane&rsquo;s house. Jimmie Dale edged toward
 the inner side of the pavement, still walking nonchalantly. And then, gradually
 merging more and more with the shadow of the house itself, he came abreast
 of the lane&mdash;and the street was empty. A moment more, and lithe, active,
 silent as a cat in his movements, he had swung himself over a fence; still
 another moment, and lost utterly in the shadows of the porch, he was crouching
 at the basement door of the house.</p>
<p> It was Jimmie Dale, the Gray Seal again, in action now. From under his vest,
 from one of the multitudinous little upright pockets of that leather girdle
 where nestled an array of vicious blued-steel implements, a compact burglar&rsquo;s
 kit, he selected a pick-lock. From another pocket came a black silk mask. Jimmie
 Dale slipped the mask over his face, and leaned closer to the door. For perhaps
 five seconds the slim, sensitive fingers were at work, then the door opened
 noiselessly, and closed again, and was locked behind him.</p>
<p> He stood silent, motionless&mdash;listening. There was no sound. Apart from
 the staff, there should be no one in the house. The papers had overlooked few
 details in their account of the murder that afternoon. Mrs. Lane was away in
 Europe, and they had taken the body of Jathan Lane to the house of his married
 daughter. Under the mask there came again that grim flicker to Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 lips. There were only the servants then&mdash;since it was not yet <i>two o&rsquo;clock!</i></p>
<p> The round, white ray of a flashlight stabbed through the blackness, vanished,
 and blackness fell again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Stairs ahead and to the right,&rdquo; Jimmie Dale confided to himself. &ldquo;Servants&rsquo; quarters
 on top floor probably; only the cellar and storage here.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The flashlight played steadily, impudently now, pointing the way upstairs;
 and, as silent as the ray itself, Jimmie Dale followed. As he reached the head
 of the stairs he found a closed door before him. The light went out. He listened
 again; then, in the darkness, he opened the door and stepped through. Again
 he listened. Still there was no sound. The flashlight winked once inquisitively&mdash;then
 darkness again. He was standing at the rear of the hall. The basement stairs
 came up under what was evidently the main staircase.</p>
<p> And now a shadow flitted with incredible swiftness here and there; and doors
 opened, and some were closed again, and some were left open&mdash;and there
 was no sound. And presently Jimmie Dale stood again at the rear of the hall.
 He could command the open door that led to the basement stairs; and along the
 hall, where a slight rift in the blackness made by the plate glass panels was
 distinguishable, he could command the front doors.</p>
<p> He nodded in quiet satisfaction to himself. Jathan Lane&rsquo;s safe was
 in a sort of private den or office that opened off the rear of the library,
 and porti&egrave;res hung between the two rooms; each room had a door opening
 off the hall, and both doors stood open now. A clock struck somewhere in the
 house. His lips tightened. It was two o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p> Alert, tense, he listened&mdash;listened until the silence itself throbbed
 and beat at the ear drums, and palpitated, and made noises of its own.</p>
<p> There wasn&rsquo;t much chance. He knew that. After what had happened that
 night, unless under extraordinary conditions, Jathan Lane&rsquo;s safe should
 be the most inviolate piece of property to be found anywhere in New York. And
 even if any one came, the corollary of whatever held its premise in that safe
 was to be found at Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s, and the Tocsin had said that
 the police would be warned in time. Yes, he understood. She had obviously made
 no effort to render anything abortive here at the source, for the very reason
 that she hoped it would but lead to the trap she would have prepared at Gentleman
 Laroque&rsquo;s. Her attitude had been quite logical, quite plausible. So why
 was <i>he</i> here?</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s hands clenched at his sides. The answer was simple enough,
 and yet, too, in its very self seemed to hold a world of mockery and, yes,
 even futility. He was here to pick up the threads of yesterday and of those
 thousand yesterdays gone&mdash;anything&mdash;the grasping at any straw that
 might bring him into that arena where she was battling for her life, and from
 which, striving to shield him, she sought to bar him out.</p>
<p> He could not very well pick up those threads at Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s,
 if indeed there were any threads <i>to</i> pick up, for the simple reason that the
 police would be there! And so he was <i>here</i>.</p>
<p> Gentleman Laroque! His brow furrowed. Yes, he remembered Gentleman Laroque&mdash;and
 Niccolo Sonnino&mdash;and a certain night that had so nearly cost young Clarie
 Archman his life. So Gentleman Laroque was in this new combine! Gentleman Laroque
 had played the r&ocirc;le of safe-breaker that other night&mdash;but Gentleman
 Laroque had missed his calling, whether as a safe-breaker or as the gang leader
 that he was. He would have made an infinitely better confidence man, for he
 was educated, suave, and, when it suited him, polished to a degree; he possessed
 all the requisites, and, in abundance, the prime requisite of all&mdash;a cunning
 that was the cunning of a fox. Also he, Jimmie Dale, remembered something else
 about Gentleman Laroque; he remembered Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s last words
 to the Gray Seal on that night in question, and now here in the darkness, waiting
 for he knew not what, with Laroque emerging so unexpectedly from the past,
 those words, hoarse in their rage and elemental fury, seemed to ring again
 with strange significance in his ears: &ldquo;You win to-night, but we&rsquo;ll
 get you yet! Some day we&rsquo;ll get you, you cursed snitch, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> What was that?</p>
<p> The sound came neither from below through the open door of the basement staircase,
 nor yet from the front doors along the hall. The sound persisted. It was like
 the gnawing of a rat. And then Jimmie Dale placed its general location. It
 seemed to come from outside the house, and in direction from the little den
 or office at his right that contained the safe. He moved stealthily to the
 doorway, and, still in the hall, protected by the door jamb, peered into the
 darkness of the room. He could see nothing.</p>
<p> But now the sound was still more clearly defined, and he placed it exactly.
 Rather than a gnawing, it was a scratching at the wall outside and below the
 window; and as it continued it seemed at times to grow almost human with impatience
 and irritability as it quickened its tempo.</p>
<p> And then suddenly Jimmie Dale turned his head. Imagination? No, there was
 another sound&mdash;and it, too, now repeated itself, low, cautious, stealthy.
 Some one was creeping down the third story stairs from the top of the house.</p>
<p> For an instant Jimmie Dale stood without movement, then a hard, quick smile
 compressed his lips. That scratching sound outside the window, which still
 persisted, had not been loud enough to <i>awaken</i> anybody. It was rather curious,
 rather singular! His ears, acute, trained to the slightest sound, caught the
 footfalls coming now along the upper hall, still low, still cautious and stealthy&mdash;and
 Jimmie Dale slipped across the threshold, and in an instant had passed into
 the library and was crouched behind the porti&egrave;res that hung between
 the two rooms.</p>
<p> A minute passed. A tread creaked softly on the main staircase; then a form
 bulked in irregular outline in the doorway of the little den, paused for the
 fraction of a second, came into the room, closed the door, and glided swiftly
 to the window. The window was cautiously opened. There was the soft <i>pad</i> of
 feet as a man crawled through and dropped to the floor. A hoarse whisper vibrated
 through the room.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Damn it, why didn&rsquo;t you keep me there all night?&rdquo; a voice
 demanded angrily. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to <i>sleep</i>, did you, or forget to
 leave the <i>window</i> of your room open so&rsquo;s you could <i>hear?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p> Another voice answered. The words came in a choked, broken way, as though
 with great effort:</p>
<p> &ldquo;No; I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t go to sleep. Not likely! I heard you the
 minute you came, but&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I had a&mdash;a bit
 of a turn. I came as soon as I could. I&mdash;I was sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p> A ray of a flashlight lanced through the blackness. It played on the tall,
 gaunt figure of an old, gray-haired man arrayed in a dressing gown, and on
 a face that was drawn and pallor-like in colour.</p>
<p> Then darkness again.</p>
<p> Behind the porti&egrave;re, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face suddenly hardened. There
 were little gray &ldquo;mutton-chop&rdquo; side whiskers, that was the only
 change. He recognised the man in an instant. It was the &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; alias
 Patrick Denton, one of the cleverest &ldquo;inside&rdquo; crooks that had ever
 infested New York. The man, pronounced an incurable heart case, and even then
 supposed to be in a dying condition, had been pardoned two years ago while
 serving a sentence in Sing Sing. Since then he had dropped out of sight; and
 indeed, generally, was supposed to be dead.</p>
<p> There was a callous grunt from the man at the window.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, you look it!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s no
 lie!&rdquo; He laughed shortly. &ldquo;And maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing. You
 could get away with the faithful-butler-mourning-for-his-dead-master stuff
 without batting an eyelid, if you had to.&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was no answer.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s hand slipped into his pocket and came out again with
 his automatic. So that was it! He began to understand. The Minister was back
 at his old inside game again&mdash;this time in the r&ocirc;le of Jathan Lane&rsquo;s
 butler!</p>
<p> The man who had crawled in through the window spoke again&mdash;sharply now:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get busy! We&rsquo;ve lost too much time as it is.
 If a light&rsquo;s safe, shoot her on; we can work quicker that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Minister. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
 safe enough.&rdquo; He stifled a cough. &ldquo;The rest are all asleep; and
 on account of what happened this afternoon, I had every shade in the house
 drawn. I&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off with a quick gasp, as coincident with the
 faint click of an electric-light switch, a single, shaded incandescent on the
 desk in front of the safe went on. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
 thought it was to be Hunchback Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The fold of the porti&egrave;re in Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s hand drew closer in
 against the edge of the wall projection until there was left but the veriest
 crack. A pucker came and nested in little wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.
 He was not so sure, after all, that he had begun to understand. In view of
 the Tocsin&rsquo;s letter, he did not understand at all. The man who stood
 there in the room beside the Minister, the man with the cool, contemptuous
 black eyes, the thin, cunning lips parted in a grim smile, was Gentleman Laroque.</p>
<p> &ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; said Laroque coolly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it
 straight. Hunchback Joe was to come here for the sparklers, smear the trail
 by bringing them back to me, and then I was going to slip them to old Isaac
 Shiftel. But Hunchback Joe couldn&rsquo;t come, and as it&rsquo;s a rather
 fussy job I didn&rsquo;t dare trust any one else, so I came myself. I&rsquo;ll
 take them direct from here to Shiftel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The pucker cleared from Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes. Shiftel&mdash;old Isaac
 Shiftel&mdash;the fence! The man was an outstanding figure in the underworld!
 Yes, he <i>did</i> begin to understand. But for once, for the first time since those
 days in the years gone by when the Tocsin had begun to sound those &ldquo;calls
 to arms,&rdquo; the Tocsin was astray. It was not her fault. It was nothing
 that she could by any possibility have foreseen. Only as matters now stood
 the police trap at Laroque&rsquo;s would be abortive&mdash;it should have been
 at Isaac Shiftel&rsquo;s! Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips pressed together. Well,
 he knew where Isaac Shiftel lived, and instead of the police, it would perhaps
 be&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s mental soliloquy ended abruptly. The Minister was walking
 with weak, unsteady steps across the room, groping at the desk for support,
 and speaking as he went.</p>
<p> &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything the matter, is there?&rdquo; he asked anxiously. &ldquo;I
 mean nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong with that other thing to keep Hunchback Joe
 away? He&rsquo;s safe, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p> An oath fell softly from Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s lips. He still smiled;
 but the cool contempt had gone from his eyes, and in its place was a smouldering
 passion.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;No; nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong, except
 that the whole plant is blown, the papers pinched by the police, and Hunchback
 Joe is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, you say?&rdquo; The old man swayed on his feet,
 his face a ghastly white. &ldquo;Dead! You said&mdash;dead? I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale straightened up involuntarily. The old man was undeniably ill,
 desperately ill. He had reeled and would have fallen had not Laroque caught
 him and placed him in a chair.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Brandy!&rdquo; the old man gasped. &ldquo;Over there&mdash;on&mdash;on
 that cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Laroque procured the stimulant. The Minister gulped it down eagerly. It seemed
 to revive him. He stared anxiously at Laroque.</p>
<p> &ldquo;How&mdash;what&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p> &ldquo;The police were tipped off by some one you don&rsquo;t know, and by
 some one you do,&rdquo; said Laroque between his teeth. &ldquo;The some one
 you know was&mdash;the Gray Seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; The white face was set with fear. &ldquo;The police&mdash;and&mdash;Hunchback
 Joe dead! We&mdash;we can&rsquo;t go on with this&mdash;we&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t if Joe <i>weren&rsquo;t</i> either trapped or dead,&rdquo; Laroque
 broke in sharply. &ldquo;Pull yourself together! We&rsquo;ve no time to waste.
 Don&rsquo;t you understand? It&rsquo;s <i>safer</i> than ever it was! If Klanner, the
 bank janitor, had got his, and the fake evidence had been found the way we
 planted it, this little deal here to-night was all tucked away neat enough.
 But Klanner&rsquo;s skin was saved, by luck as we thought then, though we know
 better now, and that put everything up in the air as far as <i>this</i> was concerned&mdash;until
 the police copped Joe with the goods, and Joe snuffed out. That gave them the
 motive again for the murder this afternoon, and gave them the man who did it.
 The case is closed now tighter than we figured it could be sewed up even in
 the first place. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old man shook his head. He looked furtively around him.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;If the Gray Seal&rsquo;s
 in this, it&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;But I tell you the Gray Seal isn&rsquo;t in this,&rdquo; snapped Laroque
 impatiently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to get through your
 thick head! He and every one else will think the curtain rolled down on the
 <i>last</i> act when they got Hunchback Joe. It&rsquo;s safe enough! It&rsquo;s so
 safe there isn&rsquo;t anything to it, if <i>your</i> end is safe. And you ought to
 know about that&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been a year getting the dope.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t afraid of that,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
 no one in the world knows how many he had. The family knew he had a lot, of
 course, and knew it was his hobby, and that he kept &rsquo;em here where he
 could look at &rsquo;em instead of in a safety deposit vault&mdash;though I
 guess he figured no safety deposit vault had anything on his&mdash;but they
 just knew he had a lot, they didn&rsquo;t know how many.&rdquo;</p>
<p> A strange light came dawning suddenly in Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes. Had the
 Tocsin been right in this respect? Was this the <i>real</i> motive for the murder&mdash;not
 the bank&rsquo;s papers? Jathan Lane&rsquo;s hobby! It was no secret. Jathan
 Lane was a fellow member of that most exclusive organization, the St. James
 Club. Dimly there came back to memory a conversation one afternoon when four
 or five members, Jathan Lane and himself amongst them, were gathered around
 one of the smoking room tables, and&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Gentleman Laroque brusquely. &ldquo;Well, then,
 what&rsquo;s the matter with you? There&rsquo;s no sign of any robbery; no
 sign of any entry into the house, not so much as an unlocked door or a scratch
 on a window sill; and Jathan Lane, the only man who could know that anything
 had been taken&mdash;is dead. And his death&rdquo;&mdash;Laroque grinned&mdash;&ldquo;occurred
 in such a way as to make what&rsquo;s done here secure from even suspicion.
 The bank game&rsquo;s a blind. This is what we&rsquo;ve been after, and now
 it&rsquo;s open and shut. And your share is the biggest haul you ever made
 in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old man stared around him. Colour crept into his cheeks and glowed in
 hectic spots. His eyes, deep in their sockets, began to burn with a feverish
 light. He pulled himself up to his feet.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; he mumbled fiercely. &ldquo;Rich&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;rich!
 It cannot fail; I am a fool&rdquo;&mdash;he caught his breath, and swayed again
 on his feet. &ldquo;Come on! Come on! Hurry!&rdquo; he choked out.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale watched them, his lips suddenly tight. They had <i>passed by</i> the
 safe, and were coming directly toward where he stood. Another yard and they
 would reach the porti&egrave;res. His automatic swung silently upward in his
 hand. And then the old man halted in front of an oil painting that hung from
 the wall a little less than shoulder high.</p>
<p> For an instant the man stood there breathing heavily, as though even the
 exertion of crossing the room had taxed him beyond his strength; and then with
 a quick movement he jerked at the edge of the frame, and the painting itself,
 as though it were the grooved cover of a box, slid to one side, exposing the
 wall, which was as bare and as innocent in appearance behind, or, rather, through
 the frame, as anywhere else in the room.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jathan Lane&rsquo;s safe deposit vault,&rdquo; coughed the Minister.
 He laughed. His cheeks were burning; his eyes were brighter. He leaned suddenly
 down toward the floor. &ldquo;This knot in the wainscoting&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Behind the empty frame, a door in the wall swung open&mdash;and the light
 from the room fell upon the nickel dial of a safe.</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy!&rdquo; applauded Gentleman Laroque.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; whispered the old man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open it!
 Wait! A&mdash;a long time it took to get the combination, but&mdash;but I got
 it&ldquo;&mdash;his fingers were working at the dial&mdash;&ldquo;there&mdash;there
 it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Just a second!&rdquo; said Laroque coolly, as the door of the little
 wall safe swung open. He glanced around him, then darted across the room to
 a small, square table on which stood a heavy bronze vase. &ldquo;Here, this
 will do!&rdquo; he said, and laying the vase on the floor, came back with the
 table. &ldquo;Shoot the stuff out on this!&rdquo;</p>
<p> It took a minute, perhaps two; and then upon the table there lay a number
 of jewellers&rsquo; cases in both plush and leather, and a dozen or more little
 chamois bags. Laroque was rapidly opening and shutting the cases, and as he
 did so the contents of each in its turn, pendants, brooches, ornaments of many
 designs, all of them set with diamonds, seemed to leap thirstily at the light
 and hail it with eager scintillating flashes before the covers could be shut
 down upon them again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;That all that&rsquo;s in there?&rdquo; demanded Laroque.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; breathed the old man. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;he rubbed
 his hands rapaciously together&mdash;&ldquo;all except the tray he uses to
 paw &rsquo;em over on.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s thoughtful of him!&rdquo; grunted Gentleman Laroque. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
 have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> From the bottom of the safe the Minister pulled out and laid upon the table
 an oblong, plush-covered tray with raised edges.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; grunted Laroque again. &ldquo;Open the bags, and dump
 the whities into the tray.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale drew in his breath. It seemed as though little rivers of fire
 had begun to stream from the mouths of the bags. The men were working fast
 now; Laroque with almost cynical composure; the old man, wrought up, clumsy
 in his greed, his hands trembling, mumbling, crooning to himself.</p>
<p> Diamonds, unset stones, of all sizes, poured into the tray; they filled it,
 heaped it to its edges. An inch deep they lay. It was a fortune whose value
 Jimmie Dale did not dare attempt to compute&mdash;a pool of immortal beauty,
 restless with vitality, flashing, limpid, shifting, iridescent. Here the facet
 of a stone struck back at the light, fiery, passionate in its challenge; there
 another lay, soft in its radiance, glowing, pulsing, breathing, alive.</p>
<p> Laroque drew a cloth bag from his pocket and unfolded it. He ran his finger
 through the stones, separating them into two almost equal portions; the portion
 nearer him he began to put into his little sack.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Slip the rest of them into the chamois bags again, and put &rsquo;em
 back in the safe,&rdquo; he directed tersely. &ldquo;Divide &rsquo;em amongst
 the bags as equally as you can. And those gew-gaws in the cases, too, of course&mdash;put
 them back. We can&rsquo;t afford to monkey with anything but the unset stones;
 any one of those ornaments might happen to be just the one that somebody in
 the family would remember&mdash;and miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p> But now the Minister hesitated. The hectic colour had fled from his cheeks,
 only to enhance, it seemed, the fever fire in his eyes; the muscles of his
 face twitched; his hands, trembling before, shook now as with the ague.</p>
<p> &ldquo;<i>All!</i>&rdquo; he whispered fiercely, and touched his lips with the tip
 of his tongue. &ldquo;Look at &rsquo;em! My God, look at &rsquo;em! We&rsquo;ve
 got &rsquo;em all here! Take &rsquo;em! Take &rsquo;em! Let&rsquo;s take &rsquo;em
 all&mdash;all the unset stones anyhow! I&rsquo;ll make my get-away with you.
 Can&rsquo;t we take &rsquo;em all?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Gentleman Laroque continued his work without looking up.</p>
<p> &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve</i> never been in Sing Sing,&rdquo; he said, with a
  thin smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
 why I came here myself to-night. I couldn&rsquo;t trust you or anybody else,
 except Hunchback Joe, to stand up against the temptation of making the bum
 play that would land us there. All! That&rsquo;s what Sing Sing is full of!
 You poor fool, aren&rsquo;t you satisfied with a <i>sure</i> thing when the sure thing
 is a fortune? That&rsquo;s what the half we&rsquo;re taking is&mdash;a fortune.
 And nobody to know that any job has been pulled; and Shiftel with a free hand
 to dispose of the stones at market value! Would you rather pinch them all,
 make it next to impossible to sell them for anything like what they&rsquo;re
 worth, and on top of that dodge the police for the rest of your life? You&rsquo;d
 have a rosy chance making your get-away&mdash;Mr. Jathan Lane&rsquo;s vanishing
 butler, alias the Minister, alias Patrick Denton, late of Sing Sing!&rdquo; His
 voice hardened suddenly. &ldquo;As I said, <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> never been in Sing Sing.
 Hurry up, now! Put the rest of those stones and all the ornaments back in the
 safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old man swept his hand across his eyes.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said thickly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, and I&mdash;&rdquo; A
 spasm of pain contorted his features, and he clutched at his side and staggered;
 but as Laroque, with a sharp exclamation, reached out a steadying hand, the
 Minister shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and
 began to return the diamonds Laroque had left on the tray to the little chamois
 bags.</p>
<p> A strange smile crossed Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips. Laroque was right&mdash;quite
 right. And from Laroque&rsquo;s standpoint&mdash;safe. The scene of the two
 men at work there beyond the porti&egrave;re seemed suddenly to shift, and
 he, Jimmie Dale, was again one of that afternoon group gathered around the
 table in the smoking room of the St. James Club. Jathan Lane, one of the richest
 men in America, and his hobby! It had been pure pleasantry, the twitting to
 which they had subjected the multimillionaire. But the banker had answered
 seriously. &ldquo;How many stones have I? What are they worth?&rdquo; he had
 said in reply to a question. &ldquo;I am sure I do not know myself, but I am
 equally sure there are no finer unset diamonds, in mass you understand, in
 America. I have been buying them, one, two, half a dozen at a time, for years.
 I love them; I take a pure delight in them; and I indulge myself without stint,
 since, after all, my hobby is by no means a bad one even in a business sense.
 At least, and what can hardly be said of most hobbies, the value is always
 there.&rdquo; &ldquo;But your family?&rdquo; the questioner had persisted. &ldquo;I
 should think Mrs. Lane and your daughter would be raiding you all the time!&rdquo; And
 then Jathan Lane had laughed. &ldquo;Familiarity and contempt, you know,&rdquo; he
 had said. &ldquo;A boy and his bag of marbles. They haven&rsquo;t looked at
 them for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Gentleman Laroque was speaking again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; he said more pleasantly. &ldquo;They
 may be a little <i>disappointed</i>, perhaps even a little surprised that there aren&rsquo;t
 more, but that&rsquo;s where it ends so far as the family is concerned. No
 suspicion that everything isn&rsquo;t just as old man Lane left it; no suspicion
 that anything has been <i>taken</i>. And, speaking professionally, therein lies the
 difference between an artist and a hog!&rdquo; He tucked the small cloth bag
 under his coat. The table was clear. &ldquo;Close her up nice and tidy,&rdquo; he
 smiled, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll beat it for Shiftel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old man closed the wall safe, and slid the painting back in its grooved
 frame.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; approved Gentleman Laroque. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you
 to put the table back. Come on now, and lock the window behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale did not move; only his face set a little more grimly as he watched
 Gentleman Laroque climb through the window and disappear. It would be a pity
 to let Shiftel get out of this scot-free! His mind, alert, incisive, was sifting,
 weighing, formulating the details of a plan whose germ had taken root there,
 it seemed, almost from the moment he had begun to watch the men at work. Neither
 Gentleman Laroque nor the Minister would eventually escape, for they could
 be found anytime.... Shiftel was another member of the gang, an oily, craven
 little rat, and Shiftel in a corner with his own skin in danger was far more
 likely to <i>talk</i> than either of the other two...the Tocsin&rsquo;s letter and
 the Phantom...what Shiftel knew he could be made to tell...the <i>evidence</i> of
 this robbery here must be taken care of as soon as the Minister there had gone
 upstairs again to&mdash;</p>
<p> There came a low, dull thud; a broken cry:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Brandy&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> With a sudden sweep of his arm Jimmie Dale brushed aside the porti&egrave;re
 and leaped forward&mdash;too late. The heavy bronze vase, fallen from nerveless
 fingers that had striven to lift it back on the table, was still rolling across
 the floor, as the old man, with arms outflung, pitched forward beside it, and
 lay still.</p>
<p> In an instant Jimmie Dale had reached the cabinet and procured the stimulant,
 and in another was kneeling beside the prostrate figure&mdash;and then, after
 a moment, in a strangely quiet and deliberate way Jimmie Dale laid the brandy
 aside.</p>
<p> It was very still in the house, still as the form stretched out there on
 the rug before him, still as the old, white, upturned face. The man was dead.</p>
<p> The grim, sharp lines that drooped the corners of Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips
 faded away, and something seemed to soften the hard, set immobility of his
 face as he rose finally to his feet. It was just a crook, just the Minister,
 alias Patrick Denton, just the end of a vicious, miserable career of crime&mdash;but
 it was also the end of a human life. And life even to this warped soul was
 as sweet, wasn&rsquo;t it, as to another?&mdash;more so perhaps for the very
 fact that death must have stood with beckoning finger for so long now at the
 other&rsquo;s elbow! Jimmie Dale turned slowly away and walked across the room.
 Mechanically he slid the painting out along its grooves; mechanically he stooped
 and found the knot in the wainscoting. Perhaps it was as well, perhaps infinitely
 better this way, better that the end should come here than behind the steel
 bars and the gray stone walls where once it had so nearly come. They would
 not have pardoned the Minister <i>twice</i>.</p>
<p> The little door in the wall had swung open, the nickel dial of the safe glittered
 in the light&mdash;and suddenly Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s shoulders straightened,
 and for an instant his dark eyes studied the closed steel door. Then he leaned
 forward, his ear pressed against the face of the safe for the tumblers&rsquo; fall,
 and the slim, sensitive fingers, the nerves throbbing at the tips, those magical
 masters of bolts and locks, were at work.</p>
<p> The minutes passed. There was no sound, save at times the faint, musical
 whir of the dial; then, abruptly, a deep breathed exclamation:</p>
<p> &ldquo;All thumbs to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again the minutes passed; again the dial moved, now with its musical whir,
 now slowly, with infinite care; and then a sound, so low as to be scarcely
 audible&mdash;the soft thud, muffled within the steel walls, of metal meeting
 metal, the bolts sliding in their sockets.</p>
<p> The door of the safe stood open.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale swung around and stared about the room. He was provided with
 no little cloth sack such as Gentleman Laroque had had; true he had, instead,
 those little chamois bags, and his pockets might hold them all, but&mdash;With
 a quick stride he crossed the room to the desk, and picked up a black leather
 portfolio. It was quite large enough, and, used for carrying documents, its
 flap was fitted with a clasp. He opened it, dumped the papers it contained
 out on the desk, and returned to the wall safe.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale was working with lightning speed now. The little chamois bags
 were tucked into the bottom of the portfolio; the small plush and leather jewellers&rsquo; cases
 were opened in quick succession, their contents following the chamois bags,
 the cases themselves being tossed helter-skelter upon the floor.</p>
<p> The safe was empty.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale closed the portfolio, and cast a sharp, critical glance around
 the room. He nodded grimly to himself. There was ample evidence now that there
 had been a robbery, quite ample&mdash;everybody knew that there had been <i>something</i> in the now empty safe&mdash;and it would not therefore be, as Gentleman Laroque
 expected, so blind a trail now that led to the source of the diamonds with
 which Isaac Shiftel was to be endowed! Also, for good measure in this respect,
 some of the ornaments, that were certainly the property of Mrs. Lane, and which
 Gentleman Laroque had been wise enough to leave alone, would not lack for a
 speedy identification! And, again, there was the yawning door of the wall safe,
 and the painting that still protruded so eloquently from its frame!</p>
<p> His eyes softened in their expression as they held now for an instant again
 on the form that lay upon the floor. Then he shook his head in quick decision.
 He needed time now before an alarm was sounded that might by any chance reach
 the ears of Gentleman Laroque, or, more particularly, one Isaac Shiftel!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale consulted his watch. It was five minutes of three. The electric-light
 switch clicked under his fingers. The room was in darkness.</p>
<p> Then silence through the house.</p>
<p> And presently a figure crouched again in the shadows of the basement porch,
 and crossed the yard, and swung itself silently over the fence into the lane&mdash;and
 from here, slipping the black silk mask from his face, Jimmie Dale emerged
 on the street.</p>
<p> But now Jimmie Dale seemed to be no longer in haste. It was a long way from
 Jathan Lane&rsquo;s mansion to Mr. Isaac Shiftel&rsquo;s unsavory abode, which
 was now Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s destination, and the subway would be the quicker,
 but, instead, Jimmie Dale hailed a belated taxi as it passed him. He was interested
 in reaching Isaac Shiftel&rsquo;s only <i>after</i> Gentleman Laroque had been there
 and gone. He gave the chauffeur an address on the Bowery that would bring him
 within a block of the tenement that Isaac Shiftel had chosen as his lair, and
 stepped into the taxi.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
 One Isaac Shiftel</b></h2>
<p> The taxi rolled and swayed its way along. Jimmie Dale sat staring at the
 portfolio that bumped with the motion of the car upon his knees. In some thirty-odd
 minutes, at half-past three to be exact, the police would be paying a visit
 to Laroque&rsquo;s quarters, and even if the man were not back there by then,
 the police were patient and would wait! They would get Laroque&mdash;but not
 the evidence. They might even let the man go again&mdash;temporarily. It would
 not matter. Laroque&rsquo;s freedom, if obtained at all, would be of very short
 duration. The evidence lacking at Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s would be found
 within the hour and in abundant measure, together with Mr. Isaac Shiftel himself,
 at&mdash;Isaac Shiftel&rsquo;s!</p>
<p> But that was not all; nor, indeed, that which most vitally interested him.
 Despite the Tocsin&rsquo;s efforts to keep him out of those shadows, as she
 had termed it, that seemed to have closed down upon her blacker and more ominous
 even than before, the night&rsquo;s work had already brought him greater returns
 than he had ever dared to hope for or expect. He knew three of the pawns who
 moved at the criminal will of the unknown leader whom she had styled the Phantom.
 One of the three was dead, but there remained two; and of the two, one was
 Laroque, and the other was a miserable little rat-like creature, who, under
 <i>persuasion</i>, was not likely to prove over-secretive. And Shiftel&rsquo;s tongue,
 once made to wag, held promise of almost anything, even the &ldquo;Open Sesame&rdquo; to
 what was now his, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s, ultimate goal&mdash;the Phantom.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes travelled to the window, held there for a few minutes
 noting the taxi&rsquo;s progress, and then fixed introspectively again on the
 portfolio.</p>
<p> Shiftel! He knew Shiftel as only the <i>initiated</i> knew him, as only those knew
 him whose ears were attune to the whispered confidences of the underworld&rsquo;s
 exchanges in the dens and dives hidden away from the light of day, where he,
 Jimmie Dale, once as Larry the Bat, and now in the present day as Smarlinghue,
 the broken-down artist and hop-fighter, was welcomed as one of the &eacute;lite
 of that inglorious realm. He had even seen Shiftel on one or two occasions&mdash;an
 unkempt, bearded, spectacled foreigner of uncertain age, a cringing little
 beast, hideously cunning, a master in his own peculiar line of deviltry. Shiftel
 ostensibly, for the benefit of the police should they ever prove inquisitive,
 made his living in his two-room, dirty, bachelor apartment, by working on garments
 which he brought from various sweat shops. If he were rarely at home and too
 lazy to work much, that was his misfortune, his loss, and his sole personal
 affair! But the underworld held him in quite other regard&mdash;as a &ldquo;fence,&rdquo; a &ldquo;shover
 of stolen goods,&rdquo; who was safe, and in cleverness without an equal. There
 were few crooks in the Bad Lands but were hungry for Isaac Shiftel&rsquo;s
 services, but Shiftel was not approachable to all; it was understood, and perforce
 had regretfully come to be accepted as a fact, that he dealt only with a small
 and select clientele of his own choosing, whose personnel was more guessed
 at than known; and that to break into the charmed circle was a feat attempted
 by many but accomplished by few. And as far back as Jimmie Dale could remember,
 as far back as he could remember even Gentleman Laroque, Shiftel had lived
 in the same miserable rooms in the same miserable tenement.</p>
<p> The taxi rattled on. At intervals Jimmie Dale kept glancing out of the window.
 And then, as the taxi turned at last into the Bowery, he smiled suddenly, laid
 his handkerchief on the portfolio, and reached into one of the pockets of the
 leather girdle under his vest. Shiftel! He took out a thin metal case, like
 a cigarette case, and from the case, with a pair of tiny tweezers that mocked
 at finger-prints, he lifted out a diamond-shaped gray paper seal that was adhesive
 on one side, and dropped it on the handkerchief. He returned the metal case
 to its hiding place, folded the handkerchief carefully, and replaced it in
 his pocket.</p>
<p> A moment later the taxi stopped. Jimmie Dale alighted, paid and dismissed
 the chauffeur, and as he swung around the corner, walking east from the Bowery,
 he looked at his watch. It was twenty minutes past three. It became now simply
 a question whether Laroque was still with Shiftel, or had gone home.</p>
<p> The street, one of the most shabby of East Side streets, was dark, poorly
 lighted, and free of pedestrians. Jimmie Dale passed by a tenement whose shabbiness
 was quite in keeping with its surroundings, passed by a narrow areaway which
 separated the tenement from another which might have been a duplicate of the
 first&mdash;and halted before the entrance of the second tenement.</p>
<p> The outer door was unlocked. In a moment he was inside the hallway, and in
 utter blackness now stood motionless, listening. Then again the black silk
 mask was slipped over his face, and again it was as though a shadow moved.
 Shiftel&rsquo;s apartment was the middle one on the ground floor facing the
 other tenement across the areaway.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale passed down the length of the hall, counting the doors on his
 right by the sense of touch, and, returning, crouched with his ear against
 the panel of the door he had selected. From within, so faintly as to be indefinable
 in any concrete way, there came the sound of movement. Still Jimmie Dale listened,
 even while his fingers worked silently at doorknob and lock. He nodded his
 head as he completed his work. There had been no sound of voices. Gentleman
 Laroque had evidently been and gone. Isaac Shiftel was alone.</p>
<p> And then suddenly Jimmie Dale was on his feet, and in a flash was in the
 room, the door closed and locked behind him. Through the doorway of a connecting
 room ahead of him he could see the unkempt, bearded figure of Shiftel as the
 man, with a cry, sprang wildly to his feet from the chair in which he had been
 seated, clawing, even as he sprang, at the white, glittering array of diamonds
 strewn upon the table-top before him.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; the man called out hoarsely.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s automatic covered the other as he moved swiftly forward
 to Shiftel&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quite an elaborate collection you&rsquo;ve got here, Isaac,&rdquo; he
 said softly. &ldquo;First water stones of course, or <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t be
 handling them. And please don&rsquo;t wriggle, Isaac, until I&mdash;ah, thanks!&rdquo; He
 had laid the portfolio down on the table, and his fingers passing deftly over
 Shiftel&rsquo;s clothing had whipped out a revolver from the other&rsquo;s
 pocket and transferred it to his own.</p>
<p> But now Shiftel seemed to have got a sudden grip upon himself. He leaned
 forward, peering sharply from behind his spectacles at Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 masked face.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said with a snarl, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you, because
 I don&rsquo;t know <i>your</i> kind. But you evidently don&rsquo;t know Isaac Shiftel.
 Those stones, eh? That&rsquo;s it, is it? Well, you may get out of here with
 them, but afterwards&mdash;eh?&mdash;do you think Isaac Shiftel&rsquo;s arm
 is so short as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale made no answer. He retreated a step, and with his free hand began
 to unfasten the portfolio.</p>
<p> Shiftel shook his fist virulently now. The first shock once over, he was,
 through familiarity, apparently quite at his ease again in dealing with&mdash;a
 crook.</p>
<p> &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get wise to this, eh?&rdquo; he demanded fiercely. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
 you&mdash;&rdquo; His glance had travelled to the window that opened on the
 areaway. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, eh? The shade&rsquo;s
 down, but like a fool I left the window open. You had the luck to sneak into
 that areaway.&rdquo; He peered again into Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face, and abruptly
 his tone and manner changed. He rubbed his hands together ingratiatingly. &ldquo;I
 said you didn&rsquo;t know Isaac Shiftel,&rdquo; he said smoothly; &ldquo;but
 you do&mdash;everybody in your line of business knows Isaac Shiftel. I&rsquo;ll
 make a deal with you&mdash;a fair share&mdash;eh? You don&rsquo;t want Isaac
 Shiftel as an enemy. I&rsquo;ll give you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting in ahead of me, Isaac,&rdquo; interrupted Jimmie
 Dale plaintively. He coughed slightly&mdash;and politely pressed his handkerchief
 to his moistened lips. &ldquo;<i>I</i> meant to be the first to offer something.&rdquo; With
 a quick jerk of his revolver hand, he plucked a diamond necklace from the top
 of the portfolio, and tossed it upon the table. &ldquo;That, for instance&mdash;Isaac.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The ornament seemed to fascinate Shiftel. As if drawn to it against his will,
 he leaned forward staring at it; and then, as though actuated by a sort of
 frightened incredulity, he reached out a hand toward it&mdash;but Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 hand that still held the handkerchief was the quicker. It fell and gripped
 like a vise upon the back of Shiftel&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Just a moment, Isaac,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale coolly. &ldquo;There
 is something else that I want you to have&mdash;as a little memento of the
 occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p> There came a startled cry from Shiftel. Jimmie Dale had withdrawn his hand,
 and Shiftel was staring now, not at the diamond necklace, but at a diamond-shaped
 gray paper seal that was pasted on the back of his hand.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it for you!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s smile was not
 inviting. &ldquo;The Gray Seal! I apologise for the melodrama, but I think
 it will aid you, Isaac, to see things in a clearer light. You&rsquo;ve got
 a little information that I want, and I imagine it will help to quicken your
 memory and loosen your tongue to know <i>who</i> wants it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was no answer. The man, his lips twitching, was still staring at the
 back of his hand.</p>
<p> With a sudden movement, Jimmie Dale emptied the contents of the portfolio
 upon the table. He brushed them into a heap with the diamonds already there.</p>
<p> &ldquo;They belong together,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, in a curious monotone, &ldquo;and
 I couldn&rsquo;t bear to see them left behind. They&rsquo;ll be <i>found</i> together
 too, Isaac, for I am afraid it will be impossible to make any one believe now
 that Jathan Lane&rsquo;s safe has never been disturbed.&rdquo; His voice hardened
 suddenly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going up for this, Isaac. I make no bargain
 with you. The police are going to be tipped off over the phone, and they are
 going to find you here trussed up in that chair with the diamonds in front
 of you. But before the police get you, you are going to deal with me. I want
 to know who the man is you, and those with you, take your orders from. And
 before we are <i>through</i> you are going to tell me, Isaac&mdash;all you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Shiftel&rsquo;s tongue was circling his lips. He shook his head. He was cringing
 now, supplicating with his hands.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; he protested wildly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
 all wrong. You&rsquo;re all wrong about everything. I don&rsquo;t know anything
 about Jathan Lane. I don&rsquo;t know where the diamonds came from. I never
 ask questions in my business. They were brought in here for me to shove, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Isaac!&rdquo; snapped Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;The
 game is up! Your friend, Patrick Denton, alias the Minister, is dead up there
 on the floor of Jathan Lane&rsquo;s private library, where he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; Shiftel&rsquo;s hands had ceased their movements. The
 man stood rigid. Something stronger than himself seemed to have stripped him
 of further power to dissimulate. &ldquo;Dead! You&mdash;you killed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Never mind about that!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale bit off his words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
 enough for you to know for the present that he is dead. You&rsquo;re not quite
 so innocent as you were&mdash;are you, Isaac? And as for the man who brought
 those stones here, a friend of mine has kindly arranged to have the police
 pay a little visit at Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s at just about this time; to
 be precise&rdquo;&mdash;he drew his watch from his pocket&mdash;&ldquo;at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s words ended abruptly. He, too, was suddenly standing
 tense and rigid. A footstep, guarded, cautious, was coming along the areaway
 out there. It was coming nearer to the open window&mdash;the drawn shade did
 not <i>hide</i> the sound. Instinctively his eyes sought the dial of his watch.</p>
<p> It was half past three.</p>
<p> &ldquo;At Laroque&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Shiftel, his ears strained toward the window,
 was whispering the words. &ldquo;The police&mdash;at Laroque&rsquo;s!&rdquo; And
 then he raised both fists in fury and shook them above his head. &ldquo;You
 snitch, you cursed snitch&rdquo;&mdash;the low, whispered words seemed but
 to accentuate the man&rsquo;s sudden flood of passion&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
 get you yet for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p> For an instant Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s brain seemed to reel in turmoil and chaos.
 That voice was no longer Shiftel&rsquo;s. Those words! Once he had heard those
 exact words before, and&mdash;with a quick step forward, his hand reached out,
 tearing beard and spectacles from the other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Gentleman Laroque!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, you fool!&rdquo; said Laroque, still whispering. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve
 tripped at last, eh? You didn&rsquo;t know, and you&rsquo;ve brought the police
 <i>here</i>. Well, take the consequences! It&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;s trapped!&rdquo; He
 was backing slowly away from both table and window toward the inner wall of
 the room. &ldquo;Perhaps <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> explain the possession of those stones!
 You fool, you and that woman with you, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
 up against, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; ordered Jimmie Dale grimly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Just this far,&rdquo; smiled Laroque. &ldquo;I hear them coming along
 the hall inside now. Don&rsquo;t forget there&rsquo;s one of your police on
 guard outside the window, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> The room was in instant darkness. The bare fraction of a second passed, not
 more; there was a faint scraping sound from the direction where Laroque had
 been standing&mdash;and Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s flashlight, whipped from his pocket,
 was sweeping around him.</p>
<p> The room was empty!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face was set like chiselled marble. Empty! Gone! The
 man was gone! But that was not all! Voices were ringing that slogan of the
 old days in his ears again: &ldquo;Death to the Gray Seal!&rdquo; He did not
 need to be told what it meant to be caught by either police or underworld.
 He, too, heard those guarded footsteps inside the tenement and coming now along
 the hall. His mind, alert, virile, was working with lightning speed. The doorway
 was behind him, and Laroque could not have gone that way&mdash;nor by the window
 guarded by the police. There must be some secret exit from the room. If so,
 given but a second, while he, Jimmie Dale, was attempting an escape, Laroque
 could get back again and secure the diamonds that lay upon the table. And he,
 Jimmie Dale, was <i>responsible</i> for them now!</p>
<p> And now Jimmie Dale in action was swift as his racing thoughts. Whether he
 could save himself or not, there was at least a way to save the stones. With
 the flashlight switched on, he propped it on the end of the table, its ray
 streaming over the gems and playing in the opposite direction from the connecting
 door.</p>
<p> &ldquo;If you can hear me, Laroque,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I warn you&mdash;don&rsquo;t
 try it! All you&rsquo;ll get off that table will be a bullet, whether I&rsquo;m
 caught or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p> It was utter blackness behind him. He backed swiftly, silently through the
 connecting door, and across the outer room to the door that led into the hall.
 His automatic held a line on the table top. He crouched at the far side of
 the door casing. They were here now. He heard a whispered consultation outside,
 as his fingers, closing on the key, silently unlocked the door. Queer! His
 brain was racing again. A queer sight! All blackness back here&mdash;and, through
 the connecting doorway, a light, apparently coming from nowhere, streamed over
 a shimmering, scintillating mass of diamonds, and ended by imposing itself
 in a white, luminous circle on a dirty, greasy wall behind! His eyes never
 left the table; his automatic never wavered in its line. Queer! The Phantom!
 Gentleman Laroque&mdash;Isaac Shiftel! Could it be? Was that a partial answer
 to the Tocsin&rsquo;s &ldquo;score of aliases and score of domiciles&rdquo;?
 Was Gentleman Laroque the Phantom? Yet how had she taken this for Laroque&rsquo;s
 home if she hadn&rsquo;t known the two men were one? And she hadn&rsquo;t known.
 She had said so. But&mdash;yes, it was not unexplainable. It might easily have
 been&mdash;just as it had been with him, Jimmie Dale, as Larry the Bat, or
 as Smarlinghue. She might have seen Laroque come here some evening&mdash;and
 Shiftel might have come out&mdash;while she thought Laroque remained <i>at home</i>.
 It might easily be that she did not know Shiftel, and so&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Bust it in!&rdquo; The words came sharp, incisive, from the hall;
 then a quick exclamation: &ldquo;Blamed if the door ain&rsquo;t unlocked! Come
 on!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The door was flung violently open. A man swung forward into the room&mdash;and
 halted abruptly, staring toward the connecting doorway.</p>
<p> &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, sergeant, look at that!&rdquo; he burst out.</p>
<p> A man behind pushed eagerly forward. And Jimmie Dale, crouching low by the
 baseboard in the blackness, slipped through the doorway behind the other without
 a sound, and in a moment was outside the tenement and walking quietly along
 the street&mdash;in a direction that ignored the areaway.</p>
<p> Half an hour later Jimmie Dale mounted the steps of a palatial residence
 on Riverside Drive. He smiled softly as he stumbled and shuffled so noisily
 that before he had gained the topmost step the door was opened for him by the
 white-haired old butler, who had been butler to Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s father
 before him, and whose proudest boast was that he had dandled his Master Jim
 upon his knee. It would have been so easy to have slipped in, and passed the
 old man, and gone upstairs to bed&mdash;and broken the old man&rsquo;s heart
 to have been found out <i>asleep</i> at his self-appointed post.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale severely&mdash;and used identically
 the same words he had used on a hundred similar occasions: &ldquo;Sitting
 up again for me, Jason? How many times am I to tell you that I won&rsquo;t
 have it? Jason, go to bed at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;Thank you, sir. Thank you, Master
 Jim, sir&mdash;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
 Threads</b></h2>
<p> Two weeks had passed.</p>
<p> It was evening; and Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue now, the seedy, down-at-the-heels
 artist, better known as Smarly in the Bad Lands, and still better known again
 in the ultra-exclusive dens and dives, where the first citizens of New York&rsquo;s
 crimeland foregathered, as a dope fiend shattered beyond repair, a character
 shady enough from any angle to entitle him to homage even in that unhallowed
 circle of the &eacute;lite, slouched along an East Side street&mdash;but the
 slouching gait was strangely and incredibly swift. He skulked in the night
 shadows of the buildings like some evil thing that sought darkness as kindred
 to itself. But at intervals, as he moved along with that strange illusive swiftness,
 the rays of a street lamp, as though in ironic mockery at his inability to
 evade them, brought out into sharp relief the disreputable figure whose coat
 was a size too small for him, and from the short sleeves of which protruded
 blatantly the frayed and soiled wristbands of his shirt, whose shoulders were
 stooped, and whose face, what could be seen of it under a battered felt hat,
 was hollow cheeked, and gaunt with a half starved look.</p>
<p> And now he entered a house that made the corner of a lane, a house that was
 as disreputable as himself, a dwelling of some old-time pretentions, but with
 the city&rsquo;s onward march a derelict now, metamorphosed into a mean and
 squalid tenement. He passed along the dark, musty hallway to the rear room
 on the ground floor, and, opening the door, stepped inside. He closed the door,
 locked it behind him, and for an instant stood still, his glance seeming to
 search into the very shadows themselves where they lay heaviest in the far
 corners of the room.</p>
<p> It was the Sanctuary that for a year now&mdash;or was it two?&mdash;had housed
 the character of Smarlinghue, as, in the days gone by, the old Sanctuary, before
 the fire had destroyed it, had housed the character of Larry the Bat. Through
 a top-light high up near the ceiling above the French window, which latter,
 a relic of past glory, opened on a level with the floor, the moonlight flickered
 in. It disclosed in nebulous outline a battered easel in one corner of the
 room, and near it, against the wall and strewn upon the floor, a number of
 canvases of different sizes. A cot bed, its covers in disorder, occupied the
 wall space opposite the door. For the rest, there were a filthy, threadbare
 rag of carpet upon the floor, a battered table, a rickety washstand, and two
 disabled chairs.</p>
<p> Satisfied that the moonlight was the sole intruder, Jimmie Dale nodded shortly
 to himself, and stepping abruptly forward examined the drawn roller shade on
 the French window, and particularly a rent therein that was fastened together
 with a pin. Again he nodded. Then a diminutive gas-jet, choked with air, hissed
 and spluttered under his match, and supplanting the moonlight, threw a sickly
 yellow glow about the room. He crossed then to the corner near the door, knelt
 down on the floor, and after an instant&rsquo;s work removed an ingeniously
 fitted section of the baseboard. From the aperture he took out the carefully
 folded dinner suit which he had been wearing on the evening when he had last
 left his residence on Riverside Drive.</p>
<p> He began to cast off the shabby, disreputable garments of Smarlinghue. He
 worked swiftly. With the clothes discarded, there came another change. The
 hollow cheeks, the thin, extended lips, the widened nostrils disappeared as
 little distorting pieces of wax were removed. Before a cracked mirror propped
 up on the rickety washstand, he washed away the stain that previously had given
 a jaundiced, unhealthy hue to his face and hands&mdash;and with minutest care
 took stock of the result in the mirror.</p>
<p> And then the light went out. The rest could be completed in the darkness.
 Smarlinghue was no longer at home.</p>
<p> It was like a shadow now flitting soundlessly here and there in the streak
 of moonlight. A minute, perhaps two, passed; and then the pin that held together
 the rent in the window shade was removed, and Jimmie Dale peered cautiously
 out into the narrow, squalid, moonlit courtyard beyond. Another instant, and
 the French window opened noiselessly on its carefully oiled hinges, and closed
 again. A figure, close hugged against the wall of the building, stole along
 the few intervening feet to the fence that divided the courtyard from the lane.
 Here, next to the wall, a loosened plank swung outward. The figure slipped
 through into the lane&mdash;and Jimmie Dale, immaculate and faultlessly attired,
 emerged upon the street from which, but a few minutes before, Smarlinghue,
 the dope fiend, had vanished.</p>
<p> He walked rapidly now, heading over toward the Bowery, and crossing that
 thoroughfare, innocuous now in the early evening hours, continued on deeper
 into the East Side. A half grim, half whimsical smile was on his lips. His
 objective was a little two-story, tumble-down house where an old widow by the
 name of Mrs. Kinsey still kept, as she had kept for more years than the East
 Side could remember, a small and woefully unpretentious confectionery store.
 It did not further the one interest he had in life now, this objective of his
 to-night; it would bring him no nearer to his goal, so far as he could see,
 though it held a logical and even intimate connection therewith. It was no &ldquo;call
 to arms&rdquo; from the Tocsin that he&mdash;</p>
<p> His pace slackened involuntarily, and there was a sudden droop to the broad
 shoulders that were usually so straight. The Tocsin! Where was she&mdash;while
 he, seeking to reach her, groped and groped in pitiful failure, a blind man,
 a child in strength, a fool in intellect! He clenched his hands. One of those
 black moments again! One more added to the thousand through which he had lived
 in the past two weeks. Was she still <i>alive?</i></p>
<p> He choked back a cry of bitter agony, and quickened his pace again; but though
 his shoulders were once more thrown back, a whiteness had been born into his
 face.</p>
<p> It was two weeks since she had left him that night in the little boat on
 the East River, two weeks since the night Gentleman Laroque, alias Isaac Shiftel,
 had so mysteriously disappeared from that tenement room, and she had begun
 again to battle alone for her existence, pitting her wits against that unknown
 super-fiend of the underworld whom she had styled the Phantom. And since that
 night Gentleman Laroque, both in that character and in the character of Isaac
 Shiftel, had vanished as effectually as though he had never existed; and there
 had been no word or sign from her, save a short note that he had found, as
 once before in the old days he had found one, hidden behind the movable section
 of the baseboard in the Sanctuary&mdash;and that was now a week ago. He had
 destroyed it, torn it for safety&rsquo;s sake into the same minute fragments
 that he always tore her notes; but it still remained intact, for it had seared
 itself word for word indelibly upon his brain.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dear Philanthropic Crook,&rdquo; she had written. &ldquo;Oh, why
  <i>will</i> you do it! You do not know your own danger. Apart from the police, there
 is only one man who could be interested in the secret of Shiftel&rsquo;s room.
 That&rsquo;s you, Jimmie. They know that. Keep away from the place. They expect
 you sooner or later. Oh, I beg of you to keep away! It is a trap. Mother Margot,
 the new tenant, is one of them. She is only there to throw dust in your eyes,
 and in the eyes of the police.</p>
<p> &ldquo;As for myself, I am safe so far, Jimmie; but I do not know how much
 progress I have made. Sometimes I think I have already come far along the road&mdash;and
 sometimes I seem lost again. Yesterday I was sure of the Phantom&rsquo;s identity;
 to-day I am sure I was wrong; to-morrow I shall be sure again&mdash;but it
 will be of a totally different personality. You think, no doubt, that it is
 Shiftel, alias Laroque. Well, perhaps, it is; but unless you and I are both
 swept out of the road, neither in the one character nor the other will that
 man probably ever be heard of again. And so, oh, Jimmie, be careful&mdash;<i>and
 remember the trap</i>. Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The last phrase was heavily underscored. The trap! It brought a grim twist
 to his lips. He had already been in and out of the trap&mdash;and, from what
 she had said in her note, at perhaps the only time when it had been safe so
 far as he was concerned, paradoxical though that seemed, for he had visited
 Shiftel&rsquo;s rooms again the night after the murder, and while the police
 had, so fortunately it now appeared, obligingly done unconscious picket duty
 for him without. The diamonds found in Shiftel&rsquo;s room had, thanks to
 the set pieces, been almost immediately identified; and these, coupled with
 their owner&rsquo;s murder, and the dead butler&rsquo;s identification as an
 ex-Sing Sing convict, had aroused a veritable furor in the papers. The police
 had wanted, and still wanted, Shiftel very badly indeed, and so plain-clothesmen
 for a week had unostentatiously watched the tenement day and night on the chance
 that Shiftel would return. But he, Jimmie Dale, had been even more interested
 in Shiftel&rsquo;s erstwhile domicile than had the police; therefore he had
 examined it, not entirely to his ultimate satisfaction, but certainly unknown
 to the headquarters men, whom, not being Shiftel, he had had little difficulty
 in eluding. The result had been&mdash;nothing.</p>
<p> Then, again unknown to the police, he had joined forces with them, and he,
 too, had watched the tenement. On the first of the month, a week after Shiftel&rsquo;s
 disappearance, the agent had re-rented the two miserable rooms to an old hag-like
 creature known as Mother Margot. He had been aware of that before the Tocsin&rsquo;s
 note had reached him. But prior to that again Mother Margot had passed muster
 with the police, who had thereupon withdrawn their forces, considering further
 surveillance of the premises unnecessary and their hopes from that quarter
 at an end. But Mother Margot had not passed muster with him, in spite of the
 fact that his own investigation of the woman had resulted in the discovery
 that she was, and had been for a year, a licensed pushcart vendor, a sort of
 travelling dry goods emporium, who hawked her wares in that ultra-foreign quarter
 on Thompson Street, just off West Broadway, where she with a hundred others
 of her ilk cluttered the narrow street until it was well nigh impassable. He
 knew what the police did not know. He knew that Shiftel&rsquo;s rooms held
 a secret that the man whom he, as well as the Tocsin, had now come to call
 the Phantom would strive his utmost to protect by one means or another. And
 so he had watched Mother Margot because logic would not down. The Tocsin&rsquo;s
 note had but confirmed his suspicions; and though her warning had not gone
 utterly unheeded, and he had thereafter evaded the &ldquo;trap,&rdquo; he had
 kept even a still closer watch upon Mother Margot herself. For days at a stretch
 now he had lived as Smarlinghue&mdash;and that had brought him here to his
 errand to-night.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face hardened suddenly. His errand! It was dirty, miserable,
 pitiful work that he had partially uncovered. Sooner or later, he had made
 sure that Mother Margot would bring him into touch with others of the same
 breed who owned allegiance to the Phantom. And she had at last, to-night&mdash;for
 it was neither probable nor tenable to imagine that, serving the Phantom, she
 was allied with any other band, or permitted a divided interest. An hour ago
 he had followed her to the Wistaria Caf&eacute;, one of the lowest type of
 dance halls in the Bad Lands, where she had joined two men; one named Little
 Sweeney, a smooth-tongued, oily little rat, fastidious in his dress, and whom
 he, Jimmie Dale, already knew in the same sense as he knew by sight and name
 a hundred other crooks of greater or less degree; the other, whom they had
 addressed not inaptly as Limpy Mack, a stoop-shouldered, bent-over figure in
 peaked cap, with unkempt gray hair and moustache, who walked with a distinct
 limp and by the aid of a cane whose tip was heavily rubber-capped like a crutch,
 he did not know at all. From the dance hall proper the three had adjourned
 to a private room in the rear; and anticipating their arrival there by the
 matter of a few seconds, he, Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue then, had adjourned
 to the alleyway without, and the window raised an imperceptible crack, the
 roller shade raised an equally imperceptible space above the sill, had afforded
 both sight and hearing&mdash;that is, within limitations, in so far as hearing
 went. He had seen Little Sweeney hand the man who limped a paper which the
 latter had carefully tucked away in his pocket; and then, as a waiter came
 in and left a tray of glasses, the three had got their heads together around
 a table.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s brows furrowed now as he hurried along. Again and again
 the blare of the jazz band had drowned out their low tones. In the ten minutes
 during which he had crouched there outside the window, he had caught no more
 than snatches of their conversation; but those snatches had been viciously
 significant. His mind mulled them over again now; a half completed sentence
 from one, an interjection from another. It had begun with Mother Margot.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Mabbe dis Mrs. Kinsey person wid her tin-horn shop ain&rsquo;t got
 so much!&rdquo; she had cackled. &ldquo;Mabbe youse&rsquo;ll lose yer hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<p> After that a jumble of words from one or other of the three:</p>
<p> &ldquo;...Forget it!... Never banked a cent in her life.... Up in the thousands,
 that&rsquo;s what; else where&rsquo;s the insurance alone that was a couple
 of thousand when the old man bumped off two years ago?... The Chief never pulls
 a bone.... The old girl&rsquo;s as deaf as a church congregation.... She&rsquo;ll
 lead us to it.... Cop the sale to-night.... Sure, about bedtime.... No night-hawk,
 though.... You watch downstairs, I&rsquo;ll watch up....&rdquo;</p>
<p> In actual detail he had learned little; but in general he had learned enough
 to know that old Mrs. Kinsey was supposed to possess a hidden store of savings,
 whose hiding place they in some way expected to trick her into disclosing.
 The thought of the police had come to him; that he might in some way with safety
 and without involving his own personality warn the police, instead of playing
 a lone hand in this himself. He smiled a little wanly. There was one very good
 reason why he should not communicate with the police. This Little Sweeney and
 the man who limped offered new fields for investigation, widened his range
 of action, and were, indeed, a reward for the days and nights that he had hung
 upon Mother Margot&rsquo;s trail. They might, or they might not, lead to something
 tangible; but certainly, for the moment, he could not afford to see them in
 the toils of the police. The alternative was stark enough. He could not stand
 by inactive and see this miserable, sordid tragedy played out.</p>
<p> And so he had left the three in the back room of the Wistaria Caf&eacute;,
 and had hurried to the Sanctuary&mdash;and Smarlinghue had become Jimmie Dale.
 That was all. That was why he was here now, why he was approaching that little
 store on the corner ahead, which, early as the evening was, not more than nine
 o&rsquo;clock, had its modest show window already darkened for the night&mdash;he
 had not dared risk &ldquo;Smarlinghue&rdquo; here; Smarlinghue, whose position
 in the underworld, that had literally come to mean life and death to him again,
 would crumble to dust before the slightest breath of suspicion.</p>
<p> But his visit to the Sanctuary, imperative though it had been, had nevertheless
 taken time. Against this, however, was the fact that the Sanctuary was not
 hopelessly out of the direct road between the dance hall and Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s
 little shop; and, besides, he had hurried. He smiled a little grimly. They
 might, or they might not, have arrived before him; but, in any case, there
 would not have been time enough for them to have reached here, played out their
 game, and made their get-away. In that latter respect, at least, it was quite
 certain&mdash;the grim smile deepened&mdash;that he could not possibly be too
 late.</p>
<p> He had halted now on the edge of the curb, the intersecting side street between
 himself and the small, two-story frame house, where Mrs. Kinsey both lived
 and transacted her daily business. The house was in darkness, save for a lighted
 window in a lower, rear room that opened on the cross street. And for a moment
 he stood here, then suddenly he moved forward again&mdash;but this time along
 and across the side street itself until he stood directly beneath the lighted
 window. His question had been answered. Even from across the street, and muffled
 though it necessarily had been, his ear had caught the sound of a voice raised
 to an abnormal degree from the interior of the house; and now through the curtains
 of what was a small, plainly-furnished sitting room, he caught a glimpse of
 a faded little old white-haired woman, in a faded little old black dress, whose
 wrinkled face was strained in earnest attention as she strove to hear through
 a huge ear-trumpet. Little Sweeney was standing in front of her, his lips to
 the mouth of the trumpet.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I said you were never looking better, Mrs. Kinsey!&rdquo; bawled Little
 Sweeney.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale was gone.</p>
<p> A moment more, and he was standing nonchalantly at the door of the little
 shop. There was apparently no other entrance to the house, and if Mrs. Kinsey
 had admitted Little Sweeney as a caller, as appeared obvious, it must have
 been through the shop, and the door therefore, in spite of the shop itself
 being in darkness, should logically be unlocked. And being unlocked it would
 also have given entrance to one Limpy Mack and Mother Margot, who were both
 at the present moment undoubtedly hidden in the house.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch upstairs, you watch down,&rdquo; repeated Jimmie
 Dale softly to himself.</p>
<p> It was possible, though scarcely probable in view of the fact that Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s
 deafness practically offered the freedom of the house, that he might run into
 that <i>downstairs</i> watcher skulking here just inside the shop itself. Well, in
 that case&mdash;he glanced sharply up and down the street that for the moment
 held no near-by pedestrians&mdash;the play would come to a very sudden and
 abrupt end!</p>
<p> His back was turned to the street now. From a pocket in that curious leather
 girdle around his waist and under his outer garments he took out a black silk
 mask and adjusted it over his face. And now the slim, sensitive fingers pressed
 down the door latch without a sound. His logic had not been at fault. The door
 was unlocked. It began to open. Still there was no sound. And then Jimmie Dale,
 his hand snuggled over his automatic in the side pocket of his dinner coat,
 stood inside the shop with the door closed behind him.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
 Mother Margot</b></h2>
<p> No challenge questioned Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s entry&mdash;there was only the
 strident voice of Little Sweeney from the rear room. The shop itself, as he
 had expected, was not the vantage point chosen by either of Little Sweeney&rsquo;s
 two confederates.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stole forward to the rear of the shop, where through an open
 door there showed a glimmer of light, which, though it seemed to be strangely
 obstructed, evidently came from some sort of passage that connected the living
 quarters of the house with the shop; and here, slipping in behind the single
 counter that the shop boasted, he listened. Little Sweeney was still bawling
 at the top of his voice.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over for the last few days,&rdquo; said
 Little Sweeney.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Please speak a little louder.&rdquo; Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s voice came
 plaintively through the darkness.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; said Little Sweeney in low and fervent tones; and
 then in a veritable yell: &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d been thinking it over! Thinking
 it over! Our little talk, you know, of a few days ago, about buying out your
 confectionery business. I promised to come back and let you know what I was
 going to do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kinsey.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; shouted Little Sweeney, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to
 take a chance and buy it, and I&rsquo;ve brought you a hundred dollars to bind
 the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t think of selling it for a hundred dollars,&rdquo; protested
 Mrs. Kinsey feebly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Not SELLING it, just to bind the bargain,&rdquo; screamed Little Sweeney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
 give you the rest of the thousand when we sign the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Would you please speak a little louder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kinsey anxiously. &ldquo;Sometimes
 my hearing ain&rsquo;t quite so good as it used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep your secret!&rdquo; gritted Little Sweeney in a hoarse
 whisper; then full-lunged again: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a hundred-dollar bill.
 You don&rsquo;t even need to give me any receipt for it. I&rsquo;ll come across
 with the rest before the week&rsquo;s out. It&rsquo;s just to show that I&rsquo;m
 in earnest, and to keep anybody else from buying the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody else would buy it,&rdquo; said the old
 lady ingenuously.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said a mouthful!&rdquo; was Little Sweeney&rsquo;s <i>sotto
 voce</i> retort.</p>
<p> &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kinsey wistfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
 be so glad, because I can&rsquo;t move around as spry as once I could. And
 I was afraid I&rsquo;d&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go on with it much
 longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Mrs. Kinsey,&rdquo; bellowed Little Sweeney
 cordially. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re both satisfied with our bargain. Here&rsquo;s
 the money. And I guess I&rsquo;ll be moving along. I&rsquo;ll see you again
 in a day or so with the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Thank you very much indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kinsey earnestly. &ldquo;And
 I do so hope that you&rsquo;ll do well with it, and that you won&rsquo;t lose
 anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p> A chair scraped. Footsteps came from the back passageway, which, as Jimmie
 Dale crouched lower behind the counter, suddenly grew light. A moment more
 and Little Sweeney stepped into the shop, making for the front door; behind
 him followed Mrs. Kinsey, carrying in one hand a lamp, and clutched in the
 other her ear-trumpet and a <i>hundred-dollar</i> bill.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips set grimly. Back in the corridor that was now darkened
 again he thought he saw a shadow move; he distinctly caught the sound of a
 footstep. The downstairs watcher&mdash;and Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s hundred-dollar
 bill! It was quite clear now, the whole mean, sordid, contemptible business.
 The bait was cunning enough in a low, vicious way; amply cunning enough to
 succeed with a trusting, simple old woman already on the verge of her dotage.
 Where Mrs. Kinsey, who distrusted banks, had secreted her savings of years,
 she would secret a hundred-dollar bill.</p>
<p> Little Sweeney&mdash;in lieu, no doubt, of shouting on the street&mdash;bowed
 himself out politely.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kinsey. &ldquo;And thank you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She closed and locked the door, and came back through the shop, passing again
 into the rear hallway.</p>
<p> As the light receded, Jimmie Dale rose cautiously. Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s lamp,
 as she had passed, disclosed the fact that just beyond the rear door of the
 shop, the passageway made a jut at right angles. He nodded tersely to himself
 as he gained this with the trained step, so silent as to be almost uncanny,
 that had mocked at even the creaky boards of the old Sanctuary, and, in the
 shadows himself now, he peered along the hallway proper.</p>
<p> Steep, narrow stairs, to the left and a little way down the hall, led to
 the upper story. Mrs. Kinsey, still carrying her lamp, still clutching at her
 ear-trumpet and the hundred-dollar bill, was already near the top. The lower
 portion of the stairs and the hall itself, since her body shaded the lamp,
 were in almost complete darkness.</p>
<p> And then from somewhere above there came a sharp, whispered interrogation:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p> From along the lower hall, her figure shrouded in the blackness, a woman&rsquo;s
 voice answered:</p>
<p> &ldquo;She&rsquo;s still got it. Watch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot! Limpy Mack, then, was the upstairs watcher. There seemed something
 incongruous in this passage of words between the two, like a stage aside that
 was not supposed to be heard by the intervening figure of the old woman who
 was climbing the stairs; but it was not the incongruity in itself, it was the
 callous brutality, the vulture-like preying upon helpless infirmity, that hardened
 Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face now in a sort of merciless intentness.</p>
<p> Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s light disappeared around the landing at the head of the
 stairs, and then, contemptuous of any exaggerated attempt at silence, another
 footstep sounded on the stair treads. Jimmie Dale could not see, it was pitch
 black in the lower hall now, but it was not necessary to <i>see</i> the obvious. Mother
 Margot was following Mrs. Kinsey upstairs.</p>
<p> And now there came the sound as of some one walking about in a room overhead
 for a moment or so, and then silence.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved toward the stairs, and without a sound began to make his
 way upward. Halfway up he paused, and stood tight-pressed against the wall.
 He could just detect a glow of light filtering into the upper hallway, as though
 the door of a lighted room, almost directly above his head, stood open into
 the hall. Then a footstep and still another, starting from a position further
 back along the hall, moved toward the lighted doorway. Came then the sound
 as of a piece of furniture being moved on squeaky casters; and then a low-breathed,
 exultant oath in a man&rsquo;s voice, followed by a woman&rsquo;s vicious chuckle.
 He could almost discern the outlines of two figures there&mdash;Mother Margot
 and Limpy Mack.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Pipe de lay!&rdquo; chuckled Mother Margot. &ldquo;Dere goes Little
 Sweeney&rsquo;s century buck. Look at her saltin&rsquo; it!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Close your trap!&rdquo; ordered Limpy Mack sharply. &ldquo;Maybe she
 can&rsquo;t hear, but that&rsquo;s no reason for taking a chance of spilling
 the beans now we know where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, forget it! Youse gives me a pain!&rdquo; retorted Mother Margot
 acidly, but in a nevertheless more subdued tone. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;d have
 to write her a letter to tell her youse was makin&rsquo; a noise before she&rsquo;d
 be wise to it, an&rsquo; mabbe den she wouldn&rsquo;t believe youse!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Shut your face!&rdquo; said Limpy Mack tersely.</p>
<p> The sound of what had seemed to Jimmie Dale like squeaky casters came again,
 then a footstep traversed the lighted room, a door&mdash;obviously one connecting
 with an adjoining room&mdash;opened and closed again, and the light was gone.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; prompted Mother Margot&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s
 her bedroom she&rsquo;s gone into. It&rsquo;s all clear now. Wot&rsquo;re youse
 waitin&rsquo; for?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting till the old bird&rsquo;s tucked away in bed,&rdquo; Limpy
 Mack&rsquo;s voice answered out of the darkness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting till
 there isn&rsquo;t any chance of her moseying out for anything just as we&rsquo;re
 tapping the crib. I haven&rsquo;t noticed that there was anything the matter
 with her <i>eyes</i>; and she&rsquo;s not so <i>dumb</i> but that she might start something
 in the neighbourhood. I don&rsquo;t play the fool when I can play safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; echoed Mother Margot sarcastically. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s
 safer dan dis de way it is now? I wanter get home. Youse ought to go down to
 an antique dump an&rsquo; buy yerself a suit of armour, an&rsquo; walk around
 in dat. Youse&rsquo;d look fine&mdash;an&rsquo; youse&rsquo;d always be safe.
 De pip, dat&rsquo;s wot I&rsquo;m contractin&rsquo; from youse!&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was no answer.</p>
<p> Mother Margot grunted contemptuously, and relapsed into silence.</p>
<p> The minutes passed. There was utter silence now in the house, save for an
 occasional uneasy movement of one or other of the two watchers in the hall
 above Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stood in grim patience, close against the wall, still on the
 stairs, an integral part of the shadows around him. The time dragged interminably,
 the minutes seeming to expand into endless hours. And then suddenly Limpy Mack&rsquo;s
 voice broke the silence in a tense undertone:</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right! Her light&rsquo;s out. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p> There came then the sound of footsteps receding from the hall; and Jimmie
 Dale in an instant silently gained the head of the stairs, and lay there crouched,
 half on the landing and half on the topmost treads. From his position, slightly
 diagonal though it was from where he had placed the door, he had calculated
 he would be able to see clearly enough into the room that Mother Margot and
 her companion had obviously just entered. He nodded now in quick self-corroboration.
 Out of the darkness of the room, lancing it in a little white shaft of light,
 there came the ray of an electric torch, and two figures were outlined as they
 bent over a piece of furniture that stood against the far wall, and that looked
 like an old chest of drawers. But there was no squeak of casters now. Jimmie
 Dale smiled uninvitingly. They were becoming unduly cautious! The piece of
 furniture was being lifted, not rolled, until it stood out from the wall, the
 back of it exposed.</p>
<p> For a moment the two figures leaned over it, the flashlight playing on the
 back of the dresser; and then from its extreme edge, what looked like a very
 narrow drawer, its depth almost half of the dresser itself, was pulled out.</p>
<p> &ldquo;S&rsquo;help me!&rdquo; Mother Margot&rsquo;s voice quivered in curious,
 sibilant excitement. &ldquo;Say, de old skirt&rsquo;s rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;<i>Was</i>,&rdquo; corrected Limpy Mack&rsquo;s voice curtly. &ldquo;Keep
 your paws off! We&rsquo;ll make the split to-morrow. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll
 take care of it. See? Hold the flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; sniffed Mother Margot. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;re de only
 honest one in de bunch. I know &rsquo;cause Little Sweeney told me!&rdquo;</p>
<p> A man&rsquo;s hand dipped into the projecting drawer, disappeared nearly
 up to the elbow, and came out again with a fistful of banknotes which he stuffed
 into his pocket. Again the man plunged in his hand. Jimmie Dale rose to his
 feet, took a step forward&mdash;and halted abruptly, as Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 voice suddenly shrilled out tensely through the silence:</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd! Listen! Wot&rsquo;s dat? Over by de door!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s jaws clamped together, as his automatic swung up into
 line. Strange! He could have sworn he had not made the slightest sound. He
 saw Limpy Mack step forward a pace and stand facing the doorway, listening
 intently. And then Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face relaxed. Behind Limpy Mack&rsquo;s
 back Mother Margot&rsquo;s hand shot stealthily into the drawer, and a wad
 of bills disappeared stealthily inside her blouse. Once more she helped herself.</p>
<p> With a queer, grim droop to the corners of his mouth, Jimmie Dale retreated
 suddenly back along the hall, and a little beyond the head of the stairs. Mother
 Margot! The gods were good! There would be more in the night after all than
 the mere salvaging of old Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s savings. He had no intention
 now of interrupting the two at their work! Mother Margot had wrought a very
 drastic change in his plans!</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear anything!&rdquo; Limpy Mack&rsquo;s voice growled
 after a moment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; de creeps,&rdquo; Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 voice replied. &ldquo;I t&rsquo;ought I heard somethin&rsquo; creak, but I
 guess it was de wind. Hurry up, Limpy! I wanter get out of dis. I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; de
 creeps, dat&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s de matter wid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Perhaps another two minutes passed, and then Jimmie Dale, far back along
 the hall now, heard the footsteps of the two coming from the room. At the head
 of the stairs they paused, and Limpy Mack spoke gruffly:</p>
<p> &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to take the chance of being seen leaving here
 together. You&rsquo;re safe enough, because if any one saw you, they&rsquo;d
 think you were just a friend of the old dame. You wait here, give me five minutes,
 then beat it yourself. And you go straight home! You&rsquo;ll get what&rsquo;s
 coming to you to-morrow after the Chief&rsquo;s made the split. We don&rsquo;t
 meet again to-night unless something breaks, and in that case you know where
 to find me. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled quietly in the darkness. He owed Limpy Mack thanks for
 that, at least&mdash;it would save him from following Mother Margot.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; mocked Mother Margot. &ldquo;Cookin&rsquo; a pill in
 yer dump under Sen Yat&rsquo;s! Why don&rsquo;t youse come across wid de price
 of a bunk, an&rsquo; give de Chink a chance once in a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Limpy Mack, without answer, descended the stairs. From the lower hall, faintly,
 there came the soft <i>tap-tap</i> of his rubber-tipped cane. Presently the shop door
 opened and closed gently.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved silently forward. He could just distinguish Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 figure as a dark blur at the head of the stairs. She, too, now began to descend.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale spoke.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you company downstairs, Mother Margot,&rdquo; he said
 softly&mdash;and the flashlight in his hand, stabbing suddenly through the
 darkness, played its ray upon her.</p>
<p> She whirled with a low, terrified cry, and put her hands before her blinking
 eyes as though to ward off a blow.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dat? Who&rsquo;re youse?&rdquo; she cried out.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Go on, Mother Margot&mdash;downstairs,&rdquo; Jimmie Dale prompted
 more brusquely.</p>
<p> She obeyed in a stumbling, uncertain way.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd! My Gawd!&rdquo; she mumbled wildly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;re youse?
 A dick? I ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo;! I swear to Gawd, I ain&rsquo;t! I
 swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; interrupted Jimmie Dale coolly, as they reached the
 lower hall. &ldquo;But perhaps you will come across just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She stared at the hand which he had extended significantly in the flashlight&rsquo;s
 glow, and from under a bedraggled hat whose brim flapped over her straggling
 gray hair and fell into her eyes, she blinked again; she drew the old threadbare
 black shawl she wore closer around her shoulders, and clutched at it where
 it met at her neck.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I dunno wot youse mean,&rdquo; she croaked hoarsely. &ldquo;Come
 across wid wot?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;With what Limpy Mack <i>didn&rsquo;t get</i>.&rdquo; Jimmie Dale was biting
 off his words now. &ldquo;There <i>was</i> somebody at the door, even if you didn&rsquo;t
 hear him. I can use that money myself that you put inside your blouse. And
 I&rsquo;m waiting&mdash;also I&rsquo;m in a hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse ain&rsquo;t a dick, den!&rdquo; She seemed relieved in the
 sense that rage and fury now supplanted fear. She snarled at him. &ldquo;Why
 didn&rsquo;t youse touch Limpy? I only got a dollar or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten Limpy,&rdquo; Jimmie Dale answered evenly.
 His hand was still extended. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he snapped suddenly.</p>
<p> For an instant she hesitated, then snarling again, she felt inside her blouse
 and brought out a few crumpled banknotes.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale thrust the money into his pocket&mdash;and extended his hand
 again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; she announced tartly. &ldquo;Wot d&rsquo;youse
 expect? I didn&rsquo;t have no chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled thinly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Loosen the waistband of your blouse!&rdquo; he ordered sharply.</p>
<p> She glared at him fiercely.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she shrilled out. &ldquo;Youse can go to blazes!
 I told youse dat was all. I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, yes; I think you will,&rdquo; returned Jimmie Dale grimly. &ldquo;When
 I leave you I am going to call on your friend Limpy Mack, and if I explain
 the double cross you put over on him, I imagine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> She changed front instantly. Fear seemed to have her in its grip again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse won&rsquo;t do dat!&rdquo; She was whimpering suddenly. &ldquo;My
 Gawd, youse won&rsquo;t do dat!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Den take it!&rdquo; she mumbled in a frenzied way&mdash;and from the
 loosened blouse a small shower of banknotes fluttered to the floor.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stooped and gathered them up.</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better!&rdquo; he observed coolly. &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll
 go a little further, Mother Margot. I want quite a lot of information. First,
 this Limpy Mack&rsquo;s dump, as you called it on the stairs. Does he live
 there alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, my Gawd!&rdquo; She was wringing her hands together in terror. &ldquo;Youse
 ain&rsquo;t still goin&rsquo; dere, are youse? Youse ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
 tell him, are youse? He&rsquo;d pass de word along, an&rsquo; if de Chief got
 wise dey&rsquo;d bump me off for dis. I&mdash;dey&rsquo;d clean me up before
 de mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;So I imagined,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale calmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
 why I refrained from any interference upstairs. You see, Mother Margot, I rather
 think we have become indispensable to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I dunno wot youse mean,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I mean this,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale coldly, &ldquo;that if you play
 straight with me, you are safe in so far as what you put over on your precious
 pals is concerned. Otherwise&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Is
 it quite plain?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot licked her lips feverishly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dey&rsquo;d cut me t&rsquo;roat!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s
 wot dey&rsquo;d do. Wot do youse want? I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got no chance,
 have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;We started with Limpy Mack, and we&rsquo;ll finish with him first,&rdquo; said
 Jimmie Dale tersely; &ldquo;though you&rsquo;ve just mentioned something much
 more important. Well, does he live alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure, he lives alone,&rdquo; Mother Margot answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
 got de basement&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Under Sen Yat&rsquo;s,&rdquo; completed Jimmie Dale smoothly. &ldquo;All
 right! Now, the really important matter. This Chief you mentioned&mdash;who
 is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s voice hardened. &ldquo;That
 won&rsquo;t do, Mother Margot! I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to try another trick
 to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she protested wildly. &ldquo;Honest to Gawd,
 I ain&rsquo;t! I dunno!&rdquo; She was wringing her hands together again. &ldquo;He
 ain&rsquo;t nobody, he&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;she glanced furtively around her,
 the act seemingly almost subconscious&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s
 just a voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale studied her for a moment. The woman was evidently too frightened
 to be anything but truthful.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, go on!&rdquo; he prodded.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all I knows about him,&rdquo; said Mother Margot fearfully. &ldquo;Just
 a voice over de telephone dat youse&rsquo;re always wise to &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s
 a kind of a queer, thick voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Is that the way you get your orders, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot nodded assent.</p>
<p> &ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any telephone in your room,&rdquo; said Jimmie
 Dale sharply. &ldquo;I happen to know that you&rsquo;ve just moved in where
 another pal of yours, Mr. Isaac Shiftel, used to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot swallowed hard. She drew back a little.</p>
<p> &ldquo;How&rsquo;d youse know?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Never mind! How about that telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t done in de room,&rdquo; she said tremulously. &ldquo;I
 didn&rsquo;t know anythin&rsquo; about to-night at all. Den dis afternoon w&rsquo;en
 I was wid my pushcart down on Thompson Street I&rsquo;m called into a store
 to de telephone, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;What store? Where is this telephone?&rdquo; Jimmie Dale interrupted
 tersely.</p>
<p> She hesitated.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s in a booth in de back room of Mezzo&rsquo;s second-hand
 store, if youse&rsquo;ve got to know,&rdquo; she blurted out.</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, I was called to de telephone,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; told
 to go to de Wistaria Caf&eacute; to-night an&rsquo; meet Limpy Mack.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;And Little Sweeney,&rdquo; added Jimmie Dale quietly; then abruptly: &ldquo;Who
 else is in this gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again Mother Margot shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I dunno dem all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I guess we don&rsquo;t all
 know each other neither. I only know Limpy Mack an&rsquo; Shiftel, an&rsquo; a
 man named Laroque; but I ain&rsquo;t seen neither of dem last two for weeks,
 an&rsquo; I dunno where dey&rsquo;ve gone. Little Sweeney was a new one on
 me to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; observed Jimmie Dale curtly. &ldquo;Then who fixed
 it for you to move into Shiftel&rsquo;s rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;The Voice,&rdquo; she replied readily. &ldquo;I was told to go an&rsquo; hand
 de agent de rent in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale pleasantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting
 on, Mother Margot; and since you and I have become such friends, I&rsquo;m
 going to take the liberty of calling on you in a day or so&mdash;unless perhaps
 you can tell me how, well, say, a man like Shiftel can get in or out of those
 rooms without bothering himself with either doors or windows?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She drew still farther back, a startled look and a new terror in her face.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I know who youse are now,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Little Sweeney
 an&rsquo; Limpy was talkin&rsquo; about youse. Youse are de Gray Seal! My Gawd!&rdquo; She
 wrung her hands. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t youse come dere! I&rsquo;m playin&rsquo; straight
 wid youse. I don&rsquo;t know why, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; phoney
 about de rooms, but I knows dat&rsquo;s wot dey wants youse to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again Jimmie Dale studied the dishevelled and distraught creature.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;so I believe, and I believe you
 are playing straight. Well, we&rsquo;ll leave the rooms in abeyance for the
 time being. I shall always know where to find you&mdash;on Thompson Street.
 You may be called to the phone by <i>another</i> voice. Now, one thing more, Mother
 Margot&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to keep Limpy Mack waiting! What was that paper
 Little Sweeney gave Limpy Mack in the back room of the Wistaria to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse&mdash;youse know about dat, too?&rdquo; She stared at him in
 terrified amazement.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; repeated Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dey didn&rsquo;t let me see it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some sort
 of dope about de gang, I guess, &rsquo;cause Little Sweeney was a new man.
 Little Sweeney just says, &lsquo;I got it pat,&rsquo; he says, w&rsquo;en he
 hands it over. I dunno wot was in it; dey didn&rsquo;t let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Perhaps Limpy will be more considerate with me,&rdquo; observed Jimmie
 Dale dryly. He motioned along the hall, switched off the flashlight, and taking
 Mother Margot&rsquo;s arm, led her into the shop. &ldquo;You go home now,&rdquo; he
 ordered.</p>
<p> She hesitated. His hand still on her arm, he felt her shiver.</p>
<p> &ldquo;If youse&mdash;youse&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to Limpy Mack&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she
 quavered, &ldquo;youse&mdash;youse won&rsquo;t split on me? Swear youse won&rsquo;t!
 Dey&mdash;dey&rsquo;d kill me before de mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale gruffly. &ldquo;As
 long as you play straight with me, it&rsquo;s as much to my interest as yours
 to see that no harm comes to you. You&rsquo;re out of this. The only person
 I know is Limpy Mack, whom I saw come out of here alone&mdash;understand?&mdash;and
 I followed him because I thought perhaps he had made a little haul that&mdash;since
 you&rsquo;ve saved me introducing myself&mdash;the Gray Seal could use himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; She was whimpering again. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
 afraid. Youse swear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale opened the door, and with a precautionary glance up and down
 the street, pushed her not ungently out into the night.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-night, Mother Margot.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
 The Man With The Rubber-Tipped Cane</b></h2>
<p> The black silk mask gone from his face, Jimmie Dale too stepped out of Mrs.
 Kinsey&rsquo;s little shop, and hurried away&mdash;but in an opposite direction
 to that taken by Mother Margot. And now he smiled as he went along. To-morrow,
 if he had luck, Mrs. Kinsey would get her money back, all of it, say by registered
 mail, and accompanied by a suggestion that she would be better advised to use
 a bank hereafter; a suggestion which fright at the discovery of her loss would
 probably have the salutary effect of causing her to act upon without loss of
 time!</p>
<p> He hurried on&mdash;and ten minutes later, deep in the Chinese quarter, in
 the neighbourhood of Chatham Square, in a narrow, crooked, evil-smelling, little
 street, in fact more an alleyway than a thoroughfare, he was strolling past
 the entrance of a shuttered tea store that bore the sign: SEN YAT. Again he
 smiled a little to himself&mdash;but now from a different cause. It was quite
 true that Sen Yat dealt in tea; but it was equally true that upstairs behind
 the shutters Sen Yat also specialised in another commodity of the East, and
 to those who had the price and were &ldquo;safe&rdquo; the sorry solace of
 the poppy was always at instant command.</p>
<p> An old and unkempt woman, mumbling to herself, shuffled by. A Chinaman, like
 a rat taking to its hole, disappeared down a basement entrance from the sidewalk
 a few yards away. Jimmie Dale turned suddenly. The street for the moment was
 clear. He retraced his steps to another basement entrance, the one below Sen
 Yat&rsquo;s, and out of the darkness of which, as he had previously passed
 by, a crack of light seeping from under the door sill had already informed
 him that Limpy Mack had returned home.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale was gone from the street&mdash;and down the half dozen
 steps was crouching in the blackness below the sidewalk at Limpy Mack&rsquo;s
 door. Again the silk mask was slipped over his face; again his fingers sought
 a pocket in the little leather girdle&mdash;and the next instant were silently
 and deftly at work with a pick-lock.</p>
<p> Perhaps a minute passed. Then Jimmie Dale straightened up, swung the door
 open, and like a flash was inside the room with the door closed behind him.</p>
<p> A startled oath greeted his entrance. Limpy Mack, peaked cap drawn over his
 eyes, was seated at a table on which burned an oil lamp. His heavy, rubber-tipped
 cane also lay across the table. He snatched at this now in lieu of a sheaf
 of banknotes which he let fall from his hands, and which he had evidently been
 engaged in counting&mdash;and rose, half threateningly, half defensively, to
 his feet.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale pleasantly. &ldquo;I seem to
 be in luck to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> His automatic indicated the sheaf of notes, and then held on Limpy Mack.
 Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s glance swept swiftly, critically around the place. Its
 furnishings were few and of the crudest; a bed in one corner, near a second
 door that conveniently opened on the back yard no doubt; a washstand minus
 one leg, and therefore askew, that boasted a streaked and badly blistered mirror;
 the table and chair in front of the washstand; a dirty, unswept floor, bare
 of carpet&mdash;and that was all. The place reeked with filth.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Nice quiet little resort you&rsquo;ve got here,&rdquo; smiled Jimmie
 Dale. His eyes were apparently roving again about the cellar-like room, apparently
 everywhere save on Limpy Mack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&mdash;<i>drop that!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p> A revolver, almost free from Limpy Mack&rsquo;s pocket, fell with a clatter
 to the floor. The man screamed out in rage.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Why, Limpy, that&rsquo;s raw,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale in a pained
 way. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d fall for it. All I wanted was
 your gun.&rdquo; He advanced to the table, and kicked the weapon across the
 floor under the bed.</p>
<p> There was a sudden <i>swish</i> through the air, as, quick without warning, Limpy
 Mack aimed a blow with his cane at Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s wrist and automatic.
 It missed. Again the man screamed out in fury.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face set.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t raise your voice again like that,&rdquo; he said in flat
 tones. &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; His automatic swung to the level of the other&rsquo;s
 eyes.</p>
<p> With a snarl, Limpy Mack subsided into the chair. He scowled at Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who are you, anyway, you damned thug?&rdquo; he demanded thickly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. He was smiling whimsically
 now&mdash;not at Limpy Mack, but at the somewhat exacting demands of the situation
 in which he found himself. Mother Margot must in no way appear in this; and,
 besides that money on the table, there was the paper that Little Sweeney had
 given to Limpy Mack in Mother Margot&rsquo;s presence&mdash;a paper, in reference
 to the contents of which, he, Jimmie Dale, had acquired an intense curiosity.
 Ostensibly, therefore, he must appear&mdash;in order that no thought of Mother
 Margot might by any chance enter the other&rsquo;s mind&mdash;to be ignorant
 of even the existence of the paper, and yet, at the same time, get hold of
 it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;I was walking
 down a certain street to-night, and I saw you sneak out of a little confectionery
 store that looked as though it had all been closed up for the night, and I
 said to myself: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s funny, because Limpy Mack never plays for
 chicken feed.&rsquo; And then I went and read the sign on the window, and I
 remembered that everybody said Mrs. Kinsey had a well-filled stocking hidden
 away somewhere. So I just took a chance, Limpy, thinking that maybe you&rsquo;d
 found it, and I followed you. And as I said before, I seem to have played in
 luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; growled Limpy Mack. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t
 Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s, or anybody else&rsquo;s money. It&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to know it,&rdquo; murmured Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;But
 even so, I still insist that I am in luck to-night. There must be quite a few
 thousand here.&rdquo; He began to thrust the bills into his pockets.</p>
<p> Limpy Mack sat crouched down in his chair, the posture seeming to accentuate
 almost to deformity his stooped shoulders.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he shrieked out. He gnawed at his unkempt gray moustache,
 and flung another oath at Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale swept the table clean. It was obviously all that Limpy Mack had
 stolen from Mrs. Kinsey, for he would obviously have had it <i>all</i> out to count
 it&mdash;but there was still a certain paper in Limpy Mack&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;since you say it was yours&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t
 got some more,&rdquo; suggested Jimmie Dale invitingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
 I&rsquo;ll have to trouble you to turn your pockets out, Limpy. Stand up!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got any more.&rdquo; The man seemed suddenly
 cowed. He crouched still lower in his chair.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; repeated Jimmie Dale sternly. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m
 quite sure you have!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Limpy Mack was whining now. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell
 you the truth. I got it where you said. But that&rsquo;s all&mdash;all of it
 was on the table. Say, you believe me, don&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;d come across
 if I had any more, wouldn&rsquo;t I? I couldn&rsquo;t help myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The man was blatantly stalling now. The paper was&mdash;<i>no, it wasn&rsquo;t
 on account of the paper</i>. Behind Limpy Mack&rsquo;s back something showed in
 the blistered mirror&mdash;the head and shoulders of Little Sweeney protruding
 through the rear doorway, and in Little Sweeney&rsquo;s hand a levelled revolver.
 Limpy Mack&rsquo;s voice had drowned out any sound made by the opening of the
 door, if, indeed, there had been any sound at all.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s brain was working in lightning flashes now, but not a
 muscle of his face moved. His automatic dangling in his hand was useless. To
 swing it on the door with only a chance aim would be but the signal for Little
 Sweeney to fire.</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right, Limpy,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, and leaned slightly toward
 the end of the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale was in action. With a sweep of his hand he sent the
 lamp crashing from the table to the floor, and ducked instantly to one side.</p>
<p> There was a yell from Limpy Mack; and, in the sudden darkness as the lamp
 went out, from the doorway came the tongue-flame of Little Sweeney&rsquo;s
 revolver and the roar of the report. Then a rush of feet, the flash and roar
 of the revolver again, and the next instant Jimmie Dale was locked in a hand
 to hand struggle with Little Sweeney. Here and there they swayed, the breath
 of one, panting, hard, on the other&rsquo;s cheek; the table toppled to the
 floor, carrying the chair with it; their feet crunched on the splintered glass
 from the lamp and chimney&mdash;and then suddenly Jimmie Dale reeled from a
 terrific blow across the head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I got him!&rdquo; screamed Limpy Mack&rsquo;s voice exultantly. &ldquo;I
 got him, Sweeney! I beaned him with the loaded handle of my cane.&rdquo;</p>
<p> But though dazed, lurching, scarcely able to keep his feet, Jimmie Dale was
 still fighting like a wildcat. Twice since Little Sweeney had grappled with
 him, he had managed to strike the other with the butt of his automatic. He
 had only one chance now&mdash;to end it quickly&mdash;he was too nearly gone
 himself. He wrenched himself suddenly free, and swung again with all his strength.
 A gurgling voice&mdash;Little Sweeney&rsquo;s&mdash;answered the blow:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Look out&mdash;Limpy&mdash;beat it&mdash;you know why&mdash;that paper&mdash;beat
 it&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again and again Jimmie Dale brushed his hand across his eyes. He fought desperately
 to clear his brain. His head was sick and dizzy. What was that sound, that
 strange, queer sound? <i>Tap, tap, tap!</i> Little Sweeney&mdash;that black outline
 on the floor was Little Sweeney&mdash;Little Sweeney wouldn&rsquo;t trouble
 any one for an hour or so&mdash;but that <i>tap, tap, tap</i>&mdash;it sounded from
 the direction of the rear door. And now it was gone, and there was silence&mdash;just
 silence. But the silence, as nothing else had done, seemed now to penetrate
 Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s swimming head, and seemed to bring with it a sudden, swift
 significance.</p>
<p> Fool! He stumbled madly toward the rear door. Limpy Mack was gone&mdash;gone
 with the <i>tap, tap, tapping</i> of his cane. That paper! A clue to that super-crook
 perhaps, that the Tocsin called the Phantom, and Mother Margot called the Voice!</p>
<p> He was outside now. No, not too late! That was Limpy Mack there, wasn&rsquo;t
 it? That figure running, running! God, how his brain swam! His knees seemed
 weak under him, as though they were going to double up like the blades of a
 knife&mdash;but he was running too. His surroundings seemed mechanically, subconsciously,
 to be absorbed&mdash;just a back yard that ended in the black, irregular outline
 of the rear of what was evidently a three or four-story tenement.</p>
<p> On Jimmie Dale stumbled. He could not be more than ten or fifteen yards behind
 that figure ahead, which, to his whirling brain, seemed to take on the aspect
 of some grotesque jumping-jack, bobbing up and down in the darkness, until
 suddenly it disappeared through the back door of the tenement.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale prodded himself into a spurt, reached the tenement door, found
 it open, and reeled inside. His faculties seemed miserably unreliable. Couldn&rsquo;t
 he <i>think</i> any more! He stood stock still, and again his hand swept fiercely across
 his eyes. The man couldn&rsquo;t have gone out of the front door, nor have
 gained the landing above, because he, Jimmie Dale, had been too close at the
 other&rsquo;s heels, and would have heard him, would be hearing him now. And
 there was not a sound&mdash;nothing but pitch, inky blackness. Therefore Limpy
 Mack must be somewhere here in the blackness.</p>
<p> That was better! At least his brain was striving to fight its way back to
 normal. But his eyes ached brutally. He bit his lips to keep back a groan of
 pain, and leaned against the wall for support. One of them, he or Limpy Mack,
 must sooner or later make a move. He forced a twisted smile. If the blow from
 the loaded cane had not proved too much for him after all, it would not be
 he who made that move!</p>
<p> And now, after a time, where he had heard no sound before, he became conscious
 of many sounds&mdash;the low indistinct sound of muffled things, the night
 sounds of a tenanted building filtering vaguely out from behind closed doors
 only to integrate themselves in a queer, throbbing way into the very silence
 itself. How long had he been standing here? Once he clutched frantically, but
 noiselessly, at the wall to keep himself erect. Perhaps it would not be Limpy
 Mack who moved first! His brain was swimming in that sick, nauseating way again.
 Perhaps it would be&mdash;</p>
<p> A door began to open cautiously a few yards along the hall. And then a man&rsquo;s
 head and shoulders, a man with a clean shaven face and slouch hat showing quite
 distinctly in the lighted doorway, was thrust out. The man peered around; then
 from the threshold he whispered back into the room:</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch he thought you beat it straight out through the
 front door, and went out after you. I&rsquo;ll take a look, and if he&rsquo;s
 still hanging around outside I&rsquo;ll spot him. You keep under cover, Limpy.
 You&rsquo;re safe here anyway. I&rsquo;ll be back in ten minutes. Savvy?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The man, a broad-shouldered, well set-up fellow, stepped out into the hall,
 and closed the door behind him. His footsteps echoed back as he walked rapidly
 toward the front of the tenement; then the front door opened and closed again;
 the footsteps rang faintly from the pavement without, died away&mdash;and Jimmie
 Dale was standing before the door of the room.</p>
<p> He had not heard the door being locked. He was sure of that, in spite of
 the fact that his head was whirling like a top. His fingers closed silently
 on the doorknob&mdash;and with a swift movement, standing in the hall, his
 automatic thrown forward, he flung the door wide open.</p>
<p> And then for a moment he stood there like a man stunned. The room was empty.
 No, not empty! Dangling from the gas-jet hung Limpy Mack&rsquo;s rubber-tipped
 cane; and stuck upon the cane, flaunting itself in grim, ironical, mocking
 challenge&mdash;<i>was a diamond-shaped gray paper seal</i>.</p>
<p> A smile of understanding, bitter in its chagrin, flickered across Jimmie
 Dale&rsquo;s lips. He had stuck a gray seal on the back of Shiftel&rsquo;s
 hand that night two weeks ago. This one, he was sure, could have come from
 nowhere else; and, if that were so, then Shiftel, and Gentleman Laroque, and
 Limpy Mack, and Limpy Mack in still another guise, in the guise of the man
 who had just tricked him so neatly, were all one. And from that encounter in
 Shiftel&rsquo;s rooms, and one other encounter long before that at Niccolo
 Sonnino&rsquo;s place, Gentleman Laroque, alias Isaac Shiftel, in the character
 of Limpy Mack to-night, had known that he was dealing with the Gray Seal from
 the moment his room under Sen Yat&rsquo;s had been entered&mdash;could not
 help but have known it. And at the last here, the man, being then disarmed,
 had had no choice but to resort to his wits as the only means of escape. Yes,
 he, Jimmie Dale, quite understood!</p>
<p> He had sought, and found, and lost again&mdash;the Phantom.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
 The Message</b></h2>
<p> Days of searching! Days of futility! Days that had brought no reward! Since
 the night of Limpy Mack&rsquo;s disappearance there had been only failure.
 Nowhere had he been able to pick up again a thread or clue that would set him
 once more upon the Phantom&rsquo;s trail&mdash;until to-night. And to-night?
 Jimmie Dale shook his head. He was at sea, troubled&mdash;about to-night.</p>
<p> Threadbare, gaunt-cheeked, dissolute in appearance, his battered old felt
 hat pulled down over his eyes, he was slouching now, as Smarlinghue, with apparent
 aimlessness along the street. Past him, going to and fro, other figures shuffled
 by&mdash;for the most part Chinamen, their crossed hands tucked in the sleeves
 of their blouses. A slumming party from a &ldquo;gape-wagon&rdquo; disembarked
 its load of candidates for initiation into those most dark, drear, shivery
 and hidden things of Chinatown, whose storied mysteries in this more enlightened
 generation were now within the reach of all&mdash;for the insignificant sum
 of one dollar a ticket!</p>
<p> A twisted smile flickered across Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips. This jostling
 little crowd that was being herded into line now by the stentorian voiced barker
 would see many things, for the stage was always set. They would see most fearsome
 opium dens that reeked with the sickly sweetish smell of poppy, where no poppy
 was; they would see the worshippers at the Shrine of the Thousandth Ancestor;
 they would see the council chambers where the Tong wars were declared, and
 most ghastly murders hatched; they would see the Chinamen at their fan-tan;
 and&mdash;Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders&mdash;they would undeniably get
 their money&rsquo;s worth. It was quite innocent, and everybody would be satisfied;
 but into Hip Foo&rsquo;s, for instance, where he was going now, from whose
 tortuous, bunk-lined, connecting sub-cellars there were two exits separated
 one from the other by almost a block, and again from the entrance by an entirely
 different street, their tickets would not take them. Hip Foo made no money
 from the gape-wagons!</p>
<p> The scene, though it was still before him, was gone from his consciousness
 as quickly as the train of thought that had obtruded itself upon him, and his
 mind was instantly back again now on the note that had been laid beside his
 plate by one of the attendants at the St. James Club, where he had been dining
 but little more than half an hour ago. The note had contained a single sentence&mdash;in
 the Tocsin&rsquo;s writing:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Watch Mother Margot&mdash;at Hip Foo&rsquo;s to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> His lips closed tightly. Was there anything beneath the surface of that one
 sentence, anything more than its actual wording, anything of a <i>personal</i> nature?
 He had been turning it over and over in his mind from the moment he had received
 it, even while he had hurried to the Sanctuary and from a millionaire clubman
 had become the drug-wrecked Smarlinghue, even now again as he walked here along
 this none too well lighted and unsavory street in the heart of New York&rsquo;s
 Chinatown. The note was like none he had ever received from her before. Here
 there was no detailed plan laid out, no evident foreknowledge of what was afoot.
 It seemed almost a call for help where she herself was helpless, and so&mdash;it
 brought the blood pounding in quicker tempo through his veins&mdash;it might
 well be she had realised and was prepared at last to accept as inevitable the
 fact that, whether she would or no, he meant to force his way if it were humanly
 within his power into those shadows, as she termed them, with which the Phantom
 had surrounded her. Well, why not? She must know that he had already been in
 perhaps closer, more intimate touch than even herself with this master criminal
 of a score of aliases and a score of domiciles, first as Gentleman Laroque,
 then as Isaac Shiftel, and again as Limpy Mack. And besides there was her promise
 that&mdash;no! He shook his head a little bitterly. Why should he try to blind
 his own eyes? Her promise to call upon him for aid had contained the proviso
 that it would not identify him as an ally of hers in the Phantom&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p> It was a foolish hope fathered only by desire! A hope that out of this watching
 of Mother Margot to-night at Hip Foo&rsquo;s he and the woman that he loved
 would come together again, that he would see her, hear her voice, and after
 that&mdash;Yes, she knew that, too! She had said so in the letter she had slipped
 into the pocket of his coat when she had left him that night on the old East
 River wharf. She knew that once he found her again no legion of Phantoms, no
 pleading on her part, could keep him from her side until the end, whatever
 that end might be. He might shake his head if he chose, he might argue speciously
 with himself as his love prompted him to do, but in his heart he knew that
 her note to-night would not bring her and himself together unless&mdash;yes,
 that was it!&mdash;to-night saw the end of the Phantom&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p> The end! That brought still another angle into the Tocsin&rsquo;s message,
 an angle that was represented by this Mother Margot. His eyes grew grimly thoughtful
 as he walked along. How far was the old hag to be trusted? How much to be depended
 upon was the hold he had on her through having caught her in the act of purloining
 an extra share of the loot from one of her own confederates, who though she
 evidently did not know it herself, had been the Phantom in the guise of Limpy
 Mack that night at old Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s? His hands had been tied in a measure
 in respect of Mother Margot. True, since that night he had never lost track
 of her, but his means of communication had been restricted to the same means
 that the &ldquo;Voice,&rdquo; as she called the Phantom, had employed&mdash;of
 calling her from her pushcart in Thompson Street to that telephone booth she
 had spoken of in Mezzo&rsquo;s second-hand store, and questioning her. This
 he had done each day, sometimes more than once; but the result had always been
 the same. Each time she had sworn that she had heard nothing further from the
 Voice. And yet to-night she was to be watched at Hip Foo&rsquo;s!</p>
<p> Was she playing fast and loose? He had not been in personal touch with her&mdash;that
 was where the weakness of his position lay. She knew him to be the Gray Seal,
 but she knew him only as a man with a mask on his face. He could not stand
 beside her pushcart on Thompson Street, and, wearing a mask, talk to her. He
 could not go to her as Smarlinghue and risk even the suspicion that Smarlinghue
 had any connection with the Gray Seal, let alone being the Gray Seal himself!
 A word from her, if that thought ever entered her mind, or anybody else&rsquo;s
 for that matter, and underworld and police would join hands in the one cause
 that could ever be common to both, and fight as only two packs of wolves might
 fight for the prey that only one could have.</p>
<p> It was not a pleasant thought!</p>
<p> He withdrew his hands suddenly from his ragged pockets, and, stooping down,
 picked up a crumpled newspaper from the gutter, as the flaring red type of
 a headline caught his eye. He glanced at it, and pitched it away again almost
 immediately. He had been interested to know if it were a special edition announcing
 some new development in the case of one Connie Pfeffer, alias the Mole. It
 did not. It was just re-hash.</p>
<p> He smiled wryly. The Gray Seal, &ldquo;that depraved and degenerate glutton
 who feasted and lived like some ghoul upon his foul notoriety, and who, with
 inhuman boastfulness, left his diamond-shaped gray seal upon the scene of every
 one of his fiendish crimes,&rdquo; the usual stand-by of the sensational headliners,
 had of late been relegated to obscurity by the newspapers. It was a relief!
 For the time being the crime that held the public attention was that in which
 this Connie Pfeffer was involved, but this was more, as a matter of fact, because
 of the opportunity it afforded for a jeer at the police rather than on account
 of the actual crime itself. For two days the journals had been full of the
 Levenson Bank robbery, a private bank in the Wall Street district, where a
 customer, having just drawn out ten thousand dollars in twenty five-hundred-dollar
 bills, had been held up almost in front of the teller&rsquo;s wicket at the
 point of a revolver and relieved of his cash. Connie Pfeffer, alias the Mole,
 who had answered to the description of the robber, had been apprehended within
 an hour of the crime by the police, released again for lack of evidence against
 him&mdash;and then had promptly disappeared. New evidence establishing the
 fact that Connie Pfeffer was the man who had entered the bank had almost immediately
 come to light, but Connie Pfeffer was no longer to be found, and the police&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale swung sharply around. Some one was plucking at his sleeve&mdash;a
 tattered and stoop-shouldered old man, who had a tray slung around his neck
 upon which was displayed a pitiful array of cheap collar buttons.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Hello, Smarly!&rdquo; The man spoke low, out of the corner of his
 mouth. &ldquo;Say, Smarly, I wanter ask youse somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p> For an instant Jimmie Dale surveyed the other. It was Pedler Joe, and Pedler
 Joe lived just around the corner from the Sanctuary and was therefore in the
 category of an old acquaintance and neighbour; but his, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s,
 business to-night was at Hip Foo&rsquo;s, and he had no time to waste.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Hello, Joe!&rdquo; he returned a little ungraciously. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
 know you went in for night work. There&rsquo;s a gape-bus back there, and the
 bunch have gone into Charlie Wong&rsquo;s lay-out. If you stick around when
 they come you may get away with something.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t out for business&mdash;not dat kind,&rdquo; the man
 whispered&mdash;and still holding Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s coat sleeve, edged out
 to the curb and halted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for some one. Everybody
 says youse&rsquo;re on de level, Smarly. Youse bats around a lot in places
 dey won&rsquo;t let me into, so hand it to me straight. Have youse seen Connie
 anywhere, youse knows who I mean, de Mole?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stared. It was rather curious, rather much of a coincidence!
 He had been thinking of Connie Pfeffer, alias the Mole, at the moment Pedler
 Joe had accosted him. And coincidences in the Bad Lands were not always&mdash;coincidences!</p>
<p> It was Smarlinghue of the underworld, not Jimmie Dale the millionaire clubman,
 who spoke.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the lay?&rdquo; His tones pointed the inquiry with almost
 exaggerated suspicion.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s straight!&rdquo; the old man answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
 askin&rsquo; youse just dat. Have youse seen him, or heard anythin&rsquo; about
 him?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale still parried the question.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sounds like you&rsquo;d shoved your stake in with the bulls,&rdquo; he
 scowled. &ldquo;Did they give you a badge to pin inside your vest? What have
 you got to do with Connie?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old man&rsquo;s face was haggard; he evidently had not shaved for several
 days, and the short white bristles seemed to accentuate a general woe-begone
 aspect and feebleness that age and the thin, stooped shoulders already proclaimed
 loudly enough.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I got a lot to do wid him,&rdquo; the old man said hoarsely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
 like my own kid, dat&rsquo;s wot he is. I ain&rsquo;t done much for him mabbe,
 but I done wot I could to keep him straight, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;You!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale laughed outright. Pedler Joe&rsquo;s life
 history was written on the police blotters! The man had served at least a half
 dozen sentences in prison. True, Pedler Joe in his declining years&mdash;he
 must be verging on the seventies now&mdash;had, outwardly at least, reformed
 to the extent of earning his living as a legalised mendicant, as witness the
 collar buttons. But as a guardian and sponsor for young morals&mdash;Jimmie
 Dale, as Smarlinghue, grinned viciously. &ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s no wonder he
 pulled that bank job! He comes by it honestly! Say, what&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s grin had died away. Something was wrong here; there was
 something deeper than appeared on the surface, something that he did not understand.
 The tears had come suddenly into the faded old eyes, and were trickling now
 down the wrinkled cheeks.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Forget it, Joe!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale laid his hand in quick sympathy
 on the other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hand you nothing.
 Spill the story, Joe&mdash;only hurry, &rsquo;cause I got a date.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I picked him outer de gutter w&rsquo;en he could hardly walk,&rdquo; said
 Pedler Joe. &ldquo;An&rsquo; w&rsquo;en I wasn&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; spaces up
 de river, I kept my eye on him. Sounds like hell from an old lag, don&rsquo;t
 it? But it&rsquo;s true, Smarly, so help me Gawd, it&rsquo;s true! I wasn&rsquo;t
 runnin&rsquo; straight myself, but wot chance I got I tried to show de kid
 my line wasn&rsquo;t any good. Only I was away a lot, an&rsquo; I let him down,
 so it ain&rsquo;t all his fault. Dere wasn&rsquo;t no one to keep him from
 goin&rsquo; wild w&rsquo;en I was doin&rsquo; time&mdash;see? He ain&rsquo;t
 lived wid me for years, but dat didn&rsquo;t keep him from comin&rsquo; frequent
 to see me, I&rsquo;ll say dat for him. An&rsquo; den dis bank job happened.
 If youse read de papers youse know he was pinched in my place dat afternoon.
 He blew in to get a little stake from me, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;From you!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale interrupted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
 you had loose change to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Some days,&rdquo; said the old man simply, &ldquo;I pick up more&rsquo;n
 youse&rsquo;d t&rsquo;ink. But dat ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to do wid it.
 Dere was always a few dollars for Connie w&rsquo;en he was on his uppers. Well,
 youse know dey didn&rsquo;t have anythin&rsquo; on him to hold him for de job,
 an&rsquo; dey let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;And he beat it, and he ain&rsquo;t been seen since,&rdquo; commented
 Jimmie Dale judicially in his r&ocirc;le of Smarlinghue. &ldquo;And now some
 one else comes along and swears too it was him at the bank. It&rsquo;s open
 and shut now that he pulled the job all right, and ducked with the cash. That&rsquo;s
 why they&rsquo;re laughing at the police. You&rsquo;re wasting your time looking
 for him. He&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pedler Joe; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone&mdash;dat&rsquo;s
 wot&rsquo;s de matter.&rdquo; He glanced furtively about him. &ldquo;But he
 ain&rsquo;t gone de way youse t&rsquo;ink. I don&rsquo;t say now he didn&rsquo;t
 pull de job, though I didn&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink so until last night; an&rsquo; I
 was handin&rsquo; de police straight goods w&rsquo;en dey was puttin&rsquo; me
 through down at de Chief&rsquo;s de afternoon dey put de nippers on Connie
 at my place. He&rsquo;s gone&mdash;but he ain&rsquo;t gone de way youse t&rsquo;ink.
 Dere&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; else bein&rsquo; pulled besides dat. Take a look
 at dis!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale leaned forward. Pedler Joe had loosened his collar. The man&rsquo;s
 neck and throat were a mass of ugly bruises, discolored, swollen, finger-printed
 in angry, purplish blotches.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; muttered Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get
 that?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It was last night&rdquo;&mdash;Pedler Joe again glanced furtively
 around him, as he rearranged his collar&mdash;&ldquo;dey nearly bumped me off
 before dey was satisfied dat I didn&rsquo;t know any more&rsquo;n wot I&rsquo;d
 told de police. Dey wanted to know where de cash was, de ten t&rsquo;ousand
 bucks dat Connie stole. Dat&rsquo;s wot dey did to <i>me</i>, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s
 why I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; youse if youse have seen or heard anythin&rsquo; of
 Connie.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips had tightened.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You think,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;they had tried the same
 game with Connie, and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s&mdash;<i>disappeared?</i> You mean
 you&rsquo;ve doped it out that they hadn&rsquo;t been able to make him talk
 up to last night, and that they tried you then on a chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old man nodded.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure, dey got him,&rdquo; he said miserably. &ldquo;Dey got him cold.
 Dat&rsquo;s wot makes me t&rsquo;ink now dat Connie pulled de job all right, &rsquo;cause
 dey&rsquo;re wise to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale; &ldquo;but who was it that laid you
 out?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t dead sure,&rdquo; said Pedler Joe. &ldquo;I woke up
 last night in bed wid a pair of hands around my t&rsquo;roat, chokin&rsquo; me.
 It was pretty dark in the room. Dere was two of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; I wasn&rsquo;t
 sure, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t sure now, but I thought one of &rsquo;em, the
 little fellow, was Bunty Myers, who used to travel wid Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s
 gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Gentleman Laroque! <i>The Phantom!</i> Jimmie Dale was fumbling aimlessly with the
 brim of his battered old felt hat. Mother Margot, Hip Foo&rsquo;s, the Phantom&mdash;and
 Connie Pfeffer, alias the Mole! Was this what was at the bottom of the Tocsin&rsquo;s
 note? Intuitively he was instantly sure of it. It dovetailed perfectly. The
 Phantom was not likely to be playing <i>two</i> games to-night, therefore&mdash;</p>
<p> Pedler Joe was whispering hoarsely again:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;re on de level, Smarly, an&rsquo; on de inside everywhere.
 I&mdash;I thought mabbe youse&rsquo;d help me. An&rsquo; if youse heard anythin&rsquo; or
 saw anythin&rsquo; youse&rsquo;d tip me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale held out his hand.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure, I will, Joe!&rdquo; he said. He leaned closer to the other. &ldquo;You
 keep your map closed about having spoken to me&mdash;see? I know Bunty Myers.
 I&rsquo;ll do my best for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;T&rsquo;anks, Smarly,&rdquo; said the old man gratefully. &ldquo;I
 knew youse would.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale again. &ldquo;Well, that goes&mdash;and
 so-long, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He turned and slouched on again down the street. His face was impassive,
 but his hands in his pockets were clenched now. So the Phantom&rsquo;s hand
 was in this, too, was it? And the old broken figure with the tray of collar
 buttons slung around his neck was one of the victims! It brought the hot anger
 surging upon him. There was something that struck deep to the root of his sympathy,
 something pathetic in the queer, strange loyalty, the curious love that old
 Pedler Joe, himself a thief by profession in the days gone by, held for the
 gutter snipe that he had tried&mdash;and failed&mdash;to bring up in the paths
 of virtue! The Phantom! Well, perhaps, to-night, if at Hip Foo&rsquo;s there
 was&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale turned the corner, and halted suddenly in a dazed, stunned way.
 As at the door of Charlie Wong&rsquo;s back there on the other street, a wagon
 was drawn up here at the curb in front of Hip Foo&rsquo;s, and a little crowd
 was disembarking from the wagon and was being marshalled into line, but it
 was not a gape-wagon that stood at Hip Foo&rsquo;s front door; it was a wagon
 of quite a very different sort&mdash;a police van. And then in an instant,
 his wits at work again after the first shock of surprise, Jimmie Dale slouched
 back out of sight around the corner again. Here he broke into a run. A raid!
 Hip Foo&rsquo;s was being raided.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale ran on at top speed. His chances were just even&mdash;that was
 all. There were <i>two</i> exits a block apart. He could not watch both at once. Which
 one would Mother Margot use? The police would not get her, nor any of those
 with her. The police would gather in a few Chinese attendants who would be
 as phlegmatic and informative as so many cows; the police would collect a little
 opium-smoking paraphernalia, and Hip Foo would be fined&mdash;but that would
 be all. Before the first blue-coat crossed the threshold of the entrance, the
 exodus through the sub-cellars would have begun.</p>
<p> And now Jimmie Dale drew into the shadows at the mouth of a dark and narrow
 lane. It was the toss of a coin. This one or the other! Yes&mdash;here they
 came now, like rats running from a sinking ship. He crouched against the wall
 unnoticed, or if noticed accepted as one of their own ilk, and watched them.
 Man after man, woman after woman, passed out into the street. The procession
 dwindled to a few belated stragglers&mdash;and ceased. He waited a minute longer.
 There was no one else.</p>
<p> Tight-lipped then, Jimmie Dale turned away. Mother Margot had not been amongst
 them. He had lost the toss, that was all. She had gone out the other way.</p>
<p> He walked rapidly now. There was only one thing left to do, one way left
 open to him. It would not be very difficult to find Mother Margot&mdash;at
 her home&mdash;in those rooms from which, on that first night, the Phantom
 had so mysteriously disappeared. He had even promised her a visit!</p>
<p> He smiled a little grimly. His promise so far had been unfulfilled. Not because
 the Tocsin had warned him that the place was a trap, and even Mother Margot,
 evidently terror-stricken that night at Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s, had done likewise;
 but because, prior to that warning and prior to Mother Margot&rsquo;s occupancy
 of the rooms, he had already searched the premises and found nothing; and because,
 until now, it had not seemed that there was anything to be gained by a move
 which might result in warning the Phantom that he, Jimmie Dale, had been in
 communication with Mother Margot.</p>
<p> But to-night there was no choice but to go there&mdash;unless perhaps she
 had gone back to her pushcart in Thompson Street. He would try that first,
 and if she were there call her to the phone as he always did, and arrange a
 meeting somewhere under conditions such that she would discover no more of
 his actual identity than that of the man in the mask whom she already knew
 as the Gray Seal.</p>
<p> He was hurrying now. Time, as measured in minutes, might or might not be
 precious. He did not know. What had taken place at Hip Foo&rsquo;s, whether
 for instance the rendezvous that Mother Margot had presumably had there had
 been prematurely interrupted by the raid, or what were the details of the scheme
 the Phantom was hatching, he did not know. But in any case, one thing was vital,
 not only to himself but to the Tocsin, vital to all he hoped for&mdash;that
 the <i>character</i> of Smarlinghue should not be endangered. And this, not only because
 it was in itself the key that opened for him the innermost portals of the underworld,
 that again and again had alone stood between him and recognition as the Gray
 Seal, but because to-night he must meet Mother Margot, not as Smarlinghue,
 but in the only character that she would recognise, and, yes&mdash;the grim
 smile came again&mdash;<i>obey</i>. And so, first of all, must come the Sanctuary;
 after that&mdash;his shoulders under the ragged coat lifted in a queer, almost
 fatalistic little shrug&mdash;who knew!</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
 Jimmie Dale Pays A Visit</b></h2>
<p> It was Smarlinghue, the drug-wrecked artist, who, ten minutes later, by the
 street entrance, inviting even the nods of recognition from some of the loungers
 round about, entered the dingy tenement and scuffled along the musty, dark,
 unlighted hallway to the squalid rear room on the ground floor&mdash;the Sanctuary;
 it was Jimmie Dale, in dinner jacket, the millionaire clubman, who stealthily
 gained the street again by way of the old French window, the refuse-strewn
 courtyard, the board in the high fence that swung aside at a touch, and finally
 the lane.</p>
<p> Another ten minutes, and he was sauntering nonchalantly along a narrow crowded
 street, whose curbs were lined with pushcarts, whose sidewalks were thronged
 with shawled women and coatless, swarthy men, whose gutters were the playground
 for almost naked children. Thompson Street was in the heart of New York, just
 off West Broadway, not far from the homes of the old-time aristocracy of Washington
 Square, but it was also in a foreign land!</p>
<p> But Mother Margot with her pushcart was not here to-night. He had hardly
 expected she would be. His face was set as he made his way back now to the
 Bowery, and from there headed still deeper into the East Side. There was nothing
 for it now but Mother Margot&rsquo;s rooms.</p>
<p> A few blocks farther brought him within sight of the tenement that was his
 destination, and his pace slowed as he passed the narrow alleyway over which
 the police had kept abortive guard on the night they had pounded at Isaac Shiftel&rsquo;s
 door inside. There was a light in the window, the same window through which
 he and the Phantom, alias Isaac Shiftel, or perhaps better on that occasion,
 alias Gentleman Laroque, had first had warning that the police were without.
 Mother Margot, then, had presumably returned home.</p>
<p> He was opposite the tenement door now. He halted abruptly, ostensibly to
 watch the efforts of a man across the road who was attempting to start an old
 car that was back-firing viciously, in reality to allow some near-by pedestrians
 to pass by&mdash;and then suddenly Jimmie Dale had disappeared from the street,
 and in another instant, in the dark, murky hall, was standing before Mother
 Margot&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p> From one of the pockets in the leather girdle beneath his outer garments,
 that harboured too its little blued-steel burglar&rsquo;s kit, he took out
 his black silk mask and slipped it over his face. His lips tightened a little,
 as his right hand closed over the automatic in the side pocket of his dinner
 jacket. Who knew! There was a light in there, it was true; but he was not necessarily
 <i>sure</i> that it was Mother Margot&mdash;or that Mother Margot was alone.</p>
<p> He knocked upon the door. There was no answer. He knocked again. This time
 there came the sound of a shuffling footstep crossing the floor within, and
 then the door was cautiously opened, and Mother Margot, holding a candle above
 her head, peered out into the hallway.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd&mdash;youse!&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;re
 youse doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled beneath his mask.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Have you forgotten, Mother Margot?&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I
 promised you a visit, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He stepped forward, but she blocked his way at the threshold.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Go away! Go away from here!&rdquo; she breathed wildly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should&mdash;just yet,&rdquo; said Jimmie
 Dale quietly. &ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if we had our interview
 <i>inside</i> instead of out here? It wouldn&rsquo;t be quite so public.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said frantically. She kept glancing behind her, over
 her shoulder in a terrified way. &ldquo;Aw, go away! For the love of Gawd,
 go away before we&rsquo;se gets caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in there, then?&rdquo; demanded Jimmie Dale sharply.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No one!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Dere ain&rsquo;t no one dere&mdash;at
 least I don&rsquo;t know whether dere is or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stared at the old hag for a moment speculatively.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; He injected a caustic note into his voice. &ldquo;What
 do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell youse de other night!&rdquo; She was still whispering
 hoarsely. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell youse wot dey said&mdash;dat dey was figurin&rsquo; on
 youse comin&rsquo; here sometime. Dat&rsquo;s wot I means. I ain&rsquo;t never
 seen no one in here but me, but sometimes I&rsquo;m scared. Sometimes I&rsquo;m
 sure some one is watchin&rsquo; me&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t
 <i>see</i> no one. Don&rsquo;t youse see I&rsquo;m playin&rsquo; straight wid youse.
 If I wasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d let youse in, an&rsquo;&mdash;aw, my Gawd, get
 away from here! If I&rsquo;m caught tippin&rsquo; youse off dey&rsquo;d put
 a knife into me, dat&rsquo;s wot dey&rsquo;d do!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be less likely to be seen or caught without that light,
 then,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale coolly. He leaned forward suddenly, caught her
 arm, and blew the candle out. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; He was past
 her in an instant, and with quick, silent tread, his step as noiseless as though
 he possessed the padded paws of a cat, he made the circuit of the two rooms.
 And then he was back again beside her at the threshold. The rooms, so far as
 any outward and visible evidence of human presence was concerned, were empty.
 Nevertheless, he drew Mother Margot out into the dark hallway now, and closed
 the door silently behind them.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wot is it?&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Wot is it youse wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;A little information&mdash;perhaps a little more than information,&rdquo; said
 Jimmie Dale evenly. &ldquo;You said something a minute ago about playing straight
 with me. I&rsquo;m not so sure about you, Mother Margot. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
 here. I telephoned you this morning, and you swore you had not heard from the
 Voice since that night at Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It was de truth,&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you always tell the truth,&rdquo; he said tersely, &ldquo;because
 then, of course, you&rsquo;ll tell me now all about Hip Foo&rsquo;s to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She drew in her breath sharply.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Youse&mdash;youse knows about
 dat?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Go on, Mother Margot!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale prompted curtly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dere&mdash;dere ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to tell.&rdquo; She was
 obviously groping for inspiration. &ldquo;De bulls raided de place almost as
 soon as I got dere, an&rsquo; I beat it on de jump for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie!&rdquo; snapped Jimmie Dale sternly. &ldquo;There
 is a good deal to tell! Shall I help your memory?&rdquo; He was quite sure
 of his ground. Pedler Joe&rsquo;s story made the Phantom&rsquo;s and Bunty
 Myers&rsquo; connection with the night&rsquo;s work a practical certainty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
 you think Bunty Myers, and Connie Pfeffer&rsquo;s ten thousand is worth telling
 about&mdash;Mother Margot?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The shot went home. The old hag shrank back against the wall. He heard her
 mumbling incoherently.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale coldly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she burst out. &ldquo;I&mdash;I daresn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I think you can,&rdquo; Jimmie Dale answered sharply. &ldquo;And I
 am sure that it will be much the <i>safer</i> thing for you to do. As a last resort,
 for instance, if you forced my hand, the police might be very much interested
 to learn that Mother Margot knew something about the Levenson Bank robbery,
 and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell youse!&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;My Gawd,
 wot can I do? Wot else can I do? I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come across. Wen youse
 telephoned me to-day I hadn&rsquo;t heard nothin&rsquo;. It was only about
 six o&rsquo;clock dat de Voice told me to take de message over to Hip Foo&rsquo;s,
 an&rsquo; be dere by half past eight. See? Dere wasn&rsquo;t no way I could
 tell youse, was dere? I ain&rsquo;t de only one dat don&rsquo;t know where
 de Gray Seal lives, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale evenly; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll dispense
 with any discussion as to what you would have done if you had known. Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It was to meet Bunty Myers an&rsquo; another of Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s
 gang named Muller.&rdquo; Mother Margot&rsquo;s whisper was scarcely audible. &ldquo;An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; it
 was about Connie Pfeffer, all right. I was to tell &rsquo;em dat Connie had
 seen de error of his ways an&rsquo; opened up, an&rsquo; dat de coin was in
 de house wid de broken stairs, an&rsquo; shoved in under one of dem.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She paused, and in the semi-darkness Jimmie Dale could see her jerking her
 head in a queer birdlike way furtively about her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s its other name?&rdquo; demanded Jimmie Dale shortly.</p>
<p> She looked at him puzzled.</p>
<p> &ldquo;De other name of wot?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;The house with the broken stairs.&rdquo; Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s tones
 were uncompromising.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Pedler Joe&rsquo;s, of course!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Youse
 knows where dat is. Everybody does.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Pedler Joe! For a moment Jimmie Dale stared at her. Was Pedler Joe, too,
 playing a game? The figure of the old man, full of misery from what seemed
 genuine distress and fear, rose before him. But against this was Pedler Joe&rsquo;s
 record. Was this the way he had brought up his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;&mdash;to
 play in with him hand and glove? And yet those bruises on the man&rsquo;s neck
 and throat&mdash;<i>they</i> were genuine enough.</p>
<p> Again Jimmie Dale lunged in the dark, and won.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Pedler Joe had nothing to do with it!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
 try any holding out on me, Mother Margot!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t holdin&rsquo; out nothin&rsquo; on youse,&rdquo; she
 protested. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say Pedler Joe was in it. Connie beat it for
 Joe&rsquo;s after pullin&rsquo; de robbery at de bank dat day, so&rsquo;s to
 work up an alibi&mdash;see? But de bulls pinched him quicker&rsquo;n he figured.
 He hears dem comin&rsquo; while he&rsquo;s dere&mdash;see?&mdash;an&rsquo; w&rsquo;en
 Pedler Joe ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; he shoves de envelope wid de cash in under
 one of de broken stairs, an&rsquo; w&rsquo;en de bulls bust in dey don&rsquo;t
 find nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; dey ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; on Connie,
 an&rsquo; after puttin&rsquo; him through for a few hours down at headquarters
 dey has to let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale nodded.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; he said tersely. &ldquo;And the reason he didn&rsquo;t
 go back for the money was because he never got a chance. Your gang got him,
 and started in to apply less humane but evidently more effective measures to
 make him talk than the police did.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot drew in her breath.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I guess youse knows de whole lay. My Gawd, youse ain&rsquo;t human,
 are youse?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Hip Foo&rsquo;s,&rdquo; suggested Jimmie Dale grimly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;But dere ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; much
 to dat: now youse knows de rest. I had just give &rsquo;em de message w&rsquo;en
 de bulls started de raid, an&rsquo; we beat it. Dey&rsquo;re to go down dere
 after Pedler Joe gets to sleep, an&rsquo; pinch de dough&mdash;dat&rsquo;s
 all.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Not quite!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Connie Pfeffer.
 Did they go the limit with him? Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t&mdash;not quite. He&rsquo;ll be all right after
 a while, but I guess he just come through wid de dope in time. Him an&rsquo; one
 of Laroque&rsquo;s men, dat&rsquo;s supposed to be a man-nurse in charge of
 an invalid&mdash;see?&mdash;is on deir way west for somewhere now. Dat gets
 Connie outer here so&rsquo;s he don&rsquo;t get a chance to butt in an&rsquo; spill
 anythin&rsquo; to Pedler Joe or some other pal dat&rsquo;d help him out, an&rsquo; besides
 it&rsquo;s a kind of a stake dey&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; him so&rsquo;s de bulls
 won&rsquo;t bother him no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again Jimmie Dale was silent for a moment. It was clear-cut, wasn&rsquo;t
 it, the work that was ahead now? There was no choice, was there? There was
 only one thing to do. He could not go to a telephone, say, and tip the police
 off to the hiding place of the money; for the fact that it would be found in
 Pedler Joe&rsquo;s would convict Pedler Joe as an accomplice. The man, innocent
 though he was, would not have a chance. His known intimacy with the Mole, and
 the fact that Connie Pfeffer had been found there shortly after the robbery,
 both of which reasons had already resulted in a grilling for the old man from
 the authorities, and above all Pedler Joe&rsquo;s own record would&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale abruptly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Mother Margot crouched back against the wall. &ldquo;Go
 where?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;To Pedler Joe&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale curtly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; She flung out her arms wildly. &ldquo;Me&mdash;go dere!
 Aw, my Gawd, not dat! If dey caught me dey&rsquo;d&mdash;dey&rsquo;d croak
 me. I don&rsquo;t dare! My Gawd, I don&rsquo;t dare! Dey&rsquo;d kill me. I&rsquo;ve
 told youse all I knows. Youse ain&rsquo;t got no use for me dere.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, yes, I think I have,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
 feel a little more comfortable if I knew where Mother Margot was and what she
 was doing during the next half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;But&mdash;but youse can trust me,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Possibly!&rdquo; admitted Jimmie Dale evenly. &ldquo;But not to the
 extent of staking my life on it. It would be rather awkward for me if you communicated
 with the Voice, say, while I was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, no; I swear I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she whispered frantically. &ldquo;Aw,
 for Gawd&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t make me do dat! If dey sees me, if dey catches
 me dey&rsquo;ll know I snitched, an&rsquo; dey&rsquo;ll twist me t&rsquo;roat
 or put a knife into me.&rdquo;</p>
<p> It was quite true. If caught under any such circumstances Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 life would not be worth a moment&rsquo;s purchase. But then Mother Margot would
 not be caught. Bunty Myers and whoever was to accompany him were not to go
 there until late to-night, not until they would expect Pedler Joe to be in
 bed and asleep; and at the present moment Pedler Joe was out roaming miserably
 about the streets in his hopeless search. The place would be empty. There would
 be no risk for Mother Margot&mdash;and he, Jimmie Dale, was certainly by no
 means sure enough of her to leave her free to communicate with her confederates
 and trap him like a rat if she chose to do so.</p>
<p> &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t catch you.&rdquo; His tones were peremptory now. &ldquo;You
 go ahead. I&rsquo;ll follow&mdash;where I can keep my eye on you. I can&rsquo;t
 very well walk through the streets with a mask on my face, and I would a little
 rather prefer, Mother Margot, that all <i>you</i> saw was&mdash;a mask. And, besides,
 it might be just as well for your sake that you should not be seen in company
 with any one. You say you know Pedler Joe&rsquo;s place. Well, so do I. When
 you turn into the wagon drive I&rsquo;ll join you. Now then!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again she shrank back.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m scared. Youse
 don&rsquo;t know wot youse&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;. Youse&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
 get me killed, dat&rsquo;s wot it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make any noise that might be heard back there
 in your room by the unseen watcher that you appear to be so much afraid of,&rdquo; he
 said coldly; &ldquo;but you are either going with me, or it is going to be
 a showdown right here, Mother Margot. You understand?&rdquo; He caught her
 by the arm, and pushed her toward the front door. &ldquo;Now go!&rdquo;</p>
<p> She moved forward along the hall. He could see her wringing her hands.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; she whispered; and again: &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
 The House With The Broken Stairs</b></h2>
<p> Mother Margot passed out through the door. Jimmie Dale, a few paces behind,
 removed his mask as he stepped out to the sidewalk. He crossed instantly to
 the other side of the road, and, keeping pace with her, followed her as she
 shuffled down the street.</p>
<p> He was smiling grimly now. The Phantom apparently was becoming cautious&mdash;in
 a personal sense. As Gentleman Laroque, as Isaac Shiftel, as Limpy Mack, the
 man had but narrowly escaped; to-night, it seemed fairly obvious, he was playing
 a safer game by delegating the actual work to the members of his old gang over
 whom he evidently still preserved his authority. Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s smile
 gave place to tight, set lips. It was a compliment in a way, and a very genuine
 compliment, to him, Jimmie Dale; but if there was no Phantom to-night, no chance
 at the man in that personal way, then, equally, there would be no Tocsin to-night
 either at the end of the quest!</p>
<p> He went on down the street, following the shawled figure of the old hag.
 Why dwell on that? What good would it do? What would it bring him? Some night,
 some time, it would be the last night and the last time, and there would be&mdash;the
 end. Meanwhile to-night, at least, he could check-mate the Phantom&rsquo;s
 game.</p>
<p> His thoughts swept back to the immediate present. Something struck him for
 the moment as incongruous, out of keeping, a little illogical, in view of the
 open brutality they had dealt out to Pedler Joe last night when they had not
 hesitated to break into the old man&rsquo;s house, that to-night the Phantom
 had switched his tactics to those of almost exaggerated stealth. And then he
 shook his head. No&mdash;it was far from illogical. He saw it now. He owed
 the Phantom a compliment in return. Mentally he paid it. The man had a sort
 of super cunning and cleverness cradled in his devil&rsquo;s brain! Pedler
 Joe knew nothing; Pedler Joe would continue to know nothing. Connie Pfeffer&rsquo;s
 lips were sealed unless to confess his own guilt. And so the disappearance
 of the money would remain a mystery&mdash;that was all!</p>
<p> The shawled figure on the opposite side shuffled on. It was not far now to
 Pedler Joe&rsquo;s. He followed her across the Bowery, down a side street again,
 past the Sanctuary, and around the next corner. Here he closed the gap between
 them, crossing to her side of the street&mdash;and as she disappeared into
 the blackness of a sort of arched driveway, he joined her.</p>
<p> He slipped the mask over his face again, and took her arm.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p> The driveway was a wretched, dirty place, once used no doubt for a delivery
 wagon when the store in front had been in its prime; now it was Pedler Joe&rsquo;s
 entrance to his domain, which, in turn, had once been an outhouse of some kind,
 perhaps even the stable, or wagon shed, a miserable little wooden shack, neglected
 now and in hopeless disrepair.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, still holding Mother Margot&rsquo;s arm, emerged from the driveway,
 crossed the small yard beyond, and halted at the door of the hovel.</p>
<p> It was dark here; nothing showed but the looming shadows of the surrounding
 buildings. Mother Margot was whimpering again:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Pedler Joe! Pedler Joe&rsquo;ll see me, an&rsquo; den&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Pedler Joe is out,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale crisply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
 no one inside. You won&rsquo;t get into any trouble, Mother Margot, unless
 you make it yourself. I&rsquo;ll see to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The door was locked. From the leather girdle Jimmie Dale selected a pick-lock.
 A moment, two, passed. The slim, sensitive fingers of Jimmie Dale, that mocked
 at even the intricate locks and bolts devised by modern ingenuity, were working
 quickly, almost contemptuously now, at Pedler Joe&rsquo;s cheap, flimsy fastening.
 The door swung open. Jimmie Dale motioned Mother Margot to enter, and, following,
 closed and locked the door again behind them.</p>
<p> For an instant he stood motionless, then his flashlight swept the interior,
 lancing the blackness with its round, white ray. The place was one of utter,
 poverty-stricken desolation. There was but a single room, with no furniture
 in it save an old table and chair; the floor sagged and had rotted away in
 places; even a window was lacking, for where one once had been, it was now,
 in lieu of broken panes no doubt, nailed up with boards.</p>
<p> And now the flashlight focussed and held on a flight of stairs obliquely
 across from the door and on the far side of the room. Mother Margot had called
 the place &ldquo;the house with the broken stairs,&rdquo; and it was well
 named! Half a dozen of the treads at least were broken away and were little
 more now than so many gaping holes; and for the rest, the whole staircase leaned
 drunkenly to one side as though scarcely able any longer to sustain its own
 weight, let alone the added burden of any one desirous of reaching the floor
 above.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Whereabouts in the stairs is it?&rdquo; Jimmie Dale demanded abruptly.</p>
<p> Mother Margot was crouched close against the door in a frightened attitude.
 She shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I wish to Gawd I did, so&rsquo;s
 we could get outer here quick. It&rsquo;s in one of dem holes in de stairs.
 Connie said he didn&rsquo;t remember which one &rsquo;cause he had to act on
 de jump. He heard de bulls comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; Pedler Joe was upstairs,
 an&rsquo; he said he hadn&rsquo;t time to figure anythin&rsquo; except to get
 de cash outer sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale quietly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
 much matter. We&rsquo;ll begin at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He moved across the room, and with his flashlight began his search under
 the broken stair treads. But it was not until the fourth attempt that his hand,
 in under a tread up to the elbow, encountered a sealed envelope. He drew it
 out quickly, and tore the end open. Yes, here it was! He took out the money
 and counted it rapidly&mdash;twenty five-hundred-dollar banknotes. It was all
 here&mdash;ten thousand dollars. He thrust the money into his pocket, and laid
 the empty envelope on the stair beside him.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mother Margot!&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
 go in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p> From another pocket in the leather girdle he drew out now the thin metallic
 case that contained its store of diamond-shaped, gray-paper seals, and with
 the tiny tweezers&mdash;that there might be no tell-tale finger prints&mdash;lifted
 out one of the seals and moistened the adhesive side with his lips. There was
 Pedler Joe to be considered. Pedler Joe must not be held accountable by the
 Phantom, any more than by the police. He picked up the empty envelope and pressed
 the gray seal firmly down upon it. When Bunty Myers and his fellow thugs arrived
 and found the money gone, Pedler Joe would naturally be the first one they
 would think of, and their former suspicions that the old man knew more than
 he pretended would be aroused again with disastrous results for Pedler Joe.
 But the gray seal here on the envelope would square Pedler Joe and settle all
 doubts on that score. The Phantom, for instance, was fully&mdash;</p>
<p> Mother Margot&rsquo;s whisper cut tensely, suddenly through the room:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dey&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;! Dey&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;! Aw, for Gawd&rsquo;s
 sake, dey&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; dere ain&rsquo;t no way to get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p> In an instant Jimmie Dale was across the room beside her. He caught her wrist
 fiercely.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I told youse so!&rdquo; She was crooning in a queer, low way. &ldquo;Dey&rsquo;ll
 kill me for dis!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; breathed Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> Cool, possessed, motionless, he stood there. Mother Margot was right. He
 could hear the footsteps of three or four men close to the door outside. There
 was no way out. They were trapped, and Mother Margot&mdash;</p>
<p> The door rattled as it was tried. A voice in a low callous laugh reached
 him through the panels:</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing youse piped old Pedler down de line, Bunty;
 it&rsquo;s saved us wastin&rsquo; de night hangin&rsquo; round waitin&rsquo; for
 him to hit de hay!&rdquo;</p>
<p> And then another voice, impatiently:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, get de door open! Wot&rsquo;s de use playin&rsquo; wid de lock?
 Bust it in, an&rsquo; strike a light! Youse don&rsquo;t have to be careful
 of de noise when Pedler ain&rsquo;t dere.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot! There was a chance. Just one. Not for both of them perhaps,
 but for Mother Margot. He owed it to her. He had brought her here&mdash;to
 her death&mdash;if the chance failed.</p>
<p> He leaned toward her, his lips close against her ear.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Flatten back here against the wall. The door opens away from you.
 Don&rsquo;t move till they make a rush, then slip through the door behind them,
 and get to the street. I&rsquo;ll guarantee at least that no one will <i>follow</i> you, and with a little luck you won&rsquo;t be seen at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;But youse&rdquo;&mdash;a strange note had come suddenly into her voice&mdash;&ldquo;but
 youse&mdash;youse mean dat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Never mind what I mean,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale between set teeth. &ldquo;Do
 as I tell you, or <i>neither</i> of us&rsquo;ll get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The door lock yielded with a little snap&mdash;but Jimmie Dale was no longer
 there. Silent as a shadow in his movements, he was already halfway up the stairs.</p>
<p> He halted here. He was still holding the envelope with its gray seal, but
 instead of his flashlight his automatic now was in his other hand.</p>
<p> And then for the first time Jimmie Dale made a sound&mdash;at the moment
 that the door swung open. It was as though, suddenly alarmed, he had tripped
 and fallen upon the rickety stairs. There was a chorus of startled oaths, a
 rush of feet across the floor in his direction, the white gleam of a flashlight
 thrown upon him, the chorused shouts again&mdash;and he turned, dropping the
 envelope from his hand, and as it fluttered downward to the floor, he dashed
 madly up the stairs.</p>
<p> Came the crash and roar of a revolver shot, the spurt of flame, the ugly
  <i>spat</i> of a bullet as it embedded itself in the woodwork somewhere above his
 head, another, and still another&mdash;but Jimmie Dale did not fire in return.
 There was Mother Margot. They had not noticed her and she should be gone by
 now, but he could not see. He dared not take the chance of any of them running
 back for cover in the direction of the door. Just a few seconds more, and then&mdash;he
 flung himself over the topmost stair&mdash;yes, it was safe now surely to check
 their rush if he could. He fired&mdash;his shot directed high over their heads.
 Snarls and curses answered him. The flashlights, more than one of them now,
 made almost daylight of the place. And suddenly a new shout went up. Some one
 had picked up the envelope!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gray Seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hail of lead came up the staircase&mdash;and a concerted rush of dark,
 swarming figures. He could not tell how many&mdash;three or four&mdash;but
 it seemed as though there were a dozen.</p>
<p>The window! There must be a window here. He remembered that Pedler Joe had
 spoken of a window. Yes, there it was just across from the stairhead. He hurled
 himself toward it, flung it open, and swung out over the sill. It could not
 be very high. In any case it was the only chance. A flashlight&rsquo;s ray
 caught him now from the head of the stairs, and was accompanied almost simultaneously
 by an oath and the tongue flame of a revolver.</p>
<p> He let go his hold and dropped. Something, a heap of rubbish, an uneven surface,
 threw him violently upon his face as he landed, but in an instant he was on
 his feet again. There was no way out of the place except across the yard and
 through the archway, and he raced in that direction. He heard a shout signalling
 his whereabouts from the window. It was echoed by shouts from within.</p>
<p> If he could but gain the street before they poured out of the shack in pursuit!
 No&mdash;here they came now! Over his shoulder he caught a glimpse of shadowy
 forms behind him.</p>
<p> He had a start of ten yards, perhaps fifteen at the outside. He swerved out
 into the street. Strange the commotion back there had not aroused the neighbourhood!
 But it would not take long to do so now if the chase remained in the open!</p>
<p> &ldquo;The Gray Seal! Get him! Stop him!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The shouts, the pound of feet rang from behind him. But now a queer, half
 choked, panting laugh came grimly from Jimmie Dale as a dark shawled figure
 peered suddenly out from a doorway and drew back again as he dashed by. Mother
 Margot! Well, at least, he had kept his promise to Mother Margot.</p>
<p> And now windows began to open; people to emerge from the houses. The pound
 of feet, the shouts seemed to grow even nearer. Jimmie Dale was straining every
 muscle now, running like a deer. Another few minutes of this in the open and
 it would be the end. Thank God, the Sanctuary was just around the corner! If
 he had ever needed it in his life, he needed it now. They might see him enter
 the tenement; but by the time they had been able to search the place even cursorily
 the Gray Seal would have vanished, and only Smarlinghue of the underworld,
 the drug-wrecked peer of that inglorious realm to which they themselves belonged,
 would be found.</p>
<p> He turned the corner, ran on the few yards up the block to the Sanctuary,
 and as he flung himself inside the tenement door he saw them swing into the
 street behind him, and heard them like a pack of bloodhounds give tongue again
 at sight of their quarry. But in a second now he was along the dark hallway
 and inside the Sanctuary itself, the door locked behind him.</p>
<p> And now he worked with lightning speed. He could have run on out through
 the French window, and by the lane perhaps might have had a fair chance of
 getting away&mdash;but almost as important as his life was the vital necessity
 of protecting the character of Smarlinghue from suspicion, and the Gray Seal
 making straight for Smarlinghue&rsquo;s room and disappearing thereby, marked
 an intimacy in time of stress with Smarlinghue&rsquo;s habitation too significant
 to go unchallenged. He tore off his evening clothes, wrenched open the movable
 section of the baseboard, brought out the seedy, tattered garments of Smarlinghue,
 and put them on.</p>
<p> He needed no light&mdash;only a few more precious seconds. They were stumbling
 around outside in the hall now; and now he could hear them break into one of
 the other rooms. Just a few more seconds&mdash;that was all he needed. There
 were still the little pieces of wax that distorted lips and nostrils, that
 gave a peculiar set to cheeks and ears; still the facial solution to give the
 gaunt, pallor-like effect that Smarlinghue&mdash;Cold beads of sweat stood
 out suddenly on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s forehead. His mask as he pulled it off
 was sticky; his hand as he put it to his face came away <i>wet</i>. No, there was
 no need for light. He knew! It was blood. His face had been bruised and cut
 when he had fallen from the window. No make-up, no clothes, no &ldquo;Smarlinghue&rdquo; would
 explain that!</p>
<p> They were coming to his door now, weren&rsquo;t they? His wits&mdash;if he
 had ever possessed any! A chance for his life&mdash;and Smarlinghue&rsquo;s!
 The wax went into the nostrils, under the lips, behind the ears, inside the
 cheeks&mdash;there was no need for pallor on blood-stained skin&mdash;and the
 mask was over his face again.</p>
<p> A footstep was almost at the door.</p>
<p> And then, not Jimmie Dale, but Smarlinghue spoke.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; he cried in a strange, gurgling, strangled voice. &ldquo;Help!
 Let me alone! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p> He loosened the catch on the inside of the French window, but without opening
 the window itself; then, seizing a chair, he hurled it over his head in the
 direction of the easels and canvases that stood against the far wall. There
 was an answering crash. He scuffled with his feet, as he flung the evening
 clothes he had just taken off&mdash;saving out only his hat, which he put on&mdash;into
 the hiding place, and put back the movable section of the baseboard again.
 Another instant, and he had sent the table in the centre of the room hurtling
 to the floor, and had sprung&mdash;silently now&mdash;to the door.</p>
<p> They were pounding upon it, flinging themselves against it in an effort to
 break it in. In the darkness of the hall they would not be able to distinguish
 clothes. If they followed him, then, with luck, he might still save both himself
 and Smarlinghue; if they didn&rsquo;t, then&mdash;well, it was the end.</p>
<p> He turned the key with a sudden twist of his fingers, and swept the door
 open. Dark forms loomed before him. He struck right and left with all his body
 weight behind his blows, cleaving a passage for himself as he plunged forward.</p>
<p> A volley of furious oaths greeted the unexpected attack. Hands snatched at
 him. He broke from their clutches as they tried to grasp him, and sped down
 the hall. Yes, they were following! Thank God, they were following!</p>
<p> It was only a step from the street door to the lane, and in barely the fraction
 of a second he had gained the latter, leaving his hat behind him on the sidewalk
 as though it had been swept from his head in his flight; in another second
 he was through the board in the fence that swung aside at a touch of his hand,
 and was creeping along the rear of the tenement to the French window of the
 Sanctuary. An instant here he listened as he slipped the mask from his face,
 then the French window opened and closed silently again&mdash;and Smarlinghue,
 with battered, blood-stained face lay prone and motionless upon the floor amidst
 the d&eacute;bris and ruin of his squalid room.</p>
<p> A minute passed&mdash;two. Fellow tenants began to gather at the doorway,
 and finally to crowd into the room. The poverty-stricken gas-jet hissed as
 some one lighted it, and threw a pale, yellow, inadequate light over the surroundings.
 Jimmie Dale felt some one grasp him by the shoulders and lift him to a sitting
 posture. He rubbed his hand across his eyes, and stared dazedly around him.
 Then suddenly he seemed to rouse himself. He shook his fist wildly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Get the police!&rdquo; he croaked hoarsely, as he recognised as Bunty
 Myers a man who was elbowing his way forward. &ldquo;Get the police! I want
 the police! Some one bust in here and said if I made a peep he&rsquo;d lay
 me out. I&mdash;I was scared for a minute, mabbe two, and then I&mdash;I started
 something.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure! You look it!&rdquo; snapped Bunty Myers. He swung fiercely on
 the little crowd and brushed them back to the doorway. &ldquo;Get outer here!&rdquo; he
 snarled. &ldquo;Dis ain&rsquo;t yer hunt!&rdquo; He turned again to Jimmie
 Dale. &ldquo;Blast youse, Smarly!&rdquo; he swore. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t blamin&rsquo; youse,
 but if youse&rsquo;d kept quiet we&rsquo;d have had him cornered cold. He&rsquo;s
 got away now down the lane.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. &ldquo;Wot I come
 back for was to find out if youse&rsquo;d got a better look at him dan some
 of de boys wid me on account of his mask, an&rsquo; if youse&rsquo;d know him
 again if youse saw him?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale shook his head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t get no look at him,&rdquo; he said viciously. &ldquo;But
 I&rsquo;ll have the police on him, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;De police!&rdquo; Bunty Myers&rsquo; laugh was forced, unmirthful. &ldquo;De
 police&rsquo;ll be a long time findin&rsquo; dat bird, youse can take it from
 me! Say, youse give me de pip, Smarly! Dat was de Gray Seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s jaw dropped. He stared helplessly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; gasped Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;The Gray Seal! Him!&rdquo;</p>
<p> And he was still staring in a dazed and helpless way about him as Bunty Myers
 swung hurriedly from the room again, presumably to join his companions in their
 search along the lane.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  Beggar Pete</b></h2>
<p> The street lights showed mistily, like vague, filmy patches in the darkness.
 It was raining in torrents, pitilessly. The water dripped from the brim of
 Smarlinghue&rsquo;s old felt hat, and beating into his face soaked the bandage
 around his cheek, threatening to displace it. He smiled grimly in reminiscence,
 as he raised his hand and tightened the dressing a little in its place.</p>
<p> It was four nights ago now since his accident when he had made his escape
 from Pedler Joe&rsquo;s window, and subsequently had saved himself by playing
 the dual r&ocirc;le in the imaginary fight he had staged between Smarlinghue
 and the Gray Seal in the Sanctuary; and since then the character of Smarlinghue
 had virtually been a little Old Man of the Sea that had clung with almost sinister
 tenacity to him, and that he had not been able to shake off and discard as
 before at will. It was strange! A queer trick of fate, perhaps; and not an
 over-kindly one, for it had tied his hands, and for the moment had left him
 seriously crippled in his efforts to pick up the clues, already found and lost
 so many times, that must eventually, if there were ever to be life and freedom
 for the Tocsin, happiness for himself and the woman that he loved, lead to&mdash;the
 Phantom.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face grew hard, anxious, perturbed. Things had not gone
 well in those four days. Smarlinghue, if such a thing were possible when his
 life itself had been the stake, had played his part too well that night in
 the Sanctuary! Already one of the acknowledged aristocracy of the underworld,
 he had been suddenly elevated to the status of little less than demi-god. Smarlinghue
 had been in actual, physical combat with the Gray Seal! Smarlinghue had become
 the idol of a morbid awe and curiosity! It was subsiding now, but while it
 lasted it had made the &ldquo;disappearance&rdquo; of Smarlinghue, even for
 a few hours, far too dangerous a move to consider; he had been too much the
 attraction, too much on exhibition, as it were. But even if this had not been
 so, there was still another and perhaps even stronger reason that had temporarily
 chained him to the r&ocirc;le of the drug-wrecked artist and to the environment
 of the Sanctuary. The underworld had eyes and ears, and so too had the police;
 while, still more to be feared as one who seemed to reach out with cunning
 versatility into so many different spheres, as one who, of all others, would
 have his suspicions the most quickly aroused, there was the Phantom. Jimmie
 Dale, if he had returned to his ordinary life, would have had to do so with
 a bandaged face curiously like Smarlinghue&rsquo;s! It invited far too much!
 And so he had telephoned to Jason, that peer of butlers, that he had been called
 out of town for a few days; and whatever personal fears the old man might have
 entertained for the safety of his young master, whom, as he was wont to say,
 he had dandled on his knee as a child, Jason could be trusted to account, both
 ingeniously and to the entire satisfaction of any one interested, for the temporary
 absence of Jimmie Dale from his usual haunts.</p>
<p> In a personal sense, therefore, there had been no serious cause for anxiety;
 but in those four days it seemed, somehow, as though a wall, impenetrable,
 thick, had been reared across his path, halting him, and shutting out from
 both sight and hearing those things that concerned him far more than the consideration
 of his own security. There had been no word from the Tocsin, no note, no sign,
 no straw of evidence out of the whispered confidences in the hidden places
 of the underworld that he could grasp at as indicative of even her continued
 existence. The old question gnawed at his heart. Was she still alive to-night?
 What move had the Phantom made in those four days, and if any, had the man
 with his hell-born cunning been at last successful?</p>
<p> The days had been as a blank. Even Mother Margot had been denied him, for
 no mask could have hidden the bandages from her eyes. But yet, after all, he
 had not been idle. He had done what he could. The wave of notoriety that for
 the moment had swept him to a pinnacle high above his fellows of the underworld
 had seemed to present the only opportunity for activity left open to him, and
 he had seized upon it to cultivate the very men who were unconsciously responsible
 for the ruse to which he had been forced to resort that night in the Sanctuary
 to save his life, the men who had hammered at his door, voicing for the moment
 the one rallying cry that alone could unite the myriad, vicious interests of
 gangland in one common bond, &ldquo;Death to the Gray Seal!&rdquo; And in a
 measure he had been successful, though, as far as results had gone, he might,
 it seemed, have saved himself the effort. Bunty Myers, Muller and the rest&mdash;Gentleman
 Laroque&rsquo;s, alias the Phantom&rsquo;s, gang&mdash;had admitted him, rather
 pleased to bask in his reflected glory, to their hang-out in the upstairs rear
 room of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s ill-favoured &ldquo;club,&rdquo; which was
 half restaurant, half gambling den, and the resort of the worst in the Bad
 Lands, but he had learned nothing. They had loafed and smoked and played cards
 and drunk an amazing quantity of liquor, but that was all. There had always
 been Bunty Myers and Muller, and at times as many as three or four more, but
 had he, Jimmie Dale, not known that back of it all Gentleman Laroque, unseen,
 held these men in allegiance, he never would have discovered it there!</p>
<p> He had learned nothing; but though to-night, for perhaps the first time,
 he could have dispensed with the bandages to the extent of at least being able
 to use the black silk mask without the risk of Mother Margot suspecting the
 tell-tale hurt that lay beneath, he was on his way now to Kerrigan&rsquo;s
 again as the first part of his night&rsquo;s work. Afterwards&mdash;He shrugged
 his shoulders. Afterwards he would see! Certainly there was always a chance
 at Kerrigan&rsquo;s. He felt that he had already worked himself into an intimacy
 that was not far from breeding confidences. Their apparent inaction was also
 not without its measure of satisfaction, and this in itself alone was worth
 knowing. It might very well, and probably did, augur that the Phantom too was
 for the moment inactive, that there was a momentary stagnation, as it were,
 in that master crook&rsquo;s field of endeavour, and&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stopped short. He was opposite the swinging doors of a saloon,
 run by one Gypsy Dan, from which there emanated a stentorian-lunged voice high-pitched
 in song, accompanied by the thumping of many fists evidently upon the bar,
 and the stamping of many feet obviously upon the floor. Subconsciously, he
 was now aware, he had heard the row half a block away. It was not by any means
 a select and exclusive neighbourhood; it was one more of squalor than anything
 else and accustomed to disturbances more strenuous and decidedly more vicious
 than this, but it was at least within the purlieus of the city and supposedly
 under the domination of law and order. And now from the opposite corner ahead
 he caught the ray of a street lamp glinting on the rubber-cloaked shoulders
 of an officer, as the man crossed the street and headed for the saloon.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue, smiled thinly. Whoever they were in there, they
 were friends of Smarlinghue, the riff-raff, the rank and file of the citizenry
 of that sordid fatherland of the underworld in which he held so high a station!
 The character of Gypsy Dan&rsquo;s saloon guaranteed that. He turned quickly,
 pushed the swinging doors open, and stepped to the side of the ragged, unkempt
 figure at the bar who was yelling at the top of his voice.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; said Smarlinghue roughly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
 harness bull on the move out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The man, too immersed in his vocal efforts and the liquor he had imbibed,
 paid no attention; but the barkeeper was alert in an instant.</p>
<p> &ldquo;T&rsquo;anks, Smarly!&rdquo; he grunted. He leaned across the bar
 and clapped his hand over the singer&rsquo;s mouth, effectually shutting off
 the flow of song. &ldquo;Close yer face!&rdquo; he ordered peremptorily. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;ll
 be Riley out dere, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s all to de good if youse&rsquo;ll give
 him half a chance. D&rsquo;ye hear? Dat goes for de whole of youse!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The half dozen loungers around the bar subsided. Comparative silence reigned
 for a moment, then a slow, measured step sounded outside, a night-stick rattled
 softly on the swinging doors, as though both in warning and in acknowledgment
 that the amenities had been observed, and the step died away.</p>
<p> &ldquo;T&rsquo;anks, Smarly!&rdquo; said the barkeeper again, as he once
 more leaned back against the far side of the bar.</p>
<p> The erstwhile singer blinked.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Have a drink,&rdquo; he invited cordially; and digging into his pocket,
 he produced a fistful of bills which he waved with a lordly, inebriated air
 about him.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stared. A moniker in the Bad Lands was always apt and incisive,
 and it had been particularly so in this instance. He knew the ragged, down-at-the-heels
 vagrant, as everybody else in the East Side knew the man. <i>Beggar</i> Pete! The
 man was known at times to do odd jobs perhaps if pushed to extremity for food
 and particularly for drink, but otherwise he lived a miserable, poverty-stricken
 existence&mdash;not criminal, perhaps, just a drifter, lost to all sense of
 responsibility and self-respect.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, half seriously, half facetiously. &ldquo;Who
 stuck you in his will, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Some one at the bar guffawed.</p>
<p> &ldquo;A nice old geezer wid gold spectacles dat Pete croaked wid a black-jack,&rdquo; said
 the man. &ldquo;Dere wasn&rsquo;t no one else to inherit wot was in de stiff&rsquo;s
 pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Beggar Pete swung suddenly upon the speaker.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s a damn lie!&rdquo; he shouted furiously. &ldquo;Youse
 t&rsquo;inks youse&rsquo;re funny, don&rsquo;t youse? Well, mabbe youse won&rsquo;t
 laugh so loud wid a bust face&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale edged in between the two men. Beggar Pete was huge-framed and,
 in spite of dissipation, muscular, and his face, working with rage, was indicative
 of a row that would bring more than Riley rapping softly in admonition with
 his night-stick on the swinging doors.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll have a drink,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, diplomatically.
 He nodded to the barkeeper. &ldquo;Suds for mine!&rdquo; Then to Beggar Pete: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
 how, Pete!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Beggar Pete&rsquo;s scowl gradually subsided.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;re all right, Smarly!&rdquo; he said. He grew suddenly
 confidential. &ldquo;Say, it came my way all right, an&rsquo; &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
 more&rsquo;n half an hour ago, neither. I&rsquo;ll tell youse. I was walkin&rsquo; along
 an&rsquo; broke for fair, an&rsquo; an old gent goes brushin&rsquo; by in a
 hurry in de rain. De Mouser t&rsquo;inks he&rsquo;s funny, but de old geezer
 did have gold spectacles &rsquo;cause just after he gets by me he stops an&rsquo; reaches
 into his pocket for a box of matches, an&rsquo; I sees his face under de umbrella
 as he lights his cigar. Den he goes on again, an&rsquo; as he puts de box of
 matches back in his pocket I sees somet&rsquo;ing drop out on de sidewalk.
 I slips along an&rsquo; grabs it up.&rdquo; Beggar Pete licked his lips, and
 scowled again at the little crowd. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his purse, dat&rsquo;s
 wot it is, an&rsquo; a fat one. I ain&rsquo;t no saint, an&rsquo; jest den
 I t&rsquo;ought me luck was out, &rsquo;cause I t&rsquo;ought he looked &lsquo;round
 an&rsquo; saw me pickin&rsquo; it up, so I runs after him an&rsquo; hands it
 back. Say, he slips me wot I t&rsquo;ought was one buck, an&rsquo; wot I guess
 he t&rsquo;ought was only one too, but w&rsquo;en I gets into Kelly&rsquo;s
 place dat was near dere an&rsquo; had a snifter it took all de money in de
 cash register to make change&mdash;see? Fifty, dat&rsquo;s wot it was&mdash;a
 fifty-dollar bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, den,&rdquo; suggested one of the crowd to whom the story had
 evidently been retailed before, &ldquo;set &rsquo;em up again, Pete&mdash;youse
 must be dry talkin&rsquo; about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, included in the invitation which Beggar Pete promptly accorded,
 shook his head and left the place.</p>
<p> He smiled a little curiously to himself as he went on again through the rain.
 It was an incident, that was all; an incident that could have no bearing on
 him in a personal way, that could carry with it no significance so far as he
 was concerned, save that it was one of the many little cross-sections of life,
 queer, bizarre, a scratch under the surface of things, here in the Bad Lands.
 Yet, naturally enough, it remained uppermost in his thoughts for a few moments
 as he walked along.</p>
<p> He knew Beggar Pete, and he was not at all convinced by Beggar Pete&rsquo;s
 story. Benevolent, gold-spectacled gentlemen were not in the habit of handing
 out fifty-dollar bills&mdash;even on a dark and rainy night! There would always
 be a street lamp within a few paces under whose light the award could be made
 without any mistake on the donor&rsquo;s part. A five-dollar bill for the service
 Beggar Pete had rendered&mdash;yes; a fifty-dollar bill&mdash;no. He found
 himself growing more and more skeptical. Indeed, he was not sure, for instance,
 that the gibe the lounger at the bar had flung at Beggar Pete had not more
 nearly hit the truth, to the extent at least that Beggar Pete had come by the
 money by methods that would not stand any very close scrutiny.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders. One thing at least seemed certain. Beggar
 Pete would sooner or later come to grief, and perhaps the sooner the better.
 There were too many Beggar Petes who had drifted on the reefs to become broken
 hulks, worthless to themselves and a menace to others!</p>
<p> He drew his coat collar closer around his throat. What a beastly night! Head
 down against the storm, he ploughed along. Thank Heaven, he was not far from
 Kerrigan&rsquo;s now&mdash;just around the next corner. For all its evil-smelling,
 reeking atmosphere, where about the only air there was stole in like a sneak
 thief through the broken window pane that was covered with cardboard, there
 would be even <i>physical</i> comfort to-night in the company of Bunty Myers and his
 fellow gangsters in that upstairs back room! There would even be a sort of
 compensation in the fact that he was under cover and in shelter should the
 real object of his visit, as it probably would, prove as futile to-night as
 it had in the past. His face hardened suddenly. What was the matter with him?
 Was he growing childish, his thoughts feeble-minded and astray? Shelter! A
 bit of a rain storm! Where was the Tocsin to-night? Where was she? What was
 <i>sheltering</i> her from a storm, not of pattering rain drops, but from one where
 every moment her life itself stood in peril, where her&mdash;</p>
<p> He raised his head. Along the street, through the murk, he noticed a shadowy
 form, the only other pedestrian in sight. It was too far off in the storm to
 distinguish even whether it was a woman, or a man wearing what might be a long
 raincoat, but strangely enough, unaccountably enough, yet nevertheless existent
 in his mind was the consciousness of something familiar about the figure. And
 then, almost the next moment, his impression was verified in a measure that
 brought every faculty, alert and tense now, into instant action. The figure
 was turning the corner, passing under the street lamp. It was Mother Margot!</p>
<p> He did not quicken his pace. He was Smarlinghue! His lips tightened grimly.
 Mother Margot owed the man she knew as the Gray Seal her life, but how far
 her gratitude extended he did not know&mdash;perhaps not at all in view of
 the fact that her life would not have been in jeopardy if the Gray Seal had
 not literally forced her into the situation that had so nearly proved fatal
 to her that night at Pedler Joe&rsquo;s! In any case, it would be trusting
 her very far, too far, farther than he would ever dream of doing, if he risked
 the consequences of handing himself over utterly to her mercy in allowing even
 a suspicion to arise in her mind that the Gray Seal and Smarlinghue were one!
 A word of that, a hint, and Smarlinghue, the idol now of the underworld, would
 know instead a hatred and a vengeance that would not only bring exposure and
 disgrace to the name of Jimmie Dale, not only play into the Phantom&rsquo;s
 hands and leave the Tocsin to stand alone, as prompted by that brave, unselfish
 love of hers she sought to do, but would cost him his life as well. And so,
 as Smarlinghue, though that was Mother Margot there, he could make no move
 to intercept her.</p>
<p> But in a moment more he reached the corner. Mother Margot had disappeared.
 He nodded his head. She had gone in through Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s side entrance,
 her objective beyond question of doubt that upstairs room at the back.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved swiftly now. At last, then, there was something afoot again.
 Mother Margot was the mouthpiece of the &ldquo;Voice,&rdquo; as she called
 the Phantom. For a moment he experienced a sense of chagrin that he should
 have lost those few minutes in Gypsy Dan&rsquo;s saloon, for otherwise he would
 have been upstairs with Bunty Myers and the rest on Mother Margot&rsquo;s arrival,
 and Smarlinghue would have been introduced to Mother Margot, and&mdash;He shook
 his head again. No! He had lost nothing. His intimacy had not <i>quite</i> reached
 the point where they would talk before him. They would more likely have kicked
 him out. It was much better as it was; better that Smarlinghue should not have
 been in evidence at all if the aftermath of this visit of Mother Margot meant
 anything that would bring him into any game that might be played to-night.</p>
<p> And now he smiled with grim whimsicality as his thought of <i>shelter</i> came back
 to him. Instead of the back room upstairs, if he was to have any part in the
 proceedings whatever, he was much more likely to be a silent and unobtrusive
 occupant of the fire escape outside the window, than which he could imagine
 no place less sheltered or more uncomfortable in New York that night!</p>
<p> The door of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s side entrance closed silently behind Jimmie
 Dale. It was utterly dark here. The clientele that favored Kerrigan with its
 patronage, in so far as this portion of his premises was concerned, made no
 demand for any such extravagance as light! A footstep sounded from above, a
 woman&rsquo;s footstep; it died away, and a door closed. Mother Margot had
 run true to form!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved forward as a shadow moves, and began to mount the narrow
 stairway with which he was already so well acquainted. There was no sound.
 It was the silence learned in the days of the old Sanctuary on the creaky,
 rickety stairs there, where an untrained step would have sounded the alarm
 from top to bottom of the tenement.</p>
<p> He gained the landing. There were three or four rooms here, he knew, but
 save for a tiny thread of light that seeped out under the threshold of the
 rear room, which was the rendezvous of Laroque&rsquo;s gang, everything was
 in darkness. It was early yet, which might be one reason, and the stormy night
 another, why the other rooms were as yet evidently unoccupied.</p>
<p> And now he was crouching against the door itself, his ear pressed against
 the panel. It was a possibility, that was all&mdash;a possible alternative
 to the uninviting fire escape. Again he shook his head, then turned swiftly
 to the window almost at his elbow that gave on the rear of the little hall.
 He had caught the sound of movement through the panels, even the sound of voices,
 but the words had been hopelessly indistinguishable.</p>
<p> Cautiously he opened the window, slipped out on the fire escape, and, against
 the possibility of any of the occupants of the room stepping out into the hall
 to notice an opened window, he closed it again behind him. Another moment,
 and, flat on his face, he had crept along the iron platform until he lay beneath
 the window of the rear room. He would be able to hear now. He had taken no
 chances on that score. Open or closed, the window above him with its square
 of cardboard tacked over the broken pane could hardly be improved upon for
 his purpose. And now, keeping a little back from the wall, he raised himself
 up and peered in. Mother Margot was talking excitedly, gesticulating with her
 hands, while gathered around her at the table were Muller, Bunty Myers, and
 two men he had met there before, who, leaving aside a score of aliases, were
 known as the Kitten and Spud MacGuire.</p>
<p> A pretty quartette! Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips thinned, as, the sense of sight
 gratified, he shifted his position, placing his ear as close to the edge of
 the window casing as he dared without exposing himself to the risk of being
 seen. Yes, he could hear now, but&mdash;a dismayed frown furrowed his forehead&mdash;Mother
 Margot appeared already to have imparted whatever information had brought her
 there.</p>
<p> &ldquo;...Youse understand, don&rsquo;t youse?&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;&rsquo;cause
 if youse have got it straight, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to beat it outer dis,
 an&rsquo; get home an&rsquo; get dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It kinder took de wind outer us, dat&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; Bunty Myers&rsquo; voice
 responded in a puzzled growl. &ldquo;I t&rsquo;ought de whole works was blown
 up an&rsquo; we was done!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I told youse once,&rdquo; snapped Mother Margot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
 de panel in de wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Bunty Myers. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t deef, an&rsquo; we
 got dat, all right&mdash;de middle one at de back of de room. But, den, wot&rsquo;s
 de use of waitin&rsquo;?&rdquo; He broke into a coarse, unpleasant laugh. &ldquo;I
 guess old Miser Scroff ain&rsquo;t at home to queer anythin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;De use of waitin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned Mother Margot tartly, &ldquo;is &rsquo;cause
 de Chief says so, an&rsquo; &rsquo;cause some of youse pulled a bum play dat
 he&rsquo;s got to make good, an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be de one dat
 done it &rsquo;cause de Chief is seein&rsquo; red. Anyway, don&rsquo;t youse
 make no mistakes again. Youse ain&rsquo;t to make a move until as near ten
 as&rsquo;ll give youse time to get away wid it, but youse&rsquo;re to be through
 by den, &rsquo;cause at ten de bulls get tipped off.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Bunty Myers. And then abruptly, as Mother
 Margot evidently started to leave the room: &ldquo;Say, wait a minute, mother!
 Mabbe youse have got de answer to somethin&rsquo; we&rsquo;se can&rsquo;t figure
 out. Wot&rsquo;s de big idea behind de Chief&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; under cover?
 We ain&rsquo;t seen him for weeks&mdash;nothin&rsquo; but telephones an&rsquo; messages.
 Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t youse ask him?&rdquo; suggested Mother Margot acidly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Ask him!&rdquo; echoed Bunty Myers helplessly. &ldquo;How de hell
 can I, w&rsquo;en I don&rsquo;t know where&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de answer!&rdquo; Mother Margot&rsquo;s interruption was
 a cackling laugh. &ldquo;Youse knows all I knows. Do youse t&rsquo;ink me an&rsquo; de
 Chief goes to a picture show every evenin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; den spends de rest
 of de night together eatin&rsquo; hot frankfurters an&rsquo; stewed ice cream?
 Say, youse give me a pain! Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The door in the hall closed.</p>
<p> For an instant Jimmie Dale stood motionless, then he turned, and, in lieu
 of an exit via the hall window, began to make his way down the fire escape.
 And now what? Go to Mother Margot as the Gray Seal and force a detailed explanation
 from her as he had the other night? He shook his head. It wasn&rsquo;t necessary
 to-night, was it? He had learned enough, hadn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p> His mind was working swiftly, in a precise, virile way, as he descended the
 wet, dripping iron treads. The middle panel at the back of old Miser Scroff&rsquo;s
 room&mdash;and old Miser Scroff was not at home. That was clear enough. And
 there was no question but that Miser Scroff had money hidden away somewhere.
 It was only a wonder that it had not been taken from him before. The old man
 was almost senile. It was common property on the East Side that he had been
 caught fondling and crooning over packages of banknotes in his room on more
 than one occasion. For more years than any one could remember the man, already
 old, had just kept on growing older in a solitary life in his sordid surroundings.
 He was supposed to have a small income from some source, but however small
 it might have been it was certain he saved on it for he never spent a cent
 save to keep absolute famine from his door. Undoubtedly he had money. Robbery,
 therefore, as the motive, was equally clear. And at ten o&rsquo;clock, for
 some reason, the police were to be notified of the crime by the actual perpetrators
 themselves. Ten o&rsquo;clock. It could not be much after nine yet. There should
 be at least half an hour then before Bunty Myers need be considered as a factor.
 Meanwhile the Phantom was at work in an effort to rectify some misplay made
 by his underlings. Was it at Miser Scroff&rsquo;s that the Phantom in person
 would be employed prior to the arrival of Bunty Myers and his confederates?
 Was it luck like that? Luck at last! If so, then&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale dropped from the bottom of the fire escape to the ground. And
 then, in the shelter of the lane where the fire escape had landed him, he broke
 instantly into a run.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Not as Smarlinghue,&rdquo; confided Jimmie Dale grimly to himself
 as he ran. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t risk Smarlinghue&mdash;it&rsquo;s got to be
 the other way in spite of a patched face.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  The Panelled Wall</b></h2>
<p> Jimmie Dale, a long coat, sodden with rain, covering his evening clothes,
 crept up the narrow tenement stairs, crept along a bare and dirty hallway,
 and halted before a closed door. Softly, cautiously, he tried the door. It
 was locked. His fingers reached in under his outer garments, and then shot
 swiftly to the door again. There was a moment of utter silence, then a faint
  <i>snip</i>, and the door began to open guardedly, the fraction of an inch at a time.
 Another instant and Jimmie Dale stood inside the room.</p>
<p> The door closed behind him. A minute he listened, then the round, white ray
 from his flashlight lanced through the blackness, swept its surroundings in
 a swift, comprehensive circle&mdash;and a low, startled exclamation, involuntary,
 before it could be checked, came from Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips. This was old
 Miser Scroff&rsquo;s squalid, hovel-like abode, niggardly alike in its furnishings
 and its cleanliness, since even cleanliness cost money&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;it
 was strange! He did not understand! He had not been very long on his trip to
 the Sanctuary and back. It had not taken him long. Certainly it could not even
 yet be half-past nine. And yet it seemed as though, in spite of that, he was
 already too late.</p>
<p> The flashlight circled again, but more slowly this time, as though puzzled
 and nonplussed itself. The small room was in dire confusion. The bedding from
 the cheap cot was flung here and there on the floor; the drawers of an old
 desk had been pulled out and their contents strewn about, and the desk itself
 had been hacked to pieces as though on the chance that it might have possessed
 a hidden receptacle; while even the ragged strip of oilcloth, that was the
 sole floor covering, had been ripped up and flung into a corner. Where a hiding
 place might have existed before, there existed now nothing but a pitiful state
 of wreckage!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s mind seemed to echo the confusion. It did not seem possible
 that Bunty Myers and his companions could already have been here. And besides&mdash;the
 flashlight&rsquo;s ray shot suddenly to the rear of the room&mdash;what had
 all this to do with the panelled wall?</p>
<p> An ironic smile tinged his lips now. Yes, it might by a stretch of imagination
 be called panelled, but it was simply an extra height of boarding that ran
 up to meet the plaster all around the room some three or four feet from the
 flooring. He stepped quickly across the room, and knelt, as nearly as he could
 judge his position by the flashlight, in front of the middle boards. He nodded
 grimly. These were at least intact if nothing else in the room was! From a
 pocket in the leather girdle around his waist he drew out now a small, but
 incredibly strong and powerful &ldquo;jimmy.&rdquo; It would have been a useless
 waste of time to seek for any secret spring that, while it probably existed,
 was also certainly well and cleverly hidden.</p>
<p> He was working rapidly now, the point of the &ldquo;jimmy&rdquo; prying tentatively
 into, and up and down, the joints of the boards. A low-breathed exclamation
 of satisfaction came almost instantly from his lips. The &ldquo;jimmy&rdquo; had
 slipped through one of the cracks into an open space behind. It was here, then,
 the hiding place of old Miser Scroff&rsquo;s hoard that Bunty Myers&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stood suddenly erect, tense, every muscle rigid, listening. A
 footstep, low and stealthy though it was, had caught his ear from the hall
 outside. It was not another lodger, it was too cautious for that, too guarded;
 and for the same reason it could not be Miser Scroff. It was not Bunty Myers
 and his confederates, because there was only one footstep. The Phantom, then!
 The Phantom had required time for something somewhere. And he, Jimmie Dale,
 had dared to hope that it might be here. Luck! If he was in luck at last, he
 would play it to the full. He was crossing the room swiftly, without a sound.
 There would be a settlement this time from which there would be no escape!
 It was almost at the door now, that footstep; but he, too, was at the door&mdash;on
 the inside, crouched against the wall.</p>
<p> A grim smile twisted his lips as he stood there, his automatic flung forward,
 his flashlight ready in his left hand. Here was a good place for that settlement,
 here in old Miser Scroff&rsquo;s room, here on the scene of one of the Phantom&rsquo;s
 hell-hatched crimes&mdash;there could be no better place for that <i>final</i> reckoning!</p>
<p> The doorknob turned, the door began to open slowly. A form, shadowy, a little
 blacker than the surrounding blackness, bulked in the opening, then stole across
 the threshold, and the door closed.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale spoke in a cold, merciless whisper, as the stream of
 his flashlight cut through the black, and his automatic lifted to a level with
 the line of light:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Put up your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> The sentence died on his lips. It seemed to Jimmie Dale that the room was
 whirling around him, that he was robbed of all power of movement, that his
 brain had lost the faculty of reason. The light was boring into a pair of brown
 eyes, startled, it was true, but brave, calm, self-reliant brown eyes that
 looked out from a wondrously glorious face, the only face in all the world.
 And then his pulses leaped, and the blood in a furious tide went whipping through
 his veins. The Tocsin! The Tocsin! Was he mad? Could it be true? The Tocsin!</p>
<p> &ldquo;Marie!&rdquo; he cried out hoarsely.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jimmie! Is it you? I could not see with the light in my eyes. Oh,
 Jimmie!&rdquo; Her voice faltered. Relief was there, but relief was not the
 note he caught; it was love, yearning, the woman&rsquo;s soul that was in her
 tones.</p>
<p> The flashlight, the automatic, were thrust into his pockets. She was in his
 arms. He held her close. Years had gone since he had held her there before!
 He had fought for this, risked all and everything for this, hoped for it when
 hope itself seemed dead, and now she was here, close to him, clinging to him&mdash;and
 it was not just for the moment, not just a stolen, pitiful instant out of all
 eternity, but for always, for all time. He had her now. She would never go
 again. There was no power on earth would keep him from her side now!</p>
<p> Half laughing, half crying, she struggled to free herself a little.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that you
 are terribly <i>strong</i>, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p> He released her a little, grudgingly, but still he held her close. His lips
 found hers, her eyes, her hair&mdash;the dark silken strands that, playing
 truant from under her hat, swept his face.</p>
<p> Her hand had crept up and found his mask, slipped under it, and was resting
 gently against the strips of plaster on his cheek.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I know of course about the night when&mdash;when you got this,&rdquo; she
 said brokenly. &ldquo;All the underworld has been talking about Smarlinghue.
 They very nearly caught you, Jimmie. Oh, Jimmie, why will you do it? I have
 begged you so, done all I could to keep you out of this. And now to-night again!
 What are you doing here? What brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p> His arms tightened about her again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;To find you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> She drew away in amazement, her hands on his shoulders now, holding him at
 arms&rsquo;-length.</p>
<p> &ldquo;To find me!&rdquo; she echoed helplessly. &ldquo;But how could you
 have expected to find me here? You did not know. I sent you no note, no word,
 for after I heard about that night at Pedler Joe&rsquo;s and what happened
 later in the Sanctuary, I made up my mind not to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> He laid his hand softly across her lips.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I have not been anywhere, done anything, since that night on the East
 River, Marie,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;except with the one end in view
 of finding you. And had I not found you again now I should still have kept
 on in the same way. I&rsquo;m quite sure you know every move that Smarlinghue
 has made, and you therefore ought to know that I have already gone too far,
 that I&rsquo;ve already been too close to the Phantom more than once to have
 let anything you did keep me out of this, Marie. The fewer the notes, the more
 I should have worried, and the harder I should have worked. But that&rsquo;s
 all at an end now, thank God! There&rsquo;ll be no more separation. We&rsquo;ll
 work together from now on until we&rsquo;ve found the Phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p> For a moment she did not answer, then she turned her head away.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, Jimmie!&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I cannot! I will not!
 Nothing has been changed since that night on the East River. I cannot prevent
 you from doing as you have been doing, but there is a great difference between
 your actions as the Gray Seal and as one who is known to be working hand in
 glove with Marie LaSalle. It&mdash;it would make it almost impossible for me
 to go on, for I&mdash;I could not do anything then without the fear of putting
 your life in danger. Oh, Jimmie, you do not know, you do not understand, and&mdash;and
 I cannot tell you!&rdquo; She turned quickly toward him again. &ldquo;Go, Jimmie,
 please&mdash;at once. There is something that I must do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale reached out for the door.</p>
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go together, Marie&mdash;now,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;I
 heard Mother Margot talking about Scroff&rsquo;s panel here. I was on the fire
 escape outside Kerrigan&rsquo;s place. That&rsquo;s what you mean, isn&rsquo;t
 it? But <i>you</i> are what <i>I</i> came for, so we&rsquo;ll go, for there is nothing else
 that counts here now against the risk of you being caught by Bunty Myers and
 his crowd, to say nothing of old Miser Scroff himself turning up any minute
 to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Miser Scroff is dead,&rdquo; she interrupted dully.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; he repeated in a startled way.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Murdered,&rdquo; she said. And then her voice broke again. &ldquo;Oh,
 Jimmie, I have failed miserably to-night. I&mdash;I have cost a man his life,
 I am afraid. The least I can do now is to keep them from getting the money&mdash;it&rsquo;s
 in an old leather bag behind the panel&mdash;but that I must do. You&mdash;you
 must let me work this out, Jimmie. I have no choice. If you force me out of
 here, or if you insist on staying to help me, then in an hour, two hours, somehow,
 Jimmie, I warn you frankly that I will get away from you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will&mdash;not this time, Marie!&rdquo; said
 Jimmie Dale grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you now, and I&rsquo;m going to keep
 you no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She smiled at him wanly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Very well, Jimmie, if you think so,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Only
 remember what I have said. Meanwhile there is the panel. <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t go until
 I have got the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She started across the room, only to stumble over the broken desk. And then
 Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s flashlight was in play again, and he followed her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Murdered, you said!&rdquo; He spoke quickly. &ldquo;Why? I don&rsquo;t
 understand. And I don&rsquo;t understand what has happened here. The place
 has been turned inside out.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;The panel, Jimmie!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s near the
 middle. Get it open! I&rsquo;ll tell you while you work.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I had already found it before you came in,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale
 coolly. He was kneeling by the wall, the &ldquo;jimmy&rdquo; in his hand again. &ldquo;Go
 on, Marie!&rdquo;</p>
<p> A joint in the wood gave with a low, rending, creaking sound. She stood at
 his shoulder, whispering swiftly:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Some of the gang under the Phantom&rsquo;s orders inveigled Miser
 Scroff down somewhere in the neighbourhood of that old junk yard near Kelly&rsquo;s
 saloon, with the intention of keeping him out of the way for an hour or two
 while the rest of them came here and searched for his money. But Scroff was
 an old man, and the blow he was hit by the black-jack killed him; and the search
 here resulted in nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The &ldquo;jimmy&rdquo; pried away a narrow board from top to bottom. Jimmie
 Dale reached in his hand. Yes, there was something in here, a bag of some kind.</p>
<p> &ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And if you know
 it, where was the Phantom all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Under cover,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I told you long ago that
 he was a man with a score of domiciles and a score of aliases. Lately he has
 been driven from one to another&mdash;and robbed of some of them by the Gray
 Seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale swiftly. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve
 lost your case, now, Marie. It would appear, then, that the Gray Seal has been
 of service, so why should you attempt to keep him at a distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Her hand found and touched his shoulder.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Jimmie,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Shall we
 call it a woman&rsquo;s inconsistency? I cannot give you any other answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Another board came loose. Jimmie Dale frowned. What was the matter? He was
 not working with his usual deftness and silence. It seemed as though the creaking
 of the board could be heard throughout the building.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You said you had failed miserably to-night, and that you were afraid
 you had cost a man his life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You mean Miser Scroff?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said heavily. &ldquo;I did not know anything about
 to-night until after Miser Scroff was killed. That brought the Phantom into
 it in a personal way. There had been no murder intended, and failure to find
 anything here would otherwise have ended the matter; but in old Miser Scroff&rsquo;s
 pocket they found, besides some stock certificates made out in his name, a
 dirty old piece of paper with a tracing of his room upon it, and a position
 on the rear wall marked with an arrow, so they knew then where the money was.
 But this was after the first search had been made and the room torn to pieces
 as you see it, and though they knew then where the money was, there was a <i>murder</i> that had to be covered up.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale drew out a worn yellow leather bag from the aperture. He opened
 it, and uttered a sharp exclamation. It was crammed full of loose banknotes.</p>
<p> &ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; he asked for the second time, as
 he shut the bag.</p>
<p> The Tocsin shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It is useless to ask me, Jimmie,&rdquo; she said steadily. &ldquo;If
 I told you, I might as well enter into the partnership with you that you are
 so insistent upon&mdash;it would amount to the same thing. I cannot tell you.
 I can only tell you that I know the Phantom means to plant the crime on some
 outsider&rsquo;s shoulders, some one he has picked out as <i>suitable</i>, a seedy
 character who&mdash;it&rsquo;s horrible, Jimmie!&mdash;will not have a chance
 for his life. The securities with Scroff&rsquo;s name on them are to be placed
 under the innocent victim&rsquo;s mattress; then, with the panel rifled here,
 the police are to be tipped off about the murder, and where to find the &lsquo;murderer&rsquo; and
 the evidence. I did my best; I did all I could, but&mdash;but I lost the trail,
 and so I came here to save at least the money, and as a sort of last hope that
 somehow I might pick up the clue again. The only thing I am sure of is that
 the Phantom was playing the part of an old gentleman with gold spectacles to-night,
 and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale had taken the Tocsin&rsquo;s arm, and, carrying the bag, had
 started back for the door; but now he halted suddenly as though rooted to the
 spot, and stared at her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;An old gentleman with gold spectacles!&rdquo; he ejaculated sharply.</p>
<p> She caught at his sleeve.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she whispered tensely. &ldquo;You&mdash;you know something
 about it! You&mdash;you&rsquo;ve seen him! You know who it is they mean to
 railroad to his death for this?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The room, his surroundings, even the Tocsin, had fled from Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 consciousness for the moment; instead, there came again the scene in Gypsy
 Dan&rsquo;s saloon, when Beggar Pete had told his story, which he, Jimmie Dale,
 had but so short a time ago dismissed almost summarily from his mind as having
 no personal significance for him. Beggar Pete and the gentleman with the gold
 spectacles! Beggar Pete and his sudden affluence! He had not believed Beggar
 Pete then, but he believed him now. There was no shadow of doubt but that Beggar
 Pete was the Phantom&rsquo;s intended cat&rsquo;s-paw, and that the snare was
 the low, viciously-cunning handiwork of the Phantom. Beggar Pete&rsquo;s story,
 once those securities were found beneath his mattress, would, out of its own
 improbability, only <i>assure</i> the man&rsquo;s conviction. Nobody knew how much
 or how little cash Miser Scroff had had! So this was what the Phantom wanted
 that extra time for&mdash;to plant those securities. God, if he could <i>catch</i> the Phantom at Beggar Pete&rsquo;s! No! There was the Tocsin here&mdash;he
 had her now&mdash;he would never leave her again. And besides it was too late
 now. He knew where Beggar Pete lived because of late it had been almost a source
 of gossip on the East Side, for the simple reason that, for perhaps the first
 time in his life, Beggar Pete now had a <i>permanent</i> address&mdash;the cellar
 of a somewhat questionable lodging house run by a yegg named Harry the Dip&mdash;and
 this in return for the more than questionable agreement on Beggar Pete&rsquo;s
 part to make himself generally useful when called upon to do so! It was a long
 way to Beggar Pete&rsquo;s&mdash;almost across the whole of the East Side.
 The Phantom would have completed his work by now, or at least long before he,
 Jimmie Dale, could reach Beggar Pete&rsquo;s lodging, and that would&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;You <i>know!</i> Oh, thank God!&rdquo; she cried tremulously. &ldquo;And
 I&mdash;I was so afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It is Beggar Pete,&rdquo; he answered mechanically.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Then quick, Jimmie!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;There is not an instant
 to lose. You must get those securities before the police do!&rdquo;</p>
<p> He did not move.</p>
<p> She shook frantically at his sleeve.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You see that, don&rsquo;t you, Jimmie?&rdquo; she cried again. &ldquo;Oh,
 there&rsquo;s not an instant, not a second to spare&mdash;and besides, the
 rest of them will be here any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He looked at her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the bag of money and see that it reaches the authorities,&rdquo; she
 replied quickly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be hampered with that. It will be all
 you can do to win the race against the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said fiercely. &ldquo;Let you get away out of my life
 again? Not for a dozen Beggar Petes!&rdquo;</p>
<p> A strange smile, wistful, drooped her lips; and suddenly her eyes were wet;
 and as suddenly she reached up and drew his face to hers and kissed him.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You are too big a man for that, Jimmie,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And
 there is no other way, and&mdash;and, besides, you know what I have told you.
 You are too big a man for that, Jimmie, and that&mdash;that is why I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He held her close.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
 been more planted on him than you know anything about; enough so that the robbery
 here would almost cast suspicion on Beggar Pete without the securities being
 found at all. He has been spending more money in the saloons to-night than
 he ever had in all his life before; and he is accounting for its possession
 in a manner that no one would believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a way out of that,&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;A
 way that the Gray Seal has taken before. Take it again now, Jimmie&mdash;because
 it&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s way, <i>my</i> man&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He knew what she meant, but he did not answer. She was gathered in his arms.
 He could not let her go. He had given his all to find her&mdash;he could not
 let her go.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; she said, steadying her voice with an effort, &ldquo;every
 second that we stand here may mean that it has cost a man his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p> With a low cry that seemed wrenched from him in agony, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 hands dropped to his sides. Through the darkness, that was now a strange mist
 before his eyes, he saw her pick up the leather bag. And then her whisper came
 to him:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Thank God for you, Jimmie! I&rsquo;ll stand guard at the door until
 you&rsquo;re through.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He found himself at the rear of the room again, working with frantic speed
 in front of the broken panelling. He knew what she meant; it must be his mind,
 of course, that was functioning, governing him, and yet his actions seemed
 purely mechanical. From the leather girdle he drew out the thin metallic case;
 and from the case, with the tiny tweezers, he lifted out a diamond-shaped,
 gray-paper seal. If he succeeded in getting the securities before the police
 did, and if the police found here on the scene of the robbery the insignia
 of the Gray Seal that they knew so well, then Beggar Pete, a worthless, broken
 hulk, would go free, and&mdash;</p>
<p> Her whisper, from the door now, reached him again:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quick, Jimmie! They&rsquo;re coming now. I hear them downstairs. Quick,
 Jimmie, and&mdash;and&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p> It took an instant, no more, to moisten the adhesive side of the paper seal,
 and stick it into place on the edge of the broken panelling; and then Jimmie
 Dale was across the room, and, the door closed behind him, was standing in
 the blackness of the hallway.</p>
<p> She was gone! His face was set and rigid. Perhaps she was still somewhere
 here in the hall; but he could not see, and he did not dare call out. The stealthy
 tread of two or three men was distinctly audible coming up the stairs. He drew
 farther back along the hall and crouched there in the darkness. Low whisperings
 reached him; indistinct forms clustered around the door of Miser Scroff&rsquo;s
 room&mdash;and then the door opened and closed again, and the hall was empty.
 Empty! Where was she? Still here&mdash;still within touch perhaps? A bitter
 smile curved his lips. He was beaten&mdash;beaten by a worthless, broken hulk
 that had drifted on the reefs&mdash;a human wreck!</p>
<p> He was crouched outside the door again, and now silently, quickly, with the
 little steel pick-lock, he locked the men inside. If she were still in the
 hall here, she too would have her chance, enough time to get away before they
 discovered that gray seal in there and came pouring out of the room again!</p>
<p> And then he went down the stairs, and in another instant, the mask removed
 from his face, was outside the tenement, and racing madly through the night.
 And as he went he looked about him. He had hoped for a passing taxi or a vehicle
 of some sort, but there was only the torrential rain. And so he could but run.
 Time! It would take him all of twenty minutes, and it must be later than twenty
 minutes of ten now, and&mdash;he paused for a second under a street lamp to
 consult his watch&mdash;yes, it was a quarter to ten. At ten the Phantom would
 notify the police&mdash;in some anonymous way, of course. But there was still
 a little leeway. Perhaps ten minutes. The time it would take the police to
 get to Beggar Pete&rsquo;s <i>after</i> ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p> He ran on and on. Still no taxis, no vehicles&mdash;only deserted streets.
 It seemed as though he had run for hours. He did not stop to look at his watch
 again. He heard a clock from somewhere boom out the hour.</p>
<p> Was he in time? He glanced up and down the street now, as he halted finally
 before a small, tumble-down, shabby dwelling house. He did not know. At least
 there was no one in sight.</p>
<p> Harry the Dip&rsquo;s door was never locked! His lodgers kept hours too uncertain
 and varied! Jimmie Dale smiled grimly, as slipping suddenly into the shadows
 of the doorway, he stepped silently inside the place. Another item, this choice
 of lodging, even if it were the choice of necessity, that would not help Beggar
 Pete&rsquo;s reputation in a jury&rsquo;s eyes!</p>
<p> The cellar entrance! Where was it? It was dark in here&mdash;but not silent.
 From upstairs he could hear talking and the sound of movement. And then his
 ear caught another sound&mdash;the sound of loud, heavy, stertorous breathing
 that seemed to come from a direction ahead of him. He risked his flashlight.
 He was in a short and narrow hall. And now he advanced cautiously. Yes, here
 it was; and here, too, was the explanation of those laboured, stertorous sounds.
 Under the stairs at the back of the hall, a door stood half open.</p>
<p> The flashlight&rsquo;s ray played down a flight of bare, ladder-like steps&mdash;and
 coincidentally Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face set in hard, bitter lines. At the bottom
 of the steps, a little to one side, in a filthy cellar, sprawled on a torn
 and filthy mattress from which wisps of mildewed straw protruded blatantly,
 Beggar Pete lay in a drunken stupor. The man had already been pretty well along
 at Gypsy Dan&rsquo;s, and in the hour since then it was obvious that he had
 lost no time!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s hand clenched. The sight seemed to fan a latent fury,
 a merciless passion into flame. It was for this, to <i>save</i> this, a vagrant,
 a bum, a drunken sot, a beast, that he had lost all that was most dear to him
 in life to-night; it was for this that he had done what he had never thought
 to do under any circumstances, under any pressure, while life remained to him&mdash;lose
 the Tocsin again if once he ever found her! It seemed to plumb the depths of
 irony; it seemed as though he could <i>wish</i> for nothing better than that this besotted
 beast should experience exactly what the Phantom had prepared for him!</p>
<p> And yet, mechanically, Jimmie Dale went down the cellar stairs. He stooped
 over the man. There was no danger of <i>disturbing</i> Beggar Pete! He pulled the
 man aside, and overturned the mattress. A little bundle of stock certificates,
 held together by a rubber band, lay there. He picked them up. They were made
 out in the name of Heinrich Scroff.</p>
<p> For an instant he stood staring from the certificates in his hand to the
 sprawled form upon the floor&mdash;and slowly, gradually, the hard, embittered
 look on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face softened. Was he so sure after all that he
 had paid too much? In his hand he held the death warrant of an <i>innocent</i> man,
 a fellow creature, sunken, low, it was true, but a human being with hopes and
 fears like his own perhaps, though one, unlike himself, who had had only the
 rougher road to travel, where plenty was unknown and life&rsquo;s sunshine
 meagre.</p>
<p> He stooped again, and replaced the mattress, and laid Beggar Pete upon it.
 He was smiling now softly, as sometimes a woman smiles when her lips mirror
 her heart. And somehow he was glad.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale turned away and went out into the storm again. To-morrow
 the city would awake to find that the Gray Seal had committed another crime!</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  Little Sweeney</b></h2>
<p> The air was heavy with drifting layers of smoke, as it always was in this
 back, upstairs room of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;club,&rdquo; that was
 the hang-out of Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s, alias the Phantom&rsquo;s, gang.
 Four men sat at the table playing stud, and Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue, seated
 a little apart, watched them now as he fumbled with the dirty, frayed sleeves
 and wristbands of his coat and shirt, and, fumbling then in his pocket, drew
 out a hypodermic syringe, its nickel-plating worn and brassy, its general appearance
 as disreputable as himself.</p>
<p> How many nights had he come to this room, as he had come to-night, playing
 a game, that was not a game of cards, with Bunty Myers here, and the Kitten,
 and Muller, and Spud MacGuire! How many nights? He had almost lost track of
 time. The wound in his cheek had healed. He had even resumed, in so far as
 an occasional appearance at the St. James Club, and here and there a social
 function went, his normal life as Jimmie Dale. He must have been coming here
 for many nights!</p>
<p> Through half closed, apparently drug-drowsed eyes, he watched the players
 at the table. Yes, it must have been for many nights. It was over a week since&mdash;his
 fingers tightened involuntarily in a fierce, spasmodic grip upon the hypodermic&mdash;since
 that night when he had held the Tocsin once again in his arms in old Miser
 Scroff&rsquo;s room, and had lost her again. Since then he had continued to
 cultivate these men. They were only pawns, they moved only at the will of that
 unseen yet ever present spirit of evil, the Phantom; but to be one of them
 opened the Avenue of a Thousand Chances that might lead to the Phantom himself.
 He had had no other clue to follow.</p>
<p> But so far nothing had come of it. They did not distrust him&mdash;who in
 the underworld would distrust Smarlinghue, who had the entr&eacute;e everywhere!&mdash;but
 they had made no advances toward offering him full membership in that unhallowed
 fraternity to which he knew they belonged. At times he had believed they had
 been on the verge of doing so, and that applied especially to Bunty Myers,
 who was the Phantom&rsquo;s apparent chief of staff; but there had been nothing
 definite, nothing concrete, nothing tangible.</p>
<p> And yet, even in a negative sense, the nights he had spent here of late had
 not been futile. He was in possession of the fact that there had been <i>inactivity</i>.
 And that meant that the Phantom, whatever might be germinating in that master
 mind of crime, had for the time being been quiescent; and, as a corollary to
 that, the almost certain deduction that no further blow had been struck at
 the Tocsin&mdash;that she was still safe. And this had been borne out by Mother
 Margot, who, so far, had always been the Phantom&rsquo;s mouthpiece. As the
 Gray Seal, and through the hold that, as the Gray Seal, he had upon her, he
 had continued to call her daily from her pushcart to the telephone and question
 her. But she had still protested vehemently each time that she had had no further
 word of any move, and he was satisfied that she was telling the truth for the
 simple reason that he did not believe she would dare do anything else. But,
 even so, unknown to her, he had still maintained, in so far as he could, a
 personal surveillance over her movements, and there had been nothing to disprove
 her statements. She still tended her pushcart in Thompson Street; she still
 lived in those rooms from which the Phantom, in the dual guise of Shiftel,
 the fence, and Gentleman Laroque, who once had openly led this very gang here,
 had so mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p> Smarlinghue&rsquo;s face was vapid, but into the dark eyes behind the creeping
 eyelids there came a troubled gleam. Those rooms where the Voice, as Mother
 Margot called the Phantom, had installed the old hag! What was the secret that
 they held? He was certain that Mother Margot did not know. And twice again,
 of late, in Mother Margot&rsquo;s absence, and despite the Tocsin&rsquo;s warning
 that they were a trap for himself, he had explored them, searched them&mdash;and
 found nothing.</p>
<p> And now the men around the table, the room itself, his immediate surroundings,
 existed only in a subconscious way in Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s mind. That was the
 negative side of the week just past. There was equally the positive side.</p>
<p> Shiftel had returned to the underworld.</p>
<p> Not openly. Not to his old quarters. At first the rumour had flown from mouth
 to mouth through the underground exchanges of the Bad Lands that Shiftel was
 back; that he had been seen a dozen times in the hidden places, the lairs,
 the hang-outs, the breeding dens of vice: that crooks of his old, exclusive
 clientele had talked with him, done business with him. And at first, he, Jimmie
 Dale, had not believed it; and then he had seen the man himself. He was sure
 of it. Shiftel! Isaac Shiftel, alias Gentleman Laroque, alias Limpy Mack, alias
 the Gentleman with the Gold Spectacles&mdash;the Phantom! The man that the
 Tocsin had so truly said possessed a score of domiciles and, yes&mdash;entities&mdash;there
 was no better word, for in each of his disguises the man seemed to have established
 himself as a known and breathing entity in the life and surroundings of the
 particular character which for the moment he might have assumed. As witness
 Shiftel, the fence, known far and wide in the underworld: as witness Gentleman
 Laroque, long the leader of this band here, long the most notorious gangster
 in the Bad Lands.</p>
<p> He had seen Shiftel three nights ago in the Green Dragon, a dance hall of
 unsavoury repute. And Shiftel, the man who was the cause of his, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s,
 return to the life of Smarlinghue and the squalor of the Sanctuary, the man
 who sought the Tocsin&rsquo;s life, the one man that he, Jimmie Dale, would
 gladly have sacrificed his all to bring to a final reckoning and account, had
 escaped him that night in the Green Dragon.</p>
<p> He shook his head, mumbling to himself, almost mechanically continuing to
 play his part in the presence of these underlings around the table even while
 his mind was far away. It was not his fault that Shiftel, once seen, had got
 away. He could not in any fairness hold himself to blame. He had caught but
 a glimpse of the man far across the hall, as in the swirl of the bunny-hug
 the dancers on the polished centre of the floor had opened for a moment and
 closed again. When he had reached the other end of the room Shiftel had disappeared.
 That was all.</p>
<p> It was strange! What was the game? What was the meaning of this reappearance?
 The man was running a tremendous risk, and the motive must certainly be commensurate
 with the danger. What was that motive? Shiftel was wanted, and wanted badly,
 by the police for his connection with the diamonds stolen from Jathan Lane,
 the murdered banker. There was no such person, of course, as Shiftel&mdash;it
 was the Phantom. Shiftel was only one of the Phantom&rsquo;s disguises to be
 put on or off at will. But it was the known character of Shiftel that the police
 sought. Why had the man shown himself in that character, lived it again? He
 need only have discarded it utterly, never returned to it, and as far as &ldquo;Shiftel&rdquo; was
 concerned he could have laughed at the police until the day he died.</p>
<p> What was it? What was at the back of that crafty brain whose evil genius
 had prompted this move? No little thing! Had the Tocsin&rsquo;s note that he,
 Jimmie Dale, had found amongst the mail Jason had handed him when he had appeared
 at home for his lunch yesterday, any bearing on the Phantom&rsquo;s motive?
 He did not think so; rather, out of the ruck of explanations that had suggested
 themselves, and which were for the most part hopelessly untenable, there had
 finally come one that he was almost ready to accept.</p>
<p> Smarlinghue&rsquo;s lips twisted in a grin&mdash;apparently one inspired
 by Spud MacGuire as the man scooped a pot on a bare-faced bluff. Well, why
 not? Even if it was a back-handed compliment to himself! The Phantom was shy
 of funds. Time after time of late he, Jimmie Dale, as the Gray Seal, had forestalled
 the other, and snatched away the fruits of the man&rsquo;s criminal schemes.
 Where, in the past few weeks, the Phantom had counted upon thousands, many
 of them, and had even spent lavishly to pave the way to the expected profits,
 he had received instead not a single penny. The Phantom, therefore, unless
 he possessed the reserve wealth of a Cr&oelig;sus, was certainly shy of funds.
 Yes, that was it. It <i>must</i> be it. And as almost irrefutable evidence of this
 was the fact that the Phantom, as Shiftel, was said to be in communication
 again with some of those who composed that carefully selected circle of crooks
 who had been tried and successful business associates in the past; and that
 was why, too, it was as <i>Shiftel</i>, and not as Limpy Mack, not as Gentleman Laroque,
 or any one of his other aliases, that the Phantom had ventured, cautiously
 it was true, but nevertheless had ventured out into the underworld again.</p>
<p> The Tocsin&rsquo;s note! It came uppermost into his mind now. It was the
 first sign of existence she had given since that night at old Miser Scroff&rsquo;s.</p>
<p> His lips were still twisted in a smile, but there was something cold, forbidding,
 far removed from smiles, that seemed suddenly now to weigh upon his spirits.
 She had written; but it had only been to accentuate, as it were, her decision,
 what she had said that night when he had been so sure of taking his place again
 beside her. Alone! That was it&mdash;alone! It was her love, of course, her
 great unselfish love, that prompted her to try to keep him out of the &ldquo;shadows,&rdquo; out
 of <i>her</i> dangers. The note reiterated it; he knew it word for word:</p>
<p class="note"> &ldquo;Dear Philanthropic Crook:&mdash;I see that you are incorrigible. If
 I thought that it would do any good I would implore you again&mdash;oh, Jimmie,
 I <i>do</i> implore you to leave all this to me, and to go back at once to your own
 life. I am half mad with fear for you. There is something, some trap being
 laid, and I cannot find out what it is. I only know that the Phantom has become
 suspicious that behind the Gray Seal&rsquo;s repeated blows there is more than
 a mere desire to reap where the Phantom has sown. I only know that the Phantom
 is convinced that he himself is the Gray Seal&rsquo;s one and only object;
 and, in turn, the Phantom means to move heaven and earth now to get the Gray
 Seal&mdash;first. Oh, I know you won&rsquo;t do as I ask you! I know you too
 well. I know that, if anything, this hint of danger will perhaps even urge
 you on. But I had to write. I had to warn you because I am afraid, and because
 I know that in some way, with all his hideous cunning behind it, the Phantom
 is laying a trap for you that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Bunty Myers swung around in his chair, and made a grimace at the hypodermic
 syringe with whose needle Jimmie Dale was now pricking the skin of his forearm.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Say, can dat, Smarly!&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;Youse give me nerves.
 Youse&rsquo;ve been monkeyin&rsquo; wid dat squirt gun for de last half hour.
 If it won&rsquo;t work, for Gawd&rsquo;s sake go down to de Chink&rsquo;s,
 or somewhere else, and hit a pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The door opened.</p>
<p> Mechanically Jimmie Dale restored the hypodermic to his pocket. He was staring
 at the doorway. It was not the sudden appearance of that hag-like, black-shawled
 figure that set his brains at work in swift, lightning flashes, and brought
 every faculty he possessed into play to preserve the indifference, even apathy,
 that became the supposedly drug-dulled Smarlinghue, for Mother Margot, he knew,
 was a frequent visitor here. It was not Mother Margot who caused his pulse
 to stir now; it was the man who had stepped into the room behind her&mdash;Little
 Sweeney.</p>
<p> It seemed somehow to dovetail and fit most curiously into his thoughts of
 Shiftel of a few moments gone. His hand, inside his pocket, as it released
 the hypodermic closed instead upon his automatic. He kept staring at the door&mdash;behind
 Little Sweeney. Was there still <i>some one</i> else? The last time these two had
 been together there had been another with them. That night at Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s,
 when they had tried to rob the old deaf woman of her savings! There had been
 another with them then&mdash;Limpy Mack. But Limpy Mack was also Shiftel, also
 Gentleman Laroque; in a word, the Phantom. Was Shiftel, or the Phantom in whatever
 guise he chose to assume, there behind these two to-night? Little Sweeney had
 not been heard of or seen since that night. This was Little Sweeney&rsquo;s
 first appearance, and&mdash;</p>
<p> The door closed.</p>
<p> Little Sweeney, with a nod that embraced everybody, leaned nonchalantly back
 against the door and lighted a cigarette. Mother Margot stared around the room,
 and then her eyes fixed on Jimmie Dale. He saw her glance swiftly then, interrogatively,
 at Bunty Myers.</p>
<p> Bunty Myers waved his hand.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Smarly, meet Mother Margot,&rdquo; he said off-handedly. &ldquo;Mabbe
 youse knows Little Sweeney.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Meet Mother Margot! There was something exquisitely ironical in this, wasn&rsquo;t
 there? If Mother Margot but knew how many times and under what circumstances
 they had met before!</p>
<p> Mother Margot loosened her shawl, and slumped down in a chair.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Everybody knows Smarlinghue,&rdquo; she grunted.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Little Sweeney from the door.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Glad to meet you both,&rdquo; said Smarlinghue cordially.</p>
<p> There was silence for a moment. Mother Margot folded her hands patiently
 in her lap. The silence, prolonged, grew embarrassed. Bunty Myers broke it.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Beat it!&rdquo; he suggested uncompromisingly to Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue, vacant eyed as he looked around the room, rose
 from his chair. It was a little awkward&mdash;a little awkward to carry it
 off as though it were quite a matter of course. He grinned around the circle.</p>
<p> &ldquo;See you all again,&rdquo; said Smarlinghue pleasantly.</p>
<p> Little Sweeney opened the door.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Damned thick in here, this smoke,&rdquo; said Little Sweeney, as Smarlinghue
 shuffled through. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it open till the room clears out
 a bit. &lsquo;Night, Smarly!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale still pleasantly; but out in the
 hall, and as he turned and went down the stairs, his lips tightened into a
 straight line.</p>
<p> Little Sweeney was no fool! The fire escape, just within reach, just outside
 the window of the room where the broken pane mended with cardboard had once
 before supplied him, Jimmie Dale, with a vantage point from which he could
 both see and hear all that went on within, was barred to him now by the open
 door; also the open door, with Little Sweeney standing there, offered no alternative
 to a prompt and unhesitating exit via the stairs from even the building itself!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips drew still tighter together as he went on down the
 stairs. In spite of Smarlinghue&rsquo;s high station in the underworld, he
 had been treated with scant ceremony! But it was not the hurt of pride in that,
 as one of the &eacute;lite of gangland, the honour and deference that was his
 due had been withheld from him, that brought the grim, set expression to his
 face now; it was the consciousness of defeat where he had foreseen victory.
 He had counted too much on the intimacy that he had first cultivated and then
 believed he had established with Bunty Myers and his fellow gangsters. He had
 believed and hoped that he was not far from being upon the verge of initiation
 into their unholy fold, of being invited, in plain words, to become one of
 them.</p>
<p> He shrugged his shoulders as he stepped out on the street. Well, he had lost
 on that score for the time being, at least. He was wrong, that was all. But
 he had burned no bridges behind him. To-morrow night Smarlinghue could still
 go back there, and be welcome. And as for to-night&mdash;well, he was not yet
 through with to-night! There was something undoubtedly afoot again. What was
 it? He crossed to the other side of the street, and just opposite the side
 door of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;club,&rdquo; where he could watch that
 door unseen, he slipped, unnoticed, into the shadows of a high flight of dwelling
 house steps.</p>
<p> What was it? He could not, as Smarlinghue, accost Mother Margot when she
 came out; and by the time he had gone to the Sanctuary and become the man in
 the evening clothes that she knew as the Gray Seal, she would as likely as
 not have left Kerrigan&rsquo;s and have disappeared. Queer! Somehow, he was
 not interested in <i>what</i> was afoot to-night in so far as its specific nature was
 an essential feature. He was more interested in this sudden appearance of Little
 Sweeney in conjunction with the fact that Shiftel, too, had broken cover. It
 was the Phantom that interested him&mdash;and Shiftel was the Phantom. Was
 there any connection between this return of both Little Sweeney and Isaac Shiftel
 to activity? He meant to see! The two had been very closely allied that night
 at Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s, and particularly later on that same night in Limpy
 Mack&rsquo;s hang-out under Sen Yat&rsquo;s &ldquo;tea shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p> And so, somehow&mdash;he smiled grimly&mdash;he was more concerned with Little
 Sweeney than with Mother Margot to-night. Little Sweeney <i>might</i> lead him to
 Shiftel; Mother Margot he had already tried too often to have any hopeful expectations
 raised on that score. To reach the Phantom, in the guise of Shiftel, or any
 other, was the one thing in life that he sought; to meet the man once again
 face to face was why he was here now, why night after night, and day after
 day, he still risked his life playing this precarious r&ocirc;le of Smarlinghue
 in the underworld. Even a <i>chance</i> was worth while. It was rather curious that
 Little Sweeney and Shiftel, both of whom had dropped completely out of sight
 for so long a time, should both now have made their appearance again! And so,
 at the present moment, he was exceedingly interested in Little Sweeney!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale crouched there in the shadows. Pedestrians passed up and down.
 Perhaps a quarter of an hour went by. Then the side door of Kerrigan&rsquo;s
 opened, and a shawled figure stepped out and scurried away. Mother Margot!
 And then presently the door opened again, and Little Sweeney and Bunty Myers
 came out together.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale slipped out on the street, and, on the opposite side, followed
 the two men as they went down the block. At the corner they separated, and
 Jimmie Dale took up Little Sweeney&rsquo;s trail.</p>
<p> Block after block the man traversed. Jimmie Dale, hugging the shadows of
 the buildings, kept a position as nearly opposite the man across the street
 as he dared, wary always of a corner around which the man might turn, and,
 with too great a distance separating them, disappear into some place&mdash;should
 that be his objective&mdash;before he, Jimmie Dale, could round the corner
 and pick up the trail again.</p>
<p> Little Sweeney walked fast, obviously unconscious of pursuit, and obviously
 with some set and fixed destination in view. The chase headed down toward the
 water front. The quarter now was one of small stores and dwellings, dark for
 the most part, save for the saloons. Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face set grimly. It
 was not an over-inviting neighbourhood.</p>
<p> And then suddenly Little Sweeney swung around a corner.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale quickened his step, and reached the corner himself in time to
 see the other, after skirting a fence that enclosed either a vacant lot or
 a store yard of some sort, turn abruptly at the end of the fence and disappear.
 In an instant, Jimmie Dale, silent in his movements, though he was running
 now, crossed the street, and in turn was skirting the fence. There was a lane
 beyond, of course&mdash;that was it! Little Sweeney had not entered any house;
 he had just turned around the far corner of the fence, and&mdash;Jimmie Dale
 stood suddenly stock still. Out from the corner of the fence, flooding the
 sidewalk, came streaming a powerful ray of light.</p>
<p> And then Little Sweeney&rsquo;s voice, rasping:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s me! Shut off them damned lights!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The light disappeared as quickly as it had come. Footsteps crunched faintly
 in the lane, receding. Jimmie Dale edged quickly forward to the corner of the
 fence, and peered cautiously around it.</p>
<p> It was quite clear now; there was nothing mysterious about the light that
 had flung its beams across the sidewalk; it was even commonplace. From a rickety-looking
 metal garage, which was perhaps twenty-five yards back from the street and
 in which there stood an automobile, some one had sent the headlights playing
 along the lane.</p>
<p> For a moment Jimmie Dale stood there watching. There was a single incandescent
 light burning in the garage which illuminated the place dimly, and, aside from
 Little Sweeney who was just stepping inside, he could make out the forms of
 two men standing beside the car. He dared not enter the lane, of course. It
 would be the act of a fool! A chance sound, those headlights switched upon
 him, and&mdash;</p>
<p> The slouching, bent, almost decrepit figure of Smarlinghue drew back; and
 the next instant, after a swift glance around him to make sure that he was
 unobserved, with a spring, lithe and agile as a cat, he swung himself over
 the fence from the sidewalk, and dropped without a sound to the yard on the
 other side. He began to move noiselessly along the section of the fence which
 flanked the lane. It ran straight to the edge of the garage, he had observed
 from the street, and&mdash;yes, it ended there! He was in luck! He was crouched
 now against the wall of the garage itself, which obviously, though it was too
 dark to see, served to complete the enclosure, in lieu of fence, at this corner
 of the yard.</p>
<p> He could hear them talking now as plainly as though he were inside, for he
 was separated from them only by the thin metal sheeting of the garage; and,
 furthermore, just above his head, shoulder high, where a faint light seeped
 out, the window was open.</p>
<p> &ldquo;This is a sweet, juicy place for a meeting!&rdquo; Little Sweeney&rsquo;s
 voice grumbled.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s de matter wid it?&rdquo; another voice demanded, with
 a hint of truculency. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as anywhere else, I guess,
 an&rsquo; a blamed sight better&rsquo;n most. I told youse I had to make a
 trip first with some swag for a friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, all right, Goldie!&rdquo; said Little Sweeney placatingly. &ldquo;All
 right! I know you did. Forget it!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale raised himself cautiously, and, back at an angle from the window
 sash that precluded the possibility of being seen, looked inside. His lips
 tightened suddenly. The other two were no strangers, either to any one in the
 underworld or to the police. Goldie Kline and the Weasel! Goldie Kline was
 one of the cleverest box-workers in the business; the Weasel, a shrivelled
 little runt, was without a peer as a second-story man.</p>
<p> It was the Weasel now who spoke.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I tell youse straight I wouldn&rsquo;t
 touch dem stones on a bet if any one but old Shiftel was goin&rsquo; to fence &rsquo;em, &rsquo;cause
 dere ain&rsquo;t no one else could get away wid &rsquo;em. De Melville-Dane
 emerald necklace! Swipe me! Dere ain&rsquo;t a stone in de bunch dat ain&rsquo;t
 known all over de lot, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll take <i>some</i> shovin&rsquo;, even
 by Shiftel, to cash in on &rsquo;em. De lady wid de name parted in de middle&rsquo;ll
 be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Close your face!&rdquo; said Little Sweeney politely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
 seen Shiftel, haven&rsquo;t you, and he&rsquo;s settled that to your satisfaction?
 All you fellows have to do is get the stones to-night, and leave the rest to
 him.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the Weasel blithely. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t kickin&rsquo;!
 I&rsquo;m only sayin&rsquo; dat I wouldn&rsquo;t go in on de deal wid nobody
 else but Shiftel. Well, spill de rest of it! We&rsquo;re to slip him de stones
 as soon as we pinches &rsquo;em. Dat&rsquo;s understood. An&rsquo; youse have
 come down here to tell us where he&rsquo;s layin&rsquo; low to-night, an&rsquo; where
 we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to find him; so let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale leaned forward a little in strained attention. Shiftel! The one
 man he would risk, that he <i>had</i> risked, limb and life and liberty to reach!
 He had made no mistake in following Little Sweeney!</p>
<p> And then a blank look, that changed swiftly to one of bitter dismay, settled
 on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face. The roar of the engine starting up had suddenly
 drowned out all other sound. No&mdash;it was subsiding a little now. He caught
 Goldie Kline&rsquo;s voice:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, we can talk in de car. I gotta get dat job I was tellin&rsquo; youse
 about done before ten o&rsquo;clock. Dat&rsquo;s de only t&rsquo;ing dere&rsquo;s
 any hurry about. De necklace job don&rsquo;t come off till de early mornin&rsquo; when
 de dame&rsquo;s gone bye-bye. Jump in, Sweeney; we&rsquo;ll drop youse anywhere
 youse like.&rdquo;</p>
<p> They were gone&mdash;the car, Little Sweeney, the Weasel, Goldie Kline! Jimmie
 Dale stood there alone in the blackness of the yard. He could not follow them.
 They were gone. It had seemed that success at last had been actually within
 his grasp. It numbed him now somehow that it had been so swiftly and unexpectedly
 snatched away. He had little or no chance of finding Little Sweeney again to-night;
 he <i>might</i>, with luck, pick up the trail of Goldie Kline or the Weasel somewhere
 in the underworld, but&mdash;He had turned away from the garage, making his
 way back toward the street, and now he halted abruptly, staring into the darkness.</p>
<p> Had he lost his wits? What was this that his subconscious mind had kept whispering
 over and over to him as the key-note of everything from the moment the name
 had been mentioned? Melville-Dane! Melville-Dane! That was in his <i>own</i> world,
 wasn&rsquo;t it? They were his own friends. Strange! Curious! Yes, he remembered
 now. Soon after he had ventured home again following his &ldquo;absence&rdquo; from
 the city, due to that night at Pedler Joe&rsquo;s, he had found an invitation
 to some affair, a reception, if he were not mistaken, at the Melville-Danes&rsquo; for
 to-night. He had sent his regrets, it was true; but he was on too intimate
 a footing with them to have that make any difference.</p>
<p> And now Jimmie Dale moved on again, reached the fence, and gained the sidewalk
 on the other side. He was also well acquainted with that emerald necklace&mdash;a
 priceless thing that seldom left the shelter of its safe deposit vault. Mrs.
 Melville-Dane was evidently wearing it to-night at the reception!</p>
<p> He started on along the street. A word of warning, then, to the Melville-Danes&mdash;or
 the police? He shook his head. By the time Goldie Kline and the Weasel attempted
 the proposed robbery in the Melville-Dane home, they would be in possession
 of something far more valuable to him, Jimmie Dale, than all the emeralds in
 existence&mdash;<i>they would know where Shiftel could be found to-night</i>.</p>
<p> &ldquo;And I think,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale softly to himself, as he quickened
 his pace, &ldquo;I think, Smarlinghue, that we&rsquo;ll leave you at the Sanctuary
 for the rest of the night!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  The Lesser Breed</b></h2>
<p> From somewhere in the darkness there came a faint musical purr as of metal
 whirring swiftly upon metal. It stopped; began again; and stopped again. Then
 utter silence reigned; then there came a low, deep-breathed exclamation, and
 simultaneously the ray of a flashlight cut through the black, flooded the interior
 of a small safe, and reflected back upon a masked figure in evening dress.</p>
<p> &ldquo;One of the X&mdash;38 type,&rdquo; murmured Jimmie Dale to himself; &ldquo;and,
 as per catalogue, especially adapted for private residences. Tough little nuts
 to crack! I haven&rsquo;t seen one since the old days at the plant when dad
 used to turn them out by the gross!&rdquo;</p>
<p> He reached inside the safe, lifted out a morocco-leather jewel case, and
 opened it. For an instant he held it under the light, staring at a magnificent
 emerald necklace of flawless, matched stones. The Weasel had been quite right!
 Stones such as these must have been garnered and selected from the markets
 of more than one continent. They would be, through the usual underworld channels,
 extremely hard to &ldquo;fence&rdquo;; for a small and ordinary emerald was
 not of any great value, and to &ldquo;cut&rdquo; one of these and so disguise
 it, would instantly rob it of the great part of its worth. It was certainly
 a job for Shiftel! It quite accounted for Shiftel&rsquo;s reappearance!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale laid the jewel case, still open, on the top of the safe, and
 from the leather girdle hidden beneath his vest drew out the thin metal box
 that was stocked with its little gray, adhesive, diamond-shaped seals. He moistened
 one of these, lifting it with the tweezers, and stuck it on the inside of the
 jewel case; then he replaced the metal box in his girdle, and slipped the morocco-leather
 jewel case into his pocket.</p>
<p> And now the light bored into the safe again. There was nothing else there
 of value from a thief&rsquo;s standpoint. It contained what were evidently
 some of Mr. Melville-Dane&rsquo;s private papers; it had only been a temporary
 refuge for the emerald necklace, in lieu of the safe deposit vault from which
 it had been removed to grace the evening&rsquo;s reception. Satisfied on this
 point, Jimmie Dale closed and locked the safe again.</p>
<p> He drew back now across the room, and, smiling curiously, arranged two low-backed
 chairs side by side before the library table. Then his flashlight played for
 a moment on the wall, locating precisely the electric-light switch just beside
 a little alcove that was hung with heavy porti&egrave;res; and then the room
 was in darkness, and Jimmie Dale sat stretched at ease in a lounging chair
 in the alcove behind the hangings.</p>
<p> His lips twitched grimly now. It was quite a transition from Smarlinghue
 and the back room of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;club!&rdquo; It was somewhat
 different, too, in another way. At Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s, night after night,
 he had waited and watched for something, anything, that would open the road
 to the goal he had set himself&mdash;the Phantom; to-night he waited and watched
 here, quite sure in his own mind as to the exact nature of what would happen,
 and with no misgivings any longer but that his goal was in sight! In an hour,
 two hours, at any rate some time before dawn, he would have run Shiftel, alias
 the Phantom, to earth. It was the end in sight at last; life, happiness, for
 the Tocsin and himself.</p>
<p> It was very dark, very still in the library of the Melville-Dane mansion
 here. Again the twisted smile crossed his lips. Here too was quite a transition
 from the brilliant assembly of but an hour before when he had been one of the
 guests at a social function that had been, from a society point of view, one
 of the events of the season. His smile became a little whimsical. Mrs. Melville-Dane
 had been superb in that emerald necklace. He had paid her almost marked attention
 throughout the entire evening! Not once had she been out of his sight, even
 up to the time when she had taken off the necklace and had handed it to her
 husband to be placed in the safe here in the library. It had been quite simple.
 He had bidden his host and hostess good-night&mdash;and in the confusion of
 the departing guests, instead of departing himself, had secreted himself in
 the house.</p>
<p> He shrugged his shoulders. His attentions had been quite wholly unnecessary
 perhaps. He had not expected the Weasel and Goldie Kline to make any attempt
 upon the necklace until, say&mdash;<i>now</i>. It was highly improbable that they
 would have attempted to stage anything with the house full of people; and yet,
 if the Phantom&rsquo;s brain was behind the scheme, such an attempt had always
 remained a possibility. And since he, Jimmie Dale, for his own ends, to pick
 up the final clue that would bring him face to face with the Phantom, had elected
 to give no warning either to the Melville-Danes or to the police, then, of
 necessity, the moral responsibility for the safety of the necklace was his
 alone&mdash;and so he had taken no chances.</p>
<p> The minutes, the quarter hours dragged by. A clock struck through the silence
 with a clashing, resonant sound. That would be half past two. It was time now
 surely for the Weasel and Goldie Kline, for they had already allowed ample
 leeway for the household to retire and settle down for the night.</p>
<p> He stared into the dark. His brain seemed strangely, abnormally active to-night.
 It was due, wasn&rsquo;t it, to a sort of exhilaration, an uplift, that was
 upon him? The promise of the end! The Tocsin might be quite right, and probably
 was, in her belief that the Phantom was planning a trap for him, Jimmie Dale,
 for the Gray Seal. But her fears now were groundless. It was a plot that, however
 cunning, however clever it might be, would never come to maturity. It would
 not be the Phantom now who struck the <i>first</i> blow. After to-night she need never
 fear the Phantom again.</p>
<p> A faint sound, the sound of a cautious, guarded footstep, caught his ear.
 He stood up silently, his automatic in his hand. The door at the far end of
 the library creaked slightly; and then, through the parting of the hangings
 in front of him, Jimmie Dale saw the white gleam of an electric torch flash
 around the room.</p>
<p> Low whisperings reached him now. He parted the hangings another half inch.
 The flashlight was playing on the safe; two dark forms were moving quickly
 toward it; and now one of the two knelt before the safe and began to manipulate
 the dial, while the other held the light over the kneeling man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped noiselessly from behind the porti&egrave;res. His hand
 reached upward, there was a faint <i>click</i> as his fingers closed on the electric-light
 switch, and the room was ablaze with light. A smothered oath came from the
 kneeling man as he sprang to his feet; the other, startled, dropped his electric
 torch to the floor. And then silence, an absence of all movement, save that,
 in obedience to an eloquent gesture from the muzzle of Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 automatic into which they stared, the two men slowly raised their hands above
 their heads.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Hello, Goldie! Hello, Weasel!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale softly from
 behind his mask. &ldquo;I was almost beginning to think you weren&rsquo;t coming.&rdquo; He
 waved his hand toward the two chairs by the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting
 for you, you see. Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Weasel, licking at his lips, his shrivelled little face working, swore
 under his breath.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who&mdash;who are youse?&rdquo; he demanded shakily.</p>
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that presently, Weasel,&rdquo; Jimmie Dale
 answered coolly. &ldquo;In the meantime&ldquo;&mdash;his voice hardened suddenly,
 rasping, cold&mdash;&ldquo;go over there and sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Truculently, hesitatingly, their hands still above their heads, the two men
 moved forward and sat down in the chairs.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Now&rdquo;&mdash;Jimmie Dale was biting off his words, as he stepped
 swiftly behind them&mdash;&ldquo;one at a time. You first, Goldie. Put your
 hands around the back of the chair, palms together.&rdquo; And then as the
 man obeyed, Jimmie Dale thrust his left hand into the tail pocket of his evening
 coat, produced a small coil of stout cord, and shook it out to its full length.
 It had two loops near the centre in the form of slip knots. He slipped one
 of the loops over Goldie Kline&rsquo;s wrists, and tightened it. &ldquo;Now
 you, Weasel!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The other loop closed upon the Weasel&rsquo;s wrists. A moment more, and
 the respective ends of the cord were lashed to the respective chairs, and Jimmie
 Dale stepped around to the other side of the table to face the two men.</p>
<p> He smiled at them for a moment speculatively.</p>
<p> Goldie Kline burst suddenly into a torrent of blasphemy.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s smile became plaintive.</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather foolish of you, Goldie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
 are making quite a little noise, and from your standpoint I should say that
 was the one thing to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Weasel squirmed in his chair.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who are youse?&rdquo; he demanded hoarsely again. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s
 de lay? Youse&rsquo;re no dick wid dat mask on yer map.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale calmly. &ldquo;As a matter
 of fact, I am afraid I am in the same category as yourselves to-night. Shall
 we say&mdash;fellow thieves? The only difference being that I have got what
 I came for, and you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Weasel&rsquo;s rat-like little eyes narrowed. He leaned forward.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wot do youse mean?&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale took the morocco-leather jewel case from his pocket, opened it,
 and laid it down on the table in front of the two men.</p>
<p> &ldquo;This!&rdquo; he said tersely.</p>
<p> The men bent forward, staring. It was a minute before either spoke. Goldie
 Kline raised his eyes and cast a furtive, fear-startled glance at Jimmie Dale.
 The Weasel licked his lips again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; whispered the Weasel thickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s de
 Gray Seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale made no answer.</p>
<p> It was Goldie Kline who spoke now. The man seemed to have pulled himself
 together, and in his tones was a sort of blustering bravado.</p>
<p> &ldquo;So youse&rsquo;re de Gray Seal, are youse? Well, den, I don&rsquo;t
 get youse! Youse&rsquo;ve beat us to it an&rsquo; pinched de goods, damn youse!
 I can see dat! But wot&rsquo;s de big idea in hangin&rsquo; around after youse&rsquo;ve
 got de swag, an&rsquo; stickin&rsquo; up de Weasel an&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale closed the jewel case, and returned it to his pocket.</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fair question, Goldie,&rdquo; he said pleasantly; &ldquo;and
 I&rsquo;ll answer it. It&rsquo;s no cinch to shove that necklace. There&rsquo;s
 only one man who would have much chance&mdash;and that&rsquo;s old Isaac Shiftel.&rdquo; He
 smiled at them engagingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree with me,
 because&mdash;the source of my information is really of no consequence at the
 moment&mdash;I happen to know that it was mainly, if not wholly, because Shiftel
 agreed to dispose of the stones that you figured the job of getting them would
 pay. Well, I am in exactly the same position.&rdquo; Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s smile
 broadened a little. &ldquo;Without Shiftel the stones wouldn&rsquo;t pay me.
 I think this answers your question. I have the necklace, and you haven&rsquo;t;
 but you know where Shiftel, who seems to be extremely difficult of late to
 locate, can be found to-night, and I don&rsquo;t. And so I waited for you,
 because I was sure you would be kind enough to give me his address.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Goldie Kline&rsquo;s jaw had dropped. He shut it now with a snap.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, by Gawd!&rdquo; he burst out furiously. &ldquo;Can youse beat
 dat! Say, youse&rsquo;ve got yer nerve! Youse grabs de stuff from under our
 noses, an&rsquo; den youse has de gall to ask us to wise youse up so&rsquo;s
 youse can get rid of it! Say, we&rsquo;ll see youse in hell first, won&rsquo;t
 we, Weasel?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse have said somethin&rsquo;, Goldie!&rdquo; agreed the Weasel
 earnestly. &ldquo;We sure will!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale patiently. &ldquo;I really
 thought you would help me out. In fact, I actually counted on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; The Weasel was quite at his ease now,
 sneering broadly.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale leaned suddenly across the table. All trace of facetiousness
 was gone from both voice and manner now. He drew his watch from his pocket.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Listen, you two&mdash;and listen <i>hard!</i>&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
 going to give you two minutes to come across. It might be compounding a felony
 to let you get away from here, but you didn&rsquo;t steal anything&mdash;though
 that&rsquo;s not your fault&mdash;and I&rsquo;m thinking of the long terms
 you would get, even for &lsquo;breaking and entering,&rsquo; with your records
 behind you. Am I making myself clear? A little noise down here will bring the
 family and servants about your ears in short order&mdash;while I go out the
 way you came in. If they find you here, even trussed up as you are, I imagine
 you will find it rather difficult to explain to the police how you came to
 visit Mr. Melville-Dane at half past two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. On the
 other hand, an earnest half-hour&rsquo;s work&mdash;the time I should like
 to feel I was guaranteed against any interference on your part&mdash;will free
 you from that cord, and once free you can walk out of here. I still hope I
 am making myself clear.&rdquo; He glanced at his watch. &ldquo;One minute has
 already gone. Where were you to meet Shiftel?&rdquo;</p>
<p> A whitish tinge had crept into Goldie Kline&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Damn youse!&rdquo; he whispered fervently.</p>
<p> The Weasel squirmed again in his chair. He looked at Goldie Kline.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t for goin&rsquo; up for nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; There was
 a sudden nerveless whine in his voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got de goods anyhow.
 We ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to <i>lose</i> nothin&rsquo; by tellin&rsquo;. Wot&mdash;wot
 d&rsquo;youse say, Goldie?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Goldie Kline gnawed at his lips.</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he muttered after a moment. &ldquo;Spill it. I guess
 dere ain&rsquo;t nothing else to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale coolly. He replaced his watch
 in his pocket. &ldquo;It would be unfortunate if there were a <i>mistake</i> in the
 address. I am sure your memories are good enough to recall certain instances
 in the underworld that will reassure on the point that the Gray Seal always
 pays his <i>debts</i>. I mention this simply in passing. And now&mdash;where is Shiftel
 waiting for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p> It was the Weasel who answered.</p>
<p> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in de room off de back yard, down at Morley&rsquo;s dope
 joint,&rdquo; he said sullenly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale grimly. &ldquo;I know where that
 is.&rdquo; He moved away from the table and toward the door. Here he paused
 for a moment. The two men were already tugging and struggling with their bonds. &ldquo;I
 forgot to say,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;that there is nothing of any
 value left in the safe! Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale was gone.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  The Cat&rsquo;s-Paw</b></h2>
<p> Five minutes later, Jimmie Dale climbed into the light runabout that, prior
 to the reception, he had unobtrusively parked in an alleyway a block from the
 Melville-Dane residence. He replaced his silk hat with a peaked cap which he
 drew out from under the seat&mdash;and the car shot forward into the street.</p>
<p> He drove fast now. He had no thought of speed laws. Shiftel&mdash;the Phantom&mdash;the
 end in sight! He had no thought for anything but that; he asked for nothing
 more than just this, which was at last to be granted him, of playing out the
 final hand with this inhuman fiend to whom murder was a trade, and crime of
 the basest sort a pastime. There was room now for only one of them&mdash;the
 Phantom or himself&mdash;in this world. The debt that lay between them was
 too abysmal to be plumbed or spanned in any other way.</p>
<p> And yet the man should have his chance; a chance to fight for his life. He
 was not entitled to it; he, the Phantom, under the same conditions would have
 struck as quickly and murderously as he could. In fact, if the Tocsin was right,
 as no doubt she was, the Phantom even now was preparing a trap which, to-morrow,
 the next day, or the day after, was intended to be sprung in the hope of snaring
 him, Jimmie Dale, the Gray Seal; and that trap once sprung successfully he,
 Jimmie Dale, would go out with no more chance for life than the flame of a
 candle flung to the storm! But there would be no to-morrow, or the next day,
 or the day after, for the Phantom and his trap; to-night, now, within the next
 few minutes, there would be no longer need for the Phantom to cudgel his brain
 for tricks and devices to lure the Gray Seal into his web!</p>
<p> The streets were deserted. A strange, queer silence seemed to reign over
 the city. Somehow it seemed sinister, premonitive&mdash;aptly so. Still Jimmie
 Dale drove fast. And then finally, far over on the East Side, deep in a neighbourhood
 as vicious and abandoned as New York had to offer, he parked his car again
 in a lane, sprang out, and started at a brisk walk along the block.</p>
<p> There was a grim, set look on his face now, as his hand, slipping into his
 pocket for his automatic, encountered the morocco-leather jewel case. Shiftel
 was waiting for the necklace! Well, Shiftel should have it&mdash;for a moment.
 But, at that, its safety was nowhere nearly so greatly imperilled as if it
 had been left as a temptation for Goldie Kline and the Weasel! To-morrow, in
 some way, it would be back in the Melville-Danes&rsquo; possession again.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale swerved sharply into a cross street, and from there into an alleyway.
 His pace slackened, became guarded, cautious. He knew Morley&rsquo;s opium
 den by more than hearsay. As Smarlinghue, he had been a supposed client more
 than once. Yes, here it was&mdash;the back of it, anyway, over this fence here,
 and across the yard. Well, it was the back of it he sought, wasn&rsquo;t it?
 That was what the Weasel had said&mdash;the room off the back yard.</p>
<p> He drew himself up to the top of the fence, dropped silently to the other
 side, and suddenly his pulse beat fast. Across the yard was an open, lighted
 window, almost on a level with the ground. Unbridled now, almost overwhelming,
 that sense of exhilaration was upon him again. The end of the chase! What did
 it not mean&mdash;for the Tocsin&mdash;for himself!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved forward quietly, noiselessly&mdash;ten yards&mdash;another
 ten. He was not far from the window now, not more than another five yards.
 And now he could see inside. Shiftel! And now he knew another emotion&mdash;something
 cold, merciless, primitive in its naked thirst for retribution. The Weasel
 had made no &ldquo;mistake!&rdquo; Shiftel was there! He could see the bent
 form in its greasy black coat; he could see the bearded face of the old &ldquo;fence&rdquo; bending
 over a table, as he had seen it once before on a night when he had thought
 he had run the man to earth in the rooms old Mother Margot lived in now.</p>
<p> A yard more! Yes, the window was not more than a couple of feet above the
 ground. His automatic was in his hand now, his face masked again. Another yard&mdash;and
 then Jimmie Dale whirled sharply around, his face drawn suddenly in hard, tense
 lines. Out of the darkness, out of the nowhere, came a voice, ugly in its menace,
 a voice he recognised&mdash;Bunty Myers&rsquo;:</p>
<p> &ldquo;There he is! Get him! The Gray Seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Out of the darkness, out of the nowhere, a circle of flying shadows seemed
 to arise and converge upon him.</p>
<p> The trap!</p>
<p> Like lightning his brain worked; like lightning he moved now. The trap! In
 a flash, out of a strange bewilderment, he grasped the fact that somehow the
 trap of which the Tocsin had so earnestly warned him, the trap that he had
 so self-confidently thought he would nip in the making, was even now being
 sprung upon him; that his own confident plan of reaching Shiftel was in fact
 the very trap that had been laid for him.</p>
<p> The trap! And the jaws of it were that open window! And there was no other
 way to turn. Those on-rushing shadows, that were snarling, cursing men now,
 were almost upon him, blocking his retreat.</p>
<p> Retreat! He had no mind to retreat. It would be the end without a doubt to-night
 now; he had at least been right in that. But it would not be his end alone.
 Inside there, in through the jaws of the trap&mdash;was Shiftel!</p>
<p> The brain works fast. In the winking of an eye Jimmie Dale had leaped forward,
 and had sprung for the window sill. It was intuition perhaps that prompted
 him. The figure at the table, at a slight angle away from the direct line of
 the window, had risen, revolver levelled. Jimmie Dale plunged forward, as a
 man plunges in a long, low dive, over the sill and to the floor. And as he
 plunged, like a machine gun in action behind him, came the roar and flash of
 what seemed a myriad revolver shots.</p>
<p> It happened quick&mdash;quicker almost than the brain could grasp. The bearded,
 greasy old figure, intent evidently upon his victim alone, had overstepped
 the zone of safety, stepped a little forward into the line of the window; and
 now, with a wild cry, with suddenly upflung arms, as the hail of lead swept
 in, had pitched face forward to the floor.</p>
<p> And something in Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s soul, amidst the turmoil that was raging
 physically about him, gave quiet, fervent thanks. Not for a man&rsquo;s death&mdash;but
 that the burden and guilt, if it should be termed guilt to destroy such a one
 as this, one that, to save the life of the woman he loved, he <i>must</i> have destroyed
 if he could before his own end came, had been lifted from his shoulders. Shiftel
 was dead!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale had wriggled around on the floor. He was facing the window now,
 firing in turn with his automatic. The low sill afforded a measure of protection.
 He fired from the floor over it. Shouts, yells, curses answered him; but the
 rush was checked, though the shots still poured in from without.</p>
<p> And now pandemonium seemed loosed! He glanced around him quickly. The door
 of the room was locked. That was obvious because they were pounding upon it
 now, trying to burst it in; and it had been locked, quite obviously and quite
 logically, in preparation for his entry into the trap, and against the possibility
 of any escape through what was the only means of exit he could see&mdash;except
 the window with its hail of bullets!</p>
<p> It was the end! He slipped a fresh clip of cartridges into his automatic.
 But now he fired with more restraint. True, it was the end, but he must be
 careful of his ammunition now; he would need it even more when that door gave!</p>
<p> It was an even break. Himself for Shiftel! It was worth it; it had been worth
 it&mdash;for her sake. Shiftel, the Phantom, was&mdash;</p>
<p> Was he mad? Had this scene from the pit of the inferno, that bursting door,
 these shots that hummed with hell&rsquo;s venom above his head, this smoke-filled,
 acrid-stinking room, turned his brain? Shiftel! That was not Shiftel there!
 Nor Gentleman Laroque! He was staring now for the first time at the still,
 motionless figure on the floor. The beard on the upturned face hung awry. He
 reached for it, and snatched it off. A thousand noises, a thousand sounds pounded
 at his eardrums and made mockery of the crashing blows upon the door, the vicious
 <i>spat</i> of bullets, the hideous yowling of those human wolves who had the Gray
 Seal trapped at last. This man on the floor here dead was not Shiftel, nor
 the Phantom in the guise of Shiftel, nor the Phantom in any other guise. <i>It
 was Little Sweeney!</i></p>
<p> The door was yielding now. And somehow&mdash;he did not understand why or
 how for his brain seemed stunned&mdash;the noise and the shouts without seemed
 to increase in intensity. He wriggled back a little way across the room where
 he could best command both window and door. He had still one clip of cartridges
 left. He had only one hope now&mdash;that he could use them to the last one.
 In another minute the door would give, and&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;<i>Jimmie!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p> Yes, he was mad! Reason at the last had fled from him. That was her voice,
 the Tocsin&rsquo;s voice. As those shadows outside the window had suddenly
 closed in upon him out of the nowhere, so this voice, the voice he loved, came
 suddenly to him now out of the nowhere.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; </p>
<p> His eyes strained over in the direction of the desk. He could see nothing.
 There was nothing there, unless&mdash;yes, yes, the floor seemed to have risen
 up a few inches above the surrounding level. A trap door!</p>
<p> &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes! Quick! Quick, Jimmie, quick!&rdquo; her voice answered from below.</p>
<p> He flung himself forward, and wrenched the trap door wide open. It was pitch
 black below; he could see nothing.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Drop, Jimmie; it&rsquo;s only a few feet,&rdquo; she called up to
 him. &ldquo;Bolt the trap door behind you. And, oh, hurry, Jimmie, hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p> He swung himself through the opening, and dropped; then reached upward behind
 him and closed the trap door. His fingers searched for the bolt, found it,
 and shot it home. He could not stand upright; he had to stoop, the opening
 was so low. And it was so dark he could not see his hand before his face.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;Marie, thank God for you!
 Marie, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; her voice replied. &ldquo;Follow me; come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you&mdash;I can&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; he
 said; then quickly: &ldquo;Wait! I&rsquo;ve got a flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Her voice came back instantly. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
 show a light here under any circumstances. Keep your head down, and feel your
 way. You can touch the walls on each side of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p> He could hear her moving ahead of him. Half bent over, he followed. Soft
 earth was under foot. It was a low, narrow tunnel of some sort, that was evident.
 An underground passage, of course. Morley&rsquo;s drug-den was well equipped!</p>
<p> His brain was in chaos. Shiftel, Bunty Myers, the emerald necklace, Little
 Sweeney! And the Tocsin here!</p>
<p> &ldquo;Marie, I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; he burst out.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It was the trap I warned you about,&rdquo; she answered back.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes; I know that now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But Shiftel! That wasn&rsquo;t
 Shiftel up there. It was Little Sweeney.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;He was the cat&rsquo;s-paw,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p> He stumbled on. Where did this passage lead to? Was there no end to it?</p>
<p> &ldquo;Hold on a minute, Marie! Stop!&rdquo; he pleaded suddenly. &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;There is no time; there is not an instant to lose,&rdquo; she broke
 in swiftly &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;but never mind that. I can tell you in a
 few words what you do not understand as we go on. Are you listening, Jimmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Listening! Listening to <i>her</i>, to her voice!</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;since you will not wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she said rapidly, &ldquo;the Phantom was not fool
 enough to close his eyes to what looked as though there were a leak somewhere
 on the inside. The Gray Seal had put in an appearance with too great <i>regularity</i>.
 He thought, too, at last, as I wrote you, that you were after him in a personal
 way. Therefore he meant to strike first. And so for to-night&rsquo;s work he
 sent out his orders and his plans through the <i>usual</i> channels. Is that clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, as he groped his way along.</p>
<p> &ldquo;If, then, there was a leak,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;the plan for
 the night&rsquo;s work would reach the Gray Seal also as usual. But though
 the Phantom inclined strongly to the belief that <i>he</i> was the one you were after,
 and that the spoils of the various affairs in which you had intervened were
 a secondary matter, he was still not absolutely sure of it&mdash;and therefore,
 whether he was right or wrong, and while he hoped to get you by offering what
 you would believe to be himself as a bait, it was not his intention to take
 any chances with that emerald necklace to-night, and&mdash;&rdquo; She broke
 off suddenly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you found that out!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale brought up abruptly against a sharp turning in the tunnel. He
 bit his lips in chagrin. In the utter darkness, in spite of the cramped posture
 he was forced to assume, he had tried to catch up with her, reach her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I followed Little Sweeney from Kerrigan&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
 met Goldie Kline and the Weasel, and I overheard enough to know what was going
 on before I lost Little Sweeney again. They got away in an automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Her voice floated back. &ldquo;Well, that part of the
 plan was <i>not</i> passed out through the usual channels. All that was given out
 to the gang was that Shiftel would be here at Morley&rsquo;s to-night to receive
 some swag; but it was not until the last minute, not until an hour ago that
 the gang themselves were ordered to be on hand to get you if you came. After
 that they were kept <i>together</i> so that a leak <i>then</i>, when a leak would no longer
 be a lure but a warning, was impossible. If you were only after spoils, you
 would know nothing about the necklace, and so would not get it; but if you
 were after <i>him</i> you would come here, and he would get <i>you!</i> Do you still understand,
 Jimmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;all but Little Sweeney&rsquo;s part.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It was risky business playing the part of Shiftel&mdash;something
 might go wrong,&rdquo; she said bitterly. &ldquo;And the Phantom takes no risks&mdash;when
 he can let some one else assume them! That is why he had some one play the
 part of Shiftel. Little Sweeney received his orders through Limpy Mack with
 whom, as you know, he had worked before, not knowing that Limpy Mack and Shiftel
 and the unknown &lsquo;Chief&rsquo; were one; and Little Sweeney of course
 thought it was a clever way to induce two crooks to steal the jewels, for Little
 Sweeney was made to believe that Shiftel had left the country for good. Limpy
 Mack supplied the disguise, which was actually of course the one worn by himself
 when he masqueraded as Shiftel.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; gasped Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;I see now!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is not much more. Little Sweeney
 was chosen because he had been away during your later appearances, and was
 therefore free from suspicion that any leak had come through him; and Goldie
 Kline and the Weasel were chosen for the same reason&mdash;they were wholly
 <i>outsiders</i>. That&rsquo;s all&mdash;except my share. <i>I</i> had sent you no word,
 no note. I didn&rsquo;t think you could possibly know anything about to-night;
 and so I didn&rsquo;t expect you would come here, and in that respect I thought
 the Phantom would fail. But I knew that Shiftel was to be here at this hour&mdash;for
 I believed then that it was actually Shiftel himself&mdash;and so I notified
 the police. If they got Shiftel, then that was the end of our troubles. They&mdash;they
 are there now. They came just as I reached the trap door&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;her
 voice seemed to dull a little&mdash;&ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t got the Phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale made no answer. His lips were tight and grimly set. The Phantom
 was still alive, still at liberty, still free to carry on his fiendish machinations!
 But&mdash;Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face relaxed a little the next instant&mdash;it
 was not all utter failure and defeat. <i>She</i> was here! The Tocsin was here with
 him. And he, Jimmie Dale, was alive, where but a few minutes before he had
 seen no chance of life. They were together&mdash;Marie and himself. In a moment
 more now the tunnel must end, and she&mdash;</p>
<p> Her voice, suddenly low and guarded, reached him.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Stay where you are. I&rsquo;ll
 see if the way is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He stood still.</p>
<p> A minute passed, and then she called again:</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p> His hands still groped out before him as he moved forward again, and, groping,
 discovered that the tunnel here took an abrupt right-angled bend. And then
 as he turned the corner, and a cool, fresh current of air fanned his face,
 he found himself on a flight of steps, and he could straighten up and there
 was head room as he mounted them.</p>
<p> And then he was standing outside a doorway on a dark and deserted street.
 He could hear the sound of shouts, of revolver shots, but the sounds came faintly
 from the distance. They were safe now, quite safe, the Tocsin and himself.
 He looked quickly, eagerly around him. He called her softly.</p>
<p> But there was no answer&mdash;and of the Tocsin there was no sign.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Behind The Doors Of The Underworld</b></h2>
<p> Jimmie Dale turned softly, without sound, upon the bunk, easing his position.
 Around him were whisperings, murmurings, the stir of humans in troubled sleep,
 a hundred conglomerate, sinister sounds; and everywhere the sickly sweetish
 smell of opium.</p>
<p> His face was haggard, worn, drawn, in sharp, pinched lines, and there was
 a dull, weary look about the eyes that no &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; could have
 supplied, as a smile, grim, unbidden, settled now upon his lips. Was this reality?
 Perhaps it was all a dream&mdash;a dream such as the poppy brought to these
 dregs and lees of the underworld who stole in here, where no daylight had ever
 shone, to burn their suicidal incense to the God of Gray Things!</p>
<p> Reality! Could even his existence in itself be reality? Was it any more reality
 than he, as Smarlinghue, as one known far and wide throughout the underworld
 as a hopelessly confirmed dope fiend, represented reality? He was not Smarlinghue.
 There was no such person as Smarlinghue. And yet in that very character which
 he had created, unkempt and ragged, he lay here now in one of Hip Foo&rsquo;s &ldquo;private&rdquo; rooms,
 hidden deep down in the chain of sub-cellars that housed perhaps the most infamous
 opium joint in all New York! He was not a dope fiend. Neither taste nor drop
 of the drug had he ever known. And yet he had burned a thousand &ldquo;pills,&rdquo; he
 had toyed with a hypodermic syringe a thousand times, and before him even now
 lay the pipe that the Chinese attendant had brought him but a few moments since!
 Was it then reality, or but a dream, ceaseless, unending, whose vividness was
 so acute that it aped reality? Was it a dream that somewhere, always elusive,
 always just beyond his reach, always just evading him, a <i>phantom</i>, evil as no
 other human being was evil, cunning as only one from the fiend&rsquo;s pit
 itself was cunning, diced with him out of the shadows for his life&mdash;and
 hers, the Tocsin&rsquo;s?</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes closed. He was conscious of great fatigue; not physical&mdash;mental.
 Days of striving, days of utter failure, of futility, nights of unceasing,
 sleepless effort lay behind him. Reality! The question answered itself. He
 had but to listen for an instant through these thin, flimsy partitions to know
 that it was not only reality, but a reality stripped of all glamour, ugly in
 its nakedness and its menace. It was only his brain voicing its plea for rest,
 giving warning that it was nearing the breaking point and that the lash could
 be applied too often to the slave, that had prompted the groping question.</p>
<p> He listened now for a moment almost involuntarily. Here was one of those
 underground exchanges where the secrets of the underworld passed from mouth
 to mouth; where the gossip of the Bad Lands circulated; where crimes were born;
 where he had even heard his own death, the death of the Gray Seal, decreed
 a score of times.</p>
<p> Whispers reached him. Two yeggs of the lesser breed, whose names he did not
 know, were in there. Their conversation was snatchy, desultory, due presumably
 to the fact that the opium was beginning to get in its work. There was a reference
 to an uptown &ldquo;job&rdquo; of a week ago; a dance hall fracas that had
 ended in a murder; the approval of the sentence passed upon one English Steve
 by the fellow members of his gang, and the speculation as to how many of the
 gang English Steve would succeed in &ldquo;bumping off&rdquo; before in turn
 English Steve finally received his own quietus.</p>
<p> Again Jimmie Dale turned noiselessly on his bunk. He was not interested.
 Ten minutes before he had made a tour of the sub-cellar here; and then, playing
 his part as Smarlinghue, he had flung himself down on this bunk and given his
 order. Neither Bunty Myers nor any other of the Phantom&rsquo;s underlings
 were in evidence. He had not actually expected to find them already here, he
 did not even expect them later on; but in half an hour, or an hour, luck might
 change, and they <i>might</i> come. He had simply made Hip Foo&rsquo;s his first stopping
 place night after night of late because it had once been the rendezvous of
 the men he wanted, because it was here that some of them had met on the night
 the place had been raided, and because, since the night that the Phantom had
 laid the trap for him at Morley&rsquo;s, Bunty Myers and the Kitten and Spud
 MacGuire and Muller no longer met in the back, upstairs room of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;club.&rdquo; Perhaps
 they would again in the future&mdash;some of them&mdash;perhaps not!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips tightened. It had gone very badly with the Phantom&rsquo;s
 plans that night. Apart from Little Sweeney, Spud MacGuire and Muller, in the
 subsequent fight with the police, had both been killed. Also, it had apparently
 forced Bunty Myers and the Kitten into hiding. Certainly, since that night,
 he, Jimmie Dale, had not been able to pick up the slightest trace of either
 of them.</p>
<p> He swept his hand heavily across his eyes. He was not so sure that he could
 wholly glory in the outcome of that night. If the Phantom had received a blow,
 he, Jimmie Dale, had perhaps received one that was even more disastrous. The
 Phantom was still at large, still free to pursue his heinous activities, but
 with the abandonment of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s back room, even if only temporarily,
 by Bunty Myers and the rest of his associates who hung on the Phantom&rsquo;s
 orders, he, Jimmie Dale, had lost touch with everything and every one connected
 with the Phantom&mdash;except Mother Margot!</p>
<p> Mother Margot! His lips twisted in a weary smile. She had been of little
 service to him! So far as any information he had been able to obtain from her
 was concerned, she might as well have been non-existent. Not that she had attempted
 to mislead or lie to him; he was satisfied on that score because, being the
 sole connecting link with the Phantom that was left to him, he had naturally
 watched her more carefully than ever before. As the man in the black silk mask,
 the man she knew as the Gray Seal, he had held her closely to account; but
 he was convinced that of the Phantom&rsquo;s plans and movements since that
 night at Morley&rsquo;s, she was as ignorant as he was himself. Where before
 she had been the mouthpiece of the &ldquo;Voice,&rdquo; as she called the Phantom,
 her office now had apparently become a sinecure. It was as though the Phantom,
 failing in the supreme effort he had made to find the &ldquo;leak&rdquo; among
 his trusted subordinates, and afraid perhaps to place further trust anywhere,
 had withdrawn himself completely from every one of those that formerly he had
 moved as pawns upon his miserable chess-board of crime.</p>
<p> But that did not mean the Tocsin&rsquo;s safety. The Phantom, as she had
 so well named him, master of impersonation, the Phantom alias Gentleman Laroque,
 alias Shiftel, alias Limpy Mack, alias heaven alone knew what else, the Phantom
 with his score of domiciles, if he meant now to play a lone hand, was a far
 more dangerous antagonist than ever before; one far harder to come at, more
 elusive, more safely and deeply entrenched behind&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s hand reached swiftly out for the opium pipe that lay
 on the stand beside the bunk. A footstep, one accompanied by a low, soft swish,
 was coming along the boarded corridor outside. It was probably one of the Chinese
 attendants, and the swish was the usual swish of the slippered feet; but if
 there was any one den or dive in the Bad Lands more than another where it meant
 literally life and death to preserve the character of Smarlinghue from all
 suspicion, it was here in Hip Foo&rsquo;s where a whisper was alone sufficient
 to bring down upon him, darting from its every corner and crevice, the drug
 crazed rat-horde of the underworld that infested the place.</p>
<p> The step came nearer. Jimmie Dale, the pipe apparently at his lips, lay back
 again upon the bunk. If the Phantom were playing a lone hand now, if he had
 sloughed off, as dangerous and unfit, the tools he had formerly employed, then
 he, Jimmie Dale, since the Tocsin was obviously steadfast in her determination
 to afford him no opportunity of picking up any further clue, was facing a blank
 wall. If, however, the veil that had shrouded the movements of the Phantom
 and all those who had been connected with him since that night at Morley&rsquo;s
 was simply the natural caution inspired by what had so nearly been complete
 disaster, then certainly, sooner or later, he, Jimmie Dale, would pick up the
 trail again of those, such as were left of them, who once had congregated at
 Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s. That was why he was here in Hip Foo&rsquo;s to-night&mdash;on
 the chance that, either through their appearance in person, or through the
 mumbled gossip which was the freer in dens like this where the incense burned
 to the God of Poppy loosened men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s tongues, he might
 find the lost threads again.</p>
<p> He asked no more than that&mdash;only to go on to the end while there was
 yet time. And he was afraid to-night, afraid with a great fear. How did he
 even know that it was not already too late? How did he know that in her battle
 of wits with the Phantom which she insisted in waging alone, unaided, with
 her life at stake, the Tocsin, brave, resourceful, clever though she was, had
 not already&mdash;</p>
<p> Through half-closed eyes Jimmie Dale watched the curtain that hung across
 the doorway. Yes, undoubtedly, the footstep was no longer in evidence, and
 undoubtedly the curtain was being drawn stealthily aside. He made no movement.
 The opening widened, widened still further&mdash;and suddenly the blood went
 whipping through Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s veins in a mad, elated tide, and weariness
 was gone.</p>
<p> Reward! The light was dim, low, flickering, but he could see well enough.
 It was not one of the Chinese attendants. It was the shawled head of an old
 hag that was peering in there. Mother Margot!</p>
<p> Still Jimmie Dale gave no sign that he was aware of the other&rsquo;s presence.
 It was a reward at last for the days and nights that were gone! Once before
 she had come here to meet Bunty Myers, once before this had been the rendezvous&mdash;what
 else would she be here for to-night? He had evidently been right then in hoping
 more from Hip Foo&rsquo;s than from any other place. And it did not mean that
 she had lied to him as the Gray Seal either. It might very well be, and probably
 was, that, since last he had communicated with her, the Phantom had suddenly
 broken silence and through her was issuing his orders again.</p>
<p> She stood there on the threshold now, peering toward the bunk, shading her
 eyes with her hand as though, even in the dim light, it helped her the better
 to distinguish objects. And for a moment she hesitated, then she came slowly
 through the doorway and let the curtain fall behind her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s youse, ain&rsquo;t it, Smarly?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale sat up on the bunk, and blinked at her. There was something of
 grim, sardonic humour in the situation. They had been formally &ldquo;introduced&rdquo; that
 night at Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s, and she knew Smarlinghue&mdash;as <i>Smarlinghue</i>.
 But between Smarlinghue and the man she knew, yes, and <i>obeyed</i>, as the Gray
 Seal, there was a gulf that she had never crossed. The trumps were very much
 in his hands!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale blinked again, rubbed his eyes, and stared at her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, hello!&rdquo; he said, a little ungraciously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
 Mother Margot, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She nodded without speaking.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; It was Smarlinghue who spoke. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
 idea? I ain&rsquo;t standing any free rides to dreamland&mdash;the price has
 gone up.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s askin&rsquo; youse to,&rdquo; she replied a little
 tartly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never been on dat kind of stuff, t&rsquo;ank Gawd!
 I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for some one, dat&rsquo;s wot I&rsquo;m here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale permitted a slightly malicious grin to flicker across his lips.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t seem to fall in love with me the night I got shown
 out at Wally&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;so I guess it ain&rsquo;t
 me. Try next door!&rdquo;</p>
<p> She came a little closer, and lowered her voice.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t for youse,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but mabbe youse&rsquo;ll
 do, if youse ain&rsquo;t too stewed on coke.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale did not answer for a moment. Was the entr&eacute;e into the Phantom&rsquo;s
 circle here at last, an entr&eacute;e in the sense that, if only in a minor
 way, he was to be offered the opportunity of participating in the activities
 of Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s, alias the Phantom&rsquo;s, gang? She was looking
 for some one. Who? She was, he knew, the one through whom the Phantom, always
 invisible himself, issued all his orders. Who, then, would she be searching
 for to-night save the very men that he himself would willingly pay any price
 to find&mdash;Bunty Myers for one, the Kitten for another!</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been here long enough, without being butted in on, to
 get stewed,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale caustically.</p>
<p> She came still closer, peering at him through her spectacles, drawing her
 shawl with quick nervous little clutches tighter around her shoulders and throat.
 And then suddenly her whole manner changed; she seemed frightened, almost in
 despair.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, youse&rsquo;re all right, I can see dat now,&rdquo; she burst
 out in a hoarse, shaken whisper. &ldquo;Dat was de only thing I was scared
 of w&rsquo;en I sees youse in here&mdash;dat youse&rsquo;d be stewed. Listen,
 Smarly, I got to get some help. An&rsquo; I want youse to help me. Dere ain&rsquo;t
 no one on de whole East Side could do it de way youse could, if youse only
 will.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale lounged back on the bunk. Mother Margot would at least not find
 him <i>eager</i>.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Thanks for the bouquet!&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;The last time all
 you handed me was a frozen mitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; she whispered passionately. &ldquo;For Gawd&rsquo;s
 sake forget dat, Smarly. I ain&rsquo;t handin&rsquo; youse no jolly. Everybody
 knows Smarlinghue; an&rsquo; everybody knows dere ain&rsquo;t a dump in de
 Bad Lands dat he ain&rsquo;t wise to, an&rsquo; where he don&rsquo;t get de
 glad hand. An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; everybody knows dey can trust Smarlinghue.
 <i>I&rsquo;m</i> trustin&rsquo; youse now. Say, give me yer word youse&rsquo;ll keep
 yer trap closed about me whether youse sits in de game or not, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
 come across.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;That don&rsquo;t cost nothing.
 I&rsquo;ve never seen you to-night, if that suits you. Go ahead! Spill it!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot glanced furtively around her. She listened for a moment to
 the voices, grown thicker now and almost inaudible, coming through the partition,
 then she leaned close to Jimmie Dale. Her lips scarcely moved.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get mine if I&rsquo;m heard, or youse snitches on me,&rdquo; she
 breathed in a frightened, jerky way. &ldquo;But I got to do it. I got to do
 it. I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; for hours, ever since early in de afternoon,
 an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t no good. I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere, an&rsquo; I
 can&rsquo;t find him, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t darst get too
 nosey wid questions. Youse understand, Smarly? It&rsquo;s English Steve. I
 got to get a message to English Steve, an&rsquo; if I don&rsquo;t he goes out.
 My Gawd, Smarly, youse gets dat, don&rsquo;t youse? He goes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stared at her. He experienced a sudden loss of the elation, the
 uplift, that he had known but a moment before in such full measure. English
 Steve! All the underworld knew about English Steve! It was no secret. Even
 those two hop-fighters in the next room, who ranked little higher than stalls
 and steerers in the citizenry of the Bad Lands, knew all about English Steve
 and his gang troubles. He, Jimmie Dale, knew all about it. As Larry the Bat
 he had even been personally acquainted with English Steve in the olden days.
 Therefore he also knew&mdash;which was the one thing that concerned him now&mdash;that
 English Steve had nothing to do with Bunty Myers. And it was of Bunty Myers,
 as the first step toward picking up again the Phantom&rsquo;s trail, that he
 had expected Mother Margot to unburden herself.</p>
<p> His eyes shifted to the ragged sleeve of his coat, to the dirty, frayed,
 protruding wristband of his shirt. He had hoped for too much evidently. Perhaps
 he should have known better, but that did not lessen the disappointment. True,
 he had called this woman from her pushcart on Thompson Street only that morning,
 and had talked to her as the Gray Seal over the telephone, and he had been
 thoroughly satisfied then that she was as ignorant as he was of either Bunty
 Myers&rsquo; or the Phantom&rsquo;s movements; but until a moment ago, in view
 of her appearance here, he had thought that in the meantime the Phantom had
 communicated with her. Well, he had been wrong, it seemed, and to-night was
 to be only another night of hollow results added to the nights that had gone
 before. He had lost track of how many! It didn&rsquo;t matter. He had hoped
 for too much, that was all.</p>
<p> She clutched at his sleeve frantically, in pitiful pleading.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse ain&rsquo;t afraid, are youse, Smarly?&rdquo; she quavered. &ldquo;Youse
 don&rsquo;t have to get in between. All I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; youse is to
 help me find him, an&rsquo; if youse finds him first to slip him a message.
 Youse don&rsquo;t have to do nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the message?&rdquo; inquired Jimmie Dale, a little gruffly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Just tell him to duck his nut out of New York to-night, dat&rsquo;s
 all. Just tell him dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale as Smarlinghue shook his head critically.</p>
<p> &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t that kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re
 talking about him and his gang, but everybody that ain&rsquo;t deaf knows he
 swore he&rsquo;d get every last one of the outfit he used to work with before
 they got him, if they tried any funny business. What&rsquo;s the use of handing
 him any steer like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Never youse mind about dat,&rdquo; said Mother Margot quickly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
 go if youse tells him it was me sent de word. He ain&rsquo;t for runnin&rsquo; into
 a trap, is he? Nobody but a fool &rsquo;ud do dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale appeared to ponder the matter.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trap?&rdquo; he demanded after a moment.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered miserably.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; prodded Jimmie Dale, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t know
 that, how do you know it&rsquo;s to-night they&rsquo;re laying for him, and
 where do you come in? He ain&rsquo;t a long lost son you&rsquo;ve discovered,
 is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She wrung her hands suddenly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, my Gawd, Smarly,&rdquo; she whispered wildly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
 losin&rsquo; time, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afraid. Mabbe it&rsquo;s
 too late even now. Dere ain&rsquo;t no use askin&rsquo; me questions dat I
 can&rsquo;t answer. I don&rsquo;t know how, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know where,
 but I knows English Steve gets his to-night if he ain&rsquo;t tipped off in
 time. For Gawd&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t ask me nothin&rsquo; more. I owe it
 to English Steve to wise him up. I got to do it if I can, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
 askin&rsquo; youse to help me. Youse will, won&rsquo;t youse, Smarly? Aw, for
 Gawd&rsquo;s sake, say youse will! Youse won&rsquo;t be sorry. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
 make it up to youse. Mother Margot don&rsquo;t never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale swung his leg slowly over the edge of the bunk. Well, why not?
 Mother Margot&rsquo;s advent had brought him anything but what he had hoped
 for, but he was certainly no worse off than he had been before her arrival.
 English Steve and his gang affairs were too well known, too public, to warrant
 any suspicion that there was any ulterior object in Mother Margot&rsquo;s actions.
 He had not the slightest doubt but that the gang had laid their plans for the
 removal of English Steve to-night. It was quite on the cards. In some way Mother
 Margot had got an inkling of this. She probably owed English Steve a debt of
 some kind, due, as probably, to some crooked work in the past in which they
 had been engaged together. That, too, was quite on the cards. Well, why not?
 He had no particular interest in English Steve, but certainly he had no desire
 to stand by and allow a murder, even the murder of a crook, to be committed
 if he could prevent it. And then, too, there was another angle to the affair.
 Mother Margot as a <i>friend</i> of Smarlinghue might well mean far more than Mother
 Margot constrained by fear to be the unwilling ally of the Gray Seal. And,
 besides, from now until dawn his own search would be continued through the
 underworld anyhow; and where he looked for Bunty Myers or the Kitten, he would,
 as naturally as though that were his sole quest, look for English Steve.</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale abruptly, as he stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
 help you if I can. I guess I know a few dumps you don&rsquo;t, but you keep
 on going yourself. We&rsquo;ll cover more ground that way, and get on quicker.
 And it wouldn&rsquo;t do either of us any good to be seen hunting together,
 neither. Beat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot caught his hand impulsively.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I knew youse would, Smarly! I knew youse would!&rdquo; she whispered
 in a choked voice. &ldquo;Gawd bless youse, Smarly, youse&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> It was Smarlinghue who grinned a little sheepishly, and Smarlinghue who spoke.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought you said we was losing
 time.&rdquo; He brushed past her toward the doorway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
 out by the lane, you go out the other way. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;So long!&rdquo; said Smarlinghue, alias Jimmie Dale&mdash;and vanished
 through the doorway.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  English Steve</b></h2>
<p> It was growing late, near midnight. Through the murk of an uninviting, almost
 ominous-looking basement entrance, whose light, such as it was, seeped upward
 to the sidewalk, Jimmie Dale emerged, and stood for a moment staring up and
 down the dirty, shabby street.</p>
<p> A grim smile was playing on his lips. Behind him, down those few dark, rickety
 steps up which he had just come, and thence through an ill-lighted little cobbler&rsquo;s
 shop, where a cobbler, who was a cobbler in but little more than name, held
 an inner door against the invasion of undesirables and the law, was a thug&rsquo;s
 den than which New York knew no worse. Debauchery and crime, unbridled and
 unlicensed, held sway there. None entered save the initiated&mdash;or those
 the initiated lured there to fleece and work their will upon. Likewise, it
 was a refuge from the law, and, as a refuge, was without its peer. Mickey the
 Cobbler might not be a very good cobbler or a past master of his art, but he
 was a cheery sort and always paid his bills, and never overcharged the poverty-stricken
 neighbourhood that innocently believed it supported him with its patronage!
 So why should it not be safe? Mickey the Cobbler stood high in the estimation
 of the community, and therefore brought no suspicion upon himself from the
 police.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders. What did it matter? There were dozens
 of places like that&mdash;and he had been in and out of dozens of them since
 he had left Mother Margot at Hip Foo&rsquo;s a few hours ago. What did it matter
 the degree of pest hole from which he had just come? In so far as he was concerned
 it had yielded him nothing, and in that respect it was like all the rest. His
 search to-night had been doubly fruitless because he had had a double errand.
 He had found no trace of Bunty Myers on his own account, or of English Steve
 on Mother Margot&rsquo;s.</p>
<p> Again he shrugged his shoulders. He had about given the latter up. As a matter
 of fact, it had only been secondary in any case. And yet he had kept faith
 with Mother Margot. He had visited English Steve&rsquo;s lodging house, and
 he had visited the known haunts of the gang that now held English Steve&rsquo;s
 life forfeit&mdash;and all this before even he had widened his search to embrace
 the secret pest holes of Crimeland such as the one he had just left. And he
 had been rewarded only by failure everywhere.</p>
<p> He could go on, of course, and he would go on until dawn broke, prompted
 by the prime urge to find Bunty Myers; but now, for the moment, the weariness
 of it all seemed to be creeping back upon him again, and this time not without
 its physical as well as its mental demands for at least a measure of consideration.
 His eyes roved down the street. At the corner, drawn up to the curb, there
 was a lunch wagon. He was tired and hungry. A queer, whimsical little smile
 touched his lips. What could be better? A lunch wagon and Smarlinghue, unkempt,
 ragged, dissolute in appearance, went well and in perfect harmony one with
 the other!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale turned abruptly, and walked to the corner. Here he climbed the
 three wooden, abbreviated steps that permitted entrance to the antiquated vehicle,
 and sidled up to the counter.</p>
<p> The lunch wagon for the moment was without customers. The proprietor, rousing
 himself from a doze, laid a mug of hot coffee and a sandwich on the counter
 at Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s mumbled request, slid a pot of mustard in the general
 direction of the sandwich, and subsided again into semi-unconsciousness upon
 some amazingly existent resting place in the crowded space behind the counter.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stared around him, and, as he ate, a sort of ironic facetiousness
 settled upon him. A picture of the St. James Club, with its polished silver
 and its snowy napery, rose before his mind&rsquo;s eye. Here he was Smarlinghue;
 there he was Jimmie Dale, the millionaire. He was almost beginning to wonder
 which of the two was his real, actual entity. Jimmie Dale; Smarlinghue&mdash;the
 Gray Seal! If it were ever known! His eyes fastened on the ungraceful proprietor,
 whose white coat was long overdue at the washtub, and whose white cook&rsquo;s
 hat was limp and grease spotted. It seemed a far cry to the white-haired, immaculate,
 perfectly trained Jason, his own butler, who, too, sometimes served him with
 coffee and sandwiches!</p>
<p> His mind mulled on. He kept staring about him. It was strange! The place
 somehow seemed familiar. Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t it? He had been in a lunch
 wagon before. Not this one probably, but there wasn&rsquo;t much difference
 in the genus lunch wagon, was there? No, that wasn&rsquo;t it! It seemed rather
 to be striving to revive a memory that somehow had to do with&mdash;</p>
<p> Yes, he had it now! English Steve! But that was years ago&mdash;back in the
 days when he, Jimmie Dale, was Larry the Bat in the underworld instead of the
 Smarlinghue of to-day. It was in a lunch wagon just like this. English Steve
 had been there, and two or three others of like ilk. They had adjourned to
 English Steve&rsquo;s room for a game of cards, and he, Jimmie Dale, as Larry
 the Bat, had accepted the invitation to join them. Well, what of it? That wasn&rsquo;t
 where English Steve lived now. English Steve had gone up in his profession
 since he had lived in what was little better than a shed behind old Michael&rsquo;s
 ship-chandler&rsquo;s shop. And he, Jimmie Dale, had already been to English
 Steve&rsquo;s more pretentious, if still seedy, quarters of to-day.</p>
<p> Strange, the stirring of that memory! What was it trying to suggest? That
 English Steve still&mdash;It was absurd, of course! That was years ago. It
 was the last place in all New York that any one would look for English Steve
 to-day. The last place that any one would&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s fingers fumbled in his pockets, and extracted a coin.
 He laid it on the counter, mumbled again at the proprietor&mdash;this time,
 a good-night&mdash;and shuffled his way out to the street.</p>
<p> The <i>last</i> place! The phrase battered at his mind now. If that were so, it
 was the <i>one</i> place to look! And why was it so absurd? There was more than one
 man in New York who maintained two establishments, and on a far more extensive
 scale, without publishing the fact broadcast! English Steve was a crook of
 no mean order, and such an arrangement might well have stood him in good stead
 more than once in respect of the police, and, for that matter, with his erstwhile
 associates&mdash;as it perhaps was serving him now at this minute. With his
 increasing prominence, his rise in the sordid realm of crime, English Steve
 had publicly moved into a more &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; neighbourhood among
 the &eacute;lite of Crimeland; but it might well be that he had continued to
 pay rent for his former lodging&mdash;without any one being the wiser for it
 save old Michael, his landlord, whose shop was stocked with merchandise which
 consisted mainly of ships&rsquo; stores and fittings purloined by the wharf
 rats along the river front! Birds of a feather!</p>
<p> It was worth putting to the test, at least. Certainly it was a tangible,
 definite objective&mdash;something he had not had before all night. He hurried
 now, twisting and turning through alleyways and narrow, darkened streets, until
 finally he had worked his way into a neighbourhood down near the East River
 shore.</p>
<p> The buildings were fewer here, more scattered; there was a generous sprinkling
 of vacant lots; few lights, and no pedestrians. He halted at last in front
 of a low, squat, dingy building, with large double doors and a grimy, unwashed
 show window, through which latter, from the rays of a distant street lamp,
 was just discernible a display of miscellaneous second-hand ships&rsquo; fittings&mdash;a
 heap of tarpaulin, ropes, blocks, tackles and other articles of like nature.
 This was old Michael&rsquo;s. If the man had another name, he, Jimmie Dale,
 did not know what it was. There was only one old Michael on the East Side,
 and that was enough.</p>
<p> The place was in darkness. It stood detached, unprotected by either fence
 or enclosure, and Jimmie Dale now made his way rapidly around to the rear.
 Here a sort of extension, in the shape of an exaggerated lean-to, projected
 out from the back of the building. It was here that in the days gone by, a
 miserable, barely weather-proof hole, English Steve had made his home. And
 here, too, as in front, the place was in utter darkness.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped to the door, and knocked softly upon it. There was no
 answer. He knocked louder, insistently. There was still no response. And then
 he smiled a little ironically at himself. He had come quite a long way&mdash;and
 quite probably on a fool&rsquo;s errand. Certainly English Steve did not appear
 either to be at home or in hiding here!</p>
<p> He stood at the door for a moment frowning. He had begun to doubt very much
 now that English Steve had ever cast eyes on the place again from the day he
 had taken up his quarters nearer the Bowery; but mere doubt did not in any
 way disprove the theory that, somehow, back there in the lunch wagon, had suddenly
 taken possession of him. English Steve might very well be absent at this precise
 moment&mdash;and might very well at the same time still be old Michael&rsquo;s
 tenant.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s jaws snapped suddenly together. He had come quite far
 enough to make it worth while to find out that much anyhow! He tried the door.
 It was locked, of course.</p>
<p> From one of the upright pockets in the leather girdle beneath his threadbare
 vest, Jimmie Dale drew out a little blued-steel pick-lock, and from another
 a diminutive, though none the less powerful, flashlight. For a moment the trained
 fingers worked swiftly at the lock, then the door swung open, and Jimmie Dale
 stepped inside.</p>
<p> He closed the door quietly behind him, and for an instant stood still, listening;
 then the white ray of the flashlight lanced suddenly through the blackness,
 darting here and there over walls and floor.</p>
<p> A smile crept grimly to Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips. English Steve for the moment
 might not be at home; but he, Jimmie Dale, or his intuition, or what had seemed
 perhaps a far-fetched deduction from a memory of years gone by, or whatever
 else one might call it, had after all not been at fault. English Steve still
 lived here&mdash;when it suited English Steve to do so!</p>
<p> The room was in no way changed since the night he had played cards here with
 English Steve. Even the man&rsquo;s clothes were strewn about, here across
 a chair, there even on the floor. An empty beer bottle, and beside it a slab
 of cheese and a portion of a loaf of bread, stood upon the table. But it was
 not these proofs of occupancy that caused Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s smile to tighten
 now. <i>They</i> might belong to anybody. The flashlight was holding steadily on a
 large, half-page photograph, cut from a Sunday supplement, that was tacked
 on the wall. He remembered it very well because English Steve while still sober
 that night had pointed it out with pride, and thereafter when not so sober
 had pointed it out another dozen times. It was a treasured possession of English
 Steve, and whatever else English Steve might have left behind him had he vacated
 the place for good, he most certainly would not have left that. It did not
 amount to much; it was utterly valueless; but to English Steve it had been,
 and still was obviously, a source of intense, if somewhat childish, gratification.
 It was a photograph intended to demonstrate the extent of a record crowd at
 a race course somewhere, and in the foreground, perhaps the most prominent
 figure of all, the photographer by chance had snapped the heavy black-moustached,
 rather rakish-looking figure of English Steve.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale leaned back against the table in the centre of the room. Well,
 that was settled, and for such satisfaction as the establishment of his theory
 afforded him his trip had had its reward. But what was he to do now? Wait here
 for English Steve&rsquo;s return? English Steve might return in an hour, or
 in two days from now&mdash;or <i>never</i>, if Mother Margot was right, and English
 Steve fell into whatever trap was set for him to-night! On the other hand,
 to resume a blind search through the underworld again seemed to offer no greater
 likelihood of finding the man than was presented by the possibility of English
 Steve returning here. Indeed if the man were keeping under cover, as seemed
 more than probable, since, after hours of search, he, Jimmie Dale, had been
 able to find not a single trace of the other, then the chance that right here
 was where English Steve might be met with sooner than anywhere else was not
 without its logical argument. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p> The flashlight was still circling inquisitively about the room. Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 eyes followed the ray abstractedly. It passed across the open doorway of an
 inner room. There had been a cot in there, he remembered&mdash;English Steve&rsquo;s
 bedroom.</p>
<p> Mechanically he moved forward in that direction from the table; and then
 suddenly, with a low, sharp cry, as the flashlight shot forward into the inner
 room, he halted, hard-faced, staring ahead of him across the threshold. He
 had been right in his theory, doubly right, for the search ended here; and
 Mother Margot had been right, and her fears had been only too well justified!
 Sprawled across the floor, his head in a dark, crimson pool, lay the body of
 English Steve.</p>
<p> For the fraction of a second, no more, Jimmie Dale remained motionless, and
 then he was across the threshold and on his knees beside the other. Yes, the
 man was dead. Jimmie Dale turned a little then, and the flashlight circled
 swiftly in all directions about him. There was no weapon&mdash;only the bullet
 hole in English Steve&rsquo;s right temple. The end of the search, the warning
 that Mother Margot had tried to give, had come too late. English Steve had
 been murdered.</p>
<p> So the gang had had their way, had they? It was dirty, miserable work, crook
 though English Steve might be! Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s jaws were clamped now, as
 he leaned forward again and drew a paper, already protruding as though it had
 half dropped out when the man had fallen, from the inside pocket of English
 Steve&rsquo;s coat. It was a folded sheet of foolscap size. He opened it out,
 his flashlight playing upon it. In the folds was a small newspaper clipping;
 while the paper itself was covered with a rough design, or plan, as of some
 interior.</p>
<p> He stared in a perplexed way at the clipping for a moment. It had been cut
 from the middle of a paragraph, and contained only one complete sentence; but
 from the sentence itself, and the fragments of context that preceded and followed,
 it was obviously the report of some jewellery auction. He read it once&mdash;and
 again:</p>
<p class="note"> unusually good value. The pendant was finally knocked down to Mr. Max Linesthal
 after spirited bidding for four thousand, three hundred and eighty-five dollars.
 A cluster ring set with the</p>
<p> From the clipping Jimmie Dale looked again at the roughly drawn sketch, then
 his eyes reverted to the still form on the floor. A minute, two, passed as
 he stood there. Something seemed to tighten in Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;and thrust the clipping and
 paper abruptly into his own pocket.</p>
<p> He turned away then, and began a rapid search of the two rooms.</p>
<p> Still another ten minutes passed, and then Jimmie Dale stepped out into the
 night again, locked the door behind him, and, hurrying now, headed back into
 the East Side.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  A Devil&rsquo;s Alibi</b></h2>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face was drawn in sharp, set lines, as he went swiftly
 along. In a sense the brutal, sordid affair was clear enough. The clipping
 spoke for itself; there had been an auction sale of jewellery, and Max Linesthal
 had brought in a pendant worth roughly four thousand dollars. The drawing was
 probably a sketch of old man Linesthal&rsquo;s place. Jimmie Dale nodded his
 head sharply. Everybody knew Linesthal. Max Linesthal was a prominent, if somewhat
 eccentric figure on the East Side, who lived alone in a combined office and
 dwelling that consisted of the ground floor of a small, two-story house on
 a cross street within a block of the Bowery. The old man, sometimes on his
 own account, sometimes acting for private interests on commission, or even
 for the bigger jewellers who for very justifiable business reasons did not
 wish to appear at the auctions, was a large and well-known buyer of second-hand
 jewellery of the better sort.</p>
<p> This was quite plain, and the inference from it seemed equally so. English
 Steve had seen the account of the auction, knew that a valuable pendant was
 in Linesthal&rsquo;s possession, and had in some way managed to obtain the
 information that had enabled him to make a rough, working sketch of the old
 jeweller&rsquo;s flat. Following out the inference to its logical conclusion,
 therefore, English Steve either had already robbed Max Linesthal of the pendant,
 or had proposed to do so before the night was out.</p>
<p> A puzzled light for an instant crept into Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s dark eyes.
 What was the <i>date</i> of the clipping? It might be a week old; the auction might
 have been held days ago! He shook his head impatiently, as though irritated
 at his own momentary stupidity. It was nothing of the sort; or, if it was,
 then what he had found in English Steve&rsquo;s pocket meant nothing at all.
 No robbery of any such nature as that could be committed without its being
 known everywhere in the underworld at least within a short time after the police
 were on the scene. Therefore, unless the robbery had been committed yesterday,
 or the day before, or a week ago, which it most certainly had not, since nothing
 was known of it in the underworld, the clipping, to have any present significance,
 must almost certainly have been cut from a paper of very recent date, for English
 Steve would realise that there was no guarantee, rather the opposite in fact,
 that Max Linesthal would keep the pendant in his possession for any length
 of time before he disposed of it again.</p>
<p> The whole thing narrowed down then to two suppositions: English Steve had
 not yet carried out his plans when he was shot down, presumably, by the gang;
 or he had already committed the robbery just previous to his murder and the
 pendant was then, at that time, either in his immediate possession or hidden
 somewhere, probably in his rooms. But he, Jimmie Dale, had searched and had
 found nothing. It might still be there, still craftily hidden, of course; but
 if not, and the robbery <i>had</i> been committed, then the alternative seemed blatantly
 obvious. The gang, sworn to English Steve&rsquo;s destruction, had found the
 pendant in their victim&rsquo;s possession, and taken it&mdash;that was all.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale went on, traversing block after block. And now a queer, whimsical
 smile brought a softer expression to his face. Those papers were damning evidence,
 and he had appropriated them without right or reason! He shrugged his shoulders.
 Perhaps! It had been impulse. He admitted that; but it was not an impulse that
 he regretted, or would undo now if he could. If it had been only an <i>intended</i> robbery, one that had not known fruition, there was sorrow and shame enough
 for some one&mdash;perhaps a mother; perhaps an old father; certainly some
 one who loved even English Steve&mdash;without needlessly adding to a measure
 already so miserably full. There would be time enough for those papers to come
 into the hands of the police if they were needed to point the way to a more
 thorough search of English Steve&rsquo;s rooms than he, Jimmie Dale, had made;
 or failing that, to English Steve&rsquo;s erstwhile gang and present murderers
 in whose possession the pendant then must be.</p>
<p> The softer expression vanished, and there came again a troubled look into
 Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face. There was still another angle to the affair, one
 he did not like. If the robbery <i>had</i> been committed, it must have taken place,
 say, quite a little while before midnight in order to have allowed English
 Steve time enough for its actual accomplishment, the time to get back from
 Max Linesthal&rsquo;s to old Michael&rsquo;s, and, on top of that, the time
 to account for what had then occurred in his own rooms. That, then, would be
 long before he, Jimmie Dale, had started out from the lunch wagon, and had
 anything come to the ears of the police up to that time, it would as certainly
 have been known in the resorts. And there had been not even a whisper of it.
 Why then had not Max Linesthal sent out an alarm, or, rather&mdash;<i>what had
 happened to Max Linesthal?</i> Jimmie Dale shook his head again. No; that was putting
 it in its worst phase. English Steve would not have hesitated at anything in
 the nature of violence perhaps, if, for instance, he had been caught in the
 act; but it was far more likely that his work would have been done so secretly
 and successfully that it had not even now been discovered. And yet, at a fairly
 early hour of night, before possibly the old jeweller had even gone to bed,
 to break in, blow a safe, and&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders. The answer lay at Max Linesthal&rsquo;s.
 He was going there now&mdash;he smiled grimly to himself&mdash;via the lane
 and the back door, secretively, like a thief himself. It would hardly do for
 Smarlinghue to present himself at the front door, and, if Max Linesthal responded
 to the summons, inquire if a robbery had been perpetrated! It would be even
 worse, if a robbery and perhaps violence to Max Linesthal had taken place,
 should Smarlinghue have been seen in or near the house. And that was the vital
 question. He could not morally side-step it. The old jeweller lived alone.
 Had Max Linesthal come to any harm?</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s pace slowed now suddenly to one of almost hesitancy.
 He was very near the place now; it was just around the corner. Perhaps it would
 be safer if, even by the back door, instead of Smarlinghue, it was Jimmie Dale
 who went! But it was quite a little distance from here to the Sanctuary where
 through one door Smarlinghue could enter, and through the French window on
 the squalid courtyard, and thence to the lane, Jimmie Dale could emerge. No!
 It would take too much time to go to the Sanctuary; and, besides, it could
 serve no real purpose. He did not propose to be seen&mdash;or heard. If nothing
 had happened in Max Linesthal&rsquo;s place yet, nothing would happen now since
 English Steve was dead, and he, Jimmie Dale, would leave as unostentatiously
 as he entered; if, on the other hand, the break had been made, he would leave
 with equal unostentatiousness and the police in some way, anonymously, could
 be notified. Even as Smarlinghue then, well known as Smarlinghue was in that
 neighbourhood, he was quite safe.</p>
<p> He slipped suddenly into the mouth of a lane that opened beside him. The
 slouching gait was gone now. He was running swiftly, silently, in the darkness.
 There was no question of locating Max Linesthal&rsquo;s back yard. His years
 of Larry the Bat in the old Sanctuary, of Smarlinghue in the new, where his
 life had literally depended upon it, had taught him every inch of the network
 of lanes and alleyways in this section of the East Side.</p>
<p> And now, with a lithe spring Jimmie Dale was over a fence, and in another
 instant, running across the yard, was crouched before a door that opened almost
 on a level with the ground. There was no light anywhere. He could hear no sound&mdash;save
 the distant rumble of the elevated from the direction of the Bowery. And then
 the slim, sensitive fingers of Jimmie Dale, no less deft or agile for the grime
 and uncared-for appearance that was theirs as an integral part of Smarlinghue,
 were at work again with the little pick-lock.</p>
<p> The door opened, closed&mdash;without a sound. Jimmie Dale stood inside.
 It was as though a shadow of but a moment ago outside in the darkness and silence
 had moved&mdash;and vanished.</p>
<p> But it was not dark here in the narrow hallway. A little ahead, a faint light
 showed through from a partially open doorway. Nor was it silent. Voices reached
 him, though the words themselves were not distinguishable.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stood for an instant motionless. What did it mean? A mare&rsquo;s
 nest? A late visitor? Something equally commonplace? The sketch in his pocket
 reproduced itself in a mental picture before his eyes. The four rooms from
 front to rear each had a door opening into the one next to it, and each had
 a door opening on this narrow passage here. The room ahead from which the light
 came was the second one from the front, the room that showed the safe marked
 on the plan. There had been no light showing as he had come along the lane,
 of course, because the rooms were on the opposite side of the house, and there
 were apparently no windows in the hallway here.</p>
<p> What did it mean? If nothing had happened, nothing would happen since English
 Steve was dead. His mind insisted on reiterating that statement. What was it,
 then? An ordinary, perhaps business, visitor; or the aftermath of the robbery
 in the shape of the presence of the police?</p>
<p> He stole forward cautiously, without sound, hugging the wall. The voices
 grew more distinct. And then, back against the wall, himself unseen, protected
 both by the angle at which he stood and the angle of the partially opened door,
 he stood staring into the lighted room.</p>
<p> Reality! Strange how that thought had obsessed him all night. Well, at least,
 this wasn&rsquo;t reality&mdash;or else his reason was in collapse, his sanity
 a gibing mockery. The room was evidently used by Max Linesthal as a bedroom,
 even though he kept his safe there, for the bed was there too, and Max Linesthal
 in his nightclothes sat lashed, a prisoner in a chair. He could understand
 that; but after that he was either mad or it was all a myth. A man was kneeling
 at the safe. He knew the man; he knew him quite well. He had even been with
 him that evening, had even left him not more than half an hour ago&mdash;only
 he had left the man lying dead upon the floor of a miserable shack with a bullet
 hole through his right temple, and it was the dead man who was kneeling there
 now at the safe. The man at the safe was English Steve.</p>
<p> Brain and vision now both seemed blurred. Jimmie Dale hung there. He was
 trying to fight his way out of some mental morass, wasn&rsquo;t he? The man
 was dead, and he was lying in a pool of blood miles away, and yet he was here,
 moving, yes, and speaking, just as though he were alive.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Come on, now! Come across!&rdquo; the man snapped at the bound figure
 in the chair. &ldquo;You know what&rsquo;ll happen if you don&rsquo;t! You
 know me, don&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ve seen me often enough around these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I know you.&rdquo; Max Linesthal was an old man; and
 it was perhaps only the cords that held him from collapsing in his chair, for
 his face was deathlike in its fear. &ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re English Steve.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo; snapped the man at the safe again. &ldquo;Well,
 that ought to be enough to teach you what&rsquo;s good for your health. You
 get just one minute. Take your choice. If I have to blow the safe, I might
 as well set you up against it for the pad! Get me? Now then, what&rsquo;s the
 combination? Quick!&rdquo; He reached out and gave a sudden, vicious wrench
 at the leg of the chair.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; the old man cried out hoarsely. &ldquo;Wait!
 I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you. It&rsquo;s twenty-eight and a half left, nineteen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale was not listening. Was he <i>really</i> mad? Yes, perhaps; but whether
 the man was dead or not, he was robbing the safe. And he, Jimmie Dale, could
 do nothing! He was Smarlinghue. To interfere with any crook&rsquo;s work was
 to bring the enmity of the underworld down upon the offender. It was the law
 of the underworld. It would destroy Smarlinghue. Better that Linesthal should
 lose his jewels&mdash;a thousand times better. Smarlinghue was the one chance
 he, Jimmie Dale, had to find the Phantom, the one chance he had to stand between
 the woman that he loved and the death that threatened her. With the doors of
 the underworld once closed against Smarlinghue, there was no&mdash;</p>
<p> Slowly, as though the act were almost subconscious, his hand crept now toward
 his pocket, crept into it, snuggled around the butt of his automatic, and,
 snuggling, tightened suddenly in a fierce, convulsive grip. The safe was open
 now, and the man kneeling there had his back to Linesthal in the chair, his
 side face to the door. He was ransacking the interior of the safe. Books and
 papers were being flung on the floor. A diamond pendant glistened in the light.
 It was laid on the table beside the safe. There were other jewels. They began
 to make a glittering little heap. But it was curious, strangely curious that
 the heavy black moustache should suddenly have seemed to sag down at one side;
 strange that the man should be taking the time now to pause in his work to
 twirl at it like some sophisticated dandy! No&mdash;it was off! And now the
 man was carefully readjusting it.</p>
<p> Through Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s veins, as though some floodgates were suddenly
 rent asunder, his blood was racing now in a wild, mad, surging tide. Laroque!
 It was Gentleman Laroque, alias <i>the Phantom!</i> The master of impersonation! Yes,
 he understood now! There was no madness in his brain. He understood! It was
 hellish in its cunning&mdash;a devil&rsquo;s alibi. The Phantom, if he were
 not entirely playing a lone hand through lack of trust in his erstwhile tools
 and pawns, was at least playing the major r&ocirc;le. A safe r&ocirc;le! <i>His
 alibi was a dead man!</i></p>
<p> Swift as lightning flashes Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s mind worked now. Yes, he understood.
 It was the Phantom, not the gang, who had murdered English Steve. It was the
 Phantom, not English Steve, who had taken that clipping from the paper, made
 that sketch, and placed them in the dead man&rsquo;s pocket. Max Linesthal
 would be robbed, and would swear that it was English Steve&mdash;the Phantom
 had but a moment gone taken care to make doubly sure of that point&mdash;then
 English Steve would be found murdered; the police would attribute the murder
 without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation to the gang who had boasted everywhere
 that they would take English Steve&rsquo;s life; and to the gang, too, having
 failed to find the jewels elsewhere, would be attributed, even as he, Jimmie
 Dale, had thought might be the case, the possession of the proceeds of the
 robbery from Max Linesthal&rsquo;s safe. That was why the robbery was being
 pulled here now in so open and bare-faced a manner, intentionally so, as part
 of the plan, an integral, vital part of the plan&mdash;to establish the alibi
 that English Steve could never now refute!</p>
<p> The room seemed to swim before Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;<i>red</i>. Smarlinghue!
 What did it matter now if Smarlinghue were seen, if Smarlinghue lived or died,
 so that this inhuman fiend found his end too at the same time! That was what
 Smarlinghue existed for&mdash;the final reckoning&mdash;the end. And it was
 here now. There was the man he had sought through days and nights of ceaseless,
 torturing effort. The Phantom! Primal, elemental, his soul itself seemed stripped
 of all else but a blind, savage&mdash;</p>
<p> What was that? The doorbell, wasn&rsquo;t it? The doorbell in two quick,
 short rings! Jimmie Dale, about to step forward into the other room, his automatic
 already flung forward, instinctively held motionless for an instant&mdash;and
 in that instant he saw the Phantom leap to his feet, and whirl to the electric-light
 switch just beside the safe. There was a <i>click</i>. The house was in utter blackness.</p>
<p> But Jimmie Dale was in action now. A signal, of course, those two rings!
 Why? From whom? But it didn&rsquo;t matter now. Nothing mattered save to come
 to grips with the Phantom in there. It was pitch black, but he knew what the
 other&rsquo;s next move would be as well as though the room were still alight.</p>
<p> With a bound, Jimmie Dale was through the doorway and into the room. The
 table&mdash;those jewels! They were what the Phantom had come here for&mdash;and
 signal or no signal, be its meaning what it might, the Phantom would not leave
 without them if he could help it.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale brought up against the table with a crash. His hand swept swiftly
 across its top, and as he brushed the jewels to the floor, to safety, a hand,
 groping it seemed, touched his&mdash;and was instantly drawn away before he
 could grasp it.</p>
<p> A snarl came out of the darkness on the other side of the table. A cry of
 terror rang out from the old man lashed in the chair. And then a blinding flash,
 the roar of a revolver shot, as the Phantom fired&mdash;and missed.</p>
<p> And Jimmie Dale laughed now, laughed with the tongue flame of the shot still
 hot upon his cheek, and, hurling the table out of the way, he flung himself
 forward again. He could not see. He could only spring straight for the spot
 where the shot had come from. He could not fire in return&mdash;he might hit
 the old man in the chair.</p>
<p> His fingers closed, gripped at a sleeve, tightened, and his other hand, with
 clubbed automatic, swung upward in a fierce, short-arm jab. And his soul cried
 out in joy as he felt the blow go home.</p>
<p> There was a sharp cry of pain; then a sudden, furious wrench that tore the
 sleeve from Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s grasp&mdash;and then the sound, deadened now,
 almost lost in Max Linesthal&rsquo;s terrified cries, of a step racing across
 the floor.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s jaws clamped hard together. To use his flashlight was
 to offer himself as a target that would not be missed a second time. But the
 man was making for the door, of course. Jimmie Dale leaped back in the darkness
 across the room&mdash;too late! The door slammed. He heard it locked. He heard
 the footsteps racing down the little hallway toward the back entrance.</p>
<p> But if there was no time to unlock this one, there was still another door&mdash;the
 connecting door from this room into the next, and from there into the hall.
 His flashlight now! It gleamed as he wrenched it from his pocket and ran to
 the connecting door. Was this, too, locked! Strange, those scattered jewels
 on the floor; that uncouth creature in a nightgown lashed in a chair and screaming
 in fright! He wrenched again at the door. No, it was not locked; but it was
 badly warped, and it stuck. His shoulder, all his body weight, went against
 it. It gave now, almost bursting from its hinges.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale lunged through. It had cost him time; time enough, he was afraid,
 to allow the Phantom to get away across the yard, and&mdash;Yes! He had gained
 the rear door himself now. No one was in sight. But it was dark, damnably dark,
 and&mdash;What was that noise? It seemed to be a commotion of some sort going
 on in the street out in front of the house. The neighbours must have heard
 the old jeweller&rsquo;s screams. He was still screaming. Well, it didn&rsquo;t
 matter what it was! There was still a chance. The Phantom could not yet be
 very far away, and he must have gone by the lane.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale was running now. In an instant he had crossed the yard; and then,
 as he poised to swing himself over the fence, he drew suddenly back instead,
 and crouched down in the shadows. Some one was climbing over the fence <i>from</i> the lane not ten yards away from where he stood. A voice, muffled, gruff, reached
 him:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Look out for that damned nail, sergeant!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The police! A form, silhouetted against the night, showed on the top of the
 fence for a moment, then dropped to the ground. It was followed by another.
 Jimmie Dale crouched closer in against the fence in the shadows. He gnawed
 his lip now in bitter chagrin. He was not afraid of being discovered, it was
 far too dark for that; but he knew that with this further delay any hope of
 finding the Phantom again was definitely at an end.</p>
<p> The two men were joined by a third. They crossed the yard, and disappeared
 inside the house.</p>
<p> Cautiously now, Jimmie Dale moved farther on along the side of the fence
 away from the house. With the Phantom gone, it became purely a question of
 self-preservation now. Smarlinghue found here by the police and subjected to
 a search, held perhaps until the make-up, worn off in a police cell, disclosed
 Jimmie Dale, was but little more pleasant to contemplate than was the present
 realisation of the Phantom&rsquo;s escape!</p>
<p> Well, it should be safe enough here. He was at the far end of the yard now;
 and silently, quickly, he swung himself over the fence into the lane. He broke
 into a run, swerved into an alleyway that crossed the lane some fifty yards
 farther on, and, following this, finally emerged on a cross street a block
 away from the old jeweller&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p> There was a certain strange, abnormally cold composure upon him now; a sort
 of philosophical acceptance of the fact that the Phantom had got away. But
 his mind was probing, sifting, searching for the answer that would explain
 the direct cause of the Phantom&rsquo;s escape, leaving him, Jimmie Dale, victor
 only to the extent of having saved for the old jeweller the contents of his
 safe. Who was it who had given that signal, which, so evidently now, had been
 a warning that the police were at hand? And how did it happen that the police
 had known anything about what was going on in Max Linesthal&rsquo;s? It wasn&rsquo;t
 the shot or Max Linesthal&rsquo;s screams&mdash;there hadn&rsquo;t been any
 disturbance up to the time the doorbell had rung!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, shuffling along, as Smarlinghue always shuffled, went up the
 block, turned the corner of the street on which Max Linesthal&rsquo;s house
 stood&mdash;and as though suddenly attracted by the little crowd that had gathered
 in front of the old jeweller&rsquo;s, made his way forward in that direction.
 He reached the fringe of the crowd as a man in the uniform of a police lieutenant,
 jumping from a car, pushed his way unceremoniously through the rather tough-looking
 aggregation on the sidewalk, and halted before a policeman who stood on duty
 at the door. Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes narrowed for an instant. That was Klinger,
 a lieutenant in the precinct. It might be worth while!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue, was apparently actuated now by no other motive
 than an ill-mannered, morbid curiosity that prompted him to secure the best
 vantage point that he could, for, as he wormed and elbowed his way nearer the
 lieutenant, his mouth was agape, breathless with interest, in a sort of senile
 way.</p>
<p> He caught the lieutenant&rsquo;s quick flung question to the officer at the
 door:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Did you get him, Lynch?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; the man answered.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t! How&rsquo;s that? That woman, whoever she was, handed
 us a fake tip over the phone, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Smarlinghue&rsquo;s ragged form edged still closer to the two officers, as
 though his curiosity were now beyond the bounds of restraint, as though he
 were not only utterly oblivious to, but quite innocent of the impropriety of
 standing there with blear, blinking eyes and gaping mouth, greedily drinking
 in a conversation by no means intended for his ears. The woman, whoever she
 was! It was the Tocsin, then, who had sent the warning to the police. It couldn&rsquo;t
 have been any one else.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; the man addressed as Lynch answered. &ldquo;It was
 straight enough, only there was an outside worker on the job, I guess. Anyway,
 just as we got to the corner over there and started to cross the street, a
 man ran up to Linesthal&rsquo;s door here, and then beat it like blazes down
 the street, and got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Did you get a look at him? Know who he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t sure,&rdquo; Lynch replied. &ldquo;But O&rsquo;Grady
 said he thought it looked like the Kitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Kitten! Jimmie Dale was fumbling with his battered hat. The crowd, as
 it jostled, had suddenly pushed him none too gently against the police lieutenant&rsquo;s
 elbow.</p>
<p> Lieutenant Klinger swung sharply around.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Send this damned mob about their business!&rdquo; he snapped at the
 policeman. &ldquo;And maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to run in one or
 two of them while you&rsquo;re at it. Some of &rsquo;em look as though they
 were due for it!&rdquo; He stared suddenly into Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You,
 eh, Smarlinghue? Hop-fighting, I suppose! What the hell are you doing around
 here?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Smarlinghue circled his lips with his tongue. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
 ain&rsquo;t doing nothing,&rdquo; he mumbled&mdash;and shrinking back through
 the crowd, and casting furtive glances over his shoulder in the direction of
 the police lieutenant while the crowd laughed, Smarlinghue scurried hurriedly
 down the street.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Voice</b></h2>
<p> It was like the glow of a firefly. It flitted here and there, lancing its
 tiny stabs of light indefatigably through the darkness. From somewhere without,
 in the distance, muffled, there came faintly the rumbling of wheels, the clatter
 of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs on the pavement. There was no other sound.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale rose from his hands and knees, and, with the diminutive flashlight
 switched off now, stood staring around him in the darkness. Under the black
 silk mask his forehead furrowed. This was one of Mother Margot&rsquo;s rooms&mdash;the
 room from which the Phantom had so mysteriously disappeared on that first night.
 He had searched here before&mdash;more than once&mdash;in an effort to discover
 the secret of the Phantom&rsquo;s disappearance. But he had never found anything.
 To-night, because he had never been satisfied with his previous efforts, and
 because he had now been afforded a better opportunity of searching the place
 than ever before, he had returned to it again. He had been at it for two hours
 now. And still he had found nothing.</p>
<p> Both Mother Margot and the Tocsin had warned him to beware of the place&mdash;that
 it was a trap. Both had warned him that the Phantom asked nothing better than
 to lure him here. He shook his head. That might well have been true of a month
 ago, when, in the guise of Isaac Shiftel, alias Gentleman Laroque, the Phantom&rsquo;s
 unaccountable disappearance from this room before his, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s,
 eyes, might naturally have been relied upon to bring him back without loss
 of time in the hope of getting at the bottom of the mystery. But not to-day.
 It was too long ago now. If, as a trap, it had not proved effective almost
 immediately after it was baited, the Phantom, from the standpoint of pure logic,
 must long since have given over any hope of it ever proving effective as a
 trap at all.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled grimly. He had, in spite of warnings, invaded the place
 almost immediately after that night&mdash;and he had not been able to find
 even a trap, let alone the secret of the Phantom&rsquo;s disappearance! Nor
 was Mother Margot in the secret. He was convinced of that. True, she had been
 installed here by the Phantom when the latter had been forced to vacate the
 premises after the police raid, and she had obviously been installed here for
 the purpose of keeping any stranger from renting the rooms, and therefore,
 by her occupancy, of safeguarding that secret for the Phantom, but of its nature
 he was sure she was ignorant. He doubted, indeed, if the Phantom trusted any
 one to that extent!</p>
<p> But, in any case, Mother Margot was away to-night. And so to-night&rsquo;s
 conditions offered him the opportunity for a search that, prolong it as he
 chose, was almost guaranteed against any interruption, or, as he felt confident
 now, any risk of the place proving a trap. Mother Margot was away. He did not
 know where she was. It did not matter. Presumably there was devil&rsquo;s work
 afoot again to-night, and she was engaged in her share of it. He only knew
 that for the first time since she had succeeded the Phantom as the tenant of
 these rooms, she had absented herself from her usual haunts. As Smarlinghue,
 who at her request had haunted the dens and dives of the underworld for one
 English Steve last night, he had been free, without risk of bringing any suspicion
 upon the character of &ldquo;Smarlinghue,&rdquo; to seek her out openly at
 her pushcart&mdash;which covered her real activities&mdash;on Thompson Street
 that morning. But she had not been there. She had, however, in view of what
 had transpired the previous night, obviously expected him, for he had found
 a message waiting for him with an old Italian who had his cart next to hers.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You Smarly?&rdquo; the old Italian had said. &ldquo;Margot go away
 one, two day&mdash;come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Through the darkness Jimmie Dale stared around him, his brows still knitted.
 The best opportunity he had ever had of searching these rooms had been his
 to-night, and he had seized it, but was there any use in continuing the search?
 He had the rest of the night before him, for that matter, if he chose to devote
 it to that purpose&mdash;but was it worth while? He had covered every inch
 of the floor, every inch of the walls up to a reasonable height, and his search
 had gone utterly unrewarded. He had been minute, painstaking, exact, thorough
 to a degree, and he had found nothing. Was there any use in going all over
 it again?</p>
<p> He half turned away toward the door, but halted again. There was a secret
 here&mdash;even if he had never been able to find it. There was a clue here&mdash;even
 if so far it had proved but a phantom clue. That fact would not down. He hesitated
 an instant, and then, with a shrug of his shoulders, moved softly halfway across
 the room. Well, once more, then!</p>
<p> He began to reconstruct again the scene of that first night&mdash;here in
 this room, the inner one of the two that Mother Margot now occupied. It was
 exactly here he had stood when Isaac Shiftel, stripped of his disguise, had
 suddenly turned off the light and in the ensuing darkness had vanished, as
 that trite saying had it, into thin air. The man could not have gone by the
 door, because there was only one door, and he, Jimmie Dale, had been blocking
 the doorway; nor could the man have gone by the single window, because at that
 time the police had been on guard in the alleyway outside. Through the wall
 or the floor then? Yes. But how? Where? Neither wall nor floor showed any&mdash;</p>
<p> Out of the darkness, without warning, there came suddenly a low, ugly laugh.</p>
<p> &ldquo;The Gray Seal!&rdquo; said a voice.</p>
<p> In an instant, strained and tense, his automatic whipped from his pocket
 and outflung before him, Jimmie Dale drew back against the wall. A trap after
 all! The trap he had so logically proven to have outlived its usefulness! He
 strained his eyes through the blackness. Nothing! He could see nothing. Nor
 was there any further sound. A minute passed. Was it a minute&mdash;or some
 vast, immeasurable &aelig;on of time? He stood rigid, motionless&mdash;waiting.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said a voice abruptly.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale turned his head; his automatic swung swiftly. The voice seemed
 to have come almost from his elbow. Then his jaws locked hard together. No;
 it was not from there! They were playing with him, were they? A cat-and-mouse
 game! Well then, he&mdash;</p>
<p> A voice spoke again:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Worth anywhere from thirty to fifty thousand. Easy money.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale pushed back his hat, and above his mask flirted away a bead of
 sweat from his forehead. He understood now. There wasn&rsquo;t any one in the
 room save himself. It wasn&rsquo;t a trap. It was only uncanny. He was simply
 listening to snatches of a conversation that came from the nowhere, out of
 the darkness.</p>
<p> He leaned forward a little, striving to the utmost to <i>place</i> the direction
 of the sounds. The voices, he realised now, while quite distinct, had been
 curiously heavy and uneven. He nodded sharply to himself. A pipe, a hollow
 space, almost anything might act as a conductor for the sound waves, and bring
 them here from no little distance at that!</p>
<p> Once more a voice broke through the stillness:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Easy money, yes; but old Twisty Munn&rsquo;s no fool, and neither
 is Kid Gregg. The stuff will be pinched by now, but we&rsquo;ve plenty of time
 left&mdash;enough to see that there are no mistakes made.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again there came the low, ugly laugh.</p>
<p> &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any! One o&rsquo;clock at Twisty&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> The voice ended as abruptly as though, if speaking over a telephone, the
 wire had been suddenly cut. There seemed to Jimmie Dale no other way to describe
 it. He stared around him in a queer, helpless way. Now the voices had seemed
 to come from here, now from there. His lips twisted in grim self-mockery. The
 longer he had listened the more confusing it had become. The voices simply
 came from <i>everywhere</i> in the room.</p>
<p> Had they ended now?</p>
<p> The tiny glow of the flashlight played for an instant on the crystal of his
 watch. It was fourteen minutes past twelve.</p>
<p> Noiselessly now Jimmie Dale moved across the room to a chair. The sort of
 finality with which that last sentence had been broken off held out little
 hope, he felt intuitively, of his hearing anything more. But there was a chance.
 He sat down quietly. Strange! Where had the voices come from? From below, above&mdash;where?
 He did not know. He knew only that <i>one</i> of those voices must be the Phantom&rsquo;s.
 It did not require proof. It was axiomatic. He could not locate the direction
 from which the voices had come, but the opening through which the Phantom had
 once vanished from this room was obviously the medium through which the voices
 entered. How cleverly deduced! He snapped at himself mentally. The only trouble
 was that after prolonged and laborious search he had not been able to locate
 that opening either!</p>
<p> His fingers played softly in a curiously caressing way over his automatic.
 It hadn&rsquo;t been any trap. The allusion to the Gray Seal that had so startled
 him had been only a snatch of the conversation which had at first, through
 some cause or other that he was unable to define, reached him only in broken
 fragments. Or perhaps, after all, it was a trap&mdash;the other way around.
 A trap for the trapper! If he could not locate the voices here, it might not
 possibly be so difficult to do so at, say, one Twisty Munn&rsquo;s&mdash;at
 one o&rsquo;clock!</p>
<p> He sat there in the darkness listening, his mind at work. One of the voices
 had been the Phantom&rsquo;s, that was beyond question or doubt; but which
 one of the two it was he did not know. He could, he was certain, have recognised
 Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s, alias the Phantom&rsquo;s, voice anywhere under
 ordinary circumstances, but here, due unquestionably to the mysterious way
 in which the sound waves had been transmitted, all sense of inflexion had been
 lost. Nor did the conversation itself, as he went over it again in his mind,
 help to differentiate in that respect one speaker from the other. Either one
 of the two, from what had been said, might have been the Phantom.</p>
<p> Twisty Munn&rsquo;s at one o&rsquo;clock! He smiled grimly. One of the two
 voices at least, possibly both of them, would be at Twisty Munn&rsquo;s at
 one o&rsquo;clock. Well, if nothing further eventuated here, he, too, would
 be at Twisty Munn&rsquo;s at that hour. His search, the hours he had spent
 here, had perhaps not been so fruitless after all! It was an even chance at
 least that, in spite of the continued silence in this room now, he would hear
 <i>the</i> voice again to-night. And if he did&mdash;</p>
<p> His face hardened suddenly. Last night he had held the Phantom at his mercy,
 last night he could have shot to kill before the man had even been aware of
 his presence; and last night, because he had failed to realise that it was
 a Thing blood-flecked with murder, a Thing that preyed upon every decency in
 life, and not a human being, the Phantom had escaped. Last night this had happened.
  <i>There would be no second time</i>. There was another life at stake&mdash;hers&mdash;the
 Tocsin&rsquo;s. Last night he had jeopardised that life because he had not
 fought the Phantom with the Phantom&rsquo;s own weapons, but all that was now
 at an end.</p>
<p> And as he sat there listening, and there was still no further sound, he found
 himself strangely, abnormally calm, strangely callous even, as though this
 decision were but commonplace and one of everyday occurrence. He asked now
 only for one more meeting with the Phantom. Where, or how, it did not matter.
 Just once more!</p>
<p> The minutes passed. The tiny flashlight winked again through the darkness
 and lighted up the dial of Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p> It was twenty-five minutes of one.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stood up. There was evidently nothing more to be heard here,
 or if there was, and he waited any longer, then the chance of hearing anything
 at Twisty Munn&rsquo;s must go by the board&mdash;and as a choice between the
 two he very much inclined toward Twisty Munn&rsquo;s now. He moved softly through
 the connecting doorway, and traversed the adjoining room that opened on the
 hall. Here, the door opened and closed silently behind him, and Jimmie Dale,
 lost in the darkness of the unlighted hallway, reached the rear door of the
 tenement, and stepped out into a small back yard. A moment more, and he was
 over the fence, and, slipping his mask from his face, was running noiselessly
 along a lane.</p>
<p> Two blocks away he emerged upon a dingy, ill-lighted and uninviting street.
 He smiled a little whimsically, as he pulled his soft felt hat somewhat rakishly
 to one side and well down over his eyes, and, hunching the perfectly fitting
 dinner coat at one of the shoulders, turned up the collar around his neck.
 True, the costume was hardly <i>de rigueur</i> in the East Side, but he was Jimmie
 Dale, not Smarlinghue, to-night. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, did it matter?
 He was not on his way to attend any <i>public</i> function, and as for the streets
 there were always the shadows of the buildings to hug a little closer, always
 a loose, slouching gait to assume.</p>
<p> Twisty Munn! Kid Gregg! What was the game these two were playing to-night?
 He shook his head impatiently. That did not matter either. It mattered only
 that the Phantom was concerned in their movements. It was common knowledge
 in the underworld that Twisty Munn was a &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; for a certain
 class of apparently honest establishments, where, if the alibi were good enough,
 stolen goods, disguised of course, were offered over the counters to the public
 at prices well in excess of what could be obtained through the underground
 channels employed by the regular &ldquo;fences.&rdquo; It was profitable for
 all concerned, even taking into account the commission charged by the crafty
 Twisty Munn, who lived apparently&mdash;for the benefit of the police&mdash;in
 a condition approaching almost abject poverty in a squalid, ill-furnished room
 at the top of a seedy and somewhat questionable tenement over in the direction
 of the East River. Kid Gregg, less known save by the inner circle of the underworld,
 which latter had already marked him for preferment, was a young and budding
 crook, still outside the ken of the police, who showed exceeding promise in
 the profession he had chosen. In a word, neither of them had ever had any dealings
 or were in any way connected with Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s, alias the Phantom&rsquo;s
 gang.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s dark eyes narrowed grimly as he went along. The conclusion
 was somewhat obvious. The Phantom was by no means averse to plucking the plums
 ripened by some one else, and it was fairly evident that in some way or another
 he had got wind of one that had been ripened by Twisty Munn and Kid Gregg.
 It looked very much therefore as though the night were likely to develop into
 a three-cornered game, counting in himself, Jimmie Dale, with the added possibility
 that the trumps perhaps might be in the hand that neither Twisty Munn nor Kid
 Gregg in the first place, nor the Phantom in the second, suspected!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale covered block after block at a swinging stride. His mind reverted
 to Mother Margot&rsquo;s rooms. It was strange where those voices had come
 from! He could not tear the building down to find out. He had already known
 there was a secret exit from that room. The voices in that respect had not
 proved anything further. His mind mulled on. A search of the rooms adjacent
 to Mother Margot&rsquo;s offered no prospect of help in the solution of the
 problem. If the room itself, where he <i>knew</i> the secret exit to be, was so apparently
 search proof, what better chance would any other room offer? Or why, as a matter
 of fact, should the secret exit even lead into any other room? Well, the cellar
 then, for the Phantom could not have gone up through the roof! There was no
 cellar! The ground floor was a sort of basement in itself! Those voices&mdash;</p>
<p> Cycles! He was beginning all over again. He shook his head in self-exasperation,
 and with a mental effort dismissed these thoughts from his mind. He had almost
 reached his destination, and the immediate present demanded his full attention.</p>
<p> Under a street lamp he looked at his watch. Twelve minutes to one. He nodded.
 He was well on time. Just ahead of him was the three-story tenement where Twisty
 Munn made his home.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Jackals</b></h2>
<p> The street was deserted. The tenement itself was dark. Not a light showed
 from any window. But Twisty Munn lived in an upstairs room at the rear, therefore
 the fact that no light could be seen from the street had no bearing whatever
 on Twisty Munn.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped suddenly into the doorway. The door itself, the entrance
 common to heaven alone knew how many who hived in wretchedness and squalor
 within, and to whom a latchkey would have been not far removed from mockery,
 was unlocked as he had expected. He moved noiselessly into the hall. The place
 was close and dank to the nostrils; also it reeked with the odour of garlic.
 It was dark, too; but through the murk he could just make out the stairs ahead
 of him and to the left.</p>
<p> There was a curious tightening of Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips as he moved forward
 and tested the tread of the first stair cautiously. Yes, he knew the breed!
 Old and in disrepair, the stairs would certainly shriek their protest to high
 heaven if any liberty were taken with them. But it was Jimmie Dale of the old
 days, Jimmie Dale of the days of Larry the Bat and the rickety stairs of the
 old Sanctuary, worse even than these stairs were, where his life had literally
 depended upon his silence a score of times, as he went upward now.</p>
<p> He gained the first landing. There were doors around him here, and, because
 they were flimsy doors and flimsy partitions, from behind them the night sounds
 reached him&mdash;the restless movement of a sleeper, the sick, querulous cry
 of a child, a stertorous snore.</p>
<p> Twelve minutes of one! Ten now, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p> There were three flights. At the third landing Jimmie Dale paused for an
 instant to adjust the black silk mask over his face again, then stole forward,
 feeling out with his hand along the wall, toward a thin, irregular thread of
 light that seeped out from under the ill-fitting threshold of a door at the
 rear end of the hall. Twisty Munn, at least, was evidently keeping the rendezvous!</p>
<p> Faintly, no more than a murmur, voices reached Jimmie Dale from the other
 side of the door now as he stood before it. And now a pick-lock in his hand
 was silently at work. Perhaps half a minute passed. Then, by the barest fraction
 of an inch at a time, the doorknob turned without sound under the slim, trained,
 sensitive fingers, and the door opened by a crack. The murmur from within became
 distinct, disintegrated itself into words and sentences.</p>
<p> &ldquo;...Sure, de goods is all right, but wot about de rest of it? De guys
 I have to slip dese over to ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; chances, not if youse
 handed &rsquo;em de stuff for nothin&rsquo; an&rsquo; paid &rsquo;em for takin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The door opened another crack. Twisty Munn and Kid Gregg! Yes, that was what
 the voice in Mother Margot&rsquo;s room had said. Jimmie Dale could just see
 the two. They were at a table in the upper corner of the room. His eyes narrowed.
 There was what looked like a small fortune in the shape of jewellery on the
 table between them. Twisty Munn! The stoop-shouldered, almost hunch-backed
 form of the shabby old man was bent forward over the table, while his thin,
 hooked fingers clawed at the jewels, picking up one after the other to hold
 it close to short-sighted, squinting eyes. And opposite him Kid Gregg, young,
 in an over-loud checked suit, a peaked cap pulled so low over his forehead
 as almost to hide the small, roving black eyes, scowled in evident impatience.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s sewed up&mdash;tight!&rdquo; the latter snapped. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
 I told youse dat?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure, youse told me dat,&rdquo; agreed the old man sharply. &ldquo;Two
 days ago youse told me youse had it all fixed for to-night, an&rsquo; dat everythin&rsquo; was
 safe, an&rsquo; dat youse&rsquo;d bring me de sparklers. Well, dat&rsquo;s
 all right, youse&rsquo;ve brought &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; <i>dey&rsquo;re</i> all right;
 but I ain&rsquo;t heard yet how safe dey are, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s wot puts
 de deal across wid de crowd I works for. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p> A cigarette dangled from Kid Gregg&rsquo;s upper lip. With the tip of his
 tongue he deftly transferred it to the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, den, listen!&rdquo; he grinned complacently. &ldquo;Some job,
 Twisty; an&rsquo; all me own&mdash;see? I used to know a guy dat worked for
 old Froomes up on de Avenue, an&rsquo; he was forever shootin&rsquo; off his
 face about de sparklers de family wore. Well, a month ago I gets a job dere
 myself&mdash;taken on regular. Get me? Polishin&rsquo; de hardwood floors,
 an&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; de windows of de mansion washed. Ah, say, it was soft!
 I hadn&rsquo;t been dere a week before I knew where de combination of de safe
 was kept in a drawer in de library right alongside de safe itself&mdash;so&rsquo;s
 Mrs. Froomes wouldn&rsquo;t have to walk far to get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Kid Gregg chuckled, and sucking at his cigarette only to find it out, began
 to search through his pockets for a match.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stared. Froomes! It was Martin K. Froomes, of course, the retired
 broker. He knew Froomes very well indeed, and on several &ldquo;stag&rdquo; occasions
 had been in Froomes&rsquo; house; and Froomes knew him&mdash;as Jimmie Dale,
 a fellow member of the St. James Club. So that was where that haul of jewellery
 on the table there had come from! What was it the voice in Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 room had said?&mdash;&ldquo;anywhere from thirty to fifty thousand.&rdquo; He
 could well believe it. Froomes was an exceedingly wealthy man, and, besides
 a wife, had two daughters who moved constantly in society.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; prompted Twisty Munn impatiently.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Watch me!&rdquo; boasted Kid Gregg. &ldquo;I could have made de pinch
 anytime, but den I&rsquo;d have had to make me get-away, an&rsquo; duck outer
 little old New York. I wasn&rsquo;t for dat&mdash;not some! I&rsquo;ve still
 got me job polishin&rsquo; de floors, an&rsquo; to-morrow mornin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
 be polishin&rsquo; &rsquo;em de same as though nothin&rsquo; had happened.
 See? Some day de bulls may write up me autobeeography an&rsquo; keep me photograph
 handy to look at w&rsquo;en dey wants to see somethin&rsquo; handsome&mdash;but
 not if I sees &rsquo;em first! Nix on dat stuff! So far I&rsquo;m a nice, quiet,
 hard-working young man. Get me? Well, dere ain&rsquo;t no hurry, an&rsquo; I
 sits tight, keepin&rsquo; me lamps open lookin&rsquo; for goats. An&rsquo; I
 don&rsquo;t have to wait long, neither. One day I was out on a window sill
 washin&rsquo; de window, an&rsquo; I hears de boss in de next room handin&rsquo; out
 a Sunday school spiel like he was talkin&rsquo; to a naughty son. &lsquo;From
 a business standpoint,&rsquo; says de old man, &lsquo;dis has nearly lost youse
 yer job here, an&rsquo; no man ever made anythin&rsquo; out of himself on that
 basis. An&rsquo; from a moral standpoint,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
 simply de road dat leads from bad to worse.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, an ominous droop at the corners of his mouth, dared another
 half inch of door space, as Kid Gregg paused for a moment to drag on his cigarette.
 Was there a wall switch for that single, dangling incandescent that lighted
 the room? Yes, there it was&mdash;just inside the door. He could almost have
 reached in and touched it from where he stood.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, dat&rsquo;s all I heard,&rdquo; went on Kid Gregg; &ldquo;but,
 take it from me, I watches to see who comes outer dat room. Say, can youse
 beat it! It&rsquo;s a little red-headed dude named Culver, dat&rsquo;s a typewriter,
 or secretary, or somethin&rsquo; like dat to de boss. After dat, dere&rsquo;s
 nothin&rsquo; to it. Culver&rsquo;s de bird I&rsquo;m after, an&rsquo; I gets
 his number for fair. Some high-roller wid his dinkey shirts an&rsquo; his imitation
 diamond shirt studs! He don&rsquo;t live dere wid de boss, y&rsquo;understand,
 but he dresses up every night like he owned a bank, an&rsquo; hits de high
 spots on de first speed. Youse knows de kind, don&rsquo;t youse?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Twisty Munn was twining the long, bony fingers of his hands in and out of
 the heap of brooches, pins, rings and pendants in front of him, seemingly fascinated
 by the fiery little gleams of light that he made to flash from their countless
 facets.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Up de river,&rdquo; observed Twisty Munn, &ldquo;dere&rsquo;s a whole
 cageful of dem birds dat dress up <i>all</i> de time&mdash;only dey don&rsquo;t sport
 de shirt studs any more. I get youse! Wot did youse do wid <i>Mister</i> Culver?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Kid Gregg indulged in a fresh cigarette. There was a smirk of unabashed conceit
 upon his face, as he blew a smoke ring in the air.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Him? He&rsquo;s down at Hoy Loo&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Twisty Munn leaned suddenly across the table.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s dat?&rdquo; he demanded tensely. &ldquo;Hoy Loo&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse said it!&rdquo; nodded Kid Gregg complacently. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
 gone bye-bye down at Hoy Loo&rsquo;s wid a nice little pipe of coke laid out
 beside de bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Twisty Munn squinted blear eyes at the other.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get youse!&rdquo; he grunted after a moment. &ldquo;Dat
 don&rsquo;t stick nothin&rsquo; on him. I don&rsquo;t get youse!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Kid Gregg smiled pityingly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s why youse won&rsquo;t never be nothin&rsquo; more dan
 youse are to-day, Twisty,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;just runnin&rsquo; around
 an&rsquo; doin&rsquo; de dirty work. It&rsquo;s de bean dat counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse close yer face!&rdquo; snapped Twisty Munn. &ldquo;Go on, an&rsquo; spill
 de rest of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; grinned Kid Gregg. &ldquo;I fixed it up for to-night,
 after I&rsquo;d tipped off another guy I knows to make up wid Culver about
 a week ago. Me pal plays de game. Savvy? He chums up wid Culver, an&rsquo; promises
 to show Culver some of de <i>real</i> goods around town. Youse gets it now, don&rsquo;t
 youse? To-night de two of dem goes to Hoy Loo&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; dey starts
 in wid a drink, an&rsquo; Culver gets a pill slipped into his, an&rsquo; den
 he&rsquo;s laid out peaceful on a bunk just as though he&rsquo;d got stewed
 on too many pipes. Soft, eh? He&rsquo;ll be dere to-morrow mornin&rsquo;. He
 don&rsquo;t know who me pal is because somehow me pal ain&rsquo;t got a good
 memory even for his own name; an&rsquo; besides, bein&rsquo; dolled up for
 de occasion wid a little waxed moustache an&rsquo; a cute little beard, youse&rsquo;d
 have taken him for a French Count&mdash;which he ain&rsquo;t. Well, de bulls
 get Mister Culver dere in de mornin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; Hoy Loo gets a
 piece of de money youse&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to hand out &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s
 got to stand for a police fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Kid Gregg paused and grinned at Twisty Munn, as the latter puckered the leathery
 skin of his forehead into wrinkles.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Never mind about de bean stuff dis time,&rdquo; said Twisty Munn gruffly. &ldquo;I
 ain&rsquo;t wise yet, but I&rsquo;ll say it begins to listen good. How&rsquo;d
 youse hang it onto him?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;De easiest thing youse know,&rdquo; said the Kid cheerfully. &ldquo;A
 letter&mdash;dat&rsquo;s wot. Dere&rsquo;s a letter in de mail now dat de police
 gets in de mornin&rsquo;, just about de same time dat de family on de Avenue
 wakes up an&rsquo; t&rsquo;rows a fit w&rsquo;en dey finds de safe open an&rsquo; de
 sparklers gone. De letter just says dat mabbe de police&rsquo;d like to know
 dat a guy blew into Hoy Foo&rsquo;s to-night, an&rsquo; got stewed to de eyes
 hittin&rsquo; de pipe, an&rsquo; got frisked of a bagful of rings an&rsquo; jewels
 an&rsquo; stuff by some yeggs dat was floatin&rsquo; around dere. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
 signed: &lsquo;A Friend.&rsquo; I guess dat&rsquo;s all to de mustard, ain&rsquo;t
 it? Dat takes care of de missin&rsquo; goods! De bulls slip over dere, an&rsquo; dey
 finds it&rsquo;s me red-headed friend Culver, de typewriter expert for Mr.
 Froomes dat owns de safe dat&rsquo;s been cracked.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Twisty Munn blinked.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said judicially; &ldquo;but it don&rsquo;t
 actually prove he pulled de job. If he was frisked, which he wasn&rsquo;t,
 den&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure, he was frisked!&rdquo; said Kid Gregg with a vicious grin. &ldquo;All
 dis happened before I went up to de nabob&rsquo;s house an hour ago. Dat was
 midnight, y&rsquo;understand, an&rsquo; de Froomes bunch was all in bed. I
 wasn&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; no chances. He was frisked, all right!&rdquo; The
 Kid with studied effect blew another smoke ring in the air. &ldquo;I frisked
 him&mdash;of one of dose near-diamond shirt studs of his dat youse can buy
 from de hawkers at three for a nickel!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Enlightenment was dawning on Twisty Munn&rsquo;s wily countenance.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Say dat again!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Kid Gregg. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s wot! D&rsquo;youse
 know of anythin&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s easier to lose widout youse bein&rsquo; wise
 to it dan a shirt stud dat falls out w&rsquo;en youse&rsquo;re pawin&rsquo; over
 de stuff in a safe youse&rsquo;ve cracked? Dat&rsquo;s where it is now&mdash;on
 de floor up dere in de Froomes&rsquo; library under some papers dat was yanked
 out of de safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> For a moment Twisty Munn stared at his companion, then his long, bony hand
 shot out across the table.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;ll go a long way, Kid! Shake!&rdquo; he cackled admiringly. &ldquo;Take
 it from me, youse will&mdash;a long way!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse bet yer life&mdash;an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but dust behind
 me!&rdquo; agreed Kid Gregg boastfully. &ldquo;Youse said somethin&rsquo;,
 Twisty!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;S&rsquo;help me!&rdquo; gulped Twisty Munn. His fingers clawed the
 jewels on the table again. &ldquo;As sweet a haul as ever I&rsquo;ve seen,
 an&rsquo; open an&rsquo; shut&mdash;open an&rsquo; shut!&rdquo; He pushed the
 heap suddenly toward Kid Gregg. &ldquo;Put &rsquo;em back in dat little sack,&rdquo; he
 gloated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em, Kid&mdash;dere&rsquo;s big money
 in dis all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Under his mask a dull red had suffused Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s cheeks; subconsciously
 almost his hand had crept into his pocket, and his fingers had closed around
 the stock of his automatic. It was brutal work; miserable, inhuman work. A
 shirt stud, three for a nickel&mdash;and five, ten, fifteen years, the best
 of a man&rsquo;s life, behind the drear walls and the steel bars of Sing Sing.
 Was it possible that men like these two lived, festering God&rsquo;s green
 earth! His automatic came from his pocket. They were stuffing the jewels into
 a small canvas bag now. Well, the game wasn&rsquo;t finished yet; there was
 still another hand to play! The little sack would prove a convenient receptacle.
 It ought not to take but a moment more before <i>all</i> the jewels were inside, and&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale drew suddenly back from the doorway. Had he <i>forgotten?</i> In the
 natural sweep of anger, in the hot-blooded fury that the scene in there had
 brought him, had he forgotten&mdash;those voices in Mother Margot&rsquo;s rooms!
 What was that now? A creak upon the stairs? Yes, he was sure of it! Another!
 One o&rsquo;clock! It must be after one o&rsquo;clock. Some one was coming!</p>
<p> Every faculty alert, he crouched back now&mdash;farther back, away from the
 door, where he was lost in the darkness of the hall. Yes, there was some one
 almost at the head of the stairs now, coming stealthily, almost without sound&mdash;only
 once in a while a faint, protesting squeak from a stair tread that would not
 be audible inside Twisty Munn&rsquo;s room. Those jewels, Twisty Munn, Kid
 Gregg were the lesser issue now. It was the Phantom who had brought him here,
 the hope that the Phantom would come himself in person.</p>
<p> Tense, silent, Jimmie Dale crouched there. The Phantom! If it were the Phantom
 in any one of the characters that he, Jimmie Dale, could recognise, there would
 be no failure this time such as there had been last night! Whoever passed from
 the hall into that room would stand out, if only for an instant, clearly defined
 in the lighted doorway&mdash;and an instant would be enough!</p>
<p> A second passed&mdash;still another. A dark form bulked at the head of the
 stairs. It was joined by another. Two of them, then! And now there was no sound&mdash;yet
 the two dark forms there moved. They came on down the hall like queer, wavering,
 intangible shapes that seemed almost like brain hallucinations in the darkness.</p>
<p> Outflung before him, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s automatic held a bead on the doorway.
 They had stopped there now, stopped in that thin crack of light that seeped
 out through the inch of open door that he himself had left. And the face of
 one came into the light. Bunty Myers! It was not the Phantom; it was Bunty
 Myers, the Phantom&rsquo;s unholy chief-of-staff! But <i>both</i> of the men could
 not be the Phantom. The other! Who was the other?</p>
<p> A whisper came. A revolver barrel glinted in the light-thread. Jimmie Dale
 strained forward. The other! Just a glimpse of the man&rsquo;s face! There
 could be no disguise that would blind his eyes to Gentleman Laroque, the <i>real</i> man, any longer; no disguise however clever that could&mdash;</p>
<p> The door crashed inward, a wave of light flooded out into the hall, and the
 two forms at the door leaped forward into the room. But, for the single instant
 Jimmie Dale had asked, the light had shone on the second man&rsquo;s face&mdash;and
 upon Jimmie Dale there surged a sense of bitter disappointment that seemed
 to engulf him, seemed to hold him momentarily stunned. Neither was the second
 man the Phantom; it was only the Kitten, one of the gang that used to rendezvous
 in the back upstairs room of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;club.&rdquo; The
 Kitten who only last night had&mdash;Well, he might have known! It was the
 Phantom&rsquo;s way. It was the Phantom and Bunty Myers he had heard talking&mdash;he
 knew that now&mdash;but the Phantom had left the actual work, as he had done
 a score of times before, to his tools and pawns.</p>
<p> His mind seemed strangely numbed. He stared into the room. Two men had just
 leaped through that lighted doorway. It was like some scene flashing upon a
 cinema screen, wasn&rsquo;t it? Shirt studs, three for a nickel&mdash;and the
 best of a man&rsquo;s life behind the bars of Sing Sing! He shook himself free
 as from some clogging mental weight. Yes, that was what it meant, whether Bunty
 Myers or Kid Gregg came off the victor&mdash;and there wasn&rsquo;t any other
 issue now because the Phantom wasn&rsquo;t here.</p>
<p> He crept forward to the door. Old Twisty Munn was cringing in a corner, twining
 his claw-like fingers in and out of each other, licking at his lips, his face
 gray with fear. On the table stood the little canvas bag, tied now with a string
 at the top&mdash;and behind the table, Kid Gregg, a cigarette still dangling
 from his upper lip, had risen from his chair, and was staring with a queer,
 inane smile into the muzzle of Bunty Myers&rsquo; revolver a yard or so away.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Put up your hands!&rdquo; snarled Bunty Myers.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; smiled Kid Gregg; and&mdash;the revolver in his hand
 previously hidden by the edge of the table&mdash;whipped up the weapon and
 fired.</p>
<p> It was answered by almost simultaneous reports as Bunty Myers and the Kitten
 fired together; it was answered by a scream of terror from Twisty Munn&mdash;and
 then the crash of the overturned table as Kid Gregg spun half around like a
 spent top and pitched against it.</p>
<p> But Jimmie Dale, too, was in action now. From the edge of the door jamb his
 hand shot forward, closed upon the electric-light switch, and the room was
 in darkness. And the next instant he had flung himself forward across the room.
 The little canvas bag! He had marked the exact spot on the floor where it had
 fallen from the table. Queer, this scuffling of feet around him; savage oaths;
 snarls of confusion; doors opening somewhere below in the tenement; the creak
 of stairs, and&mdash;Yes, here it was! His hand closed upon the bag and thrust
 it into his pocket. He turned and sprang for the doorway again. Something blocked
 his way, struck at him viciously, clutched at his clothing. He struck back
 with a short-arm jab, tore himself free, and lunged forward again.</p>
<p> A revolver flash lanced through the blackness behind him&mdash;another. Twisty
 Munn still screamed in terror. And a bedlam seemed loosed now throughout the
 tenement. But Jimmie Dale had gained the door.</p>
<p> He slammed it shut behind him, and, springing for the stairs, took them three
 and four at a jump. A man holding a candle, peering upward from the landing
 below, blocked his way for an instant&mdash;and went down before Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 rush.</p>
<p> Two more flights to go! Doors opened. Frightened faces were thrust out. There
 came the cries of children&mdash;and then from above the pound of feet, racing
 as madly as his own down the upper stairs.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale laughed strangely to himself. That would be Bunty Myers and the
 Kitten, but they mattered nothing now. There had been murder above, Kid Gregg
 was dead, and their one concern would be to hunt cover without loss of time,
 because if they were known to Twisty Munn they were in desperate case indeed!</p>
<p> He was not concerned with any pursuit from Bunty Myers or the Kitten. It
 was a question only of what margin he himself had before the uproar here would
 have brought the police upon the scene. It was the shouts and yells that pursued
 him from the awakened and terrified occupants of the tenement wherein lay his
 real source of danger.</p>
<p> A minute! That was all he asked. The margin of a minute! He risked a leap
 of almost half the length of the lower stairs, stumbled at the bottom, recovered
 himself, jumped for the front door, wrenched it open and dashed out. The street
 was still empty. Thank God! He ran like a deer for the corner, gained it, doubled
 at the next one, and then dropped into an nonchalant walk.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  At A Quarter To Three</b></h2>
<p> He was safe now. He laughed shortly, without mirth. Safe! Yes, for the moment&mdash;but
 the night wasn&rsquo;t ended yet. He laboured under no delusions on that score.
 The rendezvous at Twisty&rsquo;s, instead of the hoped-for meeting with the
 Phantom, had left him with the heritage of a little canvas bag whose physical
 contents became but a handful of miserable, worthless baubles compared with
 the potentialities it held for a long-term penitentiary sentence for an innocent
 man. Nothing that had transpired at Twisty Munn&rsquo;s had changed by one
 iota the vile, low, cunning trap that Kid Gregg had laid for his victim&mdash;and
 had now paid for with his own life. The police would receive the letter; the
 police would find that shirt stud at the scene of the robbery, find this young
 fool Culver at Hoy Loo&rsquo;s, and find in Culver&rsquo;s shirt that a stud
 was missing from amongst its fellows.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face darkened now, as he turned at the next street and
 headed over in the direction of the Bowery. Young fool! Yes, that was it! Why
 should he take any further risk? He did not know Culver. He knew nothing about
 Culver except that he had a red head, and was evidently somewhat of a bounder
 who probably very richly deserved what&mdash;No; he knew more than that. He
 knew that Culver was <i>innocent</i>.</p>
<p> And then a smile came to Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips, a half whimsical, half
 troubled smile. Yes, of course! It was inevitable! He knew that. He had known
 it all along. Why else had he taken the risk of snatching up that little bag
 in Twisty Munn&rsquo;s room? Well, then?</p>
<p> Hoy Loo&rsquo;s? He shook his head. He would find nothing there but a limp,
 red-headed boy, drugged into unconsciousness. He could do nothing with Culver;
 for, even if he managed to get Culver out of and away from the dope joint,
 there still remained the one outstanding, damning piece of evidence in the
 shape of that shirt stud in the library of the Froomes&rsquo; home. Neither
 would Culver&rsquo;s removal from Hoy Loo&rsquo;s offset the letter that the
 police would receive simply because they did not find the boy there, for they
 would find that Culver <i>had</i> been there, had spent most of the night there. Equally,
 there were no means of intercepting that letter.</p>
<p> There was only one alternative. Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders, and again
 the whimsical smile broke across his lips. It was perhaps a fortunate thing
 for Culver that he, Jimmie Dale, was not red-headed too!</p>
<p> He hurried on now, breaking at times almost into a run. There was only one
 way, and&mdash;yes&mdash;he saw that way clearly enough now. It remained merely
 a question of whether by any chance the robbery at the Froomes&rsquo; mansion
 would be discovered before he could act. It was not likely, since Kid Gregg
 had said the household had all retired by midnight; but it nevertheless left
 the matter of time an unknown factor whose latent possibilities were by no
 means to be ignored. Well, he would lose no time!</p>
<p> Near the Bowery, in an all-night caf&eacute;, he entered the telephone booth.
 He gave the number of his residence on Riverside Drive, and as he waited for
 the connection into his dark eyes, strangely, there crept a softer light. Old
 Jason would answer the phone. Faithful old Jason, butler to the father, more
 than butler to the son! Despite injunctions, despite the nights, many and many
 of them, when he, Jimmie Dale, did not return at all, Jason would even now
 probably be maintaining his self-appointed vigil in the arm-chair in the vestibule
 waiting for his Master Jim&mdash;and almost certainly asleep! Jason was an
 old man, and nature was stronger than the flesh. Well, it was Jason&rsquo;s
 way, a rather splendid way, a way of great devotion. Strange? No&mdash;not
 strange! It was just Jason. Jason knew perhaps too little or too much; enough,
 in any case, so that the old man lived in constant anxiety anent the safety
 of his Master Jim, and&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes! Hello! That you, Jason?&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale quickly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;Master Jim, sir,&rdquo; the old man answered.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Listen, Jason!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;Rouse up Benson, and
 send him down here with the light car as fast as he can make it. Tell him the
 Palace&mdash;he knows where that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir; at once,&rdquo; Jason replied; and then, a curious hesitancy,
 a curious yearning, in his voice: &ldquo;Is there any&mdash;anything else,
 Master Jim, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sitting
 up again, Jason!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s smile belied the severity of his
 tone. How many times had he used exactly the same words to Jason&mdash;and
 with probably the same effect! &ldquo;Go to bed, Jason! Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir, Master Jim,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;Good-night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver and went out into the street again, making
 for the Bowery now, and walking in an uptown direction. It would save time
 to meet Benson by part of the way. By the time he walked to the Palace Saloon,
 Benson should have about reached there too.</p>
<p> He began a mental calculation as he went along. Say, twenty-five minutes
 for Benson to get downtown, then another twenty for himself, Jimmie Dale, to
 reach his objective on Fifth Avenue, still another twenty for the work there
 was to do, and, yes, that was pretty close figuring, though it gave Benson,
 who was far safer away from the car and would have to walk, a leeway of twenty
 minutes. Allow an extra ten minutes, then, as a factor of safety. That made
 seventy-five minutes&mdash;an hour and a quarter. He looked at his watch. It
 was exactly half-past one. That would bring it, then, to a quarter to three.</p>
<p> He nodded. A quarter to three! He could depend on Benson literally to the
 extent of his life, and indeed had done so on more than one occasion; Benson
 as a chauffeur was almost on the same plane with Jason as a butler. As he had
 remarked many times before, there was perhaps no man in New York who was served
 as he was&mdash;and it was not a service of money. Rare thing? Yes! But it
 was true. It <i>did</i> exist in the world. Thank God for it!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale walked briskly. He reached the corner in front of the Palace
 Saloon that he had given his chauffeur as a rendezvous. Benson had not yet
 arrived. Consulting his watch, Jimmie Dale waited a minute, and then taking
 out a little notebook began to write rapidly under the rays of the street lamp.
 This, too, would save time&mdash;or, at least, preserve the schedule. It would
 save the two or three minutes necessary to give Benson verbal instructions,
 though he could, of course, taken Benson along with him in the car since their
 roads would lie in the same direction for part of the way, but he had definitely
 decided against that. If anything went amiss, it would be infinitely better
 for Benson that there should be no possibility of the two of them having been
 seen <i>together</i> in the car. He owed that to Benson. It was quite another
 matter that Benson, obeying orders, should have turned the car over to his employer
 here where he had been instructed to do so.</p>
<p> He tore the leaf from his notebook and folded it carefully. There was one
 minute left for Benson to make the rendezvous on the timetable set for&mdash;Yes,
 here he was now!</p>
<p> A car drew up at the curb. Benson&rsquo;s clean-cut, strong young face showed
 in the light as he touched his cap.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good work, Benson!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale approvingly. &ldquo;What
 time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Benson leaned forward to consult the car&rsquo;s clock.</p>
<p> &ldquo;By your <i>watch</i>, Benson,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. He held his own in
 his hand.</p>
<p> Benson looked at his wrist watch.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Five minutes of two, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. He motioned Benson from the car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
 take the car, Benson.&rdquo; And then, as he swung into the driver&rsquo;s
 seat, he leaned out and handed Benson the folded note. &ldquo;Follow these
 instructions to the letter, Benson,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;And <i>destroy</i> that note. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The car turned and headed uptown. Jimmie Dale drove fast. The streets were
 deserted. The minutes passed&mdash;ten, fifteen, eighteen. He kept glancing
 at the time&mdash;and nodded as he finally parked his car on a side street
 within half a block of one of the most exclusive residential sections of Fifth
 Avenue. He had taken nineteen minutes from the Palace Saloon.</p>
<p> The black silk mask covered his face again, as he stole forward now and slipped
 into an areaway that ran in the rear of the corner house on the Avenue. The
 rest would be slower work. This was Martin K. Froomes&rsquo; residence.</p>
<p> It was moonlight; light enough to see. There was a high fence here that flanked
 both sides of what was evidently a garage. Jimmie Dale swung himself over the
 fence, and alighted in a small, cement-floored courtyard. He was across this
 in an instant, and in another was lost in the shadows of a basement entrance.</p>
<p> Again the little steel pick-lock was at work. The door opened and closed&mdash;silently.
 Jimmie Dale stood inside. For a moment he listened; and then, the diminutive
 flashlight in service again, darting its tiny gleams before him, Jimmie Dale
 moved forward once more, and, locating the stairs, began to climb them&mdash;and
 a moment later found himself standing in the main hall of the house.</p>
<p> So far, all was well! The library now&mdash;no, first, the telephone! He
 must make sure that his memory had served him right on that score. He had been
 here once or twice before&mdash;under quite different auspices!&mdash;as a
 guest. The flashlight&rsquo;s ray played down the hall. Yes, it was all right!
 It was there on a little stand in an alcove near the foot of the central staircase.
 He could hardly have forgotten that rather unique door, shaped in a half circle,
 which at will could transform the alcove into a booth!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale turned now. He was not quite so sure of the library, but the
 impression was strong that it was here at the rear. He tried a door on his
 right. The dining room. He stepped back then into the hall, and opened a door
 on the opposite side. The flashlight circled the interior, went out&mdash;and
 Jimmie Dale closed the door softly behind him.</p>
<p> His lips, beneath the mask, tightened now, as the flashlight, playing again
 through the darkness, focused on an open safe near the window at the rear of
 the room, and upon what had evidently been a very large proportion of the contents
 of the safe which were now strewn about on the floor in front of it. He stepped
 forward quickly, and kneeling on the floor began to search carefully beneath
 the litter of documents, papers and books. A minute, two, three, went by&mdash;and
 then Jimmie Dale stood up again. Between his fingers he held a cheap and tawdry
 shirt stud.</p>
<p> He stood looking at it for a moment, balancing it now in his hand. And a
 softer light crept into his eyes, and a strange smile tempered the grimness
 of his tightened lips. No, it wasn&rsquo;t worth much, just a rhinestone&mdash;just
 ten years in the penitentiary, that was all!</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders. The margin of time was narrowing.
 He slipped the shirt stud into his pocket, and sent the flashlight&rsquo;s
 ray playing inquisitively around the room. There was still the letter that
 the police would receive in the morning, and which must be made to disprove
 even itself, be made to stand out so glaringly as a plant to saddle a crime
 on an innocent man&rsquo;s shoulders that none could mistake it for what it
 was. And there was only one way to accomplish that!</p>
<p> His eyes followed the ray of the flashlight. Yes, that single bracket light
 over there would do when the time came. He could not afford to be too generous!
 And now the window. He walked over to it and raised the drawn shade. It looked
 out on the courtyard. Silently, cautiously, he opened the window wide. Ten
 feet to the ground. Well, it might be worse!</p>
<p> At a quarter to three! He returned to the centre of the room, and consulted
 his watch. He had not needed all of that extra ten minutes. He was four minutes
 to the good.</p>
<p> He stood there in the darkness. It was very silent in the house, and yet
 it was strange what queer noises even silence possessed if one listened for
 them. They began very low and grew louder, but always in a palpitating sort
 of way, and finally beat with almost thunderous clamour at the ear drums.</p>
<p> The flashlight was on the dial of the watch again. Seventeen minutes to three.
 Benson would be at work now. It would take a minute or two, of course. He smiled
 with grim whimsicality. It always did! He had allowed for that.</p>
<p> The flashlight held on the dial of the watch&mdash;and suddenly went out.</p>
<p> A quarter to three.</p>
<p> Faintly, from the front of the house, the telephone rang&mdash;and Jimmie
 Dale was in action. The side light went on, filling the room with a soft mellow
 glow. He stepped silently to the closed door, and with his ear to the panel
 listened. The telephone rang again&mdash;and still again. And then, barely
 audible on the thickly carpeted stairs, he caught the sound of a footstep descending.</p>
<p> And presently Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips twisted again in a grim smile. He
 could not hear, he did not have the receiver at his ear, but it was Benson
 speaking from a slot booth in the Grand Central station where, though they
 might eventually trace the call, they would never trace Benson. It was Benson
 speaking, but the words were his, Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s:</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to appear in this, so never mind who I am. I couldn&rsquo;t
 find a phone any nearer, so it&rsquo;s about ten minutes ago that I saw a man
 climb over your back fence and steal into your house. I guess if you&rsquo;ve
 got such a thing as a safe there, you&rsquo;ll know where to find him; and
 if you&rsquo;re quiet enough about it you ought to get him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p> That was what Benson was saying! It was quite all right. The call <i>would</i> be
 traced&mdash;but it would &ldquo;hold water.&rdquo; The Grand Central was just
 about within a ten-minute range of the Froomes&rsquo; residence.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s ear was still pressed against the door panel. The footstep
 was mounting the stairs now&mdash;but evidently with extreme caution, for Jimmie
 Dale could scarcely catch a sound. It was probably the butler. Reinforcements!
 He would return with Mr. Froomes, perhaps, and an added footman or two!</p>
<p> A minute&mdash;two! The cautious tread was coming <i>down</i> the stairs again.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale retreated across the room to the open door of the safe. He crouched
 there, tense, his muscles rigid. In his hand now he held the little canvas
 sack of jewels, the string at the top untied. They were almost at the door
 there. And now&mdash;</p>
<p> The door burst open.</p>
<p> With a well simulated startled cry of alarm, Jimmie Dale jumped to the window
 side of the safe&mdash;and as he jumped he allowed his arm apparently to hit
 sharply against the top of the safe door and knock the canvas bag from his
 grasp, strewing the floor with a sparkling heap of gems. He was darting for
 the window now. A voice roared out to him to halt. Froomes! Froomes himself
 in dressing gown, and behind Froomes two other men. And for a bare instant
 Jimmie Dale faced them, then he vaulted for the window sill. They had seen
 him, hadn&rsquo;t they&mdash;quite plainly&mdash;seen that he wasn&rsquo;t
 Culver!</p>
<p> &ldquo;Stop! Stop, or I&rsquo;ll fire!&rdquo; Froomes yelled out.</p>
<p> But Jimmie Dale was astride the window sill now, and&mdash;a vivid flash
 like a fork of lightning seemed to leap toward him to sting and blister and
 bring him agony, and the room seemed to swirl and be full of deafening, racketing
 reports. He dropped to the ground outside, staggered, steadied himself, leaped
 across the courtyard, and swung the fence, as a fusillade of shots followed
 him from the window.</p>
<p> He was racing along the areaway now. Another instant, and he had flung himself
 into his car. It shot forward with a bound. He whipped off his mask, as he
 bent over the wheel. He was gnawing at his lips now until the blood came.</p>
<p> The car swung the corner and tore uptown. But it wouldn&rsquo;t steer properly.
 It swayed from side to side. No, it wasn&rsquo;t the car, it was himself. Something
 in his side tortured him, and something hot, sticky hot, was running down his
 leg. His head swam. Nausea strove to set its grip upon him. He fought it off.
 He had been hit, of course, but it wasn&rsquo;t far to go&mdash;not far to
 go&mdash;not far to go&mdash;and&mdash;queer sing-song brain&mdash;what&mdash;what
 was the matter? Everything was all right, wasn&rsquo;t it? They had seen the
 man who had tried to rob the safe and had left the jewels on the floor, hadn&rsquo;t
 they; and they knew it wasn&rsquo;t Culver because&mdash;it was extremely funny,
 wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;because Culver had a red head.</p>
<p> Giddiness, nausea, hot and cold flashes! Jimmie Dale fought frantically for
 his senses. He drove clinging to the wheel. It wasn&rsquo;t far. There wasn&rsquo;t
 any pursuit; they&rsquo;d never find him&mdash;if&mdash;if he could hold out
 just a little longer.</p>
<p> A sort of mental fog settled upon him that blotted out time and distance;
 and action was purely mechanical&mdash;and then he found himself staggering
 up the steps of his home on Riverside Drive. And at the top of the steps the
 door opened. He brushed his hand across his eyes. That was Jason, wasn&rsquo;t
 it? Jason had been sitting up again!</p>
<p> &ldquo;Go to bed, Jason!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale severely.</p>
<p> The old man&rsquo;s face was ashen.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My God, Master Jim, sir, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he cried
 out wildly.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale lunged through the doorway.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;I&mdash;I was just looking
 for a shirt stud. You know the kind, Jason, three for a nickel and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale pitched forward unconscious to the floor.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  The Call Of The Night</b></h2>
<p> A night light on the stand beside the bed glowed dimly, throwing curious
 little shadowy patterns on walls and ceilings. Jimmie Dale turned restlessly
 in the bed. His hand stole beneath his pajamas and mechanically, in a sort
 of tentative way, felt over his tightly bandaged side. There was a nervous
 disquiet upon him, growing with the minutes, obsessing him. He reached out
 to the bed table for his watch. Half past nine.</p>
<p> For a moment he lay still, tracing with his eyes the shadows&rsquo; fanciful
 shapes on the ceiling; and then suddenly he flung the covers from him, got
 out of bed, snatched up a dressing gown, and crossed the room to an easy chair
 by the window. He sat down and stared out into the night.</p>
<p> Rest! Quiet! He could no longer rest, because his mind would no longer remain
 quiet but ground on and on like the turning of a mill wheel that never ceased.
 The first night&mdash;when he had been wounded and the loss of blood had weakened
 him&mdash;yes. But not now! Thank God, he had regained consciousness in time
 that night to prevent Jason telephoning for a doctor! With the papers full
 of the burglar in evening clothes who was believed to have been hit by a shot
 as he had leaped through the library window of the Froomes&rsquo; mansion
 on Fifth Avenue, it would have been perhaps a little awkward for Jimmie Dale
 to explain a bullet wound in his side even to a trusted physician! It had been
 only a flesh wound. Jason and Benson between them had done famously with him
 here at home. It was healing now. That was three nights ago. It was still sore
 and stiff&mdash;he gritted his teeth as a twinge of pain caught him suddenly&mdash;but
 it was healing nicely.</p>
<p> He had not stayed in bed any more than he could help after the first day&mdash;when
 he could elude Jason&rsquo;s watchfulness. He had been afraid of that, more
 afraid of doing that than of the wound itself. One got weak staying in bed.
 One&rsquo;s legs needed exercise&mdash;and there had been the combined lengths
 of the dressing room and bedroom for surreptitious constitutionals!</p>
<p> Well, he had been well repaid for the wound; not merely in the sense that
 young Culver was probably walking the streets to-night a free man, but in the
 sense that there had come into his hands another clue, another instrument through
 which his chances of running the Phantom to earth became at once now definite,
 tangible and concrete. Bunty Myers, the rat-faced underling, the chief tool
 of the Phantom! It was Bunty Myers who had been talking to the Phantom that
 night when he, Jimmie Dale, had heard those voices which had seemed to come
 out of the nowhere in Mother Margot&rsquo;s room. Therefore Bunty Myers knew
 <i>where</i> that conversation had taken place; and therefore, whether the man himself
 realised the full significance of it or not, Bunty Myers held the secret of
 the phantom clue to the lair where his master hatched his devil&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale nodded to himself. It was a decided, even drastic change from
 the Phantom&rsquo;s accustomed line of action. From the time the Phantom had
 physically disappeared as Gentleman Laroque, the man had drawn a veil of secrecy
 and seclusion about himself that had rarely been broken&mdash;certainly never
 to the extent of admitting any one into the secret of his actual retreat before.
 True, he had many domiciles, many aliases. That was why the Tocsin had first
 called him the Phantom. But this was the <i>centre of the web</i>, the one place that
 he, Jimmie Dale, had sought and struggled vainly with every resource at his
 command to find. And now Bunty Myers had been admitted, if not into the secret
 itself, at least into the precincts of the hidden refuge. Why? Did it evidence
 weakness? The first cracking of the line of defence? It was certain that the
 Phantom&rsquo;s ranks had become sadly thinned. Little Sweeney, perhaps the
 most versatile and cunning of the Phantom satellites, was dead; and two out
 of the four trusted pawns who had had their rendezvous in the back upstairs
 room at Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;club,&rdquo; Spud MacGuire and Muller,
 were dead. The percentage was very heavy! There remained only Bunty Myers,
 the Kitten, and Mother Margot. The circle was narrowing. Was that why, where
 previously Mother Margot had always been called from the pushcart on Thompson
 Street to the telephone in the rear of that malodorous little second-hand store
 to act as the mouthpiece of the &ldquo;Voice,&rdquo; where previously all communications
 had passed through her, the Phantom had now changed his tactics and admitted
 his tools to personal interviews?</p>
<p> A frown, half of perplexity, half of annoyance, gathered on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 forehead. This might or might not be the reason. Very much more likely not!
 He had forgotten for the moment that Mother Margot had been away that night.</p>
<p> He brushed his hand across his eyes, as he winced suddenly again with pain.
 He wondered if Mother Margot were back yet. That was a curious telephone booth
 at the back of the second-hand store where she received her messages! A side
 door that opened on the lane&mdash;and the booth in a sort of back storeroom!
 He had, of course, investigated the place almost immediately after that night
 at Mrs. Kinsey&rsquo;s when Mother Margot had imparted her unwilling information
 about it, and the result of that investigation had been to make it plain that
 the telephone itself was purely a part, just as Mother Margot&rsquo;s rooms
 were, of the Phantom&rsquo;s equipment, and that Mezzo himself, who was a doddering,
 almost senile old man, was not even a pawn&mdash;merely a convenience. The
 old Italian, whose hearing was probably just good enough and no more to distinguish
 the ringing of the bell, whose trade was among a clientele far removed from
 such luxuries, could have no possible use for a telephone, let alone one in
 a booth, and less possible excuse for the expense that one involved. He was
 simply paid to keep it there. That was obvious. Well, it had served still another
 purpose&mdash;since he, Jimmie Dale, had not infrequently used it himself!
 The Phantom was not the only one who called Mother Margot to the phone, or
 the only one to whom the old hag paid allegiance! He smiled grimly. Perhaps
 he counted too much on that! Because he, Jimmie Dale, as the Gray Seal, had
 once caught Mother Margot in the act of double-crossing her own pals, it was
 no guarantee that, though he might hold her in a sort of allegiance therefrom,
 she would be above double-crossing him too!</p>
<p> He shook his head. No! He had watched her too closely. He was not prepared
 to say what she might do if she got the chance, but so far he was satisfied
 that she had played straight with him&mdash;only, so far, the little information
 she had had to give had not brought him much nearer to his goal.</p>
<p> His mind reverted to Bunty Myers. Bunty Myers had come out of the affair
 that night at Twisty Munn&rsquo;s when he had shot Kid Gregg without a breath
 of suspicion attaching to him. Again Jimmie Dale smiled grimly. He remembered
 that, as he had run down the stairs with the awakened tenement howling about
 his ears, the thought had flashed through his mind that if Twisty Munn had
 recognised Bunty Myers the latter would have the police drag-net sweeping the
 city, yes, and the country, for him, and he would be hard put to it to find
 cover. But, as it had turned out, whether Twisty Munn had really recognised
 Bunty Myers or not, Twisty Munn had remained silent on the subject. Yesterday&rsquo;s
 papers had been full of the affair. Twisty Munn was by nature an ingenious
 and versatile liar, and he had run true to form. Himself in the very act of
 receiving the stolen contents of Martin K. Froomes&rsquo; safe when the shooting
 occurred, Twisty Munn had, of course, as an incentive for remaining silent
 the undesirability of implicating himself in a criminal transaction; and again,
 he might not actually have known who Bunty Myers was, or, if he had, the fear
 of reprisals if he snitched might also very logically account for his reticence.
 Twisty Munn, so Twisty Munn swore, knew absolutely nothing about the matter,
 except that he and Kid Gregg had been sitting in his room talking when the
 door had burst open and a couple of men he had never seen before had entered.
 Kid Gregg had jumped to his feet and pulled his gun, and just as he fired one
 of the others had dropped him. He, Twisty Munn, didn&rsquo;t know what it was
 all about, s&rsquo;help him God! but he had a hunch it was a personal row between
 Kid Gregg and one of the other men over some moll or other.</p>
<p> Quite so! Into Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s dark eyes there came an ironical gleam.
 There was nothing to disprove it. Twisty Munn&rsquo;s story fitted into the
 balance of the night as perfectly as though it were the truth! Well, that left
 Bunty Myers free! That was what counted. It would be easier to find Bunty Myers
 now than if he had taken to cover from the police. And it was Bunty Myers that
 he, Jimmie Dale, wanted now!</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale shook his head again&mdash;in sudden irritation now.
 Had he forgotten too that since the night Little Sweeney had masqueraded as
 Isaac Shiftel and paid for it with his life, Bunty Myers had already sought
 cover, perhaps more as a precautionary measure than because he was actually &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for
 that affair, but nevertheless had completely forsaken his usual haunts; and
 had he also forgotten a night not long ago when, as Smarlinghue, he had searched
 vainly through the length and breadth and in the most hidden places of the
 underworld for the man? He had wanted Bunty Myers then, hadn&rsquo;t he? And
 he had not found him.</p>
<p> The strong, square jaws locked with a snap. Yes! That was true! But he wanted
 the man <i>more</i> now, wanted him vitally. He would find him, that was all!</p>
<p> And then, what?</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s laugh, short, hard, mirthless, rang low through the room.
 And then, what? The answer to that was simple. The buttons were off the foils.
 What Bunty Myers knew he would be <i>made</i> to tell. Bunty Myers wasn&rsquo;t tired
 of life, and if he found himself cornered by, say, the Gray Seal, and given
 the choice of telling where he had had that conversation with the Phantom or
 of paying the price of silence with his life, there was very little question
 as to what the man would do, for out of his own experience Bunty Myers would
 not credit the Gray Seal with trifling! Nor would there be any trifling. The
 knowledge Bunty Myers now possessed meant that the Phantom at last could be
 trapped; it meant that at last <i>her</i> life, the Tocsin&rsquo;s, could be made
 safe; that the nightmare of horror which must even now be turning her soul
 sick within her could be brought to an end; that sunshine could come, and love
 and the joy of living could be hers once more, and&mdash;</p>
<p> With a low cry, Jimmie Dale leaned suddenly with his elbows on the window
 sill, staring out into the blackness of the night. It seemed to be beckoning,
 calling to him.</p>
<p> She was out there somewhere.</p>
<p> Was she? Was he even certain that she was still alive? Something cold, an
 icy grip, seemed to clutch at his heart. Since the night at Miser Scroff&rsquo;s,
 true to her stated determination to keep him out of the shadows, as she called
 them, that enveloped her, that held her life in peril, he had had no word from
 her.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale was gnawing at his lips now; his arms fell from the window sill,
 and his hands clenched at his sides. She had simply kept her word. That was
 what she had said she would do. Why then this sudden access that verged on
 panic? He laughed out shortly again. It wasn&rsquo;t sudden. It wasn&rsquo;t
 a new phase. It hadn&rsquo;t just at this moment germinated in his brain. It
 was what had been growing there ever since he had lain wounded in bed. It was
 the seat of that constant disquiet and restlessness that was culminating now
 in&mdash;What?</p>
<p> He was on his feet; and now he began to pace the room. To protect her life
 she had arrayed herself against the merciless cunning of the Phantom&mdash;not
 a man; a monster. There was no middle course between them. There was but one
 end. One of the two must fall. And the Phantom was still safe, still secure,
 still at his hell-born deviltries.</p>
<p> And she?</p>
<p> A bead of moisture oozed out on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s forehead. He flirted
 it away with a sweep of his hand. It meant little that her silence was exactly
 in accordance with what she herself had stated was her proposed line of action.
 There was something that meant infinitely more. She might propose, but immeasurably
 true was the trite old saying applied to her that she could not always dispose!
 He, as Smarlinghue, as the Gray Seal, excluded from working in conjunction
 with her, had worked nevertheless in the days and weeks that were gone with
 identically the same end in view as she, working independently, had had&mdash;the
 unearthing of the Phantom. Why had their paths then, in spite of herself, not
 crossed since that night in Miser Scroff&rsquo;s room, save perhaps on the
 one occasion when he had <i>presumed</i> that the tip to the police in reference to
 the jewel robbery at Linesthal&rsquo;s had come from her? <i>He</i> had been in touch
 with the Phantom, with the Phantom&rsquo;s criminal efforts since then. And
 if she were still free, still alive, and making progress in her fight, how
 was it that she and he had not inevitably been brought into contact with each
 other?</p>
<p> His hands clenched tighter. And there was more even than that; one outstanding
 brutal thing, ugly in its promise, that brought him a deadly fear. She <i>had</i> made progress while she had been mistress of her actions; she had said so in
 her notes up to the time when those notes had ceased; her appearance at Miser
 Scroff&rsquo;s that night had proved that she had penetrated the Phantom&rsquo;s
 outer defences, and had had a certain foreknowledge of the man&rsquo;s proposed
 coups. Therefore the presumption was that, had all still been well with her,
 she would have had knowledge of what had happened three nights ago, and she
 would have known that he, Jimmie Dale, had been shot.</p>
<p> His brain seemed to whirl; the blood to pound in hammer beats at his temples.
 Not a sign had come from her, not a word over the telephone, not a message
 of any kind, direct or indirect. His mind, his soul, seemed to falter now before
 the ugly deduction that flung itself pitilessly at him. She loved him, as he
 loved her. He knew that. She loved him with a love so great and unselfish that
 daily, hourly she had faced alone the peril that menaced her so that he might
 not also be in danger, so that he might be sheltered from it. Would she then,
 if she knew he had been shot, and if she were able even with her last effort
 to communicate with him, have remained silent, made no attempt to discover
 how serious was his condition, or whether indeed he were alive or dead?</p>
<p> Alive or dead! The phrase battered at his brain. It applied to her. White-faced
 he stood at the window again, and stared out into the darkness. It was black!
 How black it was! And she was out there in the night somewhere&mdash;somewhere&mdash;alive
 or dead.</p>
<p> Inactive! His wound as an excuse! He swore savagely now in his emotion. What
 was he&mdash;a weakling! Too long he had stayed here now inactive when she&mdash;she
 was out there somewhere&mdash;perhaps dead. Something caught in his throat.
 His hands raised above his head and clenched until under the tightened skin
 the knuckles showed like knobs, bloodless, white.</p>
<p> If she were dead! He laughed! It was a merciless sound. He swung from the
 window and went into the dressing room. He began to dress. How should he dress?
 Tweeds or dinner clothes? That sounded queer&mdash;as though his brain were
 unhinged. He wasn&rsquo;t going to a party! Foolish word that&mdash;party!</p>
<p> He began to get into his dinner clothes. He knew what he was doing now. There
 had been what Jason would have called a rush of blood to the head for an instant,
 blurring him a bit, as it were. His side wasn&rsquo;t so bad&mdash;a twinge
 or two&mdash;nothing to speak of. There was something else out there in the
 night&mdash;a clue to pick up somewhere. He didn&rsquo;t know how&mdash;or
 where. It might be as Smarlinghue, somewhere in one of the hidden sink-holes
 of the underworld, that he would pick up the trail of Bunty Myers, or Bunty
 Myers&rsquo; pal, the Kitten; or, if Mother Margot were back&mdash;Well, it
 was as a man in a dinner coat and mask that Mother Margot knew the Gray Seal.
 He was dressing for Mother Margot. Quite the thing, wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;to
 dress for the ladies?</p>
<p> Damn it! He must hold himself in! He stepped to the liqueur stand and poured
 himself out a little brandy, and drank it. He responded instantly to the stimulant.
 It steadied him. Over his underclothes he strapped on the leather girdle with
 its kit of blued-steel implements nestling in the little upright pockets, and
 where nestled, too, the thin metal case that contained the diamond-shaped,
 gray-paper, adhesive seals, the insignia of the Gray Seal. He put on his shirt,
 his waistcoat and jacket, and into the side pocket of his jacket he slipped
 his automatic. He was dressed now.</p>
<p> He stared at himself in the glass. Jason would have to be told. It wasn&rsquo;t
 fair to the faithful old man to slip out without a word. Jason would be mad
 with anxiety if he found him gone. Jimmie Dale rang the bell.</p>
<p> The reflection in the mirror returned him a twisted contortion of the lips.
 The damned thing was trying to ape a smile, wasn&rsquo;t it? It looked like
 a death&rsquo;s-head, gaunt and pasty-white, with lines like an old man&rsquo;s.
 Well, what of it? He felt all right, except that the bandage was infernally
 tight.</p>
<p> A knock sounded at the door.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> Jason&rsquo;s white head appeared in the doorway&mdash;and then the door
 was shut with nervous haste, and the old butler came hurriedly forward across
 the room.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Master Jim, sir!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Master Jim, what&mdash;what
 are you doing, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out, Jason,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> The old man cast an anxiously suspicious glance at his master.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, of course, Master Jim, sir,&rdquo; he said soothingly. &ldquo;But
 the exertion of dressing, sir&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll just sit down for a little
 while now, Master Jim, then by and by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jason,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, whimsically, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t
 be a fraud even in a minor degree&mdash;you&rsquo;re too transparent. I&rsquo;m
 quite myself. I&rsquo;m not in delirium. I&rsquo;m simply going out.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old man&rsquo;s face grew a little white.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean it, Master Jim,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;In
 the state you&rsquo;re in, sir, it&rsquo;s likely to cost you your life to
 go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely to cost me more than that to stay in,&rdquo; said
 Jimmie Dale, quietly.</p>
<p> The old man twisted his hands together; he coughed in a sort of helpless
 way.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man, Master Jim, sir&rdquo;&mdash;the tears were
 welling into Jason&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll pardon me, Master
 Jim, for taking liberties, but when you were a baby I dandled you, Master Jim,
 on my knee, and&mdash;and I know there&rsquo;s something strange and&mdash;and
 danger&mdash;that&rsquo;s come into your life&mdash;and it isn&rsquo;t my place
 to ask what it is, but&mdash;but for God&rsquo;s sake, Master Jim, sir, don&rsquo;t
 you go out until you&rsquo;re well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped toward the old man, and laid both hands on the other&rsquo;s
 shoulders&mdash;gently.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jason,&rdquo; he said, steadily, &ldquo;get me an overcoat, light
 weight, dark color&mdash;and a slouch hat. Tell Benson I&rsquo;m waiting for
 him&mdash;and to pamper my infirmities we&rsquo;ll take the limousine to-night.&rdquo; He
 turned Jason around, and pushed the old man quietly toward the door. &ldquo;Look
 sharp, please, Jason,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> The door closed behind the old butler. For an instant Jimmie Dale stood staring
 at the door, his face softened, almost a mistiness in the dark, steady eyes;
 then he turned abruptly to the liqueur stand again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I guess perhaps I&rsquo;ll need it,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p> He took out a small silver flask, filled it with brandy, and slipped it into
 his pocket. He went out then, closing the door behind him. As he descended
 the stairs he caught the sound of the car on the driveway coming from the garage
 at the rear of the house. That was Benson&mdash;another Jason! He felt suddenly
 humbled. Benson young, Jason old&mdash;at the extremes of life&mdash;and each
 without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation would give their all for him. It was
 a strange, strange thing, the love of men one for another&mdash;the love of
 these two for him. He had accepted it all too matter-of-factly perhaps in the
 past, not stopping to appraise it always for its immeasurable worth, or, when
 he thought of it, perhaps priding himself on it only as a possession that other
 men did not have, like a suit of clothes perhaps made by an exclusive tailor
 where the same pattern was not supplied to any one else. He did not know how
 he had won it.</p>
<p> He took his coat and hat from Jason in the hallway. The old man&rsquo;s lips
 were twitching.</p>
<p> &ldquo;God bless you, Jason!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale suddenly, and swung
 through the door.</p>
<p> At the curb Benson, the chauffeur, touched his cap, as he reached out to
 open the door of the big closed car&mdash;then hesitated.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mr. Dale,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;but&mdash;but
 I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful night, isn&rsquo;t it, Benson&mdash;for a drive?&rdquo; he
 said. &ldquo;West Broadway, Benson&mdash;and, oh, yes, stop anywhere within
 a block of Thompson Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Benson mechanically&mdash;and opened the door.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped into the car. The door closed. He saw Benson, in the
 act of swinging into his seat, turn and face for an instant the open doorway
 of the lighted vestibule where Jason stood. Benson&rsquo;s shoulders lifted
 in a helpless gesture.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What the hell can I do?&rdquo; said Benson&rsquo;s shoulders eloquently.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  A Tapped Wire</b></h2>
<p> Jimmie Dale settled back in his seat. The car moved swiftly, smoothly downtown.
 It wasn&rsquo;t so bad; not so very much worse than being in bed. He was quite
 all right.</p>
<p> He stared out of the windows. He had no plans&mdash;no definite plans. How
 could he have? Somewhere, somehow, he must pick up the trail of the Phantom&rsquo;s
 associates. That was all. And Mother Margot offered by far the best and surest
 way&mdash;if she were back. Obviously, therefore, the first move was to find
 out if Mother Margot had returned, and he would know that in a few minutes
 now.</p>
<p> And if she were still away?</p>
<p> His lips tightened grimly. The Sanctuary&mdash;Smarlinghue&mdash;a spectre
 haunting the Bad Lands through the night! Perhaps hopelessly! He had done that
 on so many nights before. What other way was there&mdash;to find Bunty Myers?</p>
<p> He lighted a cigarette. Occasionally he shifted his position. He told himself
 that it was only because the bandage was so tight that he was beginning to
 experience a little discomfort.</p>
<p> The car circled around Washington Square, and made its way into West Broadway.
 Presently it stopped. Jimmie Dale got out.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wait half an hour for me, Benson,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;No
 more. If I&rsquo;m not here by then take the car back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He did not wait for a reply. Half a block ahead was Thompson Street. He started
 toward it. His coat was tightly buttoned around his throat, his collar turned
 up, his slouch hat pulled toughly down over his eyes.</p>
<p> He swung around the corner, walking with his hands in his pockets. The narrow
 street seethed with its usual night life. Half naked children tumbled in the
 gutters, and played beneath the wheels of the pushcarts that flanked the sidewalks
 on both sides of the road. Banjo torches spluttered and flung out fantastic
 flares; shawled women, dark, swarthy, elbowed about the carts; men who wore
 earrings and chattered in strange tongues lounged on the sidewalk or jostled
 their way along in a sort of aimless fashion. The place was a din, a hubbub.
 The hawkers cried their wares.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale made his way along with studied carelessness, and suddenly, nodding
 sharply to himself in satisfaction, he edged out to the curb. Mother Margot
 was back! True, the old hag herself was nowhere in sight, but this was her
 pushcart here laden with its miscellany of small articles like the notion counter
 of a department store. He picked up a cheap, gaudy, colored kerchief and pretended
 to examine it. At the next cart was the old Italian whom he, Jimmie Dale, as
 Smarlinghue then, had accosted three days before when, as now, he had been
 in search of Mother Margot.</p>
<p> &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; he demanded, holding up the kerchief.</p>
<p> The Italian shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wait-a da minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She just gone-a da telephone.
 She come-a right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale put down the kerchief.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it bad enough to wait,&rdquo; he said indifferently&mdash;and
 drew back into the throng on the sidewalk. But the next instant he had sidled
 out of the crowd again into a dark, narrow and dirty little alleyway that made
 the side of an equally dirty and uninviting second-hand shop, on whose unwashed
 window painted letters, that had once been white, announced that its proprietor
 was one Antonio Mezzo.</p>
<p> The telephone! Luck! He felt his pulses quicken. There were only two persons
 who ever called Mother Margot to this telephone here, himself and&mdash;the
 Phantom. His fingers had crept to a pocket in the leather girdle. They came
 out with his mask. He slipped it quickly over his face. Mother Margot would
 have news to-night, then! He was at the side door now. It was slightly ajar;
 and, yes, he could just catch the old hag&rsquo;s miserable jargon, the shrill,
 complaining voice, muffled, of course, by the telephone booth itself that stood
 just within beside the door:</p>
<p> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear youse. De buzzin&rsquo;s got me feazed.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips straightened suddenly. It wasn&rsquo;t Mother Margot
 he wanted to hear. Why trust her? He had never caught her at the phone before!
 He could make her talk, but he had no guarantee that it would be the whole
 truth. He pushed the door open softly and stepped inside. There was a dim light
 coming from a blackened, nearly burned-out incandescent that dangled from the
 ceiling. The back room here, littered with old junk and broken furniture, was
 cut off from the front by a closed door. Being inside the booth, she had not
 seen him. She was still reiterating the fact that she could not hear distinctly.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale crept a step forward, another&mdash;then with a swift movement
 he jerked the door of the booth open, and leaning forward clapped his hand
 firmly over the mouthpiece of the telephone.</p>
<p> There was a startled cry from the old hag, as she shrank back. The side of
 the booth creaked with her weight.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; she whispered wildly. &ldquo;De&mdash;de Gray Seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale grimly. &ldquo;Give me that receiver.
 Quick! You answer as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He put the receiver to his ear.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded a voice imperatively. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
 that noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Tell him it&rsquo;s Mezzo moving some furniture about,&rdquo; ordered
 Jimmie Dale swiftly.</p>
<p> He took his hand from the transmitter.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s de old dago shovin&rsquo; some of his junk around,&rdquo; said
 Mother Margot into the phone.</p>
<p> Again Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s hand closed over the transmitter.</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; snapped the voice. &ldquo;Can you hear now?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Tell him you can hear now,&rdquo; breathed Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; obeyed Mother Margot. &ldquo;Sure&mdash;I gets youse
 now.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Go to the Crescent as I told you, then,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;and
 give Curley this message: <i>The black box, Sadie Foy&rsquo;s at eleven o&rsquo;clock</i>.
 Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale nudged Mother Margot significantly as he nodded his head affirmatively,
 and again removed his hand from the phone.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Mother Margot.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; said the voice, curtly.</p>
<p> The receiver at the other end of the wire was hung up.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, coolly.</p>
<p> Mother Margot stumbled out of the booth. She was twisting her hands together,
 casting frightened, hurried glances toward the closed door that led into the
 second-hand shop in front, glancing furtively, too, at Jimmie Dale from under
 her hooded shawl.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; she mumbled thickly. &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Outside in the lane, the side door closed, Jimmie Dale drew the old woman
 against the wall of the building, and for a moment stood staring at her speculatively
 in the darkness.</p>
<p> Suddenly she reached out, and clawed at his sleeve.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Wot youse goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo; she whispered wildly. &ldquo;My
 Gawd! De Gray Seal! Wot youse goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale ignored her question. He spoke sharply.</p>
<p> &ldquo;So Curley down at the Crescent Saloon is one of the gang too, is he?&rdquo; he
 demanded.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No; he ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She shook her head vehemently. &ldquo;Not
 de way youse means, he ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I suppose that is why a message is sent to him, then,&rdquo; observed
 Jimmie Dale caustically.</p>
<p> &ldquo;He gets lot of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; she said quickly; &ldquo;but he don&rsquo;t
 know wot any of &rsquo;em means, an&rsquo; he don&rsquo;t know where any of &rsquo;em
 goes to. I watched him once. Some one calls him up on de phone, an&rsquo; he
 just says de message over, dat&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale softly. &ldquo;But in that case,
 did it ever strike you that the Voice, as you call him, would save quite a
 little time, to say nothing of making you trudge around town, by phoning Curley
 direct?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot was twisting her hands again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse don&rsquo;t believe me!&rdquo; she cried out hoarsely. &ldquo;Youse
 t&rsquo;ink I&rsquo;m stringin&rsquo; youse. I ain&rsquo;t! Honest to Gawd,
 I ain&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m handin&rsquo; youse de straight goods. Dat&rsquo;s
 why no one gets next to de Voice unless he wants &rsquo;em to. De trail&rsquo;s
 gummed up. See? He don&rsquo;t trust no one. He was gettin&rsquo; leery of
 me. Dat&rsquo;s why he sent me away. See? Dere&rsquo;s been a lot of leaks.
 He sent me away for three days on a fake lay. An&rsquo; w&rsquo;en I was away
 one of his games gets a hole all bust in it again, an&rsquo; I guess it was
 youse did it. So he&rsquo;s sure it ain&rsquo;t me dat&rsquo;s spillin&rsquo; any
 of de beans. Youse see, don&rsquo;t youse? Say, for God&rsquo;s sake, youse
 see, don&rsquo;t youse, dat I ain&rsquo;t stringin&rsquo; youse?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old hag&rsquo;s voice was full of nervous anxiety. She kept wringing
 her hands together. Jimmie Dale nodded. She was undoubtedly telling the truth.
 He could quite understand now why she had been away&mdash;and could understand,
 perhaps better than she could, the Phantom&rsquo;s dire need of looking to
 his fences.</p>
<p> &ldquo;But the phone?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, dat&rsquo;s de answer, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
 ain&rsquo;t so much of a trick to trace a telephone call, is it? Not if de
 dicks want to do it. Dat&rsquo;s why he don&rsquo;t telephone dat sort of stuff
 nowhere except here, an&rsquo; not to nobody except me. An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; if
 he was wise to wot happened in dere just now he&rsquo;d&mdash;he&rsquo;d&mdash;my
 Gawd, youse know wot he&rsquo;d do! Say, youse ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
 stop me, are youse? Youse&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to tell me wot dat message is,
 ain&rsquo;t youse, an&rsquo; let me put it acrost?&rdquo; She was clawing pitifully,
 frantically at Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s sleeve again. &ldquo;If youse don&rsquo;t,
 an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t give Curley dat message, dey&rsquo;ll kill me. Mabbe
 youse got away wid it bein&rsquo; de dago bumpin&rsquo; furniture dat made
 de row in de booth, but if de message don&rsquo;t go, dat don&rsquo;t go neither,
 an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; dey&rsquo;ll slit me troat. Aw, for Gawd&rsquo;s
 sake! Youse knows dat! Dat&rsquo;s wot dey&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;</p>
<p> It was literally true. The failure of Mother Margot to deliver the message
 was exactly equivalent to her death sentence. Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips were
 a straight line. There was no quibbling on that point. The Phantom&rsquo;s
 trade was murder. He would strike without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation at
 the slightest indication that the old hag had played him false. On the other
 hand if he, Jimmie Dale, allowed Mother Margot to deliver the message he delivered
 himself without reservation into her hands&mdash;either that, or go back home
 to bed and leave Sadie Foy&rsquo;s alone. But again, if the message were delivered
 it promised almost to a certainty that at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s he would pick up
 the trail he had come out to-night to find. The Crescent Saloon and Curley
 did not interest him. That was only a relaying station. The rendezvous was
 at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s. Suppose he refused to give Mother Margot the message?
 Would it stop the projected devilry that was obviously afoot? And on that basis
 alone ought he to refuse? If he did, it would cost the woman her life. There
 was no supposition about that. That was fact. He couldn&rsquo;t do that, could
 he? And yet, since he must then assume the moral responsibility, and if for
 no other reason than that play a hand at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s, his own life very
 probably hung on whether Mother Margot would keep faith with him or not.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dey&rsquo;ll kill me!&rdquo; Mother Margot whispered hoarsely. She
 pulled at his sleeve, clung to it; she was rocking queerly on her feet.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale calmly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d kill you;
 and they would equally kill me if, once out of my sight, you added to the message
 the information that I was in this game again to-night. And so you see it&rsquo;s
 a case of you being killed to a certainty, or the <i>chance</i>, depending on you,
 of the same thing happening to me.&rdquo; He smiled suddenly, whimsically. &ldquo;I
 haven&rsquo;t very much choice, have I? I can&rsquo;t send you to your death.
 The message? Oh, yes! It&rsquo;s this: The black box. Sadie Foy&rsquo;s at
 eleven o&rsquo;clock. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She drew in her breath suddenly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd, youse&rsquo;re <i>white!</i>&rdquo; she said in a low, catchy way. &ldquo;I
 gets youse. Youse&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; youse&rsquo;re
 takin&rsquo; de chance of me splittin&rsquo; on youse. Well, youse needn&rsquo;t
 worry, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell youse why. I ain&rsquo;t forgot de night at
 Pedler Joe&rsquo;s. Youse made me go dere, I knows; but youse risked yer life
 to get me out of it, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered about that,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, half to
 himself; then, briskly: &ldquo;Do you know anything about this black box or
 what the message means?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Do you know where Bunty Myers is?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again she shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t heard anythin&rsquo; for three days until in dere to-night,&rdquo; she
 said earnestly. &ldquo;I only just got back.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale quietly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better
 go now. And hurry&mdash;in case there&rsquo;s a check on the time when you
 should be at Curley&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She hesitated an instant. Then she brushed a hand quickly across her eyes.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd, youse&rsquo;re white,&rdquo; she said again, huskily&mdash;and
 turned, and shuffled hurriedly down the alleyway toward the street.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale watched her until she had disappeared.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale grimly. &ldquo;And perhaps I am&mdash;a
 fool!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  The Pieces Of A Puzzle</b></h2>
<p> Five minutes later Jimmie Dale was staring at Benson&rsquo;s back through
 the plate glass, as the big limousine, continuing its progress in a downtown
 direction, rolled rapidly along.</p>
<p> He was frowning heavily. He did not like this! He did not like having Benson
 along like this. Not because Benson could not be trusted to the uttermost,
 but for Benson&rsquo;s own sake. There wasn&rsquo;t much risk for Benson, of
 course; in fact there wasn&rsquo;t any, as far as he could see, but he would
 have felt easier in his mind had he been alone. They were going ostensibly
 now to the Silver Dragon, a famous resort of slumming parties in Chinatown,
 and Benson would park outside where other cars were parked, and simply wait.
 But for all that, there was&mdash;</p>
<p> He shrugged his shoulders. What else could he do? His side was behaving very
 nicely so far, better than he had hoped for, in fact, but that condition was
 dependent, he knew very well, on saving himself all he could. That was why,
 for example, he had not gone to the Sanctuary, and, as Smarlinghue then, gone
 alone to Sadie Foy&rsquo;s. There would have been time&mdash;ample time. But
 he wasn&rsquo;t fit to play the r&ocirc;le of Smarlinghue to-night.</p>
<p> He dismissed the subject from his mind. He had done what had seemed the wisest
 and best thing. The rest was in the lap of the gods. He began a little mental
 calculation as he took out his watch. It was twenty minutes to eleven now.
 It was roughly about ten minutes ago when Mother Margot had started on her
 errand. She should be at Curley&rsquo;s by now. That left a leeway of twenty
 minutes for somebody to telephone Curley and, presumably, make the rendezvous
 at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s at eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale replaced the watch in his pocket&mdash;and stared again at the
 back of Benson&rsquo;s head. The black box! Sadie Foy&rsquo;s! He shook his
 head. The combination meant nothing to him, of course. But Sadie Foy herself
 was quite a different matter. In Chinatown Sadie Foy was a celebrity&mdash;a
 very shady and notorious celebrity. She was seldom sober. She was a white woman,
 old now, who had married a Chinaman. But Charley Foy, her husband, had perished
 in a Tong feud. That was many years ago. Since then she had lived in a little
 rat-hole of a place as dissolute as herself, a few blocks from Chatham Square,
 supported, according to the police, by a pension from the Tong for which her
 lamented Charlie Foy had given up his life.</p>
<p> A queer smile flickered across Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips. As Larry the Bat
 in the days of old, as Smarlinghue of to-day, he was in this particular very
 much better informed than the police. There was no question whatever about
 the pension; but the pension was not based on purely philanthropic motives,
 or due to a deep-seated sorrow for Charlie Foy&rsquo;s untimely and violent
 decease. It satisfied the police. Actually, Sadie Foy drove a lively trade
 in bulk opium, or in anything else of an illicit character that promised her
 a profit. The bulk opium accounted for the pension; an innate evilness and
 cunning accounted for her general depravity. It was a choice place for a rendezvous
 of any questionable sort, or for any purpose!</p>
<p> The minutes passed as the car sped along. Jimmie Dale half closed his eyes.
 Sadie Foy, or for that matter her iniquities, meant nothing&mdash;it was the
 trail now that so obviously led to Sadie Foy&rsquo;s door. The Phantom was
 interested in something at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s at eleven o&rsquo;clock. Would
 the trail broaden&mdash;or break? What did the night hold? A final reckoning
 with the Phantom? Freedom for <i>her</i>&mdash;if she still lived? Success, partial
 or whole? Failure? What?</p>
<p> The car slowed, and stopped. Jimmie Dale stepped to the sidewalk.</p>
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll raise the limit a little this time, Benson,&rdquo; he
 said. &ldquo;Wait an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale mounted the steps of the garishly lighted restaurant before which
 the car had stopped, and passed inside. The place was a riot of noise; the
 clatter of dishes, laughter, song, the never ceasing hum of numberless voices
 from numberless tables where the diners sat. He walked leisurely from room
 to room, making for the rear of the establishment&mdash;and here nonchalantly
 walked out into the cross street behind. The Silver Dragon was blest with two
 entrances.</p>
<p> And now Jimmie Dale quickened his step. He was in a narrow, twisting, ill-lighted
 little street in the heart of Chinatown. Shuttered windows threw out stealthy
 gleams of light from their interstices; scuffling figures sidled by him. He
 passed a small frame house, mouldy and in decay, weather-streaked, which paint
 had not touched in years. It was in complete darkness; not a light showed from
 it anywhere. And then in another minute he had slipped into the adjacent lane,
 and in still another was creeping cautiously across a filthy back yard&mdash;with
 the rear of the small house that was mouldy and in decay looming up before
 him. This was Sadie Foy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p> His eyes narrowed now a little grimly. It was black here all around him,
 but the house itself was not quite so dark at the rear as it had been in front!
 From a lower window just ahead of him little undulating threads of light seeped
 out from behind the edges of a drawn shade. It was the air did that, of course&mdash;made
 the shade sway slightly. Therefore the window must be open.</p>
<p> Voices, in what seemed like low, guttural undertones, began to reach him.
 He stole cautiously forward. There was refuse in the yard, and it was pitch
 black. It was not easy to assure silence even from step to step. A tin can
 became an object of dire menace. A minute, two, passed&mdash;and then Jimmie
 Dale, from a stooping position, stood upright. His head was just on a level
 with the window sill. He could hear now distinctly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; fed up waitin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said
 a silky voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s eleven o&rsquo;clock, and we&rsquo;ve been
 patient for about a couple of hours. If youse ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; across
 nice an&rsquo; pleasant, mabbe we can help yer memory a little more de other
 way. Sadie&rsquo;s got everything locked up nice for de night in front, an&rsquo; nobody&rsquo;ll
 disturb us. Ain&rsquo;t youse, Sadie?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s dark eyes lighted with a sudden gleam. He could see little,
 scarcely more than a group of shadows on the shade, but he had recognised the
 purring voice. The trail was here! It was the Kitten&rsquo;s voice&mdash;and
 with the Kitten at work, hand in glove with him somewhere should be the Phantom
 and Bunty Myers. If the light breeze would only stir that shade a little more&mdash;just
 half an inch!</p>
<p> A woman cackled hoarsely.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure! I&rsquo;ll take care of dat! Don&rsquo;t youse worry!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo; It was the Kitten&rsquo;s voice again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
 let youse off easy so far, but we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; fed up. I ask youse
 for de last time before youse gets hurt some more, where&rsquo;s de black box?
 Yer brother didn&rsquo;t take it up de river wid him; an&rsquo; de mob of boobs
 youse played for suckers ain&rsquo;t got it, &rsquo;cause dey&rsquo;re mostly
 on de street now wid de kids pickin&rsquo; up deir free lunches in de gutters;
 an&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo;t left around loose in de crib w&rsquo;en yer sweet
 little Banco Santos was pinched; an&rsquo; youse&rsquo;ve been hidin&rsquo; all
 de time&mdash;so where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was no answer. In the silence Jimmie Dale, almost involuntarily, startled,
 had drawn back a little. The Banco Santos! He did not need to see in there.
 He knew what the black box was now! The trial was scarcely a week old. The
 papers had been full of it. Two brothers, two Portuguese, Georges and Manuel
 Santos, had run a private bank, garnering in the savings of, for the most part,
 the poorer element among the foreign class, the tenement dwellers. They had
 played the game craftily, with vicious patience, for nearly two years, piling
 up the savings of the poor&mdash;only the final coup had been disrupted a little
 by a sudden suspicion that had arisen in the minds of the authorities. And
 one evening, as the latter had descended on the place, the two brothers had
 decamped by the back window, one of them carrying under his arm a black, oblong
 security box. One of the brothers, as likewise the black box, had not been
 seen or heard of since. The other brother, Georges, had been caught, and only
 a few days ago had started to serve a fifteen-years&rsquo; sentence in Sing
 Sing. The missing funds were estimated at between twenty-five and thirty thousand
 dollars.</p>
<p> The Kitten purred again:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it too bad he&rsquo;s lost his voice as well as his memory!
 An&rsquo; we ain&rsquo;t done hardly anythin&rsquo; but be civil to him since
 we runs into him back dere in Mickey de Cobbler&rsquo;s dump. Mabbe he&rsquo;s
 sore &rsquo;cause we didn&rsquo;t go right up an&rsquo; shake hands wid him
 den! But youse see we was just sittin&rsquo; around havin&rsquo; a drink, an&rsquo; thought
 mabbe we&rsquo;d had one too many an&rsquo; was seein&rsquo; things w&rsquo;en
 de cellar door opens, an&rsquo; one of dese guys here says he&rsquo;ll bet
 a million bucks dat it was Manuel Santos, an&rsquo; by de time we gets our
 breaths back he&rsquo;s slipped out. We hadn&rsquo;t never travelled together
 none of us before, but dis looked like we all had tickets for de same place.
 So we follows him. An&rsquo; over he sneaks to Sadie&rsquo;s here to buy some
 coke, an&rsquo; we trails in, an&rsquo; sure enough w&rsquo;en we gets a real
 good look at him Steenie&rsquo;s right an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Manuel Santos.
 Only he ain&rsquo;t got de black box dat dey talked about in de papers wid
 him.&rdquo; He laughed a little, low, viciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of askin&rsquo; him.
 Youse ask him, Steenie, same as youse did before&mdash;only a little harder.&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was a sudden blurred movement of the figures on the shade&mdash;a sudden
 low, throttled cry of pain and fear.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s fingers touched the lower edge of the shade. They were
 not occupied in there with the window now! And it might even have been but
 the stirring of the night breeze. The shade swayed gently inward an inch, two&mdash;and
 floated almost imperceptibly back into place again.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face was hard and strained. It was not difficult to pick
 out Manuel Santos from the group! The man&rsquo;s hands were tied, and he drooped
 over the table as though in a half swoon; his face was battered ferociously,
 and blood trickled in two or three little streams from his cheeks. Behind him
 stood the Kitten. In a corner Sadie Foy cackled applause, and rubbed skinny
 hands together joyously. There were four other men&mdash;dregs, rats, jacks-of-all-trades
 in the underworld. He knew three of them by name: Steenie Klotz; Red Jack;
 the Bummer. Nice names! But in the underworld the monikers were apt!</p>
<p> There came the sound of a blow, another, and another&mdash;and then a cry
 again. A voice gasped out weakly:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Stop! For God&rsquo;s sake, stop! I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Blamed if youse ain&rsquo;t a great memory worker, Steenie!&rdquo; purred
 the Kitten&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to tell. Well, Manuel,
 where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s at the camp.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s words came
 painfully.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s dat?&rdquo; demanded the Kitten.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the Sound. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s just this side of the
 Martin-Holmes place.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s brows contracted suddenly. The Martin-Holmes had nothing
 to do with this, of course; but he remembered now&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse mean dat summer shack youse an&rsquo; yer brother had?&rdquo; inquired
 the Kitten softly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man answered.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Nix on dat!&rdquo; The Kitten jeered suddenly. &ldquo;De bulls lived
 dere for about two weeks pawin&rsquo; it over. Don&rsquo;t youse try any of
 dat stuff, my bucko! If it&rsquo;d been in de house dey&rsquo;d have found
 it. I heard dey even pulled de floors up. Say, Steenie, <i>youse&rsquo;d</i> better
 try again!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Manuel Santos&rsquo; voice rose shrilly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
 true! I&rsquo;m telling you the truth. The police could never find it, but
 it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Kitten evenly. &ldquo;Tell us about it,
 den.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t really in the house, it&mdash;it&rsquo;s outside the
 attic window.&rdquo; The words came slowly in a mumbling sort of way. &ldquo;It
 looks as though the eaves were all boarded in around the house, but you can
 move one of them above the window. There&mdash;there&rsquo;s only one window.
 It&mdash;it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was a low, muttered chorus of exultant oaths; and then the Kitten&rsquo;s
 voice:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat sounds good enough to be true.&rdquo; He was purring again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
 get a closed car, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll hike along out dere, an&rsquo; youse&rsquo;ll
 come too, Manuel, so&rsquo;s dere won&rsquo;t be no tricks. Youse ain&rsquo;t
 such a fool after all, Manuel! A little trip to South America where youse&rsquo;ll
 be out of everybody&rsquo;s road, an&rsquo; a lot safer yourself dan youse
 have been for de last six weeks tryin&rsquo; to hide yerself away, is better&rsquo;n
 takin&rsquo; a last ride in a wooden box where youse can&rsquo;t look at de
 scenery! Youse&rsquo;re among friends, Manuel, if youse only knew it. Dere&rsquo;s
 some&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale was retreating from the window. A moment more, and he had gained
 the street; and, hurrying now, returning by the same way he had come, he reached
 his car in front of the Silver Dragon.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Benson,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;we seem fated to make quite
 a night of it. Off and on, you&rsquo;ve driven me a number of times to Mr.
 Martin-Holmes&rsquo; summer residence out on the Sound. I know it&rsquo;s closed
 now for the season, but do you remember just exactly where it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Perfectly, sir,&rdquo; said Benson.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; nodded Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;Drive there now&mdash;that
 is to within, say, half a mile this side of the place. If I remember correctly,
 it&rsquo;s quite thickly wooded there. I leave it entirely to you to find a
 convenient spot in about that neighbourhood to run the car off the road and
 park it where it will not be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Benson stared, a hesitant, anxious expression creeping into his face.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still quite all right, Benson,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Benson mechanically.</p>
<p> &ldquo;And, by the way&rdquo;&mdash;Jimmie Dale paused in the act of stepping
 into the car&mdash;&ldquo;I might say that I am in a very great hurry, Benson.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Benson heavily.</p>
<p> For a moment, as he settled back on the cushions and the car started forward,
 the smile held on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips. Benson, like Jason, was comparable
 to a hen with her chick. Benson at this precise instant probably&mdash;to mix
 metaphors&mdash;was inwardly wriggling like an eel. He was probably debating
 with himself whether he should not drive directly home, and there, by brute
 force if necessary, with the assistance of Jason, put him, Jimmie Dale, back
 to bed again&mdash;even if he got fired for it! Benson, however, in the last
 analysis wouldn&rsquo;t do anything of the kind&mdash;he would play the game.</p>
<p> The smile faded now from Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips, and a puzzled, anxious
 look settled on his face as he dismissed Benson from his mind. He had acted
 quickly back there at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s because he had realised that there
 was no time to lose; and though, even then, he had realised too that the pieces
 of the puzzle seemed somehow strangely mismated, he had also realised that
 the final act in any case would be played out where he was going now&mdash;at
 the Santos&rsquo; camp. Further, there was the moral responsibility to save
 that money, and nothing would have induced him to shift that responsibility
 to, say, the police, when instinctively he sensed, as he did, that the Phantom
 had still a card to play, a card that also must be played out at the same place.
 But what was that card? If it were only the Kitten who was involved, he could
 pick up the Kitten&rsquo;s trail again at the Santos camp; but it was more
 than the Kitten that he wanted, more than the Kitten that he still hoped for,
 and in which hope intuition told him he was justified. He wanted the Phantom&mdash;or
 Bunty Myers.</p>
<p> He had time now to solve the puzzle&mdash;if he could. But the pieces on
 closer examination only seemed the more mismated. They contradicted even the
 sense of intuition that was so strong upon him. Where was the Phantom&rsquo;s
 hand in this? The Kitten? Well, then, why that message?&mdash;&ldquo;Sadie
 Foy&rsquo;s at eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; The Kitten had said himself he
 had been there long <i>before</i> eleven. The Kitten was therefore <i>already</i> at Sadie
 Foy&rsquo;s when the message was delivered to Curley at the Crescent Saloon.
 And then, again, the four men who were with the Kitten, he was absolutely certain,
 had no intimate connection with the Phantom; they were not the kind the Phantom
 gathered around him; they were simply apaches, buzzards of the underworld,
 mentally the lowest type of criminal, whose only knowledge of finesse was embodied
 in the use of a black-jack, a knife, or a revolver. They did not belong! Suppose
 then they had been hired for this special occasion? In that case the Kitten
 was already fully equipped to carry through the night&rsquo;s work. Why, then,
 the message?</p>
<p> The miles flew by; the minutes passed into quarter hours. They had long since
 been out on a country road.</p>
<p> What did it mean?</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, save that at long intervals he subconsciously eased his position,
 sat motionless, staring introspectively at the window.</p>
<p> What did it mean?</p>
<p> And then suddenly Jimmie Dale sat erect. He had it! It had come like a flash.
 It dovetailed; it fitted in its minutest part. It postulated only that the
 Kitten had a means of ready communication with his unhallowed master, the Phantom,
 which in itself was axiomatic. The Kitten had haphazardly been in the company
 of the four apaches when one of the four, this Steenie, had recognised the
 fugitive, Manuel Santos. It was a &ldquo;find&rdquo; worth thirty thousand
 dollars&mdash;which the Kitten did not propose the other four should share.
 It was very simple! The Kitten had taken the leadership, and in the early stages
 at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s had undoubtedly gone out on some excuse and sent the Phantom
 word of what was afoot, stating probably that he was sure they could make Manuel
 Santos talk, and if so he would somehow stall on any move being made until
 the Phantom had time to act, setting that time at eleven o&rsquo;clock. Obviously,
 then, some one would be on hand at that time to receive from the Kitten the
 information as to where the black box was hidden, if that information had been
 obtained, and the &ldquo;some one&rdquo; would then arrive first at the hiding
 place, while the Kitten and the four thugs would arrive later only to find
 a rifled nest! And the Kitten would be secure from any complicity in the eyes
 of the four thugs&mdash;wherein the Kitten was very wise!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stooped suddenly forward and picked up the speaking tube. He
 wasn&rsquo;t racing any more then against the Kitten on whom he had a known
 start. He was racing against &ldquo;some one&rdquo; else, some one who would
 race like mad so as to keep the Kitten in countenance and not force his stalling
 to become apparent through lingering on the road when his hungry dupes would
 be urging speed.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Faster, Benson!&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve got
 the rest of the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p> He leaned back in his seat again. It was clear enough now. But who was this &ldquo;some
 one?&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t the Phantom himself, for the Phantom had sent the
 message. Who, then, was the Phantom&rsquo;s delegate? Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips
 drooped curiously until grim little lines formed at the corners of his mouth.
 It was more likely than any one else to be the man he had started out to find&mdash;Bunty
 Myers. He frowned quickly. Had he made a mistake? Should he have remained at
 Sadie Foy&rsquo;s? This delegate must have been there somewhere at eleven&mdash;when
 the Kitten was going out again with the excuse of getting a closed car. And
 then he shook his head impatiently. Perhaps! If he had known what he was so
 sure of now, he might have acted differently&mdash;perhaps not. This, after
 all, was the surer way, both of finding that delegate, and securing possession
 of the black box.</p>
<p> The car was eating up the miles now, keeping check almost with the minutes
 as they passed.</p>
<p> He ran his hand through his hair. Dog eat dog! It was dirty, miserable work
 all the way through, beginning with Manuel Santos, who was perhaps the most
 despicable of the lot. His hands clenched suddenly. If nothing else came of
 it, getting that money back to those to whom it meant their all was worth whatever
 it might cost him to-night. Thirty thousand dollars! There was something fiendish,
 damnable, in the vicious premeditation, the vicious patience with which the
 two Portuguese had worked! He remembered in the account of the trial it had
 come out in evidence that the authorities had not been lax. Always on demand
 securities in the shape of bonds had been produced to make the balances. Of
 course! And of a sudden those bonds had been transferred into cash, and&mdash;presto!&mdash;the
 squalid little bank was no more! He smiled grimly. It was probably the steady
 demand for so many bills of large denominations during the two or three days
 prior to the end that had first aroused the suspicions of the authorities,
 and&mdash;</p>
<p> The car was slowing down. And now it jolted over rough ground. A branch slapped
 smartly against the window pane. The headlights, streaming out, threw tree
 trunks into spectral relief against a background of utter blackness. And then
 the headlights went off, and the car stopped.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped out.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of the place, Benson, and that you&rsquo;re hidden
 from the road?&rdquo; he asked crisply.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Benson answered. &ldquo;Quite sure, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale. &ldquo;Keep your lights off, wait
 for me, and don&rsquo;t leave the car under any circumstances.&rdquo; He sensed
 a protest anent himself rising to Benson&rsquo;s lips, and he turned quickly
 away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes, Benson,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  The Black Box</b></h2>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved forward through the trees. It could not be far, not more
 than three or four hundred yards, for the Santos house lay between himself
 and the Martin-Holmes estate. That was why he had told Benson to stop half
 a mile this side of the latter place. The general direction, he knew, was a
 diagonal one&mdash;toward the Martin-Holmes&rsquo; residence, and toward the
 shore, away from the road. He smiled a little queerly to himself as he went
 along. He remembered that during a week-end visit to Holmes a year or so ago,
 the latter had expressed his annoyance at what he had called an unsightly shack
 that two Portuguese had put up on the beach close to his place. He, Jimmie
 Dale, had not been very much interested then; he was vitally interested in
 that so-called shack now!</p>
<p> He frowned suddenly. He had been making fair progress, and should have reached
 his destination by now; but, instead, he was still in the woods and the ground
 was growing wet and soggy underfoot. He edged off in the direction of the shore&mdash;the
 house was at the water&rsquo;s edge, Holmes had said&mdash;and went on for
 another hundred yards. It grew worse. He could hear now the lapping of the
 waves. The trees grew fewer, and began to be replaced by a reedy growth&mdash;and
 then of a sudden Jimmie Dale halted. A glimmer of moonlight flickered on water
 and waving marsh grass. It was impassable&mdash;it reached out into the Sound
 itself.</p>
<p> It was disaster! He felt his face whiten. He must already have been ten minutes
 on the way&mdash;and ten minutes was the utmost limit of margin he had any
 right to count upon. Ten minutes! It was far worse than that! It would take
 that much more to retrace his steps and circle around the other way before
 he could get started again.</p>
<p> He gnawed at his lips now as he turned and began to run. It was almost certain
 disaster; disaster to the moral responsibility he had assumed, disaster to
 the hope he had cherished that to-night&mdash;He stumbled. He could not be
 careful of his footing now. Defeat, yes, perhaps&mdash;but he would not accept
 it. He ran doggedly. Again he stumbled, and again. And now he winced with pain.
 This hurt his side brutally. It wasn&rsquo;t like riding on the cushions of
 a luxurious limousine, or even of walking when no unusual effort was required.</p>
<p> He went on. His breath came hard. He swept beads of moisture away from his
 forehead&mdash;and then once he reeled. It was hours, wasn&rsquo;t it, since
 he had started over again? There wasn&rsquo;t much chance&mdash;one perhaps
 in a thousand&mdash;not that much! His jaws clamped hard together. He was making
 a mess of it with that cursed side, and&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale came suddenly out of the edge of the woods. Well, at least, this
 was better! Fifty yards away across a clearing a house loomed shadowy out of
 the darkness. He listened intently. There was no sound. He darted silently
 across the clearing and gained the house. It was a small place so close to
 the shore that, as he crept now noiselessly up the steps of a verandah that
 apparently ran all around the house, he could make out a little wharf and what
 looked like an old, neglected boat drawn up on the beach. Certainly, there
 was no mistaking the house for there was no other of this description, he knew,
 in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p> A pick-lock came from a pocket in the leather girdle, and with it again the
 black silk mask. A moment more, and Jimmie Dale stood inside the house. And
 now he listened again, straining his ears for the slightest sound. Nothing!
 His face was white and haggard. There was only one answer of course&mdash;the
 Phantom&rsquo;s delegate had been and gone. There had been time enough&mdash;so
 much and to spare that even the Kitten was due now.</p>
<p> He took out a flashlight and circled it around him. The place was crude,
 to a certain extent unfinished; exactly what Manuel Santos himself had called
 it&mdash;a camp. It seemed to be divided into several rooms by thin, unpainted
 partitions. Here at his right, steps led upward. Well, he had come this far,
 and even if the chances now were all against him, he was still going up there,
 but he had to think of the Kitten now&mdash;the possibility of being trapped
 himself by the Kitten and his thugs. There was time enough now to take the
 precaution of arming himself with a knowledge of the general plan of the place.
 He stepped hurriedly through the several rooms that made the depth of the house.
 He nodded in quick understanding. The &ldquo;camp&rdquo; was of uniform design.
 One took his choice as to which was the rear and which was the front. Here,
 where he stood now, a door opened on the verandah; and here, too, a rough staircase
 led to the upper story, or attic, as Manuel Santos had called it.</p>
<p> Well, the attic now! That window! He went quickly up the stairs. At the top,
 his flashlight disclosed a broad landing and a closed door. The door was unlocked,
 and he stepped forward over the threshold. The flashlight circled the interior.
 Again he nodded. It was an attic, nothing more or less, without partitions,
 that reached from one end of the house to the other. There was a single window,
 halfway down one side&mdash;the right-hand side from where he stood now facing
 the Sound.</p>
<p> He was at the window now. He opened it, and stood up on the sill&mdash;and
 suddenly, poised there, he remained motionless. From the direction of the road
 he thought he had caught the sound of a motor. It was gone now. Perhaps he
 had been mistaken. The road was, as nearly as he could calculate it, a good
 hundred and fifty yards back from the water.</p>
<p> He felt swiftly up above his head outside the window. He did not dare use
 the flashlight now. Whether he was mistaken about the motor or not, the Kitten
 was already due, and a light would show a long way through the darkness. And,
 besides, there was partial moonlight, and he could see a little. His fingers
 were feeling, searching, prying over the rough boarding. It was very ingenious,
 this&mdash;the eaves boarded in to meet the wall of the house&mdash;only he
 could not find any section of it that seemed at all loose or movable. It would
 be craftily done, of course; he would hardly expect anything else, but&mdash;It
 was strange! Very strange! The Kitten had been able to pass on no more detailed
 information about this than he, Jimmie Dale, had overheard; and if he, Jimmie
 Dale, could not open it, how could the Kitten&rsquo;s confederate have done
 so? Just luck? A stumbling on the trick of it? It was rather strange!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale became motionless again, intent, alert. There could be no question
 about it now. There was the unmistakable crunch of <i>several</i> footsteps approaching
 the house from the direction of the road. The Kitten was coming!</p>
<p> In a flash Jimmie Dale reached into the leather girdle, and a powerful little
 blued-steel jimmy was in his hand. It was very strange! So strange that he
 meant to see inside there, Kitten or no Kitten! The jimmy ripped into a board
 above his head, and pried one end of it loose. He felt quickly inside. It was
 naturally hollow here, and he reached in as far as he could, feeling in both
 directions. Nothing! He tore the board completely away now, and moving a little
 along the sill, reached in from the other end. <i>It was here!</i> He was wrenching
 out an oblong shaped, black metal box of the style generally used in the safe
 deposit vaults. It was here! His brain seemed stunned for a moment. He did
 not understand. He could not understand&mdash;except that he had been wrong&mdash;wrong
 in his deduction from that scene at Sadie Foy&rsquo;s, wrong in his theory
 of the meaning of that message. And yet it had been so logical, so surely the
 truth! And yet, just as logically now, he was forced to the conclusion that
 he had been wrong. There had seemed, still seemed, to be no other possible
 explanation of that message, and yet&mdash;and yet he must have been wrong.
 Nobody&mdash;no Phantom&rsquo;s delegate&mdash;had been here. And the Kitten
 himself was coming now&mdash;because those were the footsteps of four or five
 men. Perhaps the&mdash;He pried the box itself hurriedly open. No; the contents
 had not been taken and the box left! The faint light disclosed package after
 package of banknotes.</p>
<p> The crunch of footsteps came again, still nearer to the house. Jimmie Dale
 lowered himself from the sill, and, carrying the box, retreated quickly across
 the attic to the door opposite to that by which he had entered&mdash;the door
 that faced the Sound. He opened it silently, stepped out on the landing&mdash;and
 the next instant crouched quickly back in the angle between the door jamb and
 the wall, on the side of the jamb away from the stairs. Too late! He had not
 thought they were so <i>near</i>. There was a footstep below. One of them was coming
 up this way&mdash;was even on the stairs now. He could not see, he could only
 <i>hear</i>. His automatic swung forward. Some one was close to him now. His jaws
 clamped. No, he had not been seen, either. The footstep passed the threshold
 of the door, entered the attic, and was crossing it now in the direction of
 the window. And now through the open door Jimmie Dale could make out a figure,
 little more than a shadowy outline, in the faint ray of moonlight from the
 window.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale hung there riveted to the spot. It was quick&mdash;quick
 as the winking of an eye. The figure, at the window now, halted abruptly, and
 swung sharply around to face the opposite doorway. And, coincidently, it seemed,
 the door opened, and as a flashlight streamed in and fell full upon the figure,
 and Jimmie Dale saw the man&rsquo;s face, there was a chorus of savage oaths,
 and almost simultaneously the flash and roar of a revolver shot. And the figure
 turned and ran toward the doorway near which Jimmie Dale stood.</p>
<p> It was Bunty Myers.</p>
<p> A voice screamed out in rage:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Blast youse, Kitten, if youse hadn&rsquo;t bumped against my arm I&rsquo;d
 have got him, an&rsquo; got him good!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face was set, drawn, rigid, a queer tightness about the
 corner of his lips. He had been right, a thousand times right! It was not he
 who had been wrong, nor his intuition, nor his logic at fault. It was Bunty
 Myers who had been wrong&mdash;something had gone wrong with the man&rsquo;s
 plans, something had&mdash;</p>
<p> A fusillade of shots poured into the room after the flying figure. Bunty
 Myers stumbled, recovered himself, came on again, staggered through the doorway,
 and stumbled again&mdash;this time dropping to the floor.</p>
<p> And then Jimmie Dale was at work. He slammed the door shut, and snatching
 out his pick-lock, locked it. Bunty Myers! <i>He</i> wanted Bunty Myers! This was
 the man he had set out to find to-night, and&mdash;No, it wasn&rsquo;t only
 that! Thank God, he wasn&rsquo;t quite so raw as that! Those thugs in there,
 those apaches, would kill the man like a dog, as they had already tried to
 do, for interfering with their meat. And the more so now that they would find
 that meat gone! The Kitten couldn&rsquo;t stop them without giving himself
 away. It wasn&rsquo;t Bunty Myers, it was a man&rsquo;s life now&mdash;if the
 man were not already too far gone.</p>
<p> He held the box under his left arm, as he bent forward to the huddled form
 on the floor.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Put your arm around my neck. Do
 you hear? Make an effort! It&rsquo;s your only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The man, with Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s assistance, lurched to his feet. They staggered,
 half fell down the stairs together. Bunty Myers was mumbling almost incoherently:</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I had a breakdown on the way&mdash;out&mdash;Kitten. Damn
 fool, Kitten, why couldn&rsquo;t youse hold&mdash;back&mdash;eh?&mdash;only
 a&mdash;a little late&mdash;youse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> A sweat of agony was standing out on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s forehead. He was
 half carrying the man. His side was torturing him.</p>
<p> &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; whispered Jimmie Dale between drawn lips.</p>
<p> Behind, upstairs, they were smashing at the locked door. They would either
 have to break it down or come around the other way through the house. It was
 worth a couple of minutes&rsquo; start&mdash;and there was the boat there now
 on the shore just a few yards away.</p>
<p> He plunged on, staggering. Bunty Myers had become almost a dead weight. Well,
 he couldn&rsquo;t leave the man to be <i>killed</i>, could he? The man kept muttering
 now, muttering, muttering:</p>
<p> &ldquo;...Up an&rsquo; down&mdash;see?&mdash;&rsquo;ell of a note&mdash;up
 an&rsquo; down&mdash;up an&rsquo; down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Bunty Myers collapsed a limp heap in the bottom of the boat. Jimmie Dale
 shoved it off, and jumped in. There were no oars, save a broken one. He seized
 it, and began to paddle. Footsteps pounded on the verandah, racing around the
 house. A yell went up:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dere he is! Dere he is&mdash;in de boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was the crash and flame spurt of shots, the spat of lead on the water.
 Jimmie Dale threw himself flat in the boat beside Bunty Myers. With the initial
 push, and the few strokes he had managed, the boat was quite a little distance
 from the shore, and what breeze there was was carrying it still farther out
 and also in the direction of the marshy tract through which he had first tried
 to reach the house. They could not, therefore, follow him along the shore.</p>
<p> A medley of voices from the shore, punctuated by oaths, reached him:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Get a boat.... Dere&rsquo;ll be one up at dat swell ranch even if
 it is closed for de summer.... Sure! Bust de boathouse in.... Beat it quick....
 He&rsquo;s good an&rsquo; hurt, an&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t get far.... He was
 winged upstairs in de attic w&rsquo;en he fell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale wrenched his flask from his pocket. They had only seen <i>one</i> man.
 Of course! His head was swimming crazily. He gulped down some brandy, and then
 felt for Bunty Myers&rsquo; lips.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Drink this!&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>
<p> The liquor gurgled queerly. He felt it run down the man&rsquo;s chin&mdash;but
 Bunty Myers must have swallowed some of it, for he began to mutter again, obviously
 in delirium now.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Up an&rsquo; down, I tell youse!&rdquo; mumbled Bunty Myers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
 honest to Gawd&rsquo;s truth. She don&rsquo;t know it, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s
 in de next house. It goes up an&rsquo; down, I tell youse. I saw it. Up an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; His
 voice trailed off.</p>
<p> What did the man mean? Jimmie Dale swept his hand across his eyes. It encountered
 his mask. He pulled it off and put it in his pocket. They were both delirious,
 weren&rsquo;t they&mdash;he and Bunty Myers? This was the man he had come to
 find, and from whose lips he had sworn he would tear the Phantom&rsquo;s secret,
 and all the man did was to croak, &ldquo;Up and down, up and down!&rdquo; Why
 didn&rsquo;t he say, &ldquo;See-saw, Marjorie Daw!&rdquo;</p>
<p> He gulped down another mouthful of brandy. Yes, that was better now. He raised
 his head. The shore was indistinct; not so much through distance, but because
 what little moonlight there had been was gone now&mdash;under a cloud. They
 would have a boat after him pretty soon. He must paddle now&mdash;risk a shot&mdash;he
 wouldn&rsquo;t be very distinct, either.</p>
<p> He dipped in the broken oar. It brought a moan of agony from his lips. The
 shots he had invited from the shore came&mdash;and missed. He <i>must</i> paddle&mdash;if
 it tore his side to pieces.</p>
<p> Only <i>one</i> man in the boat. That&rsquo;s what they thought. Well, then, why
 not? He could easily save himself. Drop overboard and swim ashore somewhere
 in the marshy tract. He had strength enough for that. They&rsquo;d find the
 boat&mdash;and find a man in it! But there was some reason why he couldn&rsquo;t
 do that. He shook his head fiercely as though to clear his brain. Yes, of course!
 He couldn&rsquo;t leave that huddled figure there at his feet to be killed,
 could he? So it would have to be a fight, unless he could evade them in the
 darkness. And&mdash;and there wasn&rsquo;t much chance of that. He listened.
 That sounded like a boat coming from somewhere far behind now. But there weren&rsquo;t
 any more shots from the shore. Naturally! He must be opposite the marsh now,
 and they couldn&rsquo;t follow him any more on the land.</p>
<p> He couldn&rsquo;t leave the man to be killed&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what
 they&rsquo;d do, kill the man. The Kitten couldn&rsquo;t prevent it without
 the others understanding the whole game and turning on the Kitten too. The
 Kitten had done all he could when he had bumped against the arm of the man
 who had fired that first shot. Funny, that Bunty Myers should be here! No,
 it was clear, quite clear! Bunty Myers had started out all right for the box,
 but a breakdown had made him late, so late that he&mdash;</p>
<p> A shout came from the shore behind. It was answered from the water. There
 was no further question but that they had secured a boat, though it was still
 a good way off. His broken oar suddenly touched bottom as he made a stroke.
 It wasn&rsquo;t the shore&mdash;it was just shallow water here fronting the
 marshland. Well, it didn&rsquo;t matter! He couldn&rsquo;t paddle much more,
 and not fast enough anyway to escape them, nor run fast enough with a wounded
 man even if he were ashore to get away from them. He laughed a little harshly.
 It was a case of fight for it, then. Perhaps Bunty Myers might be roused, propped
 up against a seat to help. It would be ironical if Bunty Myers hit the Kitten!</p>
<p> He stopped paddling, and leaned forward with his flask once more.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Here! Quick! Take some more of this!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p> There was no answer. The head he lifted slid from his grasp, and thudded
 with a dull, ugly sound against the side of the boat. And for an instant Jimmie
 Dale stared at the limp, huddled form. And then, with a low, quick cry, he
 reached for the other&rsquo;s wrist, searching for the pulse&mdash;and then
 for the man&rsquo;s heart beat. There was none. He drew his breath in sharply.
 The man was dead.</p>
<p> The splash of oars mingled with the growl and snarl of voices came distinctly
 now across the water. <i>Bunty Myers was dead</i>. It was queer! Strange! It seemed
 to carry with it some significance beyond the mere fact of death. What was
 it? He had started out to find Bunty Myers for something or other. His head
 was swimming miserably again. It had nothing to do with that black box there
 on the floor of the boat. Nothing to do with&mdash;</p>
<p> He spurred himself to action. One man in the boat. There need be only <i>one</i> man in the boat now! He looked behind him, straining his eyes through the darkness.
 He could not see the other boat. Therefore they could not see him. He picked
 up the black box, and slipped over the side. The water could not be very deep
 since his oar had touched the bottom&mdash;no&mdash;it was less than waist
 high. He began to wade as quickly as he could, and still avoid making any splash,
 toward the shore.</p>
<p> The sounds from the oncoming boat grew louder, the voices more distinct.
 And then Jimmie Dale, reeling a little, stepped from the water&rsquo;s edge,
 and began to make his way silently through the woods. He knew the way. There
 was no danger of losing it. He was on the same side of the marshy tract that
 Benson was. He had only to keep straight ahead toward the road. And it wasn&rsquo;t
 far.</p>
<p> Curious, how heavy the black box was! He smiled grimly. Back there they would
 think Bunty Myers must have let it drop overboard. What else could they think?
 But to-morrow the police would get it&mdash;with the compliments of the Gray
 Seal. And the Phantom&mdash;no, Bunty Myers! His head was swirling again, but
 his brain seemed to be fighting desperately to tell him that what Bunty Myers
 had said about &ldquo;up and down&rdquo; and a &ldquo;next house&rdquo; somewhere
 was something he should understand, because he was to make Bunty Myers tell
 him something if Bunty Myers died for it, and he knew very well that Bunty
 Myers had died.</p>
<p> He gnawed at his lips. His head was very bad&mdash;very bad. He couldn&rsquo;t
 think any more. Not now! Not to-night! But he had no need to think any more
 now, had he? There was Benson and the car looming up just ahead of him. The
 rest was for to-morrow, and the to-morrows.</p>
<p> The to-morrows....</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  In The Sanctuary</b></h2>
<p> A door opened and closed softly. A shadow moved in the darkness. Came then
 the crackle of a match, and a gas jet, air-choked, wheezing in protest, emitted
 a thin blue flame, grew yellow, and cast a meagre glow over its immediate surroundings.
 Unkempt, disreputable in his ragged, threadbare attire as Smarlinghue, Jimmie
 Dale stood for an instant staring around him at the squalid appointments of
 the place, and then moving abruptly to the far end of the room, flung himself
 down upon the already crumpled coverings of the dilapidated cot bed against
 the wall.</p>
<p> This was the Sanctuary. He half closed his eyes, staring at the asthmatic,
 stuttering gas jet. Well, it would be in every verity a sanctuary for another
 hour or so; a retreat where he could strive quietly to bring mental order out
 of chaos, and, yes, physically rest for a little while until it was time to
 carry out the plan that he proposed to put into execution before another morning
 came.</p>
<p> Since last night, all through the day, those mumbled words of Bunty Myers,
 the dying gangster, had been ringing in his ears. They had become an obsession.
 He could not rid his mind of them&mdash;or of the insistently growing intuition
 that they were the key to the Phantom&rsquo;s lair if he could only make head
 or tail of them. &ldquo;Up an&rsquo; down, I tell youse.... She don&rsquo;t
 know it, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s in de next house.... It goes up an&rsquo; down,
 I tell youse....&rdquo;</p>
<p> Who was &ldquo;she&rdquo;? He could not actually deduce it logically, but
 he was nevertheless sure that &ldquo;she&rdquo; was Mother Margot. The voices
 he had heard in her room but could not locate, the certainty that the clue,
 the phantom clue as he came to call it, was to be found in Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 rooms, was of course the basis for this interpretation; but it was the &ldquo;next
 house&rdquo; that bothered him. What did that mean? If he were right, and it
 was Mother Margot who did not know &ldquo;&rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s in de next
 house,&rdquo; where was this &ldquo;next house&rdquo;? There was nothing there
 but another tenement across the narrow areaway.</p>
<p> He frowned suddenly, impatiently. His mind was simply beginning to go over
 again, vainly, ineffectually, what it had already gone over a thousand times,
 it seemed, since last night. He had already made a decision&mdash;hours ago.
 He would know to-night whether he was right or not; he would know before he
 slept whether Bunty Myers&rsquo; dying words linked up the Phantom&rsquo;s
 secret with Mother Margot&rsquo;s rooms or not. To-night, finally, the phantom
 clue that <i>was</i> in any case connected with the old hag&rsquo;s rooms would be
 a mystery no longer if he literally had to wreck the place to unearth it.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale nodded grimly to himself. <i>To-night!</i> In a little while&mdash;it
 was too early yet. Just ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p> His lips tightened. Yes; wreck it! His was a single purpose now&mdash;that
 to-night he would strike with all his might; strike without counting the personal
 cost; and, above all, strike while for once he possessed the certainty that
 it would not be too late in the sense that even success in the unearthing of
 the Phantom and in a final reckoning with the man might only hold a bitter
 emptiness because she, the Tocsin, the woman he loved, would already have been
 beyond all aid.</p>
<p> There would be no thought of that. He was lighter of heart on that score
 than he had been for many days. She was alive; yes, and well, and safe. He
 knew that to-night. The torment, the fear for her safety that, finding no trace
 of her, he had known yesterday, and for so many yesterdays before, was gone
 now. She was alive; and, so far, she was safe. His lips moved silently. Thank
 God for that! And now he asked only that, whatever the outcome to himself in
 what he was about to do, she might after to-night be safe for always.</p>
<p> He shook his head a little grimly. Suppose, instead of success, he failed?
 Too often the Phantom had slipped from his grasp; and he was only too well
 aware that to-night he was almost literally going up against a stacked hand
 held by the other. Mother Margot had warned him that her rooms were a trap
 for the Gray Seal; the Tocsin had warned him. He had never doubted this simply
 because more than once he had ventured into those rooms and emerged unscathed.
 And, though it might well be, as he had argued with himself on his last visit
 there, that it was now so long ago since the trap had been baited that the
 Phantom no longer built any hopes upon it as a means of snaring his prey, that
 argument, however well founded, did not apply to-night. He could not very well
 expect to attack the trap itself and proceed to demolish it without <i>inviting</i> the attention of the trapper, which was, indeed, his prime intention.</p>
<p> A fool? Perhaps! But there was no other way of getting to grips with the
 Phantom. And to-night she was alive and safe; and there might be no to-morrow
 night. And, besides, if the worst happened, he would not go out <i>alone</i>&mdash;the
 Phantom would go with him. He was somehow sure of that; it was like a deep-seated
 consciousness, a strange reassuring certainty. And if that were so, he had
 no quarrel with the price, whatever it might be!</p>
<p> His fingers, fumbling in the pocket of his ragged jacket, found and drew
 out an envelope. He stared at it for a long time. Hers! The Tocsin&rsquo;s!
 The first word he had had from her for so many days! His eyes softened. Alive!
 And he had known so great a fear&mdash;a fear that had grown day after day
 into an almost hopeless agony of dread. She who loved him, and had made no
 effort to communicate with him after he had been wounded that other night&mdash;no
 effort when he knew that under ordinary conditions she would have moved heaven
 and earth to do so. That was why, last night, in spite of Jason, in spite of
 his wound, he had tried to pick up the Phantom&rsquo;s trail again through
 Bunty Myers&mdash;and in a measure had succeeded. He had found Bunty Myers,
 but Bunty Myers was dead now.</p>
<p> A strange, grim light crept into Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s half-closed eyes. The
 circle had indeed narrowed. Of the Phantom&rsquo;s satellites, of all those
 who once had gathered in that back, upstairs room of Wally Kerrigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;club,&rdquo; there
 were left now only two&mdash;the Kitten and Mother Margot. Those two&mdash;and
 somewhere in his hidden lair the Phantom. Well, to-night then&mdash;</p>
<p> He nodded quickly to himself. He was only waiting until it was a little later.
 He turned impatiently on the cot. Time seemed to drag interminably. The stage
 was already set. He had warned Mother Margot to keep away from her rooms to-night;
 to find an alibi for herself. It was a little quixotic, perhaps, a little of
 added danger to himself; but again, as it had been last night, her life, if
 things went wrong, might very well pay part of the forfeit, and even Mother
 Margot was entitled to her life. What else could he have done? It was true
 that, at best, he could consider her but an unwilling sort of ally; but nevertheless,
 even though it might have been but through fear, she had, he was sure, always
 played straight with him. And so to-night he could have done no less than to
 have given her her chance again.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale rose abruptly from the cot, and, with the envelope in his hand,
 stepped back across the room again to a position under the gas jet. He had
 found the note here in the usual place behind the movable section of the baseboard
 when, late that afternoon, after having previously called Mother Margot from
 her pushcart on Thompson Street to that rather singularly-placed telephone
 in the rear of Antonio Mezzo&rsquo;s shop and had given her her warning, he
 had come to the Sanctuary for the purpose of assuming the r&ocirc;le of Smarlinghue,
 and of spending at least a portion of the waiting hours in the underworld&rsquo;s
 inner circles which were always pregnant with the possibility of affording
 an additional thread or clue that might lend strength to his intended stroke
 against the Phantom. He read the note again. It was dated that afternoon:</p>
<p class="note"> Dear Philanthropic Crook:&mdash;What have you been thinking? With you wounded,
 and believing I would be in a position to know of it, and no word from me,
 it could only have been one of two things. Either I was heartless, or&mdash;or
 what you had feared so greatly had happened. It could not be the former, and
 so I know that in your love you must have been, as I would have been, mad with
 anxiety.</p>
<p class="note"> I said I would not write to you or communicate with you until the shadows
 had all gone out of our lives again, but this afternoon I would indeed be heartless
 if I did not send you this word. I am well; and I am safe. Through circumstances
 that I shall not enter into, I did not know that you were wounded until last
 night, and then, almost coincidently, I also knew that from last night&rsquo;s
 activities your wound could not have been serious, and so <i>my</i> anxiety was relieved.</p>
<p class="note"> Just one word more. Once before, long, long ago, so long ago that it seems
 now it were in some other age, I wrote you that it was near the end, that I
 had all but won, that victory was in sight, and&mdash;and, Jimmie, only disaster
 came. And so now I hesitate to say anything but just this: Things are going
 very well, and it may be, Jimmie&mdash;oh, I can not help but say it&mdash;only
 <i>hours</i> before the shadows will have gone forever.</p>
<p class="note"> Marie.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale replaced the note in his pocket. Somehow, he could not bring
 himself to destroy it, as he had always done before. It had been so long since
 he had heard from her; it was physical, tangible evidence that she was <i>alive</i>.
 He swept his hand across his eyes. Those fears of last night&mdash;that had
 driven him, wounded, from his bed! It was as though she had almost read his
 mind, read the argument he had followed and from which he had deduced the worst.
 It was strange, though, that she had not known&mdash;if things were going so
 very well! Circumstances! What circumstances?</p>
<p> He began to pace up and down the squalid room; and then, as abruptly as he
 had left it, he went and flung himself down on the cot again. He was restless.
 It was not his wound. His wound was all right, and was none the worse for last
 night&rsquo;s experiences. His side was sore and stiff, of course, and in that
 sense caused him a certain discomfort, but otherwise he was quite normal.</p>
<p> It was not his wound that caused his restlessness; it was this dragging of
 time, this waiting for the moment to arrive when he could supplant inaction
 with activity. Perhaps he would have done better to have remained longer in
 those various hidden places of the inner circles of the underworld that he
 had visited after he had received the Tocsin&rsquo;s note? He shrugged his
 shoulders. No; he was better here. He had learned all that he could have hoped
 to learn&mdash;yes, and more! No; that was not quite true. He had, rather,
 only substantiated beyond question what he had already decided in his own mind
 could be the only logical conclusion to the affair of last night when the Kitten
 and Bunty Myers, playing Steenie Klotz and his companion apaches for dupes,
 had attempted to secure the stolen funds of the defunct Banco Santos.</p>
<p> His jaws closed with a snap. Whisperings! How many times before had he listened
 to the voice of the underworld breathing its secrets through the underground
 exchanges where none save those of the aristocracy might find entrance, and
 where the peers of that abandoned realm of Crimeland kept their fingers on
 the pulse of a seething, disturbed and moiling citizenry! And to-night the
 underworld was in a sort of tense ferment, watching in unholy anticipation
 a game of life and death that was being played out behind its guarded doors
 that were so effectually closed to the outer world.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale smiled suddenly, grimly now. He had found the underworld viciously
 agog, intent with gluttonous eagerness upon a drama whose d&eacute;nouement
 promised to be blood-thirsty and murderous enough to satisfy even its unbridled
 lusts! Steenie Klotz, Red Jack and their companions had been played for dupes
 by Bunty Myers and the Kitten, but the dupes were not altogether fools, nor
 their intellects fallen to so low an estate that they had failed to absorb
 the fact that one plus one made two! The Kitten, and very certainly indeed
 Bunty Myers, had not expected that the night would end with the dupes finding
 Bunty Myers dead at their hands in that boat on the shore of the Sound! And
 of the two now Bunty Myers was perhaps in the better case! The Kitten, it transpired,
 had had sense enough not to stand on the order of his going, and had incontinently
 fled for his life. He had not been heard of since last night.</p>
<p> Again Jimmie Dale smiled grimly. It was the logical conclusion&mdash;and
 it was very simple. Bunty Myers and the Kitten for years had been well known
 characters in the underworld; and for years they had been known to work <i>together</i> in Gentleman Laroque&rsquo;s gang. And one and one made two, that was all!</p>
<p> Whisperings! Whisperings, as ghouls might whisper in hideous enthusiasm at
 the promise of some abominable feast to come, whisperings everywhere through
 the underground exchanges of Gangland! Of the passing of Bunty Myers the police
 as yet were apparently in ignorance; but Steenie Klotz and his outraged apaches
 had not hesitated in &ldquo;safe&rdquo; quarters to spread the story and make
 known the sentence they had passed upon their betrayer. And the underworld
 in its blood lust waited. It was the law. The Kitten was being hunted mercilessly
 to his death. But so far they had not found the Kitten.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale nodded at the gas jet. That was what he had learned in the underworld&rsquo;s
 inner circles; and then he had returned here to the Sanctuary, for it was not
 as Smarlinghue but as the Gray Seal that he meant to play out the night. And
 now time dragged. He could not even begin to strip off these rags and discard
 the character of the drug-broken, dissolute artist until the moment arrived
 when he was ready to leave. It was too dangerous, for in the meantime some
 one, any one, a lodger even in the same tenement here, might come, and&mdash;</p>
<p> He sat up suddenly erect on the cot. Some one <i>was</i> coming. He listened. A
 footstep shuffled along in the hall outside and reached the door; and then
 some one knocked guardedly upon the panel.</p>
<p> It was Smarlinghue, not Jimmie Dale, who spoke.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he demanded ungraciously.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; a voice croaked hurriedly. &ldquo;Let me in,
 Smarly. It&rsquo;s Mother Margot.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot! A queer smile flickered across Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips, as
 he rose from the cot and started across the room toward the door. Mother Margot
 who <i>obeyed</i> him as the Gray Seal, when she couldn&rsquo;t help it perhaps; Mother
 Margot who accepted Smarlinghue as one of her own ilk, and, on one occasion
 at least, as a source of assistance and an ally in her turbulent life! What
 did Mother Margot want with Smarlinghue to-night? He opened the door, and,
 as the old hag, her shawl drawn closely around her head, entered, he closed
 it again behind her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Hello, Mother!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale facetiously. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
 business good down on Thompson Street to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She glanced around her furtively.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dere ain&rsquo;t no one here, is dere?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale shook his head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Spill it!&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again she glanced around her, and it was almost a minute before she spoke.
 She twisted her hands nervously together.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Youse helped me once before, Smarly,&rdquo; she whispered finally. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
 ain&rsquo;t got no one else to ask, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; to-night I&rsquo;m
 in bad. Youse&mdash;youse&rsquo;ll help me again, won&rsquo;t youse, Smarly?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale pushed one of the two rickety chairs the Sanctuary possessed
 toward her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; he countered cautiously. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
 making promises on the blind. Help yourself to the chair, and I&rsquo;ll listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot shook her head quickly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no time to sit down. An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t got
 no chance for anythin&rsquo; only mabbe to get croaked to-night if youse won&rsquo;t
 help me. I ran all de way over here, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I was scared
 youse wouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo; She was wringing her hands together again
 in evident terror and nervousness. &ldquo;Oh, my Gawd, if youse hadn&rsquo;t
 been here, Smarly, I&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice broke and ended in a choked sob.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes, from the crouching, dishevelled shawled and spectacled
 old creature, sought the shadows cast by the flickering gas jet that played
 along the edge of the threadbare strip of carpet at his feet. He did not question
 the genuineness of her distress. He had very good reason to believe in it most
 thoroughly. He was even vitally, personally, intimately concerned in it; for,
 back of it, where Mother Margot was involved, must be the Phantom&rsquo;s hand.
 He smiled queerly to himself. What it was that had brought her here he, as
 Jimmie Dale, <i>must</i> know; but that knowledge could only be obtained through Smarlinghue,
 and Smarlinghue was&mdash;well, Smarlinghue was Smarlinghue.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t lose your nerve,&rdquo; said Smarlinghue a little
 sharply, &ldquo;or maybe you&rsquo;ll get me scared too, and the deal&rsquo;ll
 be off before it&rsquo;s started. The time before you got me to go hunting
 for English Steve, and I found him&mdash;murdered. What is it this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to try an&rsquo; get a message to some one,&rdquo; she
 said anxiously.</p>
<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you said when it was English Steve,&rdquo; observed
 Smarlinghue judicially. &ldquo;Well, shoot! Who is it to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Again she did not answer immediately; again she glanced furtively around
 her. And then she spoke, her voice scarcely audible:</p>
<p> &ldquo;De Gray Seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;The Gray Seal!&rdquo; Involuntarily Jimmie Dale gasped. He stared
 at her. He could quite understand that she might seek the Gray Seal; but this
 was irony in its sublimest form, wasn&rsquo;t it? And then suddenly he remembered.
 The night he had saved himself here by playing his dual r&ocirc;le! The new
 heights to which Smarlinghue had risen in the underworld through that supposed
 encounter! It had almost secured him initiation into the confidences of Bunty
 Myers, and the rest of the Phantom&rsquo;s followers, of which Mother Margot
 here was one. That was it! Because he had <i>once</i> been known to have been in actual,
 physical touch with the Gray Seal, and would therefore perhaps be able to recognise
 him again! And she had come to the Gray Seal himself! It was exquisite!</p>
<p> He felt her eyes boring into him from behind her heavy-lensed spectacles.
 He smiled with exaggerated derision. But mentally now he knew no mirth. That
 was only one side of it, the strange irony of it. There must be something of
 no ordinary importance that could have prompted her to act like this. What
 was it? She who, again and again, had been compelled to act under the Gray
 Seal&rsquo;s orders, under <i>his</i> orders; who, only that afternoon, had received
 her instructions, or, perhaps better, warning from him over the telephone!</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too easy!&rdquo; scoffed Smarlinghue, and grinned broadly. &ldquo;All
 anybody&rsquo;s got to do that wants the Gray Seal is to go out on the corner
 and whistle for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; The exclamation came piteously. She wrung her hands
 the harder together.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale, still facetiously, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
 the idea, then? Do you think just because he rough-housed me here one night
 that he left his calling card, and wrote his address on it before he went away?
 Or maybe you think he took his mask off, and says: &lsquo;Smarly, drop around
 any afternoon for a cup of tea; I&rsquo;ll always be at home&mdash;to you!&rsquo; Well,
 he didn&rsquo;t! There ain&rsquo;t a bull or a lag that ain&rsquo;t been hunting
 him for years&mdash;and they&rsquo;re still hunting! How&rsquo;d you expect
 me to find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She seemed hardly to be paying any attention. Her fingers were working nervously
 with her shawl, now loosening it, now tightening it around her throat; and
 she still kept on glancing in all directions furtively around her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Smarly, for Gawd&rsquo;s sake, listen!&rdquo; she burst out wildly. &ldquo;I
 ain&rsquo;t askin&rsquo; youse to find him. I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; youse to
 help me. I got to have some one I can trust. Mabbe youse won&rsquo;t have to
 do nothin&rsquo; at all. Youse won&rsquo;t see him; it&rsquo;ll only be on
 de telephone. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been workin&rsquo; wid him for weeks now.&rdquo;</p>
<p> It was exquisite! There was humour here for Jimmie Dale&mdash;but Smarlinghue&rsquo;s
 jaw dropped helplessly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;The Gray Seal&mdash;and <i>you!</i>&rdquo; He gulped, swallowing hard.</p>
<p> She nodded her head in a sort of helpless way.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My Gawd, I&rsquo;m handin&rsquo; it to
 youse straight, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m in bad to-night. Youse
 helped me once, an&rsquo; dere ain&rsquo;t no one else I dares go to. An&rsquo; youse
 <i>will</i> help me, won&rsquo;t youse, Smarly, if I swear to youse dat dere ain&rsquo;t
 no risk or nothin&rsquo; like dat for youse, an&rsquo; dat dere ain&rsquo;t
 no one goin&rsquo; to know youse was in it at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue, examined meditatively the ragged, frayed sleeve
 of his coat.</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale cautiously. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m
 as safe as that, I won&rsquo;t see you stuck. But you&rsquo;ve got to show
 me first. What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She reached out and caught his hand impulsively, and wrung it hard.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Gawd bless youse, Smarly!&rdquo; There was a world of relief in her
 voice, husky and broken though it was. &ldquo;I knew youse would, Smarly; I
 knew youse would. Listen! Youse knows where my pushcart is on Thompson Street.
 Well, just near it is Mezzo&rsquo;s second-hand shop, an&rsquo; dere&rsquo;s
 a side door to dat&mdash;up de lane. Dat door ain&rsquo;t locked, an&rsquo; old
 Mezzo&rsquo;s away to-night, an&rsquo; de shop is shut up. Dere&rsquo;s a telephone
 in dere in de back storeroom. It&rsquo;s kept dere on de quiet&mdash;see? All
 youse&rsquo;ve got to do, Smarly, is go in dere an&rsquo; wait, an&rsquo; answer
 de telephone if it rings. Dere ain&rsquo;t nobody goin&rsquo; to see youse,
 an&rsquo; dere ain&rsquo;t nobody goin&rsquo; to know youse&rsquo;re dere.
 If it rings it&rsquo;ll be de Gray Seal, an&rsquo; youse&rsquo;ll give him
 a message from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, as Smarlinghue, whistled a little dubiously under his breath.</p>
<p> &ldquo;And they said he always worked alone!&rdquo; he observed plaintively. &ldquo;Say,
 you&rsquo;d get bumped off for this if any of the fleets knew about it! You&rsquo;re
 pretty thick, ain&rsquo;t you? He puts in a telephone for you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;He
 had nothin&rsquo; to do wid it. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s another crowd.
 He got wise to it, dat&rsquo;s all, an&rsquo; one night he caught me cold in&mdash;oh,
 my Gawd, Smarly, never mind about dat! I&mdash;I&rsquo;m in wrong wid de whole
 works. I&mdash;I got to get a message to him to-night if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you go and find him then, and can the telephone
 stuff?&rdquo; inquired Jimmie Dale, in his r&ocirc;le of Smarlinghue.</p>
<p> &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t know where he is, an&rsquo; no more about
 him dan youse does,&rdquo; she said almost hysterically. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
 youse understand, Smarly? He calls me to de phone when he wants me, an&rsquo; de
 times he&rsquo;s shown himself was when he was wearin&rsquo; a mask like he
 had de night he bust in on youse here.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; prodded Jimmie Dale, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you
 stick around and listen for the telephone yourself to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot was wringing her hands again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;D&rsquo;youse t&rsquo;ink I&rsquo;d have come here an&rsquo; put youse
 wise to wot I have, if I could&rsquo;ve done dat?&rdquo; she cried wildly. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s
 wot&rsquo;s de matter. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s de other crowd dat&rsquo;s pullin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; to-night,
 an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I got to go an&rsquo; do somethin&rsquo; dey&rsquo;s
 told me to do. I got to go. I don&rsquo;t dare not to go. Dey&mdash;dey&rsquo;d
 cut me t&rsquo;roat if I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
 somethin&rsquo; de Gray Seal&rsquo;s got to know about, or else he&mdash;oh,
 my Gawd, Smarly, can&rsquo;t youse understand?&mdash;he&rsquo;d put me in wrong,
 an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d get finished anyway. He&rsquo;s pullin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; himself
 to-night, but it&rsquo;s no good now, &rsquo;cause somethin&rsquo; else is
 goin&rsquo; to happen, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d know afterwards dat I knew, an&rsquo; if
 I didn&rsquo;t wise him up dat&rsquo;s my finish too.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Smarlinghue circled his lips with the tip of his tongue, and scowled unhappily.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said heavily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in nice, ain&rsquo;t
 you? How do you know it won&rsquo;t be the other crowd you&rsquo;re talking
 about, the bunch that you said put the phone in there, that rings up&mdash;and
 then I&rsquo;d get stung too?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause dey knows I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be dere. Ain&rsquo;t
 I tellin&rsquo; youse dat?&rdquo; Mother Margot answered miserably. &ldquo;If
 de phone rings, it&rsquo;ll be de Gray Seal. Dere&rsquo;s no one else&rsquo;d
 ask for Mother Margot.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;And suppose he don&rsquo;t ring up at all?&rdquo; inquired Smarlinghue.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I dunno!&rdquo; Mother Margot&rsquo;s face seemed to whiten a little. &ldquo;My
 Gawd, Smarly, I dunno&mdash;dat&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s got me so scared. I ain&rsquo;t
 even sayin&rsquo; he will; I&mdash;I&rsquo;m only hopin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s
 de only chance I got. I know mabbe where I could find him a couple of hours
 from now, but it&rsquo;ll be too late den. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; more,
 Smarly, can I? I can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; more. If he don&rsquo;t telephone,
 de only chance I got is to try an&rsquo; make him believe I did me best&mdash;dat&rsquo;s
 all! An&rsquo; if he don&rsquo;t believe me, I&mdash;I guess I goes out for
 keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale for a moment appeared to consider the matter.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t quite sure I get you,&rdquo; he said slowly at last, &ldquo;except
 that it looks to me like, between the two of them, it don&rsquo;t make much
 difference whether you&rsquo;re coming or going. And this telephone stunt looks
 like a long shot to me. But I don&rsquo;t see where I get hurt any, and if
 it&rsquo;s going to ease your mind I&rsquo;ll stand in. So what&rsquo;s the
 message I&rsquo;m to give if he telephones?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot&rsquo;s face brightened.</p>
<p> &ldquo;T&rsquo;ank God for youse, Smarly!&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;re
 as white as dey makes &rsquo;em. Youse just say dat de message is from me,
 an&rsquo; dat de Voice is goin&rsquo; to pull de big bump to-night, an&rsquo; to
 watch French Jeff down at de White Rat. Y&rsquo;understand, Smarly?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale shook his head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if he does, it&rsquo;s
 all right, I suppose. I&rsquo;m satisfied. I&rsquo;m not for mixing in and
 getting my hair singed. But if he asks me what the bump is, and what time it&rsquo;s
 going to bust loose, what do I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Mother Margot. &ldquo;Dere ain&rsquo;t
 nothin&rsquo; more to tell him, &rsquo;cause dat&rsquo;s all I knows myself;
 but I knows it&rsquo;s de big showdown all right, an&rsquo; de dope is straight.
 He won&rsquo;t need nothin&rsquo; more, I guess, if he wants to butt in.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale nodded indifferently. It was precisely what he wanted to know&mdash;the
 exact extent of the old hag&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p> Mother Margot shuffled her feet nervously.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I got to go, Smarly,&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;De Dago&rsquo;s
 runnin&rsquo; me pushcart for me for de rest of de night, but he don&rsquo;t
 know nothin&rsquo; about dis, so don&rsquo;t youse give him de high sign. Youse
 understand about de side door in de lane?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Smarlinghue. &ldquo;And while we&rsquo;re standing
 here talking maybe he&rsquo;s telephoned already and pulled a bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mother Margot shook her head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He knows Mezzo don&rsquo;t
 always hear, an&rsquo; sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to get an answer. If he was
 tryin&rsquo; to get me, he&rsquo;ll try again until he does.&rdquo; She hesitated,
 drew her shawl tightly about her head again, took a step toward the door, and
 once more hesitated. &ldquo;Gawd bless youse, Smarly!&rdquo; she said brokenly. &ldquo;Mabbe
 youse t&rsquo;inks youse does, but youse don&rsquo;t know wot youse&rsquo;re
 doin&rsquo; for me to-night. Mabbe I&rsquo;ll pull out of dis alive, an&rsquo; mabbe
 I won&rsquo;t, but don&rsquo;t youse ever forget, Smarly, if youse never sees
 me again, dat dere ain&rsquo;t no one in dis world means anythin&rsquo; to
 Mother Margot like youse does, Smarly. An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; Her
 voice broke.</p>
<p> She was crying. Jimmie Dale started forward impulsively as he saw the old
 shoulders shake, and a tear, followed by another, trickle unchecked down her
 cheek. But she turned her head quickly away, and scuffled hurriedly toward
 the door before he had reached her.</p>
<p> But at the door she turned again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Gawd bless youse, Smarly!&rdquo; she called again&mdash;and closed
 the door behind her.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  At &ldquo;The White Rat&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p> Mother Margot&rsquo;s footsteps, shuffling, receded along the hall, and died
 away with the opening and closing of the street door.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stood staring across the empty room. He had not fully realised
 before how secure was the hold that he, as the Gray Seal, had upon the old
 hag! She was afraid of the Phantom, or the Voice, as she called the man; but
 she was equally afraid of the Gray Seal, it now appeared&mdash;and between
 the two, unable to steer any middle course to-night, she was in mortal terror.</p>
<p> He frowned. He might have eased her mind a little in some way, perhaps. No!
 He shook his head decisively. Her coming, the story she had told, changed materially,
 and of necessity, his own plans for to-night&mdash;at least for the next few
 hours. Mother Margot&rsquo;s rooms had interested him only because of the probability
 that they were the outer portal to the Phantom&rsquo;s sanctum; but if the
 Phantom&rsquo;s movements to-night centred around French Jeff and &ldquo;The
 White Rat,&rdquo; it was French Jeff and The White Rat that automatically and
 at once became the centre of attraction for him as well. And particularly so
 since, deprived of the Kitten&rsquo;s assistance, practically the one remaining
 satellite, any play that the Phantom made must, leaving Mother Margot out,
 be made in <i>person</i>. It was the Phantom that he sought!</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped swiftly across the room and locked the door, then kneeling
 on the floor near by lifted aside the movable section of the baseboard. He
 could no more have afforded to risk the character of Smarlinghue by some well-meaning
 but ill-advised word in an effort to calm her fears, than he could afford,
 after what she had said, to go to The White Rat <i>as</i> Smarlinghue. She was as
 likely to be there as not. If she saw Smarlinghue there it would be&mdash;Well,
 she would never again after that have need to fear the Gray Seal! A hint that
 Smarlinghue was not what he seemed would be the end, swift and inevitable,
 of the Gray Seal and Jimmie Dale!</p>
<p> He nodded sharply to himself as he stripped off his ragged attire, and, quickly
 now, removing the little pieces of wax from nostrils and from beneath the lips,
 that distorted the contour of his face, and removing, too, the stain of make-up,
 began to dress again as Jimmie Dale in the carefully folded suit which he took
 from the hiding place behind the baseboard. Again he nodded to himself. Tweeds
 to-night. It was fortunate! He had naturally been wearing tweeds that afternoon
 when he had left his house. The White Rat was not usually frequented by gentlemen
 in evening dress!</p>
<p> A minute, two, three passed. The gas jet, spitting like an angry cat, became
 suddenly silent. The room was in darkness, save for a queer, nebulous shaft
 of night light that came in through the top-light high up over the French doors
 that opened on the small, ill-kept courtyard without. And now a shadow moved
 and bulked itself against the French doors, and one of the French doors opened
 without sound and closed again, and the shadow crept along the wall of the
 building, and strangely, like an apparition, disappeared through the fence
 that bordered the lane.</p>
<p> A moment more, and Jimmie Dale, as though Smarlinghue had never existed,
 was walking quietly along the street. His mind was working now with cool, judicial
 precision, sifting, weighing, appraising the factors of the problem before
 him. Mother Margot would not be near Thompson Street again to-night. If the
 Gray Seal&rsquo;s hand appeared to-night, it would be no more than she expected.
 Whether it was as the Gray Seal or as Smarlinghue that first he next saw Mother
 Margot, the statement that the Gray Seal had phoned and received his information
 was wholly in accord with the old hag&rsquo;s own suggestion. He, Jimmie Dale,
 was free to go at once to The White Rat. He was not even abusing the trust
 that she had reposed in Smarlinghue! There was something ironical in that!</p>
<p> Her distress had been genuine enough, and her story was beyond doubt or question.
 Who should know better than himself? She had said that later on she might have
 known where to find the Gray Seal, but that it would be too late then. She
 had meant, of course, her own rooms that he had, that afternoon, warned her
 to keep away from. That statement alone stamped her story with the ring of
 truth. But why bring distrust of Mother Margot even into question! She had
 never yet played him false; and to-night it was glaringly obvious that, voluntarily,
 in the only way she could, though that way depended purely on chance, she had
 done her utmost to keep her pact with him.</p>
<p> He shrugged his shoulders. Mother Margot, as a factor in the problem to-night,
 could from now on be eliminated. French Jeff and The White Rat, then! What
 was the game that the Phantom was playing, the key to which, which was all
 the information that Mother Margot had possessed, was French Jeff and The White
 Rat?</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale was walking more quickly now, threading his way through the more
 unfrequented streets, as he worked deeper into the lower East Side. French
 Jeff and The White Rat were equally notorious; the one as a sort of plenipotentiary
 of crookdom from the other side of the water, and the other as the favourite
 hostelry of foreign visitors whose credentials were properly vis&eacute;d.
 This was the understanding that the New York underworld had of French Jeff
 and The White Rat; ostensibly, however, to the police, and to the public at
 large, the man was but the quiet, law-abiding proprietor of a small establishment
 that, while it could not be dignified by the name of hotel, yet, nevertheless,
 embodied in itself a bar, a restaurant, and a few rooms for guests&mdash;which
 latter, to the public, were always &ldquo;engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Quite so! In the enormously fat little Frenchman and his White Rat lay potentialities
 for evil that were limitless. Suave, cunning in his international affiliations,
 the man was credited with playing big games for big stakes. That he was successful
 was evidenced by the fact that for years now he had carried on business without
 coming under the ban of the police.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale frowned. He, like the rest of the underworld, for his eyes were
 Smarlinghue&rsquo;s now, could only view the man in the large; there were no
 details to the picture. And this was so, naturally enough, because French Jeff
 confined himself strictly to his own foreign connections, and stood wholly
 aloof from local entanglements no matter how alluring the promise of their
 reward might be. What then was the Phantom&rsquo;s interest in this man to-night?
 Had French Jeff at last broken his rule and gone in on some deal, working hand
 in glove with the Phantom; or was the Phantom preparing, as he so often did,
 to pick the ripened plums from another&rsquo;s tree? Or was it&mdash;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale had halted before an uninviting three-story frame building on
 the corner of an equally uninviting street. A sign, somewhat battered and aping
 the Continental style, swung in the breeze over the front door. It bore the
 design of an animal, its species none too easily recognisable, done in white
 on a green background; the lettering, however, below this inartistic effort
 was informative: THE WHITE RAT.</p>
<p> Within, as could be seen from the street, the ground floor was a sort of
 combination restaurant and bar. A few customers occupied tables; a few more
 were at the bar. Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s slouch hat was pulled rakishly down over
 his eyes, his cravat flashily tucked into the bosom of his shirt, as he stepped
 now inside, and, walking up to the bar, ordered a drink. He glanced around
 him nonchalantly. He had never been in the place before, but in common with
 everybody else in the underworld he knew the fat proprietor by sight. French
 Jeff was not in evidence.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t the boss around?&rdquo; inquired Jimmie Dale casually
 out of the corner of his mouth, as the barkeeper slid a glass toward him across
 the bar.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Sure! He&rsquo;s upstairs on de office,&rdquo; replied the man, evidently,
 too, a Frenchman, in broken English. &ldquo;You want to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale shook his head.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; he said indifferently. &ldquo;Not hard enough to bring
 him down. I&rsquo;d have said hello to him if he&rsquo;d been handy, that&rsquo;s
 all.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale set his now empty glass back on the bar, and with a wave of his
 hand to the barkeeper, went out again to the street. French Jeff was &ldquo;upstairs
 on de office.&rdquo; He went on around the corner. The White Rat, if it were
 efficient along the lines upon which it was supposed to run, would certainly
 possess a side entrance for the benefit of those who, with the necessary credentials,
 were privileged to occupy rooms there. Yes, here it was.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale opened the door quietly and stepped inside. Even if seen, it
 meant only that he must then find some other means of getting into proximity
 with French Jeff. The glib excuse that he thought this was but another entrance
 to the restaurant, as indeed it might well be also, would be quite sufficient
 to guarantee an orderly retreat on his part. And then he flung a mental gibe
 at himself. He was borrowing trouble, whereas, as a matter of fact, he appeared
 to be playing in wholesale luck.</p>
<p> He found himself standing in a dimly lighted hall, rather seedily furnished,
 and quite deserted. The only sounds were those that sifted through from the
 restaurant in the front of the establishment, the clatter of dishes, the muffled
 voices of those at the tables and at the bar. No; he was wrong! From above
 him, up the stairs that were directly in front of him, his ear caught now a
 curious, irregular rasping sound. He could not at once definite it as he began
 quickly and silently to mount the stairs, but halfway up the sound took on
 a concrete meaning, and a smile broadened his lips. The sound had resolved
 itself into nothing more than a series of well defined snores!</p>
<p> And now at the top of the landing, he placed the direction of the sound.
 Doors here opened off on each side of the hall, and at the far end the light
 streamed out through one that was open, and disclosed, facing it, the door
 on the opposite side of the hall to be ajar. It was from the lighted room that
 the snores emanated.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale moved softly along the hall, keeping close against the wall on
 the opposite side from the lighted door, and finally paused. From where he
 stood now, he could just see at an angle into the lighted room. For an instant
 he stood listening, then he slipped through the already partially opened door
 beside him that faced the lighted doorway. He was playing in luck, in unbounded
 luck! Here was a vacant room, and across the hall, the door wide open, French
 Jeff and his &ldquo;office&rdquo; were in plain view. Perhaps it was almost
 too much luck! This room here might be occupied after all, the &ldquo;guest&rdquo; out
 only temporarily, and likely to return at any minute.</p>
<p> He glanced critically around him. There was light enough from across the
 hall to see. No; it was quite all right. There was no sign of occupancy, no
 clothing, no belongings of any kind in evidence. And if by any chance a new
 arrival should be allotted the room, it would certainly not be until French
 Jeff in there had been advised and had passed upon the applicant&rsquo;s desirability,
 and there would be time enough then to consider a means of retreat.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale, leaving the door no more ajar than would enable him to see readily
 into the opposite room, drew up a chair and coolly seated himself for his vigil.
 The fat little French crook was sprawled back in his desk chair, his hands
 folded over an ample and undulating paunch, his feet up and resting on a black
 handbag that in turn occupied the seat of a second chair. The man was fast
 asleep.</p>
<p> What was it? What was the game? Had that black handbag, guarded by the other&rsquo;s
 feet, anything to do with it? &ldquo;Watch French Jeff at The White Rat.&rdquo; That
 was all Mother Margot had known.</p>
<p> The minutes passed, became quarter hours, a half hour&mdash;more. Occasionally
 French Jeff stirred uneasily, awakened, settled himself drowsily, and went
 to sleep again; occasionally Jimmie Dale silently changed his own position.</p>
<p> What time was it? It had been well after ten o&rsquo;clock when Mother Margot
 had come to the Sanctuary; it must be long after eleven now. He began to know
 not so much a sense of impatience as one of disquiet. It was still early yet,
 of course, and the hours, most likely of all the twenty-four for criminal activities,
 were still to come, but somehow the pig-like serenity of the fat Frenchman
 disturbed him.</p>
<p> Still the minutes dragged by. Another quarter of an hour passed. And then
 Jimmie Dale suddenly straightened up alertly. There was a footstep now on the
 stairs; and now it came along the hall. Jimmie Dale retreated a little from
 the door, his automatic in his hand.</p>
<p> It was one of the waiters from downstairs. The man passed into the other
 room.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go, monsieur,&rdquo; he heard the waiter say in
 French.</p>
<p> French Jeff, with a grunt, roused himself.</p>
<p> &ldquo;All right, Emile,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p> The waiter left the room and went downstairs again.</p>
<p> French Jeff spent a moment at his desk, then closed it down, picked up the
 black handbag from the chair, extinguished the light, and left the room.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stole out into the darkened corridor. French Jeff descended the
 stairs, and went out through the side door. Another minute and Jimmie Dale,
 too, had gained the street, and crossing to the opposite side took up the fat
 proprietor&rsquo;s trail.</p>
<p> It led to the nearest subway station, and an uptown train. French Jeff got
 off at the Grand Central Station, and Jimmie Dale followed. At a ticket window,
 French Jeff bought a ticket and berth on the midnight train for Boston. Jimmie
 Dale, for the first time in evidence, and now at the other&rsquo;s elbow, made
 exactly the same purchase&mdash;but on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips now there was
 a smile of almost self-pity.</p>
<p> &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going where I think I am,&rdquo; confided Jimmie Dale
 softly to himself, as he followed the other through the gates and to the Pullman, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll
 be a rather expensive ride for the mileage&mdash;but the gatemen are inviolable
 and the porter might not have stood for a bribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The berths in the car were all made up. The fat little Frenchman swished
 down the aisle, waddling after the porter. Jimmie Dale, finding his berth to
 be opposite that of French Jeff, sat down on the edge of it, and drew the curtains
 together in front of him. A few minutes passed. The train pulled out. A wry
 smile began to settle on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips&mdash;and at 125th Street
 it had hardened into lines of grim, unmirthful chagrin.</p>
<p> French Jeff had undressed and gone to bed, and the car was already reverberating
 to the fat man&rsquo;s snores.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale got off the train.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
  The Lair</b></h2>
<p> Tight-lipped, Jimmie Dale stared out at the black, flying walls as the subway
 train roared its way back to lower New York. He had been properly done! There
 could be no question about that. But by whom? And why? What did it mean? Intuition,
 even back there in The White Rat, had warned him that something was wrong,
 but he would in no way have been justified in being swayed wholly by intuition.
 He could not in justice blame himself for that. What was it? What was the meaning
 of it? Something <i>had</i> happened somewhere&mdash;but not at The White Rat. And
 he had been very neatly side-tracked. All that was obvious.</p>
<p> Was it Mother Margot? He shook his head. She had never yet double-crossed
 him, and he did not believe that she would dare to do so. Even her visit to
 the Sanctuary to-night, and her very evident wholesome respect for the Gray
 Seal, not to say fear, was almost proof in itself, it would seem, that she
 had not deliberately tried to mislead him.</p>
<p> What, then? There seemed to be only one logical explanation left. The Phantom.
 It would not have been altogether a new move on the Phantom&rsquo;s part, for,
 while not wholly analogous, the man had in a way tried the same game before.
 The Phantom knew only too well, and to his cost, that there had been a leak
 somewhere in his entourage, a leak that had brought the Gray Seal very inopportunely
 on his heels more than once. But to-night that entourage, in view of the fact
 that the rest were dead and that the Kitten was being hunted mercilessly by
 his own fellow crooks of the underworld, was reduced now to Mother Margot alone.
 Therefore, if the leak still existed, it must exist in the person of Mother
 Margot, and therefore, as a precautionary measure if nothing more, should the
 Phantom be up to some play to-night in which he particularly wanted to guard
 against any interference, he would logically turn the possibility that the
 leak still existed to his own advantage, and at the same time, perhaps, test
 out, and even trap, Mother Margot.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale grimly to himself. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s
 it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He nodded sharply. He had been side-tracked from his original plan to-night,
 but the night was not yet ended, and if he had the Phantom to thank for the
 bubble he had been chasing, the Phantom might yet have reason to remember to-night
 from another cause very different indeed! The phantom clue at Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 rooms was again his goal. The delay had mattered little. What he had meant
 to do as he had lain there on the cot in the Sanctuary, he meant to do now.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale looked at his watch, as he left the subway at Astor Place and
 headed into the Bowery. It was ten minutes to one. He walked quickly now. It
 was not far to those two tenements with the narrow areaway between, in one
 of which Mother Margot had lived since Gentleman Laroque, alias Isaac Shiftel,
 alias the Phantom, had so mysteriously made his escape from the room which
 the old hag now occupied; just a little lower down, a little off the Bowery,
 in one of the East Side&rsquo;s most unenviable neighbourhoods.</p>
<p> Five minutes brought him to his destination. It was quiet here, save for
 the distant sounds of night life from the Bowery, dark, deserted. A light showed
 sparsely here and there from a window&mdash;that was all. He passed the areaway
 between the two tenements, smiled grimly at the recollection of the officer
 who had stood guard therein beneath the window on the night the Phantom had
 escaped and he, Jimmie Dale, had been so nearly trapped, and slipped unobtrusively
 into the dark hallway of the further tenement.</p>
<p> A moment more and, masked, he stood listening, at the door of Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 rooms. There was no sound from within. Why should there be? Even if Mother
 Margot, according to her own story, had not been ordered somewhere else by
 the Phantom, she would not be here since he, Jimmie Dale, had warned her to
 keep away. There was no sound, but&mdash;the slim, sensitive fingers were working
 tentatively at the doorknob&mdash;this was a little strange. The door was unlocked!</p>
<p> It swung open now silently, an inch at a time, under his hand. He stepped
 inside and, as silently, closed the door behind him. It was black in here.
 He could not see a yard in front of him. But he was familiar, a little more
 than familiar, with his surroundings! He stole forward to the doorway connecting
 with the inner room, moving without sound, as Larry the Bat in the days of
 old in the old Sanctuary had moved, and paused on the threshold. It was from
 here those voices that other night had come; here was the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> of the phantom clue.</p>
<p> Again he listened. There was still no sound. Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s automatic
 was already in his hand, and now from his pocket he took out a flashlight.
 Still he waited another instant, listening; and then, the round, white ray
 stabbing through the blackness, Jimmie Dale, his face set hard and grim, his
 lips a straight line, stood staring at the wall opposite him.</p>
<p> The phantom clue was a phantom clue no longer. It lay there clothed in tangible,
 yes, even mocking, form, so blatantly did it flaunt now the disclosal of its
 own existence! The flashlight was boring into a great oblong-shaped opening
 through the wall.</p>
<p> Still Jimmie Dale stood motionless. Through his mind in swift, lightning
 flashes swept the oft-repeated admonition of both the Tocsin and Mother Margot.
 A trap. He had been told the place was a trap for him. Was the door of the
 trap open now&mdash;a little <i>too</i> invitingly open&mdash;the door he had never
 been able to find before, patiently and thoroughly though he had searched?
 Had this anything to do with what had gone before to-night, with the fool&rsquo;s
 errand upon which he had run to French Jeff and The White Rat? How could it
 have? And yet&mdash;</p>
<p> His eyes swept the opening, and the wall adjacent to it, above and on both
 sides. He understood now, of course. And it brought no sense of self-reproof
 that, though knowing it had existed somewhere here, he had not, in the times
 he had searched before, been able to find it. It was clever, ingenious, a replica
 almost of the old Crime Club with its false, movable walls, though here not
 nearly so elaborate&mdash;but perhaps even built by the same men, at that,
 as one of their outposts, since Clarke, alias Wizard Marre, who had been the
 Phantom&rsquo;s confederate in the murder of Jason Lane, had been a member
 of that original organisation. A dado of cheap, painted burlap at the height
 of some five feet ran around the room; this was surmounted by a wide moulding,
 and the whole divided into oblong panels by vertical, though narrower, strips
 of moulding again. It was one of these oblong sections that now had disappeared
 into the floor, disclosing an inner wall, that was obviously the real wall
 of the room, set back perhaps slightly more than two feet from the false wall
 with the dado. This made a little passageway within, so that while he, Jimmie
 Dale, might have tapped the entire length of the wall in an effort to discover
 the opening by the sense of sound, in no place would it have sounded <i>more</i> hollow
 than in any other; and, again, the mouldings covered the joints, and the section
 slid up and down behind them, so that unless they had been ripped off bodily
 it would have been impossible to&mdash;</p>
<p> His face grew harder. That was what he had meant to do to-night, <i>wreck</i> the
 room if necessary, throw the caution that before had actuated him to the winds;
 but to-night all lay there <i>open</i> before him, starkly, vauntingly open.
 It was obvious enough now. The section slid up and down through the floor and&mdash;<i>Up
 and down!</i> That was what Bunty Myers had said. But Bunty Myers had said too that
 <i>she</i> didn&rsquo;t know because it was in the next house. That passage there!
 Invitingly open now! It could only lead to one place then&mdash;the next house&mdash;and
 there was only one next house on this side. The other tenement! A trap! Well,
 he had come for this, hadn&rsquo;t he?&mdash;to find the trap, no matter what
 the consequences, no matter what the cost, if it would but bring him into touch
 with the Phantom.</p>
<p> He stepped forward now silently across the room, and, with his flashlight
 switched off, knelt down at the opening. The passage in there was very narrow,
 certainly quite long, and certainly inky black. One could therefore fairly
 expect that somewhere in the passage between here and the other tenement there
 would be a light; and if so, and if it were lighted now, it would disclose
 for the benefit of the &ldquo;quarry&rdquo; any &ldquo;trapper&rdquo; who might
 be lurking there. Also if there were a light it would naturally be readily
 accessible from the entrance here.</p>
<p> Half crouched, he leaned forward into the opening, and felt inside, up and
 down along the edges of the wall. His fingers encountered a switch button.
 He pressed it now&mdash;but instead of a light showing anywhere, the movable
 section of the wall under him began to rise. He jabbed at the switch quickly
 again, even as he flung himself clear of the opening, and then found that the
 section had receded once more to its original position below the level of the
 baseboard.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale drew in his breath sharply. So that was it! The thing was electrically
 controlled. That was plain enough, and from the <i>inside</i> there was no concealment
 of how it was set in motion; but how was it operated from within the room?
 He might not have been able in his several previous searches to have located
 the position of the opening, but he was quite certain that had there been a
 concealed switch, say, anywhere along the wall under the dado, or at the edges
 of the mouldings, he would have found it, for his fingers had felt over every
 inch of that space.</p>
<p> He shrugged his shoulders. Well, it didn&rsquo;t matter now, did it, since
 some one else had supplied the &ldquo;open sesame!&rdquo; And since there
 was no other light&mdash;</p>
<p> His body well back from the opening, he reached his hand inside, and, pointing
 his flashlight parallel with the passage in the direction of the other tenement,
 flung a beam of light along it. It brought no response; no answering shot,
 for example, that he had half expected. He risked more now. Flat on the floor,
 with head and shoulders this time inside the opening, the flashlight&rsquo;s
 ray shot out again. But this time he could see. What was at the other end he
 could not tell, but immediately in front of him the way was clear. A series
 of steps led downward, then seemed to reach a level, until, in perspective,
 from where he lay, the roof and the base of the passage merged together.</p>
<p> The passage, then, beyond surmise, led down under the narrow alleyway to
 the &ldquo;next house&rdquo;&mdash;the tenement which was the counterpart of
 this one here. He rose to his feet, and cautiously, without sound, moved forward,
 descending the steps. The passage was extremely narrow, his shoulders kept
 brushing the walls on either side.</p>
<p> At every few steps he stopped to listen. His flashlight was out now. When
 he moved it was the sense of touch alone that guided him. He reached a level.
 This would be the section of the tunnel directly under the areaway, of course.
 And now, as the series of steps began again, this time leading upward, a faint
 glow of light showed through the darkness, and for the first time his ear caught
 a sound&mdash;it was like a low, strange moaning.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale went down on his hands and knees now as he crawled upward. He
 would be less a target in that position, for it was obvious that the other
 end of the secret passage was open, and that the room or the space into which
 it opened was lighted&mdash;<i>and occupied</i>. Also, it was no longer a mystery
 where the voices had come from that had been heard in Mother Margot&rsquo;s
 rooms!</p>
<p> Noiselessly he reached the top step. Here the arrangement was the exact duplicate
 of the other end of the passage. A wall section was open, a lighted room beyond.
 The moaning, naturally more distinct now, continued unabated.</p>
<p> Cautiously Jimmie Dale edged forward until he could see into the room&mdash;and
 then, in an instant, he was on his feet and through the opening, and running
 toward a man&rsquo;s form that was stretched out on the floor.</p>
<p> The Kitten!</p>
<p> The man&rsquo;s face was gray with the pallor of approaching death, and there
 was a great crimson blotch over the left side of his shirt where the vest had
 been torn open, but he roused himself now with almost superhuman energy, staring
 in most strange eagerness and excitement at Jimmie Dale.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Who are youse?&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;Who in &lsquo;ell are youse
 wid dat mask on?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale gently. The man was
 dying; it needed no professional eye to discern that fact. The Kitten! Well,
 even the Kitten was a fellow-human. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he
 said again; &ldquo;let me try and make you more comfortable, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;It does matter!&rdquo; There was fierce insistence, so fierce that
 it was almost bizarre, in the man&rsquo;s gasping words. &ldquo;It matters
 more&rsquo;n anythin&rsquo; else whether a guy dat wears a mask is a friend
 of Laroque&rsquo;s or ain&rsquo;t. Youse can&rsquo;t do anythin&rsquo; for
 me. I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got but a few minutes left. If youse&rsquo;re a friend
 of Laroque&rsquo;s beat it out of here an&rsquo; leave me alone; if youse ain&rsquo;t,
 I got somethin&rsquo; to tell youse. Quick! Who are youse?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Gentleman Laroque, alias the Phantom! The Kitten the last remaining satellite!
 What did this mean? The man&rsquo;s mind was wandering, perhaps&mdash;and yet
 he seemed coherent enough.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d know me best,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale simply, &ldquo;as
 the Gray Seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Kitten struggled to his elbow.</p>
<p> &ldquo;De Gray Seal! Prove it! Prove it for de love of Gawd!&rdquo; he cried
 out wildly. &ldquo;Mabbe dey&rsquo;ve got him, but if dey ain&rsquo;t, youse
 will&mdash;if youse <i>are</i> de Gray Seal. Prove it!&rdquo;</p>
<p> There was something of vital, paramount moment here. The man seemed possessed
 of a hatred and fury that had given him, in his dying condition, an unnatural
 strength. From the leather girdle Jimmie Dale took out the thin, metallic case
 that was the receptacle of those diamond-shaped, gray-paper seals that had
 given him his name, and, lifting one out, held it up before the Kitten&rsquo;s
 eyes.</p>
<p> The man laughed. It seemed to carry a shudder in its depths. It echoed around
 the room in a strangled, horrible way.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; screamed the Kitten. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;re
 de guy dat&rsquo;s been after him for weeks. Youse&rsquo;re de guy he&rsquo;s
 afraid of. Mabbe dey&rsquo;ve got him, but I ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; no chances,
 for if dey ain&rsquo;t, youse will. Damn him! It was Laroque dat give me dis&mdash;in
 dere&mdash;in de passage. It was Laroque dat plugged me cold, an&mdash;&rdquo; He
 caught at his throat, choking, struggling for breath.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Laroque!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmie Dale tensely. &ldquo;Do you know
 what you are saying&mdash;that it was Gentleman Laroque who shot you?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Kitten clutched at Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s arm, dragging himself up again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, I know wot I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He was whispering
 hoarsely now. &ldquo;Listen! Mabbe youse heard I was up against it wid a gang
 dat was after me, mabbe youse didn&rsquo;t&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I
 hid since yesterday. To-night dey nosed me out, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I
 had to beat it for me life. I didn&rsquo;t have much start. I pinched a car,
 but dey got another&mdash;see? I didn&rsquo;t have nowheres to go but here,
 den&mdash;I thought Laroque&rsquo;d hide me&mdash;it was de only chance I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He fought for his breath, paused, and struggled on again, his words coming
 more thickly and with greater effort.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I left de car around de corner, an&rsquo; came in here. Laroque an&rsquo; Mother
 Margot was here. I&mdash;I was tellin&rsquo; &rsquo;em about it. I thought
 I&rsquo;d given de gang de slip. But I hadn&rsquo;t. Dey came smashin&rsquo; at
 de door. Laroque didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;, only he looked wicked when
 he jumped for de electric wall bracket an&rsquo; gave dat brass fittin&rsquo; against
 de wall a twist. Dat opened de door in de wall&mdash;see? &lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; he
 says den to Mother Margot an&rsquo; me. &lsquo;De two of youse! Quick!&rsquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;De gang was bustin&rsquo; in de door of de room by now, an&rsquo; dey
 saw us. We followed Laroque through de wall, an&rsquo; he pushes de switch
 inside an&rsquo; de wall closes up. It&mdash;it was black in dere. My Gawd,
 it was black! An&rsquo; Laroque kind of laughs. &lsquo;Dat was a close squeak,
 an&rsquo; mabbe we ain&rsquo;t safe yet,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Mother, youse
 an&rsquo; me&rsquo;ll go down to Blind Peter&rsquo;s, since de Kitten&rsquo;s
 been thoughtful enough to bring us a car; an&rsquo; youse, Kitten, youse&rsquo;ll
 go where youse deserves to go for takin&rsquo; any chance on givin&rsquo; me
 away.&rsquo; Just like dat he said it, an&rsquo; he was laughin&rsquo;. My
 Gawd, he was <i>laughin</i>&rsquo; all de time. &lsquo;Youse overrated de value of
 yer life, Kitten,&rsquo; he says, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; shot me&mdash;cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The man with a nervous grip that locked like a vise around Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s
 arm and shoulder, had heaved himself up into a sitting posture. His lips and
 face were working.</p>
<p> &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye understand?&rdquo; he choked.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale through tight lips.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; gasped the Kitten. &ldquo;Listen! I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t
 got much more time. He thought he&rsquo;d finished me. I&mdash;I guess I lost
 consciousness. Den I heard de gang in here poundin&rsquo; at de wall. Dey couldn&rsquo;t
 do me no more harm. I knew Laroque had put me out for keeps, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; he
 was goin&rsquo; to pay for it&mdash;see?&mdash;pay for it&mdash;pay for it.
 I crawled to de switch an&rsquo; opened de wall. Dey made a rush for me, but
 I gets a chance to speak. Dey thought I&rsquo;d got away wid some money last
 night&mdash;a&mdash;a black box&mdash;Banco Santos&mdash;but I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;I
 don&rsquo;t know no more&rsquo;n youse where it is&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Kitten&rsquo;s voice was growing weaker; his grip was loosening, the
 strength ebbing from his fingers.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I told &rsquo;em it was Laroque an&rsquo; de woman put up de whole
 plant, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; dat dey had de money, an&rsquo; dat I&rsquo;d
 only done wot Laroque told me&mdash;an&rsquo; de proof Laroque an&rsquo; Margot
 was in de game was dis hole in de wall an&rsquo; de passage&mdash;an&rsquo; dat
 dey was runnin&rsquo; for Blind Peter&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He caught at his throat. &ldquo;De
 gang went through de hole dere after Laroque&mdash;ten minutes ago&mdash;Blind
 Peter&rsquo;s&mdash;understand? Double chance&mdash;de Gray Seal&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em
 if Steenie don&rsquo;t&mdash;de Gray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale stood up. The Kitten was dead. For an instant he looked around
 him. He seemed most curiously to be possessed of two entities&mdash;one that
 rejoiced fiercely over what now seemed a certainty that the Phantom, either
 at the hands of the apaches that the Kitten in his dying vengeance had set
 upon the other, or, failing that, through himself, Jimmie Dale, would be finally
 and irrevocably trapped to-night; the other that looked out as through a strange
 veil of unreality upon his immediate surroundings. This was the Phantom&rsquo;s
 lair at the end of the phantom trail.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  Blind Peter&rsquo;s</b></h2>
<p> Jimmie Dale stepped swiftly across the room, and with a small steel jimmy
 which he took from his leather girdle, ripped aside, from where it fitted close
 against the wall, the round brass plaque or fitting, technically called the
 canopy, of the electric-light fixture. There was no time to lose, but he could
 spare an instant for this! Yes, it was as the Kitten had said. It concealed
 an electrical connection quite apart from the electric light itself; and by
 giving the canopy a half turn the contact could be made.</p>
<p> He nodded, as he turned now in a flash toward the window. He was satisfied.
 That was how the movable section of the wall was manipulated from within. And
 the window here, unless his calculations were hopelessly at fault, faced, exactly
 across the areaway, the window in Mother Margot&rsquo;s room. He raised the
 shade&mdash;and suddenly, with a low, suppressed cry, wrenched it down again,
 and leaped for the opening in the wall. In an instant he was inside, and, pressing
 the switch, the movable section had closed behind him.</p>
<p> The police! The window <i>did</i> face Mother Margot&rsquo;s, and, as there had
 been on the first night that he had come here, so too to-night an officer was
 lurking outside there now in the alleyway. The light streaming out from the
 window with the lifting shade had disclosed a man in uniform crouched against
 the wall. And also, even as he had wrenched back the shade, his ear had caught
 the muffled tread of several men in the hall outside the room. And that, too,
 was as it had been on the first occasion!</p>
<p> He ran now, his flashlight streaming ahead of him, through the tunnel, gained
 Mother Margot&rsquo;s room, and, indifferent now as to whether the movable
 section here was left closed or not, since it could in no way affect his own
 movements, and since the tunnel was now an open secret through its discovery
 by the apaches, he made no attempt to close it behind him; and, as he had done
 before when wary of the police here, he slipped out at the rear of the tenement,
 sped silently across the backyard in the darkness, and disappeared in the lane
 behind. And thereafter, keeping always when he could to the lanes and alleyways,
 grudging the sedate though crisp walk when forced out into the open, he went
 on at top speed.</p>
<p> But swiftly as he went, his mind ran the swifter. The police&mdash;not at
 Mother Margot&rsquo;s, but at that <i>other</i> tenement! His own escape had been
 a sinecure, thanks to the Phantom&rsquo;s secret passage. It would take the
 police some time to find that movable section in the room where the Kitten
 lay! But he did not understand. Why were the police there at all? They had
 not followed on the heels of the Kitten and the apaches, for in that case they
 would have been there much <i>sooner</i>. It was not the sound of the shot that the
 Phantom had fired, for that had been deadened inside the walls of the passage;
 nor did it seem possible that any other disturbance made there had been reported
 to them, say, by the inmates of the tenement, for in that case there would
 have been commotion amongst the tenants themselves, who would have been swarming
 about like bees. It was strange! The whole night was strange! He did not understand.</p>
<p> He ran on. The point was not vital. It was vital only that he should reach
 Blind Peter&rsquo;s without delay. Thank God, it wasn&rsquo;t far! But they
 had had ten minutes&rsquo; start, and it was almost certain that neither the
 Phantom nor the apaches had gone on foot. Blind Peter&rsquo;s! He was not so
 sure after all that men like Steenie Klotz and Red Jack would be able to trap
 the Phantom there. It was the <i>safest</i> place in the underworld if one knew its
 secrets, and on that score the Phantom had made no mistake. But Steenie Klotz
 and his followers were of the lesser breed, the hangers-on, the purely thug
 element, not of the &eacute;lite, not of the initiated, and Blind Peter&rsquo;s
 might well be to them but a name, a place whose mysteries were reserved for
 the upper strata of the criminal realm from which they themselves were far
 removed. It might well be&mdash;but against this was the fact that the underworld,
 its aristocracy and its proletariate alike, were behind Steenie Klotz and his
 companions in their determination to wreak vengeance upon the Kitten, and with
 the explanation made of why it was Gentleman Laroque now instead of the Kitten
 who was the object of this vengeance, the Phantom might find far else but sanctuary
 at Blind Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p> He did not know. He knew only that if he were in time the Phantom would not
 only find no safety there, but, forced to attempt flight again, would find
 no escape. And he would be in time! He <i>must</i> be!</p>
<p> It was the end! The end! The end! The words pounded over and over again at
 his brain, as he ran on. In either case, it was the end to-night. What Steenie
 Klotz and his pack might not know of Blind Peter&rsquo;s, he, Jimmie Dale,
 knew as perhaps few outside Blind Peter himself knew. It was the years of Larry
 the Bat, the years of Smarlinghue, the knowledge he had thus garnered, the
 height to which those alter ego characters of his had risen in the inner circles
 of Crimeland, that were bearing fruit now.</p>
<p> Yes, he knew Blind Peter&rsquo;s! Blind Peter was a very old and wizened
 little man of dark-skinned, doubtful origin, who wore spectacles with lenses
 that were coloured and that were of the thickness of heavy plate-glass, and
 who groped out with hands and stick when he walked&mdash;and who was not blind.
 He ran, supposedly, a small general store in one of a block of four houses
 in a neighbourhood that, to speak mildly, was unsavory at best. The other three
 houses were, supposedly again, lodging houses, and in a sense they were lodging
 houses, just as in a sense they were anything else one wished to call them.
 But Blind Peter owned them, and they had made Blind Peter rich&mdash;or, rather,
 a maze-like cavern of vice beneath their cellars had. Here, where sound never
 reached to the outer air, where the cellars above, rubbish-filled, were a benign
 and protecting mantle, toll from the lusts of the gaming table, toll from the
 overlords of crime who rented council chambers there, toll from the fear-stricken
 who had fled from daylight and the law, toll from every human weakness, was
 paid to Blind Peter. And, discreet beyond any of his ilk in the selection of
 his clientele, Blind Peter&rsquo;s place was safe. There was but one entrance
 and one exit&mdash;through the back of Blind Peter&rsquo;s store, where none
 might enter or depart except under the closest scrutiny.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale had halted. A queer smile twisted his lips. Was there? Well,
 in the old days there had been another entrance, guessed at by many, but known
 only to a few, of which he, as Larry the Bat then, had been one&mdash;and it
 was here. He was crouched in the darkness before a low basement door, that
 of the house in the block farthest away from Blind Peter&rsquo;s store. Behind
 him was a small backyard, and behind that again the lane. The door was locked
 of course. But his pick-lock was at work now; and now the door opened slowly,
 gradually, wary of a protesting creak.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale closed the door behind him without locking it, and descending
 a short flight of steps, stood still to listen. He was in the cellar now. He
 could hear nothing either from above or <i>below</i>. There would be no guard here.
 This entrance was for emergency only, a reserve margin of safety that Blind
 Peter held up his sleeve for himself and his intimates; it probably had not
 been used in months, and naturally any one using it at all was, in the very
 fact that the secret was in his possession, beyond the necessity of challenge.
 Besides, a guard of any kind would but scream out aloud to Blind Peter&rsquo;s
 entire clientele the fact that this entrance, or exit, existed. Nor would one
 entering by this means, if he took but ordinary precautions, blazon the existence
 of the entrance to those already below. Blind Peter was far, very far, from
 being a fool! Here in this cellar the entrance was craftily hidden; but below
 it was still more so.</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s flashlight winked through the blackness. He moved quickly
 forward to the far corner of the cellar. Rubbish, an untidy heap of kindling
 wood, the flotsam and jetsam of broken and discarded household effects littered
 the place. He worked rapidly now, brushing aside a thin, scattered layer of
 the kindling wood at the edge of the pile&mdash;and lifted up a small trap
 door.</p>
<p> It was black below, intensely black. The flashlight sent its ray streaming
 down a steep flight of steps&mdash;and went out. Jimmie Dale nodded sharply
 to himself. It was as it had always been. These steps led to the rear wooden
 wall&mdash;of a coal bin. But the coal bin would not be inconveniently full,
 and the front of it was quite open, and in the back of it a board or two could
 at a touch be moved aside.</p>
<p> He began to descend the steps cautiously. Across the narrow little chamber
 that contained the coal bin was a door leading into Blind Peter&rsquo;s unholy
 nest. And since that door must exist in order to make this exclusive entrance
 of any practical avail, a door the existence of which must almost of necessity
 be a matter of common knowledge to all who frequented Blind Peter&rsquo;s,
 that door itself must excite no suspicion. Therefore when it was opened it
 exhibited to all but the initiated in Blind Peter&rsquo;s nothing more than
 an apparently essential adjunct to the establishment&mdash;a storeroom that
 contained boxes of supplies, many of them, and a coal bin!</p>
<p> Almost down the steps now, Jimmie Dale paused suddenly&mdash;and as suddenly
 took the remaining ones at a leap. Dull, muffled, the report of a revolver
 shot had reached his ears. It was echoed by another&mdash;still another. The
 flashlight was in play again. Those boards! Yes, here they were! He moved them
 aside&mdash;and stepped through into the coal bin, so innocently almost empty.</p>
<p> The coal rattled a little under his feet, but the sound was drowned out now
 by shouts that added their quota of muffled uproar to the quickened reports
 of the revolver shots&mdash;and the sounds were coming nearer, nearer to that
 door there that opened into this supposed storeroom. The Phantom and the apaches!
 It could be nothing else! Steenie Klotz had gained admittance&mdash;the law
 of the underworld was at work. Blind Peter had evidently not dared oppose it.
 Did the Phantom know of the existence of this exit? A trapped rat, was he fighting
 for escape this way?</p>
<p> Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s lips were a thin line. Well, the Phantom would <i>not</i> escape
 this way! Whatever the penalty that he, Jimmie Dale, might pay, the Phantom&rsquo;s
 career ended to-night. That was what he was here for. No matter what happened
 to himself, the price would be a small and pitiful thing to pay. To-morrow,
 no, to-night, the Tocsin, the woman he loved, she who in her great unselfish
 courage, aye and her love, had chosen to risk death alone, to fight out her
 fight alone that he too might not be sacrificed, would be free, free from peril,
 free to live in God&rsquo;s sunshine as&mdash;</p>
<p> He was at the door now. The sounds from the other side had risen into almost
 riot noise. The panel here&mdash;it used to move a little so that one intending
 entrance might first satisfy himself that he was not observed. Yes, it still
 moved&mdash;the space of a few inches.</p>
<p> He could see through&mdash;into a small room, garishly appointed, its roof
 supported by ornamental rafters from which hung several lanterns of curious,
 antique design, its walls draped with oriental hangings, the whole furnished
 in a sort of barbaric luxury. It was Blind Peter&rsquo;s private retreat&mdash;and
 naturally again offered a further bulwark and protection against the detection
 of the hidden entrance.</p>
<p> The door opening out on the other side of this room and directly opposite
 the one behind which Jimmie Dale stood was closed, but now suddenly it burst
 open. Shots, yells, curses, rose crescendo in a hideous uproar. A figure reeled
 in, stumbled, fell upon its knees, and began to drag itself away from the threshold.
 The old hag! Mother Margot! But Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s eyes rested for but an
 instant on her. There was another figure, the figure of a man, on the threshold
 itself now, a man at bay, fighting, pumping his shots from his automatic, cursing
 as he fought&mdash;Gentleman Laroque, alias Isaac Shiftel, alias Limpy Mack,
 alias the Phantom!</p>
<p> Outside, beyond that door, Jimmie Dale could not see. He could only hear&mdash;above
 the shots&mdash;the oaths and yells from, it seemed, a multitude of throats,
 like the screech of beasts, like animals giving tongue to a blood lust that
 was upon them.</p>
<p> It was very plain! They had dug the Phantom out of wherever he had been in
 hiding in Blind Peter&rsquo;s here, and had driven him in a running fight to
 the end of the chain of underground rooms and passages. It was the end! The
 Phantom could go no further&mdash;<i>save through the door behind which he,
 Jimmie Dale, stood</i>. And through that door the Phantom, for the Tocsin&rsquo;s sake,
 would never pass while he, Jimmie Dale, lived!</p>
<p> The end! Yes&mdash;but it was ending there on the threshold now. The Phantom
 half spun around, and screamed as a bullet struck him, made a desperate effort
 to slam shut the door and, instead, crumpled to the floor.</p>
<p> A strange, queer look was on Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s face. His jaws were clamped,
 his features set like iron. The end! Well, he could go now. Go the way he had
 come&mdash;unseen. It was over! The Tocsin was free. And <i>he</i> too was free, free
 of hurt or harm, free to the years that stretched ahead where only love and
 happiness should hold sway, and the&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Kill &rsquo;em!...Bump &rsquo;em both off!...The cursed snitches....&rdquo;</p>
<p> Shots seemed to be still pouring a leaden hail into the prostrate form of
 the Phantom on the threshold, as he lay there, sprawled out, a dead thing now.
 Then a rush! Faces appeared at the doorway&mdash;Steenie&rsquo;s! The man levelled
 his revolver at the old hag on the floor as she crawled for protection toward
 the end of a sort of divan at the side of the room.</p>
<p> The mind works swiftly, swift beyond all measure of time. She was only an
 old hag, an abandoned thing steeped in her crimes, the last of the Phantom&rsquo;s
 satellites&mdash;all the rest had gone&mdash;it was justice that she should
 go too. What had he to do with it? The road to life and happiness lay the other
 way. Suppose she was a woman, suppose it <i>was</i> murder that would be done in the
 next second, what had he to do with it! What had&mdash;</p>
<p> Through the opening in the panel Jimmie Dale fired. The revolver in Steenie
 Klotz&rsquo;s outstretched hand clattered to the floor, and the man with a
 yell of mingled pain, fury and surprise leaped back from the open doorway&mdash;and
 with him, from this new attack, the others took hasty cover, leaving the doorway
 clear again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quick! This way, Mother Margot.&rdquo; Jimmie Dale called out sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
 stand up! Crawl!&rdquo;</p>
<p> He fired steadily, coolly, sweeping the opposite doorway with his bullets&mdash;working
 with pick-lock in his other hand at the door behind which he stood. The old
 hag came crawling, weakly it seemed, across the floor, nearer and nearer to
 him. The shots were pouring into the room again&mdash;but they were coming
 at an angle. He laughed a little&mdash;without mirth. Steenie Klotz and his
 men were crouched on both sides of the door casing out there beyond, of course,
 and they could not fire in a direct line now without exposing themselves. But
 how much could they see? The danger would come when he opened the door for
 Mother Margot, and when he could not for the moment command the other doorway.</p>
<p> It would be a race for it then&mdash;nothing else.</p>
<p> &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; an inner voice snarled at him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
 you know the Phantom is dead! You fool, to have risked this now! You poor,
 feeble, quixotic fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The old hag was close to the door now. He called to her again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;When I open the door, jump for it!&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;Are
 you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p> He caught a faint, affirmative reply. He fired at the opposite doorway again,
 then closed the panel; and then with a sudden wrench pulled the door before
 him halfway open; and, as Mother Margot scurried through, he flung it shut
 again, locked it, and reaching out in the darkness for the old hag, jerked
 her forward, making for the rear of the coal bin. She staggered weakly, making
 a strange, half crooning noise. If he could win behind the bin to the stairs,
 there would be comparative safety, time enough at least to get to the lane
 above. Blind Peter, if he, Jimmie Dale, knew the man at all, having profound
 respect for his own skin, would not be taking a <i>personal</i> part in the fight,
 and those apaches back there would certainly never find the opening until they
 had gone for Blind Peter and had either persuaded or forced him to disclose
 it.</p>
<p> An age of time seemed to have passed, though he had reached the rear of the
 bin now. And now the boards swung back&mdash;but they were smashing at the
 door behind, battering at it, raining blows upon it. Just an instant more&mdash;if
 the door would hold for but an instant more, so that when the light poured
 in they would not <i>see!</i></p>
<p> She was slow&mdash;God, how slow she was! He pushed her roughly through the
 opening, and sprang quickly after her. And as he swung the boards back into
 place, he heard the door crash open. But he was safe now&mdash;safe for a moment
 anyhow.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Quick! The stairs! Right ahead of you!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p> But there was no answer. He stretched out his hand, groping down and around
 him. Mother Margot lay an inert heap at his feet. His jaws shut with a snap.
 Where was his margin of safety now? She was either hurt or wounded, or had
 fainted, and&mdash;</p>
<p> &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; snarled that inner voice again, as he picked the
 old hag up in his arms, and began to climb the stairs.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  The Port Of Dawn</b></h2>
<p> Muffled voices reached Jimmie Dale&rsquo;s ears from below. He staggered
 on upward, making what speed he could. It was not easy with this burden in
 his arms. In the darkness he gained the cellar; and from the cellar emerged
 on the small backyard, and thence on the lane.</p>
<p> Here, he drew a great, gasping breath of relief. He was safe so far, but
 he had still to get away from the immediate vicinity of that cellar entranceway.
 Blind Peter, at any moment, might solve the problem for Steenie Klotz and his
 pack!</p>
<p> He went on again, running heavily, lurching under his load. Thank God for
 the darkness! He looked, as he ran, for some place of shelter or hiding. He
 could not go out into the open street with Mother Margot unconscious in his
 arms&mdash;certainly not anywhere in <i>this</i> neighbourhood; nor could he run on
 indefinitely like this, whether by lane or street.</p>
<p> Fifty yards, a hundred he covered. There were no sounds of pursuit, and now
 he had no further anxiety on that score, for he was already too far away for
 them to pick up the trail if he could only find temporary cover somewhere until
 Mother Margot&rsquo;s condition, which must necessarily govern his future movements,
 could be&mdash;</p>
<p> She was stirring in his arms now uneasily, commencing to mutter incoherent
 words. He kept straining his eyes to right and left as he ran&mdash;and suddenly
 swerved close up against the left-hand side of the fence. This would do admirably.
 He could ask for nothing better. There was a shed here, or an outhouse of some
 kind. He laid Mother Margot down, worked swiftly for a moment with the door
 lock, then picking her up again carried her inside and laid her upon the floor.</p>
<p> But now, her senses evidently almost fully back, she raised herself quickly
 to her elbow, and tried to struggle to her feet.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale reassuringly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
 safe now. Are you badly hurt? Let me see.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He bent down and played his flashlight upon her&mdash;and like a man dazed
 and stunned then stood swaying on his feet. The flashlight trembled in his
 hand, throwing wavering beams across the floor. And then he was on his knees,
 and with a great cry he had gathered her into his arms, and was calling out
 hoarsely, calling her name over and over, a man unhinged, almost, with the
 mad uplift that had surged upon him.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Marie&mdash;it&rsquo;s you! The Tocsin! Marie! Marie!&rdquo;</p>
<p> The hooded shawl had fallen from her, the gray, tangled wig was awry. The
 Tocsin! Marie! And he had not known&mdash;he had known only that in some character
 here in the underworld she had been bravely striving to fight out her battle
 alone&mdash;just as she once had as Silver Mag. Silver Mag! Mother Margot!
 And he had thought that Smarlinghue was unknown to Mother Margot!</p>
<p> She was crying softly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;dear Jimmie, I&mdash;I was afraid
 that I was saying good-by to you for&mdash;for always in the Sanctuary to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> He held her closely. His face was buried in her hair. His shoulders heaved&mdash;as
 though a strong man sobbed. It was a long while before he answered her.</p>
<p> &ldquo;I know. I know now,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
 understand then. How could I? I had investigated Mother Margot and she had
 been in existence long before you left me that night in the boat on the East
 River. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that I might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> She stroked his face with her hand, very gently, very tenderly.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I was always Mother Margot&mdash;after
 Silver Mag. I was Mother Margot when they forced me into hiding the time before
 this. Don&rsquo;t you remember in the boat, Jimmie, that I would not tell you
 even then, even when Clarke was dead and you thought everything was all right
 again, how or where I had lived all through that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale; and then, with a quick,
 anxious cry: &ldquo;And I remember now that you&rsquo;ve been hurt, wounded,
 I am afraid, and need&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, and shook her head. &ldquo;It is true that I
 was hit with something, a heavy stool that one of those gangsters threw when
 the fight first started at the upper end of Blind Peter&rsquo;s cellars, and
 it made me a little dizzy and giddy perhaps. But I am not hurt. I am afraid
 I only fainted, Jimmie, just&mdash;just like a woman.&rdquo; She laughed a
 little, bravely, tremulously, as she looked around her. &ldquo;I know you said
 we were safe now, and I know that the Phantom is dead, but I&rsquo;m all right
 again, and I&rsquo;m able to go on. We can&rsquo;t be very far away from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safer here just now, quite safe,&rdquo; Jimmie Dale answered. &ldquo;If
 we went out we might only invite a chase and have to run for it, and you haven&rsquo;t
 got your strength back yet. And&rdquo;&mdash;he too laughed a little tremulously
 now&mdash;&ldquo;besides I want you&mdash;like this, Marie&mdash;like this
 for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Her head was on his shoulder now. He brushed back the hair from her forehead,
 and kissed her, and laid his face against hers.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Like this.&rdquo; Her voice broke a little. &ldquo;God is very good,
 Jimmie. I&mdash;I did not dare to hope that it would be like this when I sent
 you to The White Rat to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;That was a plant!&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale a little ruefully. &ldquo;Why
 did you send me there?&rdquo;</p>
<p> She drew slightly away from him so that she could lift her hands and clasp
 and hold his face between them.</p>
<p> &ldquo;What else could I do, Jimmie?&rdquo; she said with a catch in her
 voice. &ldquo;You&mdash;you were so persistent. I had to get rid of you. I
 knew you were going to those rooms to-night&mdash;you had told me so. Well,
 the Phantom, or the Voice, had ordered me to be in the hallway of the other
 tenement at half past twelve. I knew then that there must be some connection
 between the two tenements, which would account for the voices that I had heard
 when I had been alone in the rooms where I was supposed to live. But I didn&rsquo;t
 know how, or where. It was certain, though, that if the Phantom brought me
 that far to-night, he would bring me all the way&mdash;you see, he was at the
 end of his rope nearly; there were only the Kitten and myself left. Well, I
 meant to end it to-night with the help of the police, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;The police!&rdquo; Jimmie Dale smiled strangely. &ldquo;It was you,
 then, who were accountable for the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I had first to get you out of the
 road, or you would almost certainly have been trapped in those rooms either
 by the Phantom or the police. I hadn&rsquo;t the least idea of what French
 Jeff might be doing to-night, but his reputation made him a likely subject
 for <i>anything</i>, and I felt sure that once set on his trail with the idea that
 the Phantom was mixed up in it too, you would watch him until something happened&mdash;which,
 since I expected nothing to happen, would mean all night. I don&rsquo;t see
 why you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;He went to bed on the midnight train to Boston,&rdquo; said Jimmie
 Dale grimly.</p>
<p> She laughed a little now, still holding his face captive with her hands;
 and then abruptly her voice was grave and serious again.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Just before going to the <i>other</i> tenement at half past twelve,&rdquo; she
 said, &ldquo;I notified the police to be there at one o&rsquo;clock&mdash;if
 they wanted Isaac Shiftel; and that if they came before they would only ruin
 their one chance of getting their man. I needed that half hour to find out
 all I could, to get to the bottom of the Phantom&rsquo;s secret, or to make
 sure at least of where he lived in that other tenement, so that there could
 be no possible means of escape for him; and I wanted that much time in case
 he was late in keeping his appointment, and so that I would be sure to be with
 him and make sure that he did <i>not</i> escape. I&mdash;I am not sure that I expected
 to&mdash;to live through it myself. If he had any suspicion aroused it&mdash;&rdquo; Her
 voice broke suddenly. &ldquo;But&mdash;but he hadn&rsquo;t, Jimmie, and&mdash;and
 you must know what happened afterward since you, too, went to Blind Peter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie Dale simply. &ldquo;I know. And I know a
 great deal more now. I know now that the night I caught you, as I thought,
 double-crossing Limpy Mack, you were trying to save what you could of old Mrs.
 Kinsey&rsquo;s money. And I understand now that the reason you did not know
 when I was wounded was because it happened at the time when you, as Mother
 Margot, were away. And that night in the tunnel at Morley&rsquo;s place, when
 you wouldn&rsquo;t let me show any light or come near you, you were Mother
 Margot, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Yes, Jimmie,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p> For a moment he was silent, and then suddenly he cried out, and in his voice
 was the yearning of the days and weeks when it had seemed this moment could
 never be:</p>
<p> &ldquo;Marie!...Marie!...Marie!...&rdquo;</p>
<p> He was holding her close to him again, his arms around her, her face against
 his own. And neither spoke now. Here in the shed it was very dark and very
 silent; but radiant in their souls was the glad sunrise of a new life, and
 in their hearts was song, like the song of springtime, a song of great joy,
 and of peace.</p>
<p> For they had come at last to the Port of Dawn.</p>
