<hr>

<p class="letter">IT WAS THE stealthy clink of steel on stone that
wakened Gordon. In the dim starlight a shadowy bulk loomed over him
and something glinted in the lifted hand. Gordon went into action
like a steel spring uncoiling. His left hand checked the descending
wrist with its curved knife, and simultaneously he heaved upward
and locked his right hand savagely on a hairy throat.</p>

<p class="letter">A gurgling gasp was strangled in that throat and
Gordon, resisting the other's terrific plunges, hooked a leg about
his knee and heaved him over and underneath. There was no sound
except the rasp and thud of straining bodies. Gordon fought, as
always, in grim silence. No sound came from the straining lips of
the man beneath. His right hand writhed in Gordon's grip while his
left tore futilely at the wrist whose iron fngers drove deeper and
deeper into the throat they grasped. That wrist felt like a mass of
woven steel wires to the weakening fingers that clawed at it.
Grimly Gordon maintained his position, driving all the power of his
compact shoulders and corded arms into his throttling fingers. He
knew it was his life or that of the man who had crept up to stab
him in the dark. In that unmapped corner of the Afghan mountains
all fights were to the death. The tearing fingers relaxed. A
convulsive shudder ran through the great body straining beneath the
American. It went limp.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. The Oiled Silk Package</h2>

<p>GORDON SLID OFF the corpse, in the deeper shadow of the great
rocks among which he had been sleeping. Instinctively he felt under
his arm to see if the precious package for which he had staked his
life was still safe. Yes, it was there, that flat bundle of papers
wrapped in oiled silk, that meant life or death to thousands. He
listened. No sound broke the stillness. About him the slopes with
their ledges and boulders rose gaunt and black in the starlight. It
was the darkness before the dawn.</p>

<p>But he knew that men moved about him, out there among the rocks.
His ears, whetted by years in wild places, caught stealthy
sounds&mdash;the soft rasp of cloth over stones, the faint shuffle
of sandalled feet. He could not see them, and he knew they could
not see him, among the clustered boulders he had chosen for his
sleeping site.</p>

<p>His left hand groped for his rifle, and he drew his revolver
with his right. That short, deadly fight had made no more noise
than the silent knifing of a sleeping man might have made.
Doubtless his stalkers out yonder were awaiting some signal from
the man they had sent in to murder their victim.</p>

<p>Gordon knew who these men were. He knew their leader was the man
who had dogged him for hundreds of miles, determined he should not
reach India with that silk-wrapped packet. Francis Xavier Gordon
was known by repute from Stamboul to the China Sea. The Muhammadans
called him El Borak, the Swift, and they feared and respected him.
But in Gustav Hunyadi, renegade and international adventurer,
Gordon had met his match. And he knew now that Hunyadi, out there
in the night, was lurking with his Turkish killers. They had
ferreted him out, at last.</p>

<p>Gordon glided out from among the boulders as silently as a great
cat. No hillman, born and bred among those crags, could have
avoided loose stones more skillfully or picked his way more
carefully. He headed southward, because that was the direction in
which lay his ultimate goal. Doubtless he was completely
surrounded.</p>

<p>His soft native sandals made no noise, and in his dark hillman's
garb he was all but invisible. In the pitch-black shadow of an
overhanging cliff, he suddenly sensed a human presence ahead of
him. A voice hissed, a European tongue framing the Turki words:
"Ali! Is that you? Is the dog dead? Why did you not call me?"</p>

<p>Gordon struck savagely in the direction of the voice. His pistol
barrel crunched glancingly against a human skull, and a man groaned
and crumpled. All about rose a sudden clamor of voices, the rasp of
leather on rock. A stentorian voice began shouting, with a note of
panic.</p>

<p>Gordon cast stealth to the winds. With a bound he cleared the
writhing body before him, and sped off down the slope. Behind him
rose a chorus of yells as the men in hiding glimpsed his shadowy
figure racing through the starlight. Jets of orange cut the
darkness, but the bullets whined high and wide. Gordon's flying
shape was sighted but an instant, then the shadowy gulfs of the
night swallowed it up. His enemies raved like foiled wolves in
their bewildered rage. Once again their prey had slipped like an
eel through their fingers and was gone.</p>

<p>So thought Gordon as he raced across the plateau beyond the
clustering cliffs. They would be hot after him, with hillmen who
could trail a wolf across naked rocks, but with the start he
had&mdash;Even with the thought the earth gaped blackly before him.
Even his steel-trap quickness could not save him. His grasping
hands caught only thin air as he plunged downward, to strike his
head with stunning force at the bottom.</p>

<p>When he regained his senses a chill dawn was whitening the sky.
He sat up groggily and felt his head, where a large lump was
clotted with dried blood. It was only by chance that his neck was
not broken. He had fallen into a ravine, and during the precious
time he should have employed in flight, he was lying senseless
among the rocks at the bottom.</p>

<p>Again he felt for the packet under his native shirt, though he
knew it was fastened there securely. Those papers were his
death-warrant, which only his skill and wit could prevent being
executed. Men had laughed when Francis Xavier Gordon had warned
them that the devil's own stew was bubbling in Central Asia, where
a satanic adventurer was dreaming of an outlaw empire.</p>

<p>To prove his assertion, Gordon had gone into Turkestan, in guise
of a wandering Afghan. Years spent in the Orient had given him the
ability to pass himself for a native anywhere. He had secured proof
no one could ignore or deny, but he had been recognized at last. He
had fled for his life, and for more than his life, then. And
Hunyadi, the renegade who plotted the destruction of nations, was
hot on his heels. He had followed Gordon across the steppes,
through the foothills, and up into the mountains where he had
thought at last to throw him off. But he had failed. The Hungarian
was a human bloodhound. Wary, too, as shown by his sending his
craftiest slayer in to strike a blow in the dark.</p>

<p>Gordon found his rifle and began the climb out of the ravine.
Under his left arm was proof that would make certain officials wake
up and take steps to prevent the atrocious thing that Gustav
Hunyadi planned. The proof was in the form of letters to various
Central Asian chiefs, signed and sealed with the Hungarian's own
hand. They revealed his whole plot to embroil Central Asia in a
religious war and send howling hordes of fanatics against the
Indian border. It was a plan for plundering on a staggering scale.
That package must reach Fort Ali Masjid! With all his iron will
Francis Xavier Gordon was determined it should. With equal
resolution Gustav Hunyadi was determined it should not. In the
clash of two such indomitable temperaments, kingdoms shake and
death reaps a red harvest.</p>

<p>Dirt crumbled and pebbles rattled down as Gordon worked his way
up the sloping side of the ravine. But presently he clambered over
the edge and cast a quick look about him. He was on a narrow
plateau, pitched among giant slopes which rose somberly above it.
To the south showed the mouth of a narrow gorge, walled by rocky
cliffs. In that direction he hurried.</p>

<p>He had not gone a dozen steps when a rifle cracked behind him.
Even as the wind of the bullet fanned his cheek, Gordon dropped
flat behind a boulder, a sense of futility tugging at his heart. He
could never escape Hunyadi. This chase would end only when one of
them was dead. In the increasing light he saw figures moving among
the boulders along the slopes of the northwest of the plateau. He
had lost his chance of escaping under cover of darkness, and now it
looked like a finish fight.</p>

<p>He thrust forward his rifle barrel. Too much to hope that that
blind blow in the dark had killed Hunyadi. The man had as many
lives as a cat. A bullet splattered on the boulder close to his
elbow. He had seen a tongue of flame lick out, marking the spot
where the sniper lurked. He watched those rocks, and when a head
and part of an arm and shoulder came up with a rifle, Gordon fired.
It was a long shot, but the man reared upright and pitched forward
across the rock that had sheltered him.</p>

<p>More bullets came, spattering Gordon's refuge. Up on the slopes,
where the big boulders poised breathtakingly, he saw his enemies
moving like ants, wriggling from ledge to ledge. They were spread
out in a wide ragged semi-circle, trying to surround him again. He
did not have enough ammunition to stop them. He dared shoot only
when fairly certain of scoring a hit. He dared not make a break for
the gorge behind him. He would be riddled before he could reach it.
It looked like trail's end for him, and while Gordon had faced
death too often to fear it greatly, the thought that those papers
would never reach their destination filled him with black
despair.</p>

<p>A bullet whining off his boulder from a new angle made him
crouch lower, seeking the marksman. He glimpsed a white turban,
high up on the slope, above the others. From that position the Turk
could drop bullets directly into Gordon's covert.</p>

<p>The American could not shift his position, because a dozen other
rifles nearer at hand were covering it; and he could not stay where
he was. One of those dropping slugs would find him sooner or later.
But the Ottoman decided that he saw a still better position, and
risked a shift, trusting to the long uphill range. He did not know
Gordon as Hunyadi knew him.</p>

<p>The Hungarian, further down the slope, yelled a fierce command,
but the Turk was already in motion, headed for another ledge, his
garments flapping about him. Gordon's bullet caught him in
mid-stride. With a wild cry he staggered, fell headlong and crashed
against a poised boulder. He was a heavy man, and the impact of his
hurtling body toppled the rock from its unstable base. It rolled
down the slope, dislodging others as it came. Dirt rattled in
widening streams about it.</p>

<p>Men began recklessly to break cover. Gordon saw Hunyadi spring
up and run obliquely across the slope, out of the path of the
sliding rocks. The tall supple figure was unmistakable, even in
Turkish garb. Gordon fired and missed, as he always seemed to miss
the man, and then there was no time to fire again. The whole slope
was in motion now, thundering down in a bellowing, grinding torrent
of stones and dirt and boulders. The Turks were fleeing after
Hunyadi, screaming: "Ya Allah!"</p>

<p>Gordon sprang up and raced for the mouth of the gorge. He did
not look back. He heard above the roaring, the awful screams that
marked the end of men caught and crushed and ground to bloody
shreds under the rushing tons of shale and stone. He dropped his
rifle. Every ounce of extra burden counted now. A deafening roar
was in his ears as he gained the mouth of the gorge and flung
himself about the beetling jut of the cliff. He crouched there,
flattened against the wall, and through the gorge mouth roared a
welter of dirt and rocks, boulders bouncing and tumbling,
rebounding thunderously from the sides and hurtling on down the
sloping pass. Yet, it was a only a trickle of the avalanche which
was diverted into the gorge. The main bulk of it thundered on down
the mountain.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. The Rescue of Bardylis of
Attalus</h2>

<p>GORDON PULLED AWAY from the cliff that had sheltered him. He
stood knee deep in loose dirt and broken stones. A flying splinter
of stone had cut his face. The roar of the landslide was followed
by an unearthly silence. Looking back on to the plateau, he saw a
vast litter of broken earth, shale and rocks. Here and there an arm
or a leg protruded, bloody and twisted, to mark where a human
victim had been caught by the torrent. Of Hunyadi and the survivors
there was no sign.</p>

<p>But Gordon was a fatalist where the satanic Hungarian was
concerned. He felt quite sure that Hunyadi had survived, and would
be upon his trail again as soon as he could collect his demoralized
followers. It was likely that he would recruit the natives of these
hills to his service. The man's power among the followers of Islam
was little short of marvelous.</p>

<p>So Gordon turned hurriedly down the gorge. Rifle, pack of
supplies, all were lost. He had only the garments on his body and
the pistol at his hip. Starvation in these barren mountains was a
haunting threat, if he escaped being butchered by the wild tribes
which inhabited them. There was about one chance in ten thousand of
his ever getting out alive. But he had known it was a desperate
quest when he started, and long odds had never balked Francis
Xavier Gordon, once of El Paso, Texas, and now for years soldier of
fortune in the outlands of the world.</p>

<p>The gorge twisted and bent between tortuous walls. The split-off
arm of the avalanche had quickly spent its force there, but Gordon
still saw the slanting floor littered with boulders which had
stumbled down from the higher levels. And suddenly he stopped
short, his pistol snapping to a level.</p>

<p>On the ground before him lay a man such as he had never seen in
the Afghan mountains or elsewhere. He was young, but tall and
strong, clad in short silk breeches, tunic and sandals, and girdled
with a broad belt which supported a curved sword.</p>

<p>His hair caught Gordon's attention. Blue eyes, such as the youth
had, were not uncommon in the hills. But his hair was yellow, bound
to his temples with a band of red cloth, and falling in a
square-cut mane nearly to his shoulders. He was clearly no Afghan.
Gordon remembered tales he had heard of a tribe living somewhere in
these mountains who were neither Afghans nor Muhammadans. Had he
stumbled upon a member of that legendary race?</p>

<p>The youth was vainly trying to draw his sword. He was pinned
down by a boulder which had evidently caught him as he raced for
the shelter of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Slay me and be done with it, you Moslem dog!" he gritted in
Pushtu.</p>

<p>"I won't harm you," answered Gordon. "I'm no Moslem. Lie still.
I'll help you if I can. I have no quarrel with you."</p>

<p>The heavy stone lay across the youth's leg in such a way that he
could not extricate the member.</p>

<p>"Is your leg broken?" Gordon asked.</p>

<p>"I think not. But if you move the stone it will grind it to
shreds."</p>

<p>Gordon saw that he spoke the truth. A depression on the under
side of the stone had saved the youth's limb, while imprisoning it.
If he rolled the boulder either way, it would crush the member.</p>

<p>"I'll have to lift it straight up," he grunted.</p>

<p>"You can never do it," said the youth despairingly. "Ptolemy
himself could scarecely lift it, and you are not nearly so big as
he."</p>

<p>Gordon did not pause to inquire who Ptolemy might be, nor to
explain that strength is not altogether a matter of size alone. His
own thews were like masses of knit steel wires.</p>

<p>Yet he was not at all sure that he could lift that boulder,
which, while not so large as many which rolled down the gorge, was
yet bulky enough to make the task look dubious. Straddling the
prisoner's body, he braced his legs wide, spread his arms and
gripped the big stone. Putting all his corded sinews and his
scientific knowledge of weight-lifting into his effort, he uncoiled
his strength in a smooth, mighty expansion of power.</p>

<p>His heels dug into the dirt, the veins in his temples swelled,
and unexpected knots of muscles sprang out on his straining arms.
But the great stone came up steadily without a jerk or waver, and
the man on the ground drew his leg clear and rolled away.</p>

<p>Gordon let the stone fall and stepped back, shaking the
perspiration from his face. The other worked his skinned, bruised
leg gingerly, then looked up and extended his hand in a curiously
un-oriental gesture.</p>

<p>"I am Bardylis of Attalus," he said. "My life is yours!"</p>

<p>"Men call me El Borak," answered Gordon, taking his hand. They
made a strong contrast: the tall, rangy youth in his strange garb,
with his white skin and yellow hair, and the American, shorter,
more compactly built, in his tattered Afghan garments, and his
sun-darkened skin. Gordon's hair was straight and black as an
Indian's, and his eyes were black as his hair.</p>

<p>"I was hunting on the cliffs," said Bardylis. "I heard shots and
was going to investigate them, when I heard the roar of the
avalanche and the gorge was filled with flying rocks. You are no
Pathan, despite your name. Come to my village. You look like a man
who is weary and has lost his way."</p>

<p>"Where is your village?"</p>

<p>"Yonder, down the gorge and beyond the cliffs." Bardylis pointed
southward. Then, looking over Gordon's shoulder, he cried out.
Gordon wheeled. High up on the beetling gorge wall, a turbaned head
was poked from behind a ledge. A dark face stared down wildly.
Gordon ripped out his pistol with a snarl, but the face vanished
and he heard a frantic voice yelling in guttural <i>Turki</i>. Other
voices answered, among which the American recognized the strident
accents of Gustav Hunyadi. The pack was at his heels again.
Undoubtedly they had seen Gordon take refuge in the gorge, and as
soon as the boulders ceased tumbling, had traversed the torn slope
and followed the cliffs where they would have the advantage of the
man below.</p>

<p>But Gordon did not pause to ruminate. Even as the turbaned head
vanished, he wheeled with a word to his companion, and darted
around the next bend in the canyon. Bardylis followed without
question, limping on his bruised leg, but moving with sufficient
alacrity. Gordon heard his pursuers shouting on the cliff above and
behind him, heard them crashing recklessly through stunted bushes,
dislodging pebbles as they ran, heedless of everything except their
desire to sight their quarry.</p>

<p>Although the pursuers had one advantage, the fugitives had
another. They could follow the slightly slanting floor of the gorge
more swiftly than the others could run along the uneven cliffs,
with their broken edges and jutting ledges. They had to climb and
scramble, and Gordon heard their maledictions growing fainter in
the distance behind him. When they emerged from the further mouth
of the gorge, they were far in advance of Hunyadi's killers.</p>

<p>But Gordon knew that the respite was brief. He looked about him.
The narrow gorge had opened out onto a trail which ran straight
along the crest of a cliff that fell away sheer three hundred feet
into a deep valley, hemmed in on all sides by gigantic precipices.
Gordon looked down and saw a stream winding among dense trees far
below, and further on, what seemed to be stone buildings among the
groves.</p>

<p>Bardylis pointed to the latter.</p>

<p>"There is my village!" he said excitedly. "If we could get into
the valley we would be safe! This trail leads to the pass at the
southern end, but it is five miles distant!"</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. The trail ran straight along the top of
the cliff and afforded no cover. "They'll run us down and shoot us
like rats at long range, if we keep to this path."</p>

<p>"There is one other way!" cried Bardylis. "Down the cliff, at
this very point! It is a secret way, and none but a man of my
people has ever followed it, and then only when hard pressed. There
are handholds cut into the rock. Can you climb down?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," answered Gordon, sheathing his pistol. To try to go
down those towering cliffs looked like suicide, but it was sure
death to try to outrun Hunyadi's rifles along the trail. At any
minute he expected the Magyar and his men to break cover.</p>

<p>"I will go first and guide you," said Bardylis rapidly, kicking
off his sandals and letting himself over the cliff edge. Gordon did
likewise and followed him. Clinging to the sharp lip of the
precipice, Gordon saw a series of small holes pitting the rock. He
began the descent slowly, clinging like a fly to a wall. It was
hair-raising work, and the only thing that made it possible at all
was the slight convex slant of the hill at that point. Gordon had
made many a desperate climb during his career, but never one which
put such strain on nerve and thew. Again and again only the grip of
a finger stood between him and death. Below him Bardylis toiled
downward, guiding and encouraging him, until the youth finally
dropped to the earth and stood looking tensely up at the man above
him.</p>

<p>Then he shouted, with a note of strident fear in his voice.
Gordon, still twenty feet from the bottom, craned his neck upward.
High above him he saw a bearded face peering down at him, convulsed
with triumph. Deliberately the Turk sighted downward with a pistol,
then laid it aside and caught up a heavy stone, leaning far over
the edge to aim its downward course. Clinging with toes and nails,
Gordon drew and fired upward with the same motion. Then he
flattened himself desperately against the cliff and clung on.</p>

<p>The man above screamed and pitched headfirst over the brink. The
rock rushed down, striking Gordon a glancing blow on the shoulder,
then the writhing body hurtled past and struck with a sickening
concussion on the earth below. A voice shouting furiously high
above announced the presence of Hunyadi at last, and Gordon slid
and tumbled recklessly the remaining distance, and, with Bardylis,
ran for the shelter of the trees.</p>

<p>A glance backward and upward showed him Hunyadi crouching on the
cliff, leveling a rifle, but the next instant Gordon and Bardylis
were out of sight, and Hunyadi, apparently dreading an answering
shot from the trees, made a hasty retreat with the four Turks who
were the survivors of his party.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. The Sons of Iskander</h2>

<p>"YOU SAVED MY life when you showed me that path," said
Gordon.</p>

<p>Bardylis smiled. "Any man of Attalus could have shown you the
path, which we call the Road of the Eagles. But only a hero could
have followed it. From what land comes my brother?"</p>

<p>"From the west," answered Gordon; "from the land of America,
beyond Frankistan and the sea."</p>

<p>Bardylis shook his head. "I have never heard of it. But come
with me. My people are yours henceforth."</p>

<p>As they moved through the trees, Gordon scanned the cliffs in
vain for some sign of his enemies. He felt certain that neither
Hunyadi, bold as he was, nor any of his companions would try to
follow them down "the Road of the Eagles." They were not
mountaineers. They were more at home in the saddle than on a hill
path. They would seek some other way into the valley. He spoke his
thoughts to Bardylis.</p>

<p>"They will find death," answered the youth grimly. "The Pass of
the King, at the southern end of the valley, is the only entrance.
Men guard it with matchlocks night and day. The only strangers who
enter the Valley of Iskander are traders and merchants with
pack-mules."</p>

<p>Gordon inspected his companion curiously, aware of a certain
tantalizing sensation of familiarity he could not place.</p>

<p>"Who are your people?" he asked. "You are not an Afghan. You do
not look like a Oriental at all."</p>

<p>"We are the Sons of Iskander," answered Bardylis. "When the
great conqueror came through these mountains long ago, he built the
city we call Attalus, and left hundreds of his soldiers and their
women in it. Iskander marched westward again, and after a long
while word came that he was dead and his empire divided. But the
people of Iskander abode here, unconquered. Many times we have
slaughtered the Afghan dogs who came against us."</p>

<p>Light came to Gordon, illuminating that misplaced familiarity.
Iskander&mdash;Alexander the Great, who conquered this part of Asia
and left colonies behind him. This boy's profile was classic
Grecian, such as Gordon had seen in sculptured marble, and the
names he spoke were Grecian. Undoubtedly he was the descendant of
some Macedonian soldier who had followed the Great Conqueror on his
invasion of the East.</p>

<p>To test the matter, he spoke to Bardylis in ancient Greek, one
of the many languages, modern and obsolete, he had picked up in his
varied career. The youth cried out with pleasure.</p>

<p>"You speak our tongue!" he exclaimed, in the same language. "Not
in a thousand years has a stranger come to us with our own speech
on his lips. We converse with the Moslems in their own tongue, and
they know nothing of ours. Surely, you too, are a Son of
Iskander?"</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head, wondering how he could explain his
knowledge of the tongue to this youth who knew nothing of the world
outside the hills.</p>

<p>"My ancestors were neighbors of the people of Alexander," he
said at last. "So, many of my people speak their language."</p>

<p>They were approaching the stone roofs which shone through the
trees, and Gordon saw that Bardylis's "village" was a substantial
town, surrounded by a wall. It was so plainly the work of long dead
Grecian architects that he felt like a man who wandered into a past
and forgotten age.</p>

<p>Outside the walls, men tilled the thin soil with primitive
implements, and herded sheep and cattle. A few horses grazed along
the bank of the stream which meandered through the valley. All the
men, like Bardylis, were tall and fair-haired. They dropped their
work and came running up, staring at the black-haired stranger in
hostile surprise, until Bardylis reassured them.</p>

<p>"It is the first time any but a captive or a trader has entered
the valley in centuries," said Bardylis to Gordon. "Say nothing
till I bid you. I wish to surprise my people with your knowledge.
Zeus, they will gape when they hear a stranger speak to them in
their own tongue!"</p>

<p>The gate in the wall hung open and unguarded, and Gordon noticed
that the wall itself was in a poor state of repair. Bardylis
remarked that the guard in the narrow pass at the end of the valley
was sufficient protection, and that no hostile force had ever
reached the city itself. They passed through and walked along a
broad paved street, in which yellow-haired people in tunics, men,
women and children, went about their tasks much like the Greeks of
two thousand years ago, among buildings which were duplicates of
the structures of ancient Athens.</p>

<p>A crowd quickly formed about them, but Bardylis, bursting with
glee and importance, gave them no satisfaction. He went straight
toward a large edifice near the center of the town and mounting the
broad steps, came into a large chamber where several men, more
richly dressed than the common people, sat casting dice on a small
table before them. The crowd swarmed in after them, and thronged
the doorway eagerly. The chiefs ceased their dice game, and one, a
giant with a commanding air, demanded: "What do you wish, Bardylis?
Who is this stranger?"</p>

<p>"A friend of Attalus, Ptolemy, king of the valley of Iskander,"
answered Bardylis. "He speaks the tongue of Iskander!"</p>

<p>"What tale is this?" harshly demanded the giant.</p>

<p>"Let them hear, brother!" Bardylis directed triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I come in peace," said Gordon briefly, in archaic Greek. "I am
called El Borak, but I am no Moslem."</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise went up from the throng, and Ptolemy
fingered his chin and scowled suspiciously. He was a magnificently
built man, clean-shaven like all his tribesmen, and handsome, but
his visage was moody.</p>

<p>He listened impatiently while Bardylis related the circumstances
of his meeting with Gordon, and when he told of the American
lifting the stone that pinned him down, Ptolemy frowned and
involuntarily flexed his own massive thews. He seemed ill-pleased
at the approval with which the people openly greeted the tale.
Evidently these descendants of Grecian athletes had as much
admiration for physical perfection as had their ancient ancestors,
and Ptolemy was vain of his prowess.</p>

<p>"How could he lift such a stone?" the king broke in. "He is of
no great size. His head would scarcely top my chin."</p>

<p>"He is mighty beyond his stature, O king," retorted Bardylis.
"Here is the bruise on my leg to prove I tell the truth. He lifted
the stone I could not move, and he came down the Road of the
Eagles, which few even among the Attalans have dared. He has
traveled far and fought men, and now he would feast and rest."</p>

<p>"See to it then," grunted Ptolemy contemptuously, turning back
to his dice game. "If he is a Moslem spy, your head shall answer
for it."</p>

<p>"I stake my head gladly on his honesty, O king!" answered
Bardylis proudly. Then, taking Gordon's arm, he said softly, "Come
my friend. Ptolemy is short of patience and scant of courtesy. Pay
no heed to him. I will take you to the house of my father."</p>

<p>As they pushed their way through the crowd, Gordon's gaze picked
out an alien countenance among the frank, blond faces&mdash;a thin,
swarthy visage, whose black eyes gleamed avidly on the American.
The man was a Tajik, with a bundle on his back. When he saw he was
being scrutinized he smirked and bobbed his head. There was
something familiar about the gesture.</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" Gordon asked.</p>

<p>"Abdullah, a Moslem dog whom we allow to enter the valley with
beads and mirrors and such trinkets as our women love. We trade ore
and wine and skins for them."</p>

<p>Gordon remembered the fellow now&mdash;a shifty character who
used to hang around Peshawur, and was suspected of smuggling rifles
up the Khyber Pass. But when he turned and looked back, the dark
face had vanished in the crowd. However, there was no reason to
fear Abdullah, even if the man recognized him. The Tajik could not
know of the papers he carried. Gordon felt that the people of
Attalus were friendly to the friend of Bardylis, though the youth
had plainly roused Ptolemy's jealous vanity by his praise of
Gordon's strength.</p>

<p>Bardylis conducted Gordon down the street to a large stone house
with a pillared portico, where he proudly displayed his friend to
his father, a venerable patriarch called Perdiccas, and his mother,
a tall, stately woman, well along in years. The Attalans certainly
did not keep their women in seclusion like the Moslems. Gordon saw
Bradylis's sisters, robust blond beauties, and his young brother.
The American could scarcely suppress a smile at the strangeness of
it all, being ushered into the every-day family life of two
thousand years ago. These people were definitely not barbarians.
They were lower, undoubtedly, in the cultural scale than their
Hellenic ancestors, but they were still more highly civilized than
their fierce Afghan neighbors.</p>

<p>The interest in their guest was genuine, but none save Bardylis
showed much interest in the world outside their valley. Presently
the youth led Gordon into an inner chamber and set food and wine
before him. The American ate and drank ravenously, suddenly aware
of the lean days that had preceded this feast. While he ate,
Bardylis talked, but he did not speak of the men who had been
pursuing Gordon. Evidently he supposed them to have been Afghans of
the surrounding hills, whose hostility was proverbial. Gordon
learned that no man of Attalus had ever been more than a day's
journey away from the valley. The ferocity of the hill tribes all
about them had isolated them from the world completely.</p>

<p>When Gordon at last expressed a desire for sleep, Bardylis left
him alone, assuring him that he would not be disturbed. The
American was somewhat disturbed to find that there was no door to
his chamber, merely a curtain drawn across an archway. Bardylis had
said there were no thieves in Attalus, but caution was so much a
natural part of Gordon that he found himself a prey to uneasiness.
The room opened onto a corridor, and the corridor, he believed,
gave onto an outer door. The people of Attalus apparently did not
find it necessary to safeguard their dwellings. But though a native
could sleep in safety, that might not apply to a stranger.</p>

<p>Finally Gordon drew aside the couch which formed the main piece
of furniture for the chamber, and making sure no spying eyes were
on him, he worked loose one of the small stone blocks which
composed the wall. Taking the silk-bound packet from his shirt, he
thrust it into the aperture, pushed back the stone as far as it
would go, and replaced the couch.</p>

<p>Stretching himself, then, upon the couch, he fell to evolving
plans for escape with his life and those papers which meant so much
to peace of Asia. He was safe enough in the valley, but he knew
Hunyadi would wait for him outside with the patience of a cobra. He
could not stay here forever. He would scale the cliffs some dark
night and bolt for it. Hunyadi would undoubtedly have all the
tribes in the hills after him, but he would trust to luck and his
good right arm, as he had so often before. The wine he had drunk
was potent. Weariness after the long flight weighted his limbs.
Gordon's meditations merged into dream. He slept deeply and
long.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. The Duel with Ptolemy the
King</h2>

<p>WHEN GORDON AWOKE he was in utter darkness. He knew that he had
slept for many hours, and night had fallen. Silence reigned over
the house, but he had been awakened by the soft swish of the
curtains over the doorway.</p>

<p>He sat up on his couch and asked: "Is that you, Bardylis?"</p>

<p>A voice grunted, "Yes." Even as he was electrified by the
realization that the voice was <i>not</i> that of Bardylis, something
crashed down on his head, and a deeper blackness, shot with
fire-sparks, engulfed him.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>When he regained consciousness, a torch dazzled his eyes, and in
its glow he saw three men&mdash;burly, yellow-haired men of Attalus
with faces more stupid and brutish than any he had yet seen. He was
lying on a stone slab in a bare chamber, whose crumbling,
cob-webbed walls were vaguely illumined by the gutturing torch. His
arms were bound, but not his legs. The sound of a door opening made
him crane his neck, and he saw a stooped, vulture-like figure enter
the room. It was Abdullah, the Tajik.</p>

<p>He looked down on the American with his rat-like features
twisted in a venomous grin.</p>

<p>"Low lies the terrible El Borak!" he taunted. "Fool! I knew you
the instant I saw you in the palace of Ptolemy."</p>

<p>"You have no feud with me," growled Gordon.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine has," answered the Tajik. "That is nothing to
me, but it shall gain me profit. It is true you have never harmed
me, but I have always feared you. So when I saw you in the city, I
gathered my goods and hastened to depart, not knowing what you did
here. But beyond the pass I met the <i>feringhi</i> Hunyadi, and he asked
me if I had seen you in the valley of Iskander whither you had fled
to escape him. I answered that I had, and he urged me to help him
steal into the valley and take from you certain documents he said
you stole from him.</p>

<p>"But I refused, knowing that these Attalan devils would kill me
if I tried to smuggle a stranger into Iskander, and Hunyadi went
back into the hills with his four Turks, and the horde of ragged
Afghans he has made his friends and allies. When he had gone I
returned to the valley, telling the guardsmen at the pass that I
feared the Pathans.</p>

<p>"I persuaded these three men to aid me in capturing you. None
will know what became of you, and Ptolemy will not trouble himself
about you, because he is jealous of your strength. It is an old
tradition that the king of Attalus must be the strongest man in the
city. Ptolemy would have killed you himself, in time. But I will
attend to that. I do not wish to have you on my trail, after I have
taken from you the papers Hunyadi wishes. He shall have them
ultimately&mdash;if he is willing to pay enough!" He laughed, a
high, cackling laugh, and turned to the stolid Attalans. "Did you
search him?"</p>

<p>"We found nothing," a giant rumbled.</p>

<p>Abdullah tck-tck'ed his teeth in annoyance.</p>

<p>"You do not know how to search a <i>Feringhi</i>. Here, I will do it
myself."</p>

<p>He ran a practiced hand over his captive, scowling as his search
was unrewarded. He tried to feel under the American's armpits, but
Gordon's arms were bound so closely to his sides that this was
impossible.</p>

<p>Abdullah frowned worriedly, and drew a curved dagger.</p>

<p>"Cut loose his arms," he directed, "then all three of you lay
hold on him; it is like letting a leopard out of his cage."</p>

<p>Gordon made no resistance and was quickly spread-eagled on the
slab, with a big Attalan at each arm and one on his legs. They held
him closely, but seemed skeptical of Abdullah's repeated warnings
concerning the stranger's strength.</p>

<p>The Tajik again approached his prisoner, lowering his knife as
he reached out. With a dynamic release of coiled steel muscles,
Gordon wrenched his legs free from the grasp of the careless
Attalan and drove his heels into Abdullah's breast. Had his feet
been booted they would have caved in the Tajik's breast bone. As it
was, the merchant shot backward with an agonized grunt, and struck
the floor flat on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Gordon had not paused. That same terrific lunge had torn his
left arm free, and heaving up on the slab, he smashed his left fist
against the jaw of the man who gripped his right arm. The impact
was that of a caulking hammer, and the Attalan went down like a
butchered ox. The other two lunged in, hands grasping. Gordon threw
himself over the slab to the floor on the other side, and as one of
the warriors lunged around it, he caught the Attalan's wrist,
wheeled, jerking the arm over his shoulder, and hurled the man
bodily over his head. The Attalan struck the floor head-first with
an impact that knocked wind and consciousness out of him
together.</p>

<p>The remaining kidnapper was more wary. Seeing the terrible
strength and blinding speed of his smaller foe, he drew a long
knife and came in cautiously, seeking an opportunity for a mortal
thrust. Gordon fell back, putting the slab between himself and that
glimmering blade, while the other circled warily after him.
Suddenly the American stooped and ripped a similar knife from the
belt of the man he had first felled. As he did so, the Attalan gave
a roar, cleared the slab with a lion-like bound, and slashed in
mid-air at the stooping American.</p>

<p>Gordon crouched still lower and the gleaming blade whistled over
his head. The man hit the floor feet-first, off balance, and
tumbled forward, full into the knife that swept up in Gordon's
hand. A strangled cry was wrung from the Attalan's lips as he felt
himself impaled on the long blade, and he dragged Gordon down with
him in his death struggles.</p>

<p>Tearing free from his weakening embrace, Gordon rose, his
garments smeared with his victim's blood, the red knife in his
hand. Abdullah staggered up with a croaking cry, his face green
with pain. Gordon snarled like a wolf and sprang toward him, all
his murderous passion fully roused. But the sight of that dripping
knife and the savage mask of Gordon's face galvanized the Tajik.
With a scream he sprang for the door, knocking the torch from its
socket as he passed. It hit the floor, scattering sparks, and
plunging the room into darkness, and Gordon caromed blindly into
the wall.</p>

<p>When he righted himself and found the door, the room was empty
except for himself and the Attalans, dead or senseless.</p>

<p>Emerging from the chamber, he found himself in a narrow street,
with the stars fading for dawn. The building he had just quitted
was dilapidated and obviously deserted. Down the narrow way he saw
the house of Perdiccas. So he had not been carried far. Evidently
his abductors had anticipated no interference. He wondered how much
of a hand Bardylis had had in the plot. He did not like to think
that the youth had betrayed him. But in any event, he would have to
return to the house of Perdiccas, to obtain the packet he had
concealed in the wall. He went down the street, still feeling a bit
sick and giddy from that blow that had knocked him senseless, now
that the fire of battle had cooled in his veins. The street was
deserted. It seemed, indeed, more like an alley than a street,
running between the back of the houses.</p>

<p>As he approached the house, he saw someone running toward him.
It was Bardylis, and he threw himself on Gordon with a cry of
relief that was not feigned.</p>

<p>"Oh, my brother!" he exclaimed. "What has happened? I found your
chamber empty a short time ago, and blood on your couch. Are you
unhurt? Nay, there is a cut upon your scalp!"</p>

<p>Gordon explained in a few words, saying nothing of the letters.
He allowed Bardylis to suppose that Abdullah had been a personal
enemy, bent on revenge. He trusted the youth now, but there was no
need to disclose the truth of the packet.</p>

<p>Bardylis whitened with fury. "What a shame upon my house!" he
cried. "Last night that dog Abdullah made my father a present of a
great jug of wine, and we all drank except yourself, who were
slumbering. I know now the wine was drugged. We slept like
dogs.</p>

<p>"Because you were our guest, I posted a man at each outer door
last night, but they fell asleep because of the wine they had
drunk. A few minutes ago, searching for you, I found the servant
who was posted at the door which opens into this alley from the
corridor that runs past your chamber. His throat had been cut. It
was easy for them to creep along that corridor and into your
chamber while we slept."</p>

<p>Back in the chamber, while Bardylis went to fetch fresh
garments, Gordon retrieved the packet from the wall and stowed it
under his belt. In his waking hours he preferred to keep it on his
person.</p>

<p>Bardylis returned then with the breeches, sandals and tunic of
the Attalans, and while Gordon donned them, gazed in admiration at
the American's bronzed and sinewy torso, devoid as it was of the
slightest trace of surplus flesh.</p>

<p>Gordon had scarcely completed his dressing when voices were
heard without, the tramp of men resounded through the hall, and a
group of yellow-haired warriors appeared at the doorway, with
swords at their sides. Their leader pointed at Gordon, and said:
"Ptolemy commands that this man appear at once before him, in the
hall of justice."</p>

<p>"What is this?" exclaimed Bardylis. "El Borak is my guest!"</p>

<p>"It is not my part to say," answered the chief. "I but carry out
the commands of our king."</p>

<p>Gordon laid a restraining hand on Bardylis's arm. "I will go. I
want to see what business Ptolemy has with me."</p>

<p>"I, too, will go," said Bardylis, with a snap of his jaws. "What
this portends I do not know. I do know that El Borak is my
friend."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The sun was not yet rising as they strode down the white street
toward the palace, but people were already moving about, and many
of them followed the procession.</p>

<p>Mounting the broad steps of the palace, they entered a wide
hall, flanked with lofty columns. At the other end there were more
steps, wide and curving, leading up to a dais on which, in a
throne-like marble chair, sat the king of Attalus, sullen as ever.
A number of his chiefs sat on stone benches on either side of the
dais, and the common people ranged themselves along the wall,
leaving a wide space clear before the throne.</p>

<p>In this open space crouched a vulture-like figure. It was
Abdullah, his eyes shining with hate and fear, and before him lay
the corpse of the man Gordon had killed in the deserted house. The
other two kidnappers stood nearby, their bruised features sullen
and ill at ease.</p>

<p>Gordon was conducted into the open space before the dais, and
the guards fell back on either side of him. There was little
formality. Ptolemy motioned to Abdullah and said: "Make your
charge."</p>

<p>Abdullah sprang up and pointed a skinny finger in Gordon's
face.</p>

<p>"I accuse this man of murder!" he screeched. "This morning
before dawn he attacked me and my friends while we slept, and slew
him who lies there. The rest of us barely escaped with our
lives!"</p>

<p>A mutter of surprise and anger rose from the throng. Ptolemy
turned his somber stare on Gordon.</p>

<p>"What have you to say?"</p>

<p>"He lies," answered the American impatiently. "I killed that
man, yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a fierce cry from the people, who began to
surge menacingly forward, to be thrust back by the guards.</p>

<p>"I only defended my life," said Gordon angrily, not relishing
his position of defendant. "That Tajik dog and three others, that
dead man and those two standing there, slipped into my chamber last
night as I slept in the house of Perdiccas, knocked me senseless
and carried me away to rob and kill me."</p>

<p>"Aye!" cried Bardylis wrathfully. "And they slew one of my
father's servants while he slept."</p>

<p>At that the murmur of the mob changed, and they halted in
uncertainty.</p>

<p>"A lie!" screamed Abdullah, fired to recklessness by avarice and
hate. "Bardylis is bewitched! El Borak is a wizard! How else could
he speak your tongue?"</p>

<p>The crowd recoiled abruptly, and some made furtive signs to
avert conjury. The Attalans were as superstitious as their
ancestors. Bardylis had drawn his sword, and his friends rallied
about him, clean-cut, rangy youngsters, quivering like hunted dogs
in their eagerness.</p>

<p>"Wizard or man!" roared Bardylis, "he is my brother, and no man
touches him save at peril of his head!"</p>

<p>"He is a wizard!" screamed Abdullah, foam dabbling his beard. "I
know him of old! Beware of him! He will bring madness and ruin upon
Attalus! On his body he bears a scroll with magic inscriptions,
wherein lies his necromantic power! Give that scroll to me, and I
will take it afar from Attalus and destroy it where it can do no
harm. Let me prove I do not lie! Hold him while I search him, and I
will show you."</p>

<p>"Let no man dare touch El Borak!" challenged Bardylis. Then from
his throne rose Ptolemy, a great menacing image of bronze, somber
and awe-inspiring. He strode down the steps, and men shrank back
from his bleak eyes. Bardylis stood his ground, as if ready to defy
even his terrible king, but Gordon drew the lad aside. El Borak was
not one to stand quietly by while someone else defended him.</p>

<p>"It is true," he said without heat, "that I have a packet of
papers in my garments. But it is also true that it has nothing to
do with witchcraft, and that I will kill the man who tries to take
it from me."</p>

<p>At that Ptolemy's brooding impassiveness vanished in a flame of
passion.</p>

<p>"Will you defy even me?" he roared, his eyes blazing, his great
hands working convulsively. "Do you deem yourself already king of
Attalus? You black-haired dog, I will kill you with my naked hands!
Back, and give us space!"</p>

<p>His sweeping arms hurled men right and left, and roaring like a
bull, he hurled himself on Gordon. So swift and violent was his
attack that Gordon was unable to avoid it. They met breast to
breast, and the smaller man was hurled backward, and to his knee.
Ptolemy plunged over him, unable to check his velocity, and then,
locked in a death-grapple they ripped and tore, while the people
surged yelling about them.</p>

<p>Not often did El Borak find himself opposed by a man stronger
than himself. But the king of Attalus was a mass of whale-bone and
iron, and nerved to blinding quickness. Neither had a weapon. It
was man to man, fighting as the primitive progenitors of the race
fought. There was no science about Ptolemy's onslaught. He fought
like a tiger or a lion, with all the appalling frenzy of the
primordial. Again and again Gordon battered his way out of a
grapple that threatened to snap his spine like a rotten branch. His
blinding blows ripped and smashed in a riot of destruction. The
tall king of Attalus swayed and trembled before them like a tree in
a storm, but always came surging back like a typhoon, lashing out
with great strokes that drove Gordon staggering before him, rending
and tearing with mighty fingers.</p>

<p>Only his desperate speed and the savage skill of boxing and
wrestling that was his had saved Gordon so long. Naked to the
waist, battered and bruised, his tortured body quivered with the
punishment he was enduring. But Ptolemy's great chest was heaving.
His face was a mask of raw beef, and his torso showed the effects
of a beating that would have killed a lesser man.</p>

<p>Gasping a cry that was half curse, half sob, he threw himself
bodily on the American, bearing him down by sheer weight. As they
fell he drove a knee savagely at Gordon's groin, and tried to fall
with his full weight on the smaller man's breast. A twist of his
body sent the knee sliding harmlessly along his thigh, and Gordon
writhed from under the heavier body as they fell.</p>

<p>The impact broke their holds, and they staggered up
simultaneously. Through the blood and sweat that streamed into his
eyes, Gordon saw the king towering above him, reeling, arms spread,
blood pouring down his mighty breast. His belly went in as he drew
a great laboring breath. And into the relaxed pit of his stomach
Gordon, crouching, drove his left with all the strength of his
rigid arm, iron shoulders and knotted calves behind it. His
clenched fist sank to the wrist in Ptolemy's solar plexus. The
king's breath went out of him in an explosive grunt. His hands
dropped and he swayed like a tall tree under the axe. Gordon's
right, hooking up in a terrible arc, met his jaw with a sound like
a cooper's mallet, and Ptolemy pitched headlong and lay still.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. The Death of Hunyadi</h2>

<p>IN THE STUPEFIED silence that followed the fall of the king,
while all eyes, dilated with surprise, were fixed on the prostrate
giant and the groggy figure that weaved above him, a gasping voice
shouted from outside the palace. It grew louder, mingled with a
clatter of hoofs which stopped at the outer steps. All wheeled
toward the door as a wild figure staggered in, spattering
blood.</p>

<p>"A guard from the pass!" cried Bardylis.</p>

<p>"The Moslems!" cried the man, blood spurting through his fingers
which he pressed to his shoulder. "Three hundred Afghans! They have
stormed the pass! They are led by a <i>feringhi</i> and <i>four</i> turki who
have rifles that fire many times without reloading! These men shot
us down from afar off as we strove to defend the pass. The Afghans
have entered the valley&mdash;" He swayed and fell, blood trickling
from his lips. A blue bullet hole showed in his shoulder, near the
base of his neck.</p>

<p>No clamor of terror greeted this appalling news. In the utter
silence that followed, all eyes turned toward Gordon, leaning
dizzily against the wall, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>"You have conquered Ptolemy," said Bardylis. "He is dead or
senseless. While he is helpless, you are king. That is the law.
Tell us what to do."</p>

<p>Gordon gathered his dazed wits and accepted the situation
without demur or question. If the Afghans were in the valley, there
was no time to waste. He thought he could hear the distant popping
of firearms already.

<p>"How many men are able to bear arms?" he panted.</p>

<p>"Three hundred and fifty," answered one of the chiefs.</p>

<p>"Then let them take their weapons and follow me," he said. "The
walls of the city are rotten. If we try to defend them, with
Hunyadi directing the siege, we will be trapped like rats. We must
win with one stroke, if at all."</p>

<p>Someone brought him a sheathed and belted scimitar and he
buckled it about his waist. His head was still swimming and his
body numb, but from some obscure reservoir he drew a fund of
reserve power, and the prospect of a final showdown with Hunyadi
fired his blood. At his directions men lifted Ptolemy and placed
him on a couch. The king had not moved since he dropped, and Gordon
thought it probable that he had a concussion of the brain. That
poleax smash that had felled him would have split the skull of a
lesser man.</p>

<p>Then Gordon remembered Abdullah, and looked about for him, but
the Tajik had vanished.</p>

<p>At the head of the warriors of Attalus, Gordon strode down the
street and through the ponderous gate. All were armed with long
curved swords; some had unwieldy matchlocks, ancient weapons
captured from the hill tribes. He knew the Afghans would be no
better armed, but the rifles of Hunyadi and his Turks would count
heavily.</p>

<p>He could see the horde swarming up the valley, still some
distance away. They were on foot. Lucky for the Attalans that one
of the pass-guards had kept a horse near him. Otherwise the Afghans
would have been at the very walls of the town before the word came
of their invasion.</p>

<p>The invaders were drunk with exultation, halting to fire
outlying huts and growing stuff, and to shoot cattle, in sheer
wanton destructiveness. Behind Gordon rose a deep rumble of rage,
and looking back at the blazing blue eyes, and tall, tense figures,
the American knew he was leading no weaklings to battle.</p>

<p>He led them to a long straggling heap of stones which ran
waveringly clear across the valley, marking an ancient
fortification, long abandoned and crumbling down. It would afford
some cover. When they reached it the invaders were still out of
rifle fire. The Afghans had ceased their plundering and came on at
an increased gait, howling like wolves.</p>

<p>Gordon ordered his men to lie down behind the stones, and called
to him the warriors with the matchlocks&mdash;some thirty in
all.</p>

<p>"Pay no heed to the Afghans," he instructed them. "Shoot at the
men with the rifles. Do not shoot at random, but wait until I give
the word, then all fire together."</p>

<p>The ragged horde were spreading out somewhat as they approached,
loosing their matchlocks before they were in range of the grim band
waiting silently along the crumbled wall. The Attalans quivered
with eagerness, but Gordon gave no sign. He saw the tall, supple
figure of Hunyadi, and the bulkier shapes of his turbaned Turks, in
the center of the ragged crescent. The men came straight on,
apparently secure in the knowledge that the Attalans had no modern
weapons, and that Gordon had lost his rifle. They had seen him
climbing down the cliff without it. Gordon cursed Abdullah, whose
treachery had lost him his pistol.</p>

<p>Before they were in range of the matchlocks, Hunyadi fired, and
the warrior at Gordon's side slumped over, drilled through the
head. A mutter of rage and impatience ran along the line, but
Gordon quieted the warriors, ordering them to lie closer behind the
rocks. Hunyadi tried again, and the Turks blazed away, but the
bullets whined off the stones. The men moved nearer and behind them
the Afghans howled with bloodthirsty impatience, rapidly getting
out of hand.</p>

<p>Gordon had hoped to lure Hunyadi into reach of his matchlocks.
But suddenly, with an earth-shaking yell, the Afghans stormed past
the Hungarian in a wave, knives flaming like the sun on water.
Hunyadi yelped explosively, unable to see or shoot at his enemies,
for the backs of his reckless allies. Despite his curses, they came
on with a roar.</p>

<p>Gordon, crouching among the stones, glared at the gaunt giants
rushing toward him until he could make out the fanatical blaze of
their eyes, then he roared: "<i>Fire</i>."</p>

<p>A thunderous volley ripped out along the wall, ragged, but
terrible at that range. A storm of lead blasted the oncoming line,
and men went down in windrows. Lost to all caution, the Attalans
leaped the wall and hewed into the staggering Afghans with naked
steel. Cursing as Hunyadi had cursed, Gordon drew his scimitar and
followed them.</p>

<p>No time for orders now, no formation, no strategy. Attalan and
Afghan, they fought as men fought a thousand years ago, without
order or plan, massed in a straining, grunting, hacking mob, where
naked blades flickered like lightning. Yard-long Khyber knives
clanged and ground against the curved swords of the Attalans. The
rending of flesh and bone beneath the chopping blades was like the
sound of butchers' cleavers. The dying dragged down the living and
the warriors stumbled among the mangled corpses. It was a shambles
where no quarter was asked and none given, and the feuds and hates
of a thousand years glutted in slaughter.</p>

<p>No shots were fired in that deadly crush, but about the edges of
the battle circled Hunyadi and the Turks, shooting with deadly
accuracy. Man to man, the stalwart Attalans were a match for the
hairy hillmen, and they slightly outnumbered the invaders. But they
had thrown away the advantage of their position, and the rifles of
the Hungarian's own party were dealing havoc in their disordered
ranks. Two of the Turks were down, one hit by a matchlock ball in
that first and only volley, and another disembowelled by a dying
Attalan.</p>

<p>As Gordon hewed his way through the straining knots and flailing
blades, he met one of the remaining Turks face to face. The man
thrust a rifle muzzle in his face, but the hammer fell with a click
on an empty shell, and the next instant Gordon's scimitar ripped
through his belly and stood out a foot behind his back. As the
American twisted his blade free, the other Turk fired a pistol,
missed, and hurled the empty weapon fruitlessly. He rushed in,
slashing with a saber at Gordon's head. El Borak parried the
singing blade, and his scimitar cut the air like a blue beam,
splitting the Turk's skull to the chin.</p>

<p>Then he saw Hunyadi. The Hungarian was groping in his belt, and
Gordon knew he was out of ammunition.</p>

<p>"We've tried hot lead, Gustav," challenged Gordon, "and we both
still live. Come and try cold steel!"</p>

<p>With a wild laugh the Hungarian ripped out his blade in a bright
shimmer of steel that caught the morning sun. He was a tall man,
Gustav Hunyadi, black sheep son of a noble Magyar house, supple and
lithe as a catamount, with dancing, reckless eyes and lips that
curved in a smile as cruel as a striking sword.</p>

<p>"I match my life against a little package of papers, El Borak!"
the Hungarian laughed as the blades met.</p>

<p>On each side the fighting lulled and ceased, as the warriors
drew back with heaving chests and dripping swords, to watch their
leaders settle the score.</p>

<p>The curved blades sparkled in the sunlight, ground together,
leaped apart, licked in and out like living things.</p>

<p>Well for El Borak then that his wrist was a solid mass of steel
cords, that his eye was quicker and surer than a falcon's, and his
brain and thews bound together with a coordination keen as
razor-edged steel. For into his play Hunyadi brought all the skill
of a race of swordsmen, all the craft taught by masters of the
blade of Europe and Asia, and all the savage cunning he had learned
in wild battles on the edges of the world.</p>

<p>He was taller and had the longer reach. Again and again his
blade whispered at Gordon's throat. Once it touched his arm, and a
trickle of crimson began. There was no sound except the rasp of
feet on the sward, the rapid whisper of the blades, the deep
panting of the men. Gordon was the harder pressed. That terrible
fight with Ptolemy was taking its toll. His legs trembled, his
sight kept blurring. As if through a mist he saw the triumphant
smile growing on the thin lips of the Magyar.</p>

<p>And a wild surge of desperation rose in Gordon's soul, nerving
him for a last rush. It came with the unexpected fury of a dying
wolf, with a flaming fan of steel, a whirlwind of blades&mdash;and
then Hunyadi was down, clutching at the earth with twitching hands,
Gordon's narrow curved blade through him.</p>

<p>The Hungarian rolled his glazing eyes up at his conqueror, and
his lips distorted in a ghastly smile. "To the mistress of all true
adventurers!" he whispered, choking on his own blood. "To the Lady
Death!"</p>

<p>He sank back and lay still, his pallid face turned to the sky,
blood oozing from his lips.</p>

<p>The Afghans began slinking furtively away, their morale broken,
like a pack of wolves whose leader is down. Suddenly, as if waking
from a dream, the Attalans gave tongue and pelted after them. The
invaders broke and fled, while the infuriated Attalans followed,
stabbing and hacking at their backs, down the valley and out
through the pass.</p>

<p>Gordon was aware that Bardylis, blood-stained but exultant, was
beside him, supporting his trembling frame that seemed on the point
of collapse. The American wiped the bloody sweat from his eyes, and
touched the packet under his girdle. Many men had died for that.
But many more would have died had it not been saved, including
helpless women and children.</p>

<p>Bardylis muttered apprehensively, and Gordon looked up to see a
gigantic figure approaching leisurely from the direction of the
city, through whose gate the rejoicing women were already
streaming. It was Ptolemy, his features grotesquely swollen and
blackened from Gordon's iron fists. He strode serenely through the
heaps of corpses, and reached the spot where the companions
stood.</p>

<p>Bardylis gripped his notched sword, and Ptolemy, seeing the
gesture, grinned with his pulped lips. He was holding something
behind him.</p>

<p>"I do not come in anger, El Borak," he said calmly. "A man who
can fight as you have fought is neither wizard, thief nor murderer.
I am no child to hate a man who has bested me in fair
fight&mdash;and then saved my kingdom while I lay senseless. Will
you take my hand?"</p>

<p>Gordon grasped it with an honest surge of friendship toward this
giant, whose only fault, after all, was his vanity.</p>

<p>"I did not recover my senses in time for the battle," said
Ptolemy. "I only saw the last of it. But if I did not reach the
field in time to smite the Moslem dogs, I have at least rid the
valley of one rat I found hiding in the palace." He casually tossed
something at Gordon's feet. The severed head of Abdullah, the
features frozen in a grin of horror, stared up at the American.</p>

<p>"Will you live in Attalus and be my brother, as well as the
brother of Bardylis?" asked Ptolemy, with a glance down the valley,
toward the pass through which the warriors were harrying the
howling Afghans.</p>

<p>"I thank you, king," said Gordon, "but I must go to my own
people, and it is still a long road to travel. When I have rested
for a few days, I must be gone. A little food, to carry with me on
my journey is all I ask from the people of Attalus, who are men as
brave and valiant as their royal ancestors."</p>
