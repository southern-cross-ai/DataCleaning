  The &ldquo;Roost&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>HE was a misshapen thing, bulking a black blotch in the night at the entrance
  of the dark alleyway&mdash;like some lurking creature in its lair. He neither
  stood, nor kneeled, nor sat&mdash;no single word would describe his posture&mdash;he
  combined all three in a sort of repulsive, formless heap.</p>
  <p>The Flopper moved. He came out from the alleyway onto the pavement, into
  the lurid lights of the Bowery, flopping along knee to toe on one leg, dragging
  the other leg behind him&mdash;and the leg he dragged was limp and wobbled
  from the knee. One hand sought the pavement to balance himself and aid in
  locomotion; the other arm, the right, was twisted out from his body in the
  shape of an inverted V, the palm of his hand, with half curled, contorted
  fingers, almost touching his chin, as his head sagged at a stiff, set angle
  into his right shoulder. Hair straggled from the brim of a nondescript felt
  hat into his eyes, and curled, dirty and unshorn, around his ears and the
  nape of his neck. His face was covered with a stubble of four days&rsquo; growth,
  his body with rags&mdash;a coat; a shirt, the button long since gone at the
  neck; and trousers gaping in wide rents at the knees, and torn at the ankles
  where they flapped around miss-mated socks and shoes.</p>
  <p>A hundred, two hundred people passed him in a block, the populace of the
  Bowery awakening into fullest life at midnight, men, women and children&mdash;the
  dregs of the city&rsquo;s scum&mdash;the aristocracy of upper Fifth Avenue,
  of Riverside Drive, aping Bohemianism, seeking the lure of the Turkey Trot,
  transported from the Barbary Coast of San Francisco. Rich and poor, squalor
  and affluence, vice and near-vice surged by him, voicing their different
  interests with laughter and sobs and soft words and blasphemy, and, in a
  sort of mocking chorus, the composite effect rose and fell in pitiful, jangling
  discords.</p>
  <p>Few gave him heed&mdash;and these few but a cursory, callous glance. The
  Flopper, on the inside of the sidewalk, in the shadow of the buildings, gave
  as little as he got, though his eyes were fastened sharply, now ahead, now,
  screwing around his body to look behind him, on the faces of the pedestrians
  as they passed; or, rather, he appeared to look through and beyond those
  in his immediate vicinity to the ones that followed in his rear from further
  down the street, or approached him from the next corner.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the Flopper shrank into a doorway. From amidst the crowd behind,
  the yellow flare of a gasoline lamp, outhanging from a secondhand shop, glinted
  on brass buttons. An officer, leisurely accommodating his pace to his own
  monarchial pleasure, causing his hurrying fellow occupants of the pavement
  to break and circle around him, sauntered casually by. The Flopper&rsquo;s
  black eyes contracted with hate and a scowl settled on his face, as he watched
  the policeman pass; then, as the other was lost again in the crowd ahead,
  he once more resumed his progress down the block.</p>
  <p>The Flopper crossed the intersecting street, his leg trailing a helpless,
  sinuous path on its not over-clean surface, and started along the next block.
  Halfway down was a garishly lighted establishment. When near this the Flopper
  began to hurry desperately, as from further along the street again his ear
  caught the peculiar raucous note of an automobile horn accompanied by the
  rumbling approach of a heavy motor vehicle. He edged his way now, wriggling,
  squirming and dodging between the pedestrians, to the outer edge of the sidewalk,
  and stopped in front of the music hall.</p>
  <p>A sight-seeing car, crammed to capacity, reaching its momentary Mecca, drew
  up at the curb; and the guide&rsquo;s voice rose over the screech of the
  brakes:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, ladies and gentlemen, we will get out here for a little while.
  This is Black Ike&rsquo;s famous Auditorium, the scene of last week&rsquo;s
  sensational triple murder! Please remember that there is no charge for admission
  to patrons of the company. Just show your coupons, ladies and gentlemen,
  and walk right ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The passengers began to pour from the long seats to the ground. The Flopper&rsquo;s
  hat was in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fer God&rsquo;s sake, gents an&rsquo; ladies, don&rsquo;t pass me
  by,&rdquo; he cried piteously. &ldquo;I could work once, but look at me
  now&mdash;I was run over by a fire truck. God bring pity to yer hearts&mdash;youse
  have money fer pleasure, spare something fer me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The first man down from the seat halted and stared at the twisted, unsightly
  thing before him, and, with a little gasp, reached into his pocket and dropped
  a bill into the Flopper&rsquo;s hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; stammered the Flopper&mdash;and the tears sprang
  swimming to his eyes.</p>
  <p>The first man passed on with a gruff, &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; but
  he had left an example behind him that few of his fellow passengers ignored.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ank you, mum,&rdquo; mumbled the Flopper, as the money dropped
  into his hat &ldquo;God reward you, sir &hellip; Ah, miss, may you never
  know a tear &hellip; &lsquo;Twas heaven brought you &lsquo;ere to-night,
  lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They passed, following the guide. The Flopper scooped the money into a pile
  in his hat, began to tuck it away in some recess of his shirt&mdash;when
  a hand was thrust suddenly under his nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, now, divvy!&rdquo; snapped a voice in his ear.</p>
  <p>It was the driver of the car, who had dropped from his seat to the ground.
  A gleam of hate replaced the tears in the Flopper&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; he snarled through thin lips&mdash;and his hand
  closed automatically over the cap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, now, I ain&rsquo;t got no time to fool!&rdquo; prompted
  the man, with a leer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead onto your lay, and there&rsquo;s
  a bull comin&rsquo; along now&mdash;half or him, which?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper&rsquo;s eyes caught the brass buttons of the officer returning
  on his beat, and his face was white with an inhuman passion, as, clutching
  a portion of what was left in the hat, he lifted his hand from the rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; grinned the chauffeur, snatching at the remainder. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
  half, but it&rsquo;ll do&rdquo;&mdash;and he hurried across the sidewalk,
  and disappeared inside a saloon.</p>
  <p>Oaths, voicing a passion that rocked the Flopper to his soul, purled in
  a torrid stream from his lips, and for a moment made him forget the proximity
  of the brass buttons. He raised his fist, that still clenched some of the
  money, and shook it after the other&mdash;and his fist, uplifted in midair,
  was caught in a vicious grip&mdash;the harness bull was standing over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beat it!&rdquo; rasped the officer roughly, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;hullo,
  what you got here? Open your hand!&rdquo;&mdash;he gave a sharp twist as
  he spoke, the Flopper&rsquo;s fingers uncurled, and the money dropped into
  the policeman&rsquo;s other hand&mdash;held conveniently below the Flopper&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine&mdash;gimme it back,&rdquo; whined the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yours! Yours, is it!&rdquo; growled the officer. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d
  you get it? Stole it, eh? Go on, now, beat it&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll run you
  in! Beat it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With twitching fingers, the Flopper picked up his cap, placed it on his
  head and sidled away. Ten yards along, in the shadow of the buildings again,
  he looked back&mdash;the officer was still standing there, twirling his stick,
  one hand just emerging from his pocket. The Flopper&rsquo;s finger nails
  scratched along the stone pavement and curved into the palm of his hand until
  the skin under the knuckles was bloodless white, and his lips moved in ugly,
  whispered words&mdash;then, still whispering, he went on again.</p>
  <p>Down the Bowery he went like a human toad, keeping in the shadows, keeping
  his eyes on the ground before him, a glint like a shudder in their depths&mdash;on
  he went with hopping, lurching jerks, with whispering lips. Street after
  street he passed, and then at a corner he turned and went East&mdash;not
  far, only to the side entrance of the saloon on the corner known, to those
  who <i>knew</i>, as the &ldquo;Roost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door before which he stopped, on a level with the street, might readily
  have passed for the entrance to one of the adjoining tenements, for it was
  innocent to all appearances of any connection with the unlovely resort of
  which it was a part&mdash;and it was closed.</p>
  <p>The Flopper rang no bell. After a quick glance around him to assure himself
  that he was not observed, he reached up for the doorknob, turned it, and
  with surprising agility hopped over the threshold and closed the door behind
  him.</p>
  <p>A staircase, making one side of a narrow and dimly lighted hall, from down
  whose length came muffled sounds from the barroom, was before him; and this,
  without hesitation, the Flopper began to mount, his knee thumping from step
  to step, his dangling leg echoing the sound in a peculiar quick double thump.
  He reached the first landing, went along it, and started up the second flight&mdash;but
  now the thumping sound he made seemed accentuated intentionally, and upon
  his face there spread a grin of malicious humor.</p>
  <p>He halted before the door opposite the head of the second flight of stairs,
  opened it, wriggled inside and shut it behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, Helena!&rdquo; he snickered. &ldquo;Pipe me comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The room was a fairly large one, gaudily appointed with cheap furnishings,
  one of the Roost&rsquo;s private parlors&mdash;a girl on a couch in the corner
  had raised herself on her elbow, and her dark eyes were fixed uncompromisingly
  upon the Flopper, but she made no answer.</p>
  <p>The Flopper laughed&mdash;then a spasm seemed to run through him, a horrible
  boneless contortion of limbs and body, a slippery, twitching movement, a
  repulsive though almost inaudible clicking of rehabilitated joints&mdash;and
  the Flopper stood erect.</p>
  <p>The girl was on her feet, her eyes flashing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can that stunt!&rdquo; she cried angrily. &ldquo;You give me the
  shivers! Next time you throw your fit, you throw it before you come around
  me, or I&rsquo;ll make you wish you had&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper was swinging legs and arms to restore a normal channel of circulation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;oughter get used to it,&rdquo; said he, with a grin. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
  Pale Face Harry come yet, an&rsquo; where&rsquo;s the Doc?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behind the axe under the table,&rdquo; said the girl tartly&mdash;and
  flung herself back on the couch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;anks,&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;Say, Helena, wot&rsquo;s
  de new lay de Doc has got up his sleeve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena made no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is yer grouch painin&rsquo; you so&rsquo;s yer tongue&rsquo;s hurt?&rdquo; inquired
  the Flopper solicitously.</p>
  <p>Still no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, go to the devil!&rdquo; said the Flopper politely.</p>
  <p>He resumed the swinging of his arms and legs, but stopped suddenly a moment
  later as a step sounded outside in the hall and he turned expectantly.</p>
  <p>A young man, thin, emaciated, with gaunt, hollow face, abnormally bright
  eyes and sallow skin, entered. He was well, but modestly, dressed; and he
  coughed a little now, as though the two flights&rsquo; climb had overtaxed
  him&mdash;it was the man who had headed the subscription list to the Flopper
  half an hour before in front of Black Ike&rsquo;s Auditorium.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Helena!&rdquo; he greeted, nodding toward the touch. &ldquo;I
  shook the rubber-neck bunch at Ike&rsquo;s, Flopper. That was a peach of
  a haul, eh, old pal&mdash;the boobs came to it as though they couldn&rsquo;t
  get enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sudden and reminiscent scowl clouded the Flopper&rsquo;s face. He stepped
  to the table, reached his hand into his shirt, and flung down a single one-dollar
  bill and a few coins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dere&rsquo;s de haul, Harry&mdash;help yerself&rdquo;&mdash;his invitation
  was a snarl.</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry had followed to the table. He looked first at the money,
  then at the Flopper&mdash;and a tinge of red dyed his cheek. He coughed before
  he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t going to stall on <i>me</i>, Flopper, are you?&rdquo; he
  demanded, in an ominous monotone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stall!&rdquo;&mdash;the word came away in a roar too genuine to leave
  any doubt of the Flopper&rsquo;s sincerity, or the turbulent state of the
  Flopper&rsquo;s soul. &ldquo;Stall nothin&rsquo;! De driver held me up fer
  some of it, an&rsquo; de cop pinched de rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you the king of Floppers!&rdquo; breathed Pale Face Harry sadly. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
  hear that, Helena? Come over here and listen. Go ahead, Flopper, tell us
  about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena rose from the couch and came over to the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Flopper!&rdquo; said she sweetly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; snapped the Flopper savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; prompted Pale Face Harry. &ldquo;Go on, Flopper&mdash;tell
  us about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; growled the Flopper. &ldquo;De
  driver called a divvy wid de cop comin&rsquo;, an I had ter shell&mdash;an&rsquo; wot
  he left de cop pinched. Dat&rsquo;s all&rdquo;&mdash;the Flopper&rsquo;s
  mouth was working again with the rage that burned within him.</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry, with pointed forefinger, gingerly and facetiously laid
  the coins out in a row on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you the king of Floppers!&rdquo; he murmured softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  a wonder you didn&rsquo;t let the Salvation Army get the rest away from you
  on the way along!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena laughed&mdash;but the Flopper didn&rsquo;t. He stepped close to Pale
  Face Harry, and shoved his face within an inch of the other&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You close yer jaw,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll make yer
  map look like wot&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter happen ter dat cross-eyed snitch
  of a guy dat did me&mdash;him an&rsquo; de harness bull, when I&mdash;&rdquo; The
  Flopper stopped abruptly, and edged away from Pale Face Harry. &ldquo;Hullo,
  Doc,&rdquo; he said meekly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear youse comin&rsquo; in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A man, fair-haired, broad-shouldered, immaculate in well-tailored tweeds,
  reliant in poise, leaned nonchalantly against the door&mdash;inside the room.
  He was young, not more than twenty-eight, with clean-shaven, pleasant, open
  face&mdash;a handsome face, marred only to the close observer by the wrinkles
  beginning to pucker around his eyes, and a slight, scarcely discernible puffiness
  in his skin&mdash;&ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Madison, gentleman crook and high-class,
  polished con-man, who had lifted his profession to an art, was still too
  young to be indelibly stamped with the hallmarks of dissipation.</p>
  <p>His gray eyes travelled from one to another, lingered an instant on Helena,
  and came back to the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he demanded quietly.</p>
  <p>It was Pale Face Harry who answered him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Flopper&rsquo;s got it in for a couple of ginks that handed him
  one&mdash;a bull and a chauffeur on a gape-wagon,&rdquo; he grinned, punctuating
  his words with a cough. &ldquo;The Flopper&rsquo;s got an idea the corpse-preserver&rsquo;s
  business is dull, and he&rsquo;s going to help &rsquo;em out with two orders
  and pay for the flowers himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison shook his head and smiled a little grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forget it, Flopper!&rdquo; he said crisply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something
  better for you to do. You fade away, disappear and lay low from this minute.
  I don&rsquo;t care what you do when you&rsquo;re resurrected, but from now
  on the three of you are dead and buried, and the police go into mourning
  for at least six months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What you got for us, Doc?&mdash;something nice?&rdquo;&mdash;Helena
  pushed Pale Face Harry and the Flopper unceremoniously out of her line of
  vision as she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the drinks. Cleggy&rsquo;s bringing them,&rdquo; Madison
  laughed&mdash;and opened the door, as the tinkle of glass and a shuffling
  footstep sounded without.</p>
  <p>A man, big, hulking, thick-set and slouching, with shifty, cunning little
  black eyes and the face of a bruiser, his nose bent over and almost flattened
  down on one cheek, entered the room, carrying four glasses on a tin tray.
  He set down the tray, and, as he lifted the glasses from it and placed them
  on the table, he leered around at the little group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he said, sucking in his breath. &ldquo;De Doc, an&rsquo; Helena,
  an&rsquo; Pale Face, an&rsquo; de Flopper! Gee, dis looks like de real t&rsquo;ing&mdash;dis
  looks like biz.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does&mdash;fifty-cents&rsquo; worth&mdash;ten for yourself,&rdquo; said
  Doc Madison suavely, flipping the coin into the tray. &ldquo;Now, clear out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say&rdquo;&mdash;Cleggy put his forefinger significantly to the side
  of his nose&mdash;&ldquo;say, can&rsquo;t youse let a sport in on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clear out!&rdquo; Doc Madison broke in quite as suavely as before&mdash;but
  there was a sudden glint of steel in the gray eyes as they held the bruiser&rsquo;s,
  and Cleggy, hastily picking up the tray, scuffled from the room.</p>
  <p>Madison watched the door close, then he began to pace slowly up and down
  the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull the chairs up to the table so we can take things comfortably,&rdquo; he
  directed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t but two,&rdquo; grinned Pale Face Harry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, never mind,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;Slew the couch
  around and pull that up&mdash;Helena and I will sit on the head of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still pacing up and down the length of the room, his hands in his pockets,
  Doc Madison watched the others as they carried out his directions; and then,
  suddenly, as he neared the door, his hand shot out, wrenched the door open,
  and, quick as a panther in its spring, he was in the hall without.</p>
  <p>There was a yell, a scuffle, the rip and crash of rending bannisters, an
  instant&rsquo;s silence, then a heavy thud&mdash;and then Cleggy&rsquo;s
  voice from somewhere below in a choice and fervent flow of profanity.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison re-entered the room, closed the door, dispassionately arranged
  a disordered cuff, brushed a few particles of dust from his sleeves and shoulder,
  and, this done, started toward the table&mdash;and stopped.</p>
  <p>Helena had swung herself to the table edge, and, glass in hand, dangling
  her neatly shod little feet, was smoking a cigarette, her brown hair with
  a glint of amber in it, her dark eyes veiled now by their heavy lashes; on
  the other side of the table Pale Face Harry coughed, as, with sleeve rolled
  back, he was intent on the hypodermic needle he was pushing into his arm;
  while the Flopper, his eyes with a dog-like admiration in them fixed on Madison,
  stood facing the door, a grotesque, unpleasant figure, unkempt, unshaven,
  furtive-faced, his rags hanging disreputably about him, his trousers with
  their frayed edges, now that he stood upright, reaching far above his boot
  tops and flagrantly exposing his wretched substitutes for socks.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison reached thoughtfully into his pocket, brought out a silver cigarette
  case, and carefully selected a cigarette from amongst its fellows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; Cleggy was right,&rdquo; he said softly, tapping the end of
  the cigarette on his thumb nail. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the real thing&mdash;the
  real, real thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  A New Cult</b></h2>
  <p>DOC MADISON swung Helena lightly down from the table to the head of the
  couch, sat down beside her, one arm circling her waist, and motioned the
  Flopper to a chair&mdash;then he leaned forward and watched Pale Face Harry
  critically, as the latter carefully replaced the shining little hypodermic
  in its case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said he abruptly, jerking his free hand toward the
  hypodermic, &ldquo;could you give up that dope-needle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I could&mdash;if I wanted to!&rdquo; asserted Pale Face Harry
  defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Madison cheerfully. &ldquo;Because
  you&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;&mdash;Pale Face Harry stared at Doc Madison in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ll have to&mdash;by and by,&rdquo; said Madison
  coolly. &ldquo;And how about that cough&mdash;can you quit coughing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m dead&mdash;which won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; sniffed
  Pale Face Harry. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think I cough because I like it? How&rsquo;m
  I going to quit coughing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Doc Madison, frowning seriously. &ldquo;I
  only know you&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry, with jaw dropped, accentuating the gaunt leanness of his
  hollow-cheeked, emaciated face, gazed at Doc Madison with a curious mingling
  of incredulity and affront&mdash;and coughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he inquired grimly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison took his arm from Helena&rsquo;s waist, pulled a newspaper from
  his pocket, spread it out on the table&mdash;and his manner changed suddenly&mdash;enthusiasm
  was in his eyes, his voice, his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve steered you three through a few deals,&rdquo; said he
  impressively, &ldquo;that have sized up big enough to keep you out of the
  raw vaudeville turn you, Harry, and you, Flopper, are so fond of, and that
  would have put Helena here on easy street, if you hadn&rsquo;t blown in all
  you got about ten minutes after you got your hands on it&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve
  got one here that sizes up so big you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to spend the
  money fast enough to close out your bank account if you did your damnedest!
  Get that? It&rsquo;s the greatest cinch that ever came down from the gateway
  of heaven&mdash;and that&rsquo;s where it came from&mdash;heaven. It couldn&rsquo;t
  have come from anywhere else&mdash;it&rsquo;s too good. And it&rsquo;s new,
  bran new&mdash;it&rsquo;s never had the string cut or the wrapper taken off.
  It&rsquo;s got anything that was ever run beaten by more laps than there
  are in the track, and it&rsquo;s got a purse tied on to the end of it that&rsquo;s
  the biggest ever offered since Adam. But you&rsquo;ve got to work for it,
  and that&rsquo;s what I brought you here for to-night&mdash;to learn your
  little pieces so&rsquo;s you can say &rsquo;em nice and cute when you get
  up on the platform before the audience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper&rsquo;s tongue made a greedy circuit of his upper and under
  lips, and he hitched his chair closer to the table.</p>
  <p>A flush spread over Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s cheeks, and his eyes, abnormally
  bright, grew brighter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Doc,&rdquo; he assured Doc Madison anxiously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;U-uu-mm!&rdquo; cooed Helena excitedly. &ldquo;Go on, Doc&mdash;go
  on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Doc Madison, his voice lowered a little. &ldquo;I
  found this tucked away as a filler in a corner of the newspaper this evening.
  It&rsquo;s headed, &lsquo;A New Cult,&rsquo; with an interrogation mark after
  it. Now listen, while I read it:&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">A NEW CULT?</p>
  <p>Needley, Maine, offers no attraction for aspiring young medical men. One
  who tried it recently, and who pulled down his shingle in disgust after a
  week, says competition is too strong, as the village is obsessed with the
  belief that they have a sort of faith-healer in their midst to whom is attributed
  cures of all descriptions stretching back for a generation or more. The healer,
  he adds, who rejoices in the name of the Patriarch and lives in solitude
  a mile or so from the village, is something of an anomaly in himself, being
  both deaf and dumb. We&mdash; &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all that interests
  us,&rdquo; said Doc Madison, as he stopped reading abruptly and lifted his
  head to scrutinize his companions quizzically. Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s eyes
  had lost their gleam and dulled&mdash;he gaped reproachfully at Doc Madison.
  Helena&rsquo;s small mouth drooped downward in a disappointed <i>moue</i>.
  Only the Flopper evidenced enthusiastic response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he chortled. &ldquo;Sure t&rsquo;ing! I see. De old
  geezer&rsquo;ll have a pile of shekels hid away, an&rsquo; he lives by his
  lonesome a mile from de town. We sneaks down dere, croaks de guy wid de queer
  monaker, an&rsquo; beats it wid de shekels&mdash;sure!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison turned a sad gray eye on the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flopper,&rdquo; said he pathetically, &ldquo;your soul, like your
  bones, runs to rank realism. No; we don&rsquo;t &lsquo;croak de guy&rsquo;&mdash;we
  cherish him, we nurse him, we fondle him. He&rsquo;s our one best bet, and
  we fold him to our breasts tenderly, and we protect him from all harm and
  danger and sudden death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper blinked a little helplessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; said the Flopper, &ldquo;I got de wrong dope. Some
  of dem words you read I ain&rsquo;t hip to. Wot&rsquo;s anymaly mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anomaly?&rdquo;&mdash;Doc Madison reached for his glass, tossed off
  the contents and set it down. &ldquo;It means, Flopper, in this particular
  instance,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;that there shouldn&rsquo;t be any
  interrogation point after the heading.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the Flopper blinked helplessly&mdash;and his fingers picked uncertainly
  at the stubble on his chin. The other two gazed disconsolately&mdash;and
  Helena a little pityingly as well&mdash;at Doc Madison.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison flung out his arms suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you all?&rdquo; he demanded sarcastically. &ldquo;You
  look as though your faces pained you! What&rsquo;s the matter with you? You&rsquo;re
  bright enough ordinarily, Helena, and, Harry, you&rsquo;re no dub&mdash;what&rsquo;s
  the matter with you? Can&rsquo;t you see it&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see it!
  Why, it&rsquo;s sticking out a mile&mdash;it&rsquo;s <i>waiting</i> for us!
  The whole plant&rsquo;s there and all we&rsquo;ve got to do is get steam
  under the boilers. We&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em coming for the cure from every
  State in the Union, and begging us to let them throw their diamond tiaras
  at us for a look-in at the shrine. Don&rsquo;t you see it&mdash;can&rsquo;t
  you get it&mdash;can&rsquo;t you <i>get</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena bent suddenly over Doc Madison&rsquo;s shoulder, her eyes opening
  wide with dawning comprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cure?&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;the cure,&rdquo; said Doc Madison earnestly. &ldquo;The
  new cult&mdash;that&rsquo;s us. Get the people talking, show &rsquo;em something,
  and you&rsquo;ll have to put up fences and &lsquo;keep off the grass&rsquo; signs
  to stop the lame and the halt and the blind and the neurasthenics from crowding
  and suffocating to death for want of air. We&rsquo;ll start a shrine down
  there that&rsquo;ll be a winner, and the railroads will be running excursion-rate
  pilgrimages inside of two months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s chair creaked, as, like the Flopper, he now crowded
  it in toward the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I get you!&rdquo; said he feverishly. &ldquo;I get you! I&rsquo;ve
  read about them shrines&mdash;only you gotter have churches, and a carload
  of crutches, and that sort of thing laying around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison smiled pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; you&rsquo;ve got me, Harry&mdash;only we&rsquo;ll do the stage
  setting a little differently. Mostly what is required is&mdash;faith. Get
  them going on that, and everybody that&rsquo;s sick or near-sick in this
  great United States, that&rsquo;s got the swellest collection of boobs and
  millionaires on earth, will swarm thitherward like bees&mdash;there won&rsquo;t
  be any one left in the sanatoriums throughout the length of this broad land
  of freedom but the bell boys and the elevator men. Get them going, and all
  we&rsquo;ve got to do is look out we don&rsquo;t let anything get by us in
  the crush&mdash;a snowball rolling down hill will size up like a plugged
  nickel alongside of a twenty-dollar gold piece when it gets to the bottom,
  compared with what we start rolling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, too,&rdquo; said Helena. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
  see where the faith is coming from, or how you&rsquo;re going to get them
  coming. You&rsquo;ve got to show them&mdash;you said so yourself&mdash;even
  the boobs. How are you going to do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Doc Madison placidly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll start
  the show with&mdash;a miracle. I haven&rsquo;t thought of anything more effective
  than that so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; inquired Pale Face Harry, with a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A miracle,&rdquo; repeated Doc Madison imperturbably. &ldquo;A miracle&mdash;with
  the Flopper here in the star r&ocirc;le. The Flopper goes down there all
  tied up in knots, the high priest, alias the deaf and dumb healer, alias
  the Patriarch, lays his soothing hands upon him, the Flopper uncoils into
  something that looks like a human being&mdash;and the trumpets blow, the
  band plays, and the box office opens for receipts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena slid from her seat, and, with hands on the edge of the table, advanced
  her piquant little face close to Doc Madison&rsquo;s, staring at him, breathing
  hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say that again,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Say that again&mdash;say
  it just once more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s hand, trembling visibly with emotion, was thrust
  out across the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put it there, Doc,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
  <p>The Flopper, practical, earnestly so, lifted his right arm, wriggled it
  a little and began to twist it around, as though it were on a pivot at the
  elbow, preparatory to drawing it in, a crippled thing, toward his chin.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison reached out hurriedly and stopped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, that&rsquo;ll do, Flopper,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t need any rehearsal to hold your job&mdash;you&rsquo;re down for
  the number and your check&rsquo;s written out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said the Flqpper to the universe. &ldquo;I can smell
  de pine woods of Maine in me nostrils now. When does I beat it, Doc&mdash;to-morrer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Flopper, not to-morrow&mdash;nor for several to-morrows&mdash;not
  till the bill-posters get through, and the stage is dark, and you can hear
  a pin drop in the house. I don&rsquo;t want you camping out and catching
  cold and missing any of the luxuries you&rsquo;re accustomed to, so I&rsquo;ll
  start along ahead in a day or so myself and see what kind of accommodations
  I can secure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me! &ldquo; said the Flopper again. &ldquo;An&rsquo; to think
  of me wastin&rsquo; me talent on rubber-neck fleets!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A puzzled little frown puckered Helena&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking about the deaf and dumb man,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;How
  about him, when we pull this off&mdash;will he stand for it&mdash;and what&rsquo;ll
  he do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; said Pale Face Harry impatiently. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t
  count! He&rsquo;ll have bats in his belfry anyway, and if he ain&rsquo;t
  he&rsquo;ll go off his chump for fair getting stuck on himself when he sees
  the stunt he&rsquo;ll think he&rsquo;s done. He&rsquo;ll be looking for the
  wings between his shoulder blades, and hunting for the halo around his head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry is waking up,&rdquo; observed Doc Madison affably. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  about the idea, Helena. I haven&rsquo;t seen the Patriarch yet, but I don&rsquo;t
  imagine from his description that it&rsquo;ll be very hard to make him believe
  in himself. He doesn&rsquo;t stand for anything&mdash;we don&rsquo;t deal
  him any cards&mdash;he&rsquo;s just the kitty that circles around with the
  jackpots while we annex the chips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison reached into his vest pocket, took out a penknife whose handle
  was gold-chased, opened it, and very carefully cut the article he had read
  from the paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flopper,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heard of gold bonds,
  haven&rsquo;t you? &ldquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper&rsquo;s eyes gleamed an eloquent response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only you&rsquo;ve never had any, eh?&rdquo; supplied Doc Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d I get &rsquo;em?&rdquo; inquired the Flopper, with
  some bitterness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; smiled Doc Madison, handing, him the clipping. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
  a trainload and a bank vault full of them combined. Put it away, Flopper,
  and don&rsquo;t lose it. Lose anything you&rsquo;ve got first&mdash;lose
  your life. It&rsquo;s worth a private car to you with a buffet full of fizz,
  and Sambo to wait on you for the rest of your life. Get that? Don&rsquo;t
  lose it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper tucked the clipping into the mysterious recess of his shirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;if you say so, Doc, it&rsquo;ll
  be here when dey plant me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Flopper,&rdquo; nodded Doc Madison. &ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s
  get down to cases. I&rsquo;ve been able to pay my club dues lately, and there&rsquo;s
  money enough on deck to buy the costumes and put the show on the road. I
  start for Needley as soon as I can get away. When I&rsquo;m ready for the
  support, you three will hear from me&mdash;and in the meantime you lay low.
  Nothing doing&mdash;understand? You&rsquo;ll get all the lime-light you want
  before you&rsquo;re through, and it&rsquo;s just as well not to show up so
  familiar when they throw the spot on you that even the school kids will know
  the date of your birth, and the population will start in squabbling over
  the choice of reserved niches for you in the Hall of Fame. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper, Pale Face Harry and Helena modded their heads with one accord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give us the whole lay, Doc,&rdquo; urged Pale Face Harry. &ldquo;And
  give it to us quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me mouth&rsquo;s waterin&rsquo;,&rdquo; observed the Flopper, licking
  his lips again.</p>
  <p>Helena lighted another cigarette, and swung herself back to her perch on
  the head of the couch.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison surveyed the three with mingled admiration and delight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The world is ours!&rdquo; he murmured softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, hurry up and give us the rest of it,&rdquo; purred Helena. &ldquo;We
  know we&rsquo;re an all-star cast, all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Doc Madison&mdash;and laughed. &ldquo;Well
  then, the order of your stage cues will depend on circumstances and what
  turns up down there, but we&rsquo;ll start with the Flopper now. First of
  all, Flopper, you&rsquo;ve got to have a name. What&rsquo;s your real name&mdash;what
  did they decorate you with at the baptismal font back in the dark ages?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper scrubbed at his very dirty chin with a very dirty thumb and
  forefinger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the Flopper anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; said Doc Madison reassuringly. &ldquo;Maybe
  you are blessed above most people&mdash;you can pick one out for yourself.
  What&rsquo;ll it be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper&rsquo;s thumb and forefinger scratched desperately for a moment,
  then his face lightest with inspiration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said he excitedly. &ldquo;I got it&mdash;Jimmy de
  Squirm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison shook his head gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Flopper, I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  another weak point in your interpretation of the r&ocirc;le, that I&rsquo;ll
  come to in a minute. We&rsquo;ll give you an Irish name by way of charity&mdash;it&rsquo;ll
  help to make your classical English sound like brogue. We&rsquo;ll call you
  Coogan&mdash;Michael Coogan&mdash;that lets you off with plain Mike in times
  of stress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said the Flopper, with perfect complacence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad it pleases you,&rdquo; smiled Doc Madison. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
  your lay, then. You&rsquo;ve got to remember that you were born crooked and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena giggled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it&rdquo;&mdash;Doc Madison&rsquo;s gray eyes
  twinkled. &ldquo;You are waking up, too, Helena. I mean, Flopper, you&rsquo;ve
  got to remember that you were born twisted up into the same shape you are
  in when you hit Needley. You come from&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
  have to have a big city where the next door neighbors pass each other with
  a vacant stare. Ever been in Chicago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw! Wot fer?&rdquo; said the Flopper, with withering spontaneity. &ldquo;Noo
  Yoik fer mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all right&mdash;New York it is, then,&rdquo; agreed Doc Madison. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  poor, but respectable&mdash;and that brings us to the other point. Before
  you go down there, Helena&rsquo;s going to start a little night-school with
  a grammar, and teach you to paddle along the fringe of the great American
  language so&rsquo;s you won&rsquo;t fall in and get wet all over every time
  you open your mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo; exclaimed Helena. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be nice!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Doc Madison drily. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
  run away with the idea that I&rsquo;m joking about this&mdash;that goes.
  I don&rsquo;t expect to make a silver-tongued orator out of you, Flopper,
  and perhaps not even a purist&mdash;but I hope to eradicate a few minor touches
  of Bad Land vernacular from your vocabulary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotcher&mdash;swipe me!&rdquo; grinned the Flopper. &ldquo;Me
  at school! Say, wouldn&rsquo;t that put a smile on de maps of de harness
  bulls, an&rsquo; de dips, an&rsquo; de lags doin&rsquo; spaces up de river!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; admitted Doc Madison pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t laugh when I get through with you,&rdquo; remarked
  Helena, her eyes on the curl of smoke from her cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one more thing,&rdquo; went on Doc Madison, &ldquo;and
  I&rsquo;m through with you, Flopper. Don&rsquo;t come down there looking
  like a skate&mdash;that&rsquo;s too raw. Get new clothes and a shave&mdash;and
  keep shaved. And from the minute you buy your ticket, you keep your bones,
  or whatever a beneficent nature has given you in place of them, out of joint&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hip,&rdquo; declared the Flopper&mdash;and the dog-like
  admiration for Doc Madison burned in his eyes. &ldquo;Say, Doc, youse are
  de&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Flopper,&rdquo; Madison cut in brightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  getting late. Now, Harry, about you. You&rsquo;ve got a name, I believe.
  Evans, isn&rsquo;t it? Yes&mdash;well, that will do. Now, don&rsquo;t kill
  yourself at it, but the more you work your dope needle overtime before you
  start, and the harder you cough when you first land there the better. We&rsquo;ve
  got to have variety, you know. You&rsquo;re a physical wreck with the folks
  back home sending the casket and trimmings after you on the next train In
  care of the station agent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; coughed Pale Face Harry, with a sickly smile, &ldquo;I
  look the part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You certainly do,&rdquo; said Helena cheerfully, beating a tattoo
  with her heels on the end of the couch.</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry scowled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no artist with the paint,&rdquo; he sniffed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t paint,&rdquo; said Helena sweetly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  rouge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you through?&rdquo; inquired Doc Madison patiently. &ldquo;Because,
  if you are, I&rsquo;ll go on. When the train whistles for Needley, Harry,
  you put the soft pedal on the dope&mdash;that ought to help some. And then
  you begin to taper that cough off and become a cure&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t like the Flopper,&rdquo; said Pale Face Harry ruefully. &ldquo;I
  told you once I can&rsquo;t stop the hack, and I ask you again how&rsquo;m
  I going to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have faith in the Patriarch,&rdquo; suggested Helena innocently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You close your trap!&rdquo; exclaimed Pale Face Harry savagely; then,
  to Madison: &ldquo;Go on, Doc&mdash;it&rsquo;s up to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doc Madison coolly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to you.
  You&rsquo;ve got to try, and if you can&rsquo;t stop altogether you can make
  yourself scarce when you feel the fit coming on&mdash;you won&rsquo;t have
  to climb up on the grandstand and cough in people&rsquo;s faces, you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He might carry a screen around with him and cough behind that,&rdquo; volunteered
  Helena. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough about the Flopper and Pale Face&mdash;what
  about muh? Where do I get off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; said Doc Madison calmly. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a moral
  neurasthenic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that when it&rsquo;s at home?&rdquo; demanded Helena
  sharply.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison threw out his hands in a comically helpless, impotent gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what we need to keep up the standard of variety,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing to the masses. Don&rsquo;t you like the
  r&ocirc;le, Helena&mdash;it&rsquo;s the leading woman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do I do?&rdquo; countered Helena non-conmittingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; echoed Doc Madison. &ldquo;Why, you go down there like
  a whole parade and a gorgeous pageant rolled into one, in feathers and paint
  and diamond boulders in your ears&mdash;and you come out of it in a gingham
  apron and coy sunbonnet as sweet sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Helena&mdash;and her eyes were on the curl of smoke
  from her cigarette again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Pale Face Harry suddenly, evidently still worried
  about his cough, &ldquo;we ain&rsquo;t going to have no easy cinch of this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doc Madison, with a grim smiles &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
  not! It&rsquo;s going to be the hardest work any of you have ever done&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
  got to lead decent lives for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;dat&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the loyal Flopper; &ldquo;but
  we stands fer anyt&rsquo;ing dat de Doc says&mdash;an&rsquo; dat goes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come hard on some of us,&rdquo; remarked Pale Face Harry,
  with a sly glance at Helena, which met with contemptuous silence.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison leaned back, felt carefully at his carefully adjusted tie and&mdash;smiled
  engagingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Can you see them coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry stared at him with a far-away expression in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When we get through with this, if I ain&rsquo;t handed in my checks
  before,&rdquo; he said dreamily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mine for a brownstone
  on the Avenue, and one of them life-size landscapes with a shack on it for
  the season down to Pa&rsquo;m Beach that they call country cottages. I&rsquo;ll
  dress the ginks that scrub the horses down in solid gold braid, and put the
  corpse of chamber ladies in Irish lace&mdash;I bust into society, marry a
  duke&rsquo;s one and only, and swipe her coronet for my manly brow. Did you
  ask me anything, Doc?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;Me in me private Pullman
  in a plush seat an&rsquo; anudder to put me feet in, an&rsquo; me thumbs
  in de armholes of me vest. I wears a high polished lid an&rsquo; a red tie,
  an&rsquo; scatters simoleans outer de window in me travels to the gazaboes
  on de platforms as I pass&mdash;an&rsquo; den I joins Tammany Hall so&rsquo;s
  I can stick me fingers to me nose every time I sees a cop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flopper,&rdquo; said Doc Madison in an awed voice, &ldquo;the honor
  is all mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena went off into a peal of rippling, silvery, contagious laughter, and
  her little heels again beat an exuberant tattoo on the end of the couch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; invited Doc Madison, smiling at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing them coming,&rdquo; said Helena&mdash;and one heel
  went through the cretonne upholstery of the couch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Doc Madison&mdash;and from the inside pocket of
  his coat he pulled out a package of crisp, new, yellow-backed bills. &ldquo;You
  understand that down there none of you ever heard of each other or of me
  before, and you drop the &lsquo;doc&rsquo;&mdash;bury it! My name is John
  G. Madison&mdash;G. for Garfield.&rdquo; His fingers passed deftly over the
  edges of the bills. He pushed a little pile toward the Flopper, another toward
  Pale Face Harry, and tucked the remainder into his coat pocket again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll
  do for expenses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And now, if you understand everything,
  principally that you&rsquo;re to go to church Sundays till you hear from
  me, and you&rsquo;re quite satisfied with the lay, we&rsquo;ll adjourn, <i>sine
  die</i>, to Needley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena was holding out a very dainty hand, with pink, wiggling fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need, oh, ever so much more than they will,&rdquo; she
  declared, with a bewitching pout. &ldquo;And, please, I&rsquo;m waiting very
  patiently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By and by, Helena,&rdquo; he said, patting her hand. &ldquo;Well,
  Flopper, well, Harry&mdash;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper pushed back his chair and stood up hesitantly like a man unexpectedly
  called upon for an after-dinner speech. He stood there awkwardly a moment
  gazing at Doc Madison, his tongue slowly circling his lips; then, with a
  gulp, as though words to express his feelings were utterly beyond him, he
  turned and started for the door.</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry, as he rose, shoved out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve my luck to be in on this,&rdquo; he said modestly. &ldquo;Only,
  Doc, push it along on the high gear, will you&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t going to
  be able to sleep thinking about it.&rdquo; He looked at Helena a little undecidedly&mdash;and
  compromised on brevity. &ldquo;&lsquo;Night, Helena,&rdquo; he flung out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, good-night, Harry,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
  <p>The Flopper turned at the door and came back a few steps into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Doc,&rdquo; he said, blinking furiously, &ldquo;youse can wipe
  yer feet on me any time youse like&mdash;dat&rsquo;s wot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Flopper,&rdquo; said Doc Madison gravely. &ldquo;When
  you&rsquo;ve joined Tammany Hall&mdash;good-night.&rdquo; He followed across
  the room, and from the doorway watched the two descend the stairs. &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he
  said again, then closed the door and came back into the room. &ldquo;Well,
  Helena?&rdquo; he remarked tentatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;Garfield?&rdquo;&mdash;Helena clasped her hands around
  one knee and rocked gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be familiar, Helena,&rdquo; Doc Madison chuckled. &ldquo;Is
  that all you&rsquo;ve got to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy thinking about The Great American Play,&rdquo; she
  said pertly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you forgot&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked, still smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The curtain on the last act,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The getaway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc Madison shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no getaway.
  It&rsquo;s safe&mdash;so safe that there&rsquo;s nothing to it. We don&rsquo;t
  guarantee anything, and there&rsquo;s no entrance fee to the pavilion&mdash;all
  contributions are strictly voluntary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Helena. &ldquo;But of course
  we can&rsquo;t really cure them. We can get them going hard enough to make
  them think they are for awhile, but after they&rsquo;ve thrown away their
  crutches and got back home&mdash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; inquired Doc Madison easily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll yell &lsquo;fake!&rsquo; and swear out warrants,&rdquo; said
  Helena, her dark eyes studying Doc Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not according to statistics,&rdquo; replied Doc Madison, and his
  lips twitched quizzically at the corners. &ldquo;According to statistics
  they&rsquo;ll buy another crutch and come back to buck the tiger again. Say,
  Helena, to-morrow, you go up to the public library and read up on shrines&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
  been running since the ark&mdash;and they&rsquo;re running still. You never
  heard any howl about them, did you? What&rsquo;s the answer to those cures?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; said Helena. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s religion,
  and they&rsquo;ve got relics and things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s faith,&rdquo; said Doc Madison, &ldquo;and it doesn&rsquo;t
  matter what the basis of it is. Faith, Helena, <i>faith</i>&mdash;get that?
  And we&rsquo;re going to imbue them with a faith that&rsquo;ll set them crazy
  and send them into hysterics. And talk about relics! Haven&rsquo;t we got
  one? Look at the Patriarch! Can&rsquo;t you see the whole town yelling &lsquo;I
  told you so!&rsquo; and swopping testimonials hard enough to crowd the print
  down so fine, if you tried to get it all into the papers, that you&rsquo;d
  have to use a magnifying glass to read it, once we&rsquo;ve pulled off the
  miracle? Don&rsquo;t you worry about the getaway. If there&rsquo;s any sign
  of anything like that, you and I, Helena, will be taking moonlight rides
  in the gondolas of Venice long before it breaks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena choked&mdash;and began to laugh deliciously.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison stared at her for a moment whimsically&mdash;then he, too, burst
  into a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; he gurgled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rich, isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo; And sweeping Helena off the couch and into his arms, he began
  to dance around and around the table. &ldquo;Ring-around-a-rosy!&rdquo; he
  cried. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done so bad in the misty past, but here&rsquo;s
  where we cross to the enchanted shore and play on jewelled harps with golden
  strings and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; gasped Helena, laughing and breathless, as at
  last she pulled herself away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; panted Doc Madison. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a table I&rsquo;ve
  reserved up at the Rivoli that&rsquo;s waiting for us now. We&rsquo;re about
  to part for days and days, lady mine, that&rsquo;s the tough luck of it,
  but we&rsquo;ll make a night of it to-night anyway&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said Helena, doing a cake-walk towards the door. &ldquo;Come
  on!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Needley</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;NEEDLEY?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t wholly an interrogation&mdash;it seemed to Madison that
  there was even sympathy in the parlor-car conductor&rsquo;s voice, as the
  other took his seat check.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Health,&rdquo; said Madison meekly. &ldquo;Perfect rest and quiet&mdash;been
  overdoing it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Needley!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the train conductor of the Bar Harbor
  Express, collecting the transportation, threw the word at Madison as though
  it were a personal affront.</p>
  <p>The tone seemed to demand an apology from Madison&mdash;and Madison apologized.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Health,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;Perfect rest and quiet&mdash;been
  overdoing it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re five minutes late now,&rdquo; grunted the conductor uncompromisingly
  and, to Madison, quite irrelevantly, as he passed on down the aisle.</p>
  <p>Somehow, this inspired Madison to consult his timetable. He drew it from
  his pocket, ran his eye down the long list of stations&mdash;and stopped
  at &ldquo;Needley.&rdquo; Needley had an asterisk after it. By consulting
  a block of small type at the bottom of the page, he found a corresponding
  asterisk with the words: &ldquo;Flag station. Stops only on signal, or to
  discharge eastbound passengers from Portland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>John Garfield Madison went into the smoking compartment of the car for a
  cigar&mdash;several cigars&mdash;until Needley was reached some two hours
  later, when the dusky attendant, as he pocketed Madison&rsquo;s dollar, set
  down his little rubber-topped footstool with a flourish on a desolate and
  forbidding-looking platform.</p>
  <p>Madison was neither surprised nor dismayed&mdash;the parlor-car conductor,
  the train conductor and the timetable had in no way attempted to deceive
  him&mdash;he was only cold. He turned up his coat collar&mdash;and blew on
  his kid-gloved fingers.</p>
  <p>As far as he could see everything was white with a thin layer of snow&mdash;he
  kicked some of it off his toes onto the unshovelled platform. The landscape
  was disconsolately void of even a vestige of life, there was not a sign of
  habitation&mdash;just woods of bare trees, except the firs, whose green seemed
  out of place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have arrived,&rdquo; said John Garfield Madison to himself, &ldquo;at
  a cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a very small station, and through the window he caught sight of
  a harassed-faced, red-haired man. There was a thump, another one, a very
  vicious one&mdash;and Madison stirred uneasily&mdash;the train, with its
  five minutes&rsquo; delinquency hanging over it, was already moving out,
  as his trunks, from the baggage car ahead, shot unceremoniously to the platform.
  Madison watched a man, the sole occupant of the platform apart from himself,
  save the trunks from rolling under the wheels of the train; then his eyes
  fastened on a rickety, two-seated wagon, drawn by a horse that at first glance
  appeared to earn all it got.</p>
  <p>The train left the platform&mdash;and left quite as uninviting a perspective
  on the other side of the track as had previously greeted Madison&rsquo;s
  restricted view. But now the man who had salvaged his baggage came down the
  platform toward him. Madison inspected the approaching figure with interest.
  The man ambled along without haste, his jaws wagging industriously upon his
  tobacco, his iron-gray chin whiskers, from the wagging, flapping like a burgee
  in a breeze. He wore a round fur cap, quite bare of fur at the edges where
  the pelt showed shiny, and a red woollen tippet was tied round his neck and
  knotted at the back with the ends dangling down over his coat. The coat itself,
  a long one of some fuzzy material, with huge side pockets into which the
  man&rsquo;s hands were plunged, reached to the cavernous tops of jackboots
  where the nether ends of his trousers were stowed away.</p>
  <p>The man halted before Madison, and, reaching a mittened hand under his chin,
  reflectively lifted his whiskers to an acute angle, while his blue eyes over
  the rims of steel-bowed spectacles wandered from Madison to Madison&rsquo;s
  dress-suit case and back to Madison again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be you goin&rsquo; to git off here?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
  <p>Madison smiled at him engagingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care to have it known,
  but if you can keep a secret&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hee-hee!&rdquo; tittered the other. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s right
  smart, that be. Waren&rsquo;t expectin&rsquo; nobody to meet you, was you?
  I ain&rsquo;t heerd of none of the folks lookin&rsquo; for visitors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a hotel in the
  town, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;The Waalderf an&rsquo; the
  Congress, but the Waalderf ain&rsquo;t done a sight of business since we
  got pro&rsquo;bition in the State an&rsquo; has kinder got run down. I reckon
  the Congress&rsquo;ll suit you best if you ain&rsquo;t against payin&rsquo; a
  mite more, which I reckon you ain&rsquo;t for I see you come down in the
  parler car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; asked Madison, &ldquo;does the Congress charge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;ordinary, it&rsquo;s a dollar
  a day or five dollars a week, but this bein&rsquo; off season an&rsquo; nobody
  there, &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Walt &rsquo;ud kind of shade
  the price for you&mdash;Waalderf&rsquo;s three an&rsquo; a half a week. Them
  your duds up the platform? I&rsquo;ll drive you over for forty cents. What
  was it you said your name was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forty cents is a most disinterested offer, and I accept it heartily,&rdquo; said
  Madison affably. &ldquo;And my name&rsquo;s Madison&mdash;John Garfield Madison,
  from New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s Higgins,&rdquo; volunteered the other. &ldquo;Hiram
  Higgins, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m postmaster an&rsquo; town constable of Needley.
  An&rsquo; now, Mr. Madison, I reckon we&rsquo;ll just get these effects of
  your&rsquo;n onto the wagon an&rsquo; move along&mdash;folks&rsquo;ll be
  gettin&rsquo; kinder rambunctious for their mail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hiram Higgins backed the democrat around, roped the baggage onto the tail-board,
  picked up the hungry-looking mail-bag from where the mail clerk had slung
  it from the car to the platform, threw it down in front of the dashboard,
  and got in after it. Madison clambered into the back seat, and they bumped
  off along the road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had a mite of snow night before last,&rdquo; observed Mr. Higgins,
  pointing it out with his whip, as he settled himself comfortably. &ldquo;Kinder
  reckoned we&rsquo;d got rid of it for good till next fall till this come
  along, but you can&rsquo;t never tell. What was it you said brought you down
  here, Mr. Madison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rest and quiet&mdash;complete change,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nervous
  breakdown, according to the doctors&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they always call
  it, you know, when they can&rsquo;t find any other name for it. I&rsquo;ve
  been overdoing it, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be that so!&rdquo; returned Mr. Higgins sympathetically. &ldquo;I
  want to know! Well, now, that&rsquo;s too bad! Lookin&rsquo; for quiet, be
  you? Well, I reckon mabbe folks don&rsquo;t scurry around here quite so lively
  as they do in some of the bigger towns like Noo York, but there&rsquo;s a
  tolerable lot goin&rsquo; on most every week, church festivals, an&rsquo; spellin&rsquo; bees,
  an&rsquo; such. Folks here is right hospitable, but you ain&rsquo;t in no
  way obliged to join in if you don&rsquo;t feel up to it. I&rsquo;ll explain
  matters to &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; Hiram Higgins stopped, excitedly
  gathered reins and whip into one hand, and with the other smote his knee
  a resounding whack. &ldquo;Well, I swan!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I
  never thought of it until this minute! I reckon you&rsquo;ve come to just
  the right place, and just as soon as you get settled you go right out an&rsquo; see
  the Patriarch&mdash;you won&rsquo;t need no more doctor, an&rsquo; folks
  up your way won&rsquo;t know when you go back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Patriarch?&rdquo; inquired Madison, with a puzzled air. &ldquo;Who
  is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s
  the Patriarch. Been curin&rsquo; us folks around here longer&rsquo;n any
  one can remember&mdash;just does it by faith, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison shook his head slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might just as well be frank with you, Mr. Higgins,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  never taken much stock in faith cure and that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Higgins deeply, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t
  had much experience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed Madison reflectively; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;I
  haven&rsquo;t had any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, you just wait an&rsquo; see,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins,
  waving his mittened hand as though the whole matter were conclusively settled. &ldquo;You
  just wait an&rsquo; see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; prodded
  Madison innocently. &ldquo;What kind of cures does he perform?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They turned a right-angled bend in the road, disclosing a straggling hamlet
  in a hollow below, and, farther away in the distance, a sweep of ocean.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most any kind,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Needley
  now. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is ask the first person you see about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madison, &ldquo;but take yourself, for instance.
  Did this Patriarch ever do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins impressively. &ldquo;An&rsquo; &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
  but last week. I&rsquo;m glad you asked me. For two nights I couldn&rsquo;t
  sleep. Had the earache powerful. Poured hot oil an&rsquo; laud&rsquo;num
  into it, an&rsquo; kept a hot brick rolled up in flannel against it, but
  didn&rsquo;t do no good. Then Mrs. Higgins says, &lsquo;Hiram, why in the
  land&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t you go out an&rsquo; see the Patriarch?&rsquo; An&rsquo; I
  hitched right up, an&rsquo; every step that horse took I could feel it gettin&rsquo; better,
  an&rsquo; I wasn&rsquo;t five minutes with the Patriarch before I was cured,
  an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t had a twinge since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It certainly looks as though there were something in that,&rdquo; admitted
  Madison cautiously.</p>
  <p>Hiram Higgins smiled a world of tolerance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t worth mentionin&rsquo; alongside some of the
  things he&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he said deprecatingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
  hear about &rsquo;em fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the local doctor say about it?&rdquo; asked Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t enough pickin&rsquo;s to keep a doctor here, though
  some of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s tried,&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Higgins. &ldquo;Have
  to have &rsquo;em for <i>some</i> things, of course&mdash;an&rsquo; then
  he drives over from Barton&rsquo;s Mills, seven miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do <i>all</i> the people in Needley believe in the Patriarch?&rdquo;&mdash;Madison&rsquo;s
  voice was full of grave interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins, &ldquo;to be plumb downright honest
  with you, they don&rsquo;t. Folks as was born here an&rsquo; are old inhabitants
  do, but the Holmes, bein&rsquo; newcomers, is kinder set in their ways. They
  come down here eight years ago last August with new-fangled notions, which
  they ain&rsquo;t got rid of yet. You can see the consequences for yourself&mdash;got
  a little boy, twelve year old, walking around lame on a crutch&mdash;an&rsquo; I
  reckon he always will. Doctor looks at him every time he comes over from
  Barton&rsquo;s Mills, but it don&rsquo;t do no good. Folks tried to get the
  Holmes to take him out to the Patriarch&rsquo;s till they got discouraged. &rsquo;Pears
  old man Holmes kinder got around to a common sense view of it, but the women
  folks say Mrs. Holmes is stubborner than all git-out, an&rsquo; that old
  man Holmes&rsquo; voice ain&rsquo;t loud enough to be heerd when she gets
  goin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t but fair to mention &rsquo;em, as I dunno
  of any one else that&rsquo;s an exception.&rdquo; Mr. Higgins pointed ahead
  with his whip. &ldquo;See them woods over there beyond the town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the Patriarch lives,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins. &ldquo;On
  the other side of &rsquo;em, down by the seashore. An&rsquo; here we be most
  home. Folks&rsquo;ll be glad to see you, Mr. Madison, and now you&rsquo;re
  here I hope you&rsquo;ll make a real smart stay&mdash;we&rsquo;ll try to
  make you feel to home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Madison cordially. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
  any idea, of course, how long I&rsquo;ll be here&mdash;it all depends on
  circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you have.
  Anyway, I hope you&rsquo;ll take a notion to go out an&rsquo; see what the
  Patriarch can do for you. An&rsquo; now you ain&rsquo;t told me yet which
  hotel you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Madison gravely. &ldquo;Well, since you recommend
  it, I guess we&rsquo;d better make it the Congress.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  The Patriarch</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;BET you a cookie,&rdquo; shrilled Hiram Higgins, in what he meant
  to be a breathless whisper, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; now&mdash;only
  he don&rsquo;t want us to know he&rsquo;s give in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shet your fool mouth, Hiram!&rdquo; cautioned Walt Perkins, the proprietor
  of the Congress Hotel. &ldquo;He kin hear you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Higgins. &ldquo;No, he can&rsquo;t neither.
  He ain&rsquo;t feelin&rsquo; no ways perky, any one can see that, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  tickled most to pieces that he&rsquo;s come &rsquo;round&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
  took up with him consid&rsquo;rable, I have. Patriarch&rsquo;ll just make
  a new-born critter outer him&mdash;you watch through the window where he
  goes. Bet you a quarter that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s up to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>John Garfield Madison, outside on the veranda of the Congress Hotel, smiled
  at the words, as he lighted his cigar and turned up his coat collar. He stepped
  off the veranda, crossed the little lawn to the village street, and began
  to saunter nonchalantly and indifferently oceanwards. He did not look around&mdash;he
  had no desire to bring consternation to the massed faces of the leading citizens
  flattened against the window panes&mdash;but he chuckled inwardly as he pictured
  them. There would be Hiram Higgins, postmaster and town constable, Walt Perkins,
  hotel man and town moderator, Lem Hodges, selectman, assessor and overseer
  of the poor, Nathan Elmes, likewise selectman, assessor and overseer of the
  poor, and Cale Rodgers, school committee-man and proprietor of the general
  store.</p>
  <p>Madison sauntered slowly along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have arrived,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not at a cemetery, but at
  an El Dorado and a land flowing with milk and honey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a humorous pucker around the corners of Madison&rsquo;s eyes,
  as he reviewed his two days&rsquo; sojourn in Needley&mdash;spent mostly
  in the &ldquo;office&rdquo; of the Congress Hotel beside the stove with
  his feet up on the woodbox. He had never lacked company&mdash;the office
  stove and the spit-box filled with sawdust was the admitted rendezvous of
  the chosen spirits who were still gazing after him from the window. Morning,
  afternoon and evening they congregated there, and he had been promptly admitted
  to membership in the select circle. At each sitting they had discussed the
  spring planting and the weather, and then inevitably, led by Hiram Higgins,
  had resolved themselves into an &ldquo;experience&rdquo; meeting on the Patriarch&mdash;he,
  Madison, as a minority leader of one, grudgingly conceding an occasional
  point. The sessions had invariably ended the same way&mdash;Hiram Higgins,
  with the back of his hand underneath his chin, would stroke earnestly at
  his chin-whiskers, and remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, now, Mr. Madison, &lsquo;twon&rsquo;t do you a mite of harm
  to go out there an&rsquo; see for yourself. We&rsquo;ve kinder got to look
  on you as one of us, an&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t no use in you sufferin&rsquo; around
  with what ails you when there ain&rsquo;t no need of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s replies had been equally void of versatility&mdash;he would
  shake his head doubtfully, while his cigar-case circulated around the group.</p>
  <p>Madison sniffed luxuriously at his thoroughbred Havana. He had passed out
  of sight of the hotel window now, and he swung into a brisk walk. It was
  a mile to the Patriarch&rsquo;s by a wagon track through the woods, that
  led off from the road to the left just across the bridge. He had not needed
  to ask directions. With magnificent inadvertence Hiram Higgins had mentioned
  the exact way to reach the Patriarch&rsquo;s a dozen times, if he had once.
  Also, by now, Madison had learned all that the town knew about the Patriarch&mdash;which
  after all, he reflected with some satisfaction, wasn&rsquo;t much. The Patriarch
  was over eighty years of age, and he had come, deaf and dumb, to Needley
  sixty years ago&mdash;nobody knew from where, nor his previous history, nor
  his name. They had called him the Hermit at first, for immediately on his
  arrival he had gone out to the shore of the ocean, away from the village,
  and built a crude hut there for himself&mdash;which, in the after years,
  he had made into a more pretentious dwelling. The cures had come &ldquo;kinder
  gradual-like an&rsquo; took the folks mabbe forty years to get around to
  believin&rsquo; in him real serious,&rdquo; as Hiram Higgins put it; and
  then, as the Hermit grew old, and the local reverence for him had become
  more deep-seated, they had changed his name to the Patriarch. That was about
  all&mdash;but it seemed to suit Madison, for his smile broadened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said he to himself, as he stepped onto the bridge
  to cross the little river, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m not dreaming&mdash;this is
  like being let loose in the U. S. Treasury with nobody looking!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, mister!&rdquo; piped a young voice suddenly out of the dusk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; responded Madison mechanically&mdash;and turned to
  watch a small figure, going in the opposite direction, thump by him on a
  crutch. Madison stopped and stared after the cripple&mdash;and removed his
  cigar very slowly from his lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s that Holmes boy,&rdquo; he
  muttered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as he&rsquo;d look well on the platform
  when the excursion trains get to running. Wonder if I can&rsquo;t get a job
  for his father somewhere about a thousand miles from here and have the family
  move!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cripple disappeared down the road, and Madison, with a sort of speculative
  flip to the ash of his cigar, resumed his way. Just across the bridge he
  found the wagon track, and turned into it. It ran through a thick wood of
  fir and spruce, and here, apart from now being able to see but little before
  him&mdash;he had elected to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; away in the darkness after
  supper&mdash;he found the going far from good.</p>
  <p>Half curiously, half whimsically, he tried to visualize the Patriarch from
  the word pictures that had been painted around the stove in the hotel office.
  The man would be old&mdash;of course. And to have lived alone for sixty years,
  to have shunned human companionship he must have been either mildly or violently
  insane to begin with, which would account for his belief in himself as a
  healer&mdash;he would unquestionably, in some form or other, &ldquo;have
  bats in his belfry,&rdquo; as Pale Face Harry had put it.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s brows contracted as he went along. A man living by himself
  under such conditions, with no incentive for the care of his person, not
  even the pride engendered by the association of others, erudite as the standard
  might be in his vicinity, was apt to grow very shortly into a somewhat sorry
  spectacle. Give him sixty years of this and add an unbalanced mind, and&mdash;Madison
  did not like the picture that now rose up suddenly before him&mdash;a creature,
  bent, vapid of face, deaf and dumb, frowsy of dress, and a world removed
  from the thought of a morning bath. It might be picturesque in a way&mdash;but
  it wasn&rsquo;t a way Madison liked. Somehow, he&rsquo;d have to jerk the
  old chap out of his rut and get him rigged up a little more becomingly, before
  the trusting public, simple as they were, were invited down to see the exhibit.
  Madison&rsquo;s dramatic instinct, which was developed to a keen sense of
  what the public craved for, rebelled against any <i>faux pas</i> in the scenic
  effects. He fell to designing a costume that would more appropriately expound
  the r&ocirc;le.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got to give &rsquo;em something for their money,&rdquo; murmured
  John Garfield Madison. &ldquo;Some sort of long, flowing robe now, washed
  every day, sort of Grecian effect with a rope girdle, bare feet and sandals&mdash;um-m&mdash;dunno
  about the sandals&mdash;don&rsquo;t want to slop over, and besides&rdquo;&mdash;Madison
  grinned a little to himself&mdash;&ldquo;he might kick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still reflecting, but arrived at no conclusion other than first to size
  up the Patriarch and see how best to handle him, Madison reached the end
  of the wagon track&mdash;and halted.</p>
  <p>It was a little lighter here, now that he had left the woods, and what appeared
  to be a sweep of snow-covered lawn was before him. Around this, forming a
  perfect square, was a row of full-grown, magnificent maples&mdash;a regal
  hedge, as it were, bordering the four sides&mdash;planted sixty years ago!
  Madison&rsquo;s imagination fired exhilarantly at the inspiring thought of
  these in leaf&mdash;in another few weeks. He shook hands with himself cordially.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behold the amphitheater!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is where we
  stage the greatest act of the century!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Behind the row of trees, directly across the lawn in front of him, loomed
  the dark shadow of a long, low, cottage-like building, and from a window
  a light twinkled out between the tree trunks; while from beyond again came
  the roll of surf, low, rhythmic, like the soft accompaniment of orchestral
  music.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; breathed Madison. &ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as
  though I had just had a drink!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He walked across the lawn, passed between the trees, and reached the end
  of the cottage away from where the light showed in the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Patriarch being deaf,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I might as well
  explore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From the row of trees to the cottage was perhaps twenty feet. The door of
  the cottage, porticoed with trellis-work, was in the center of the cottage
  itself. Everywhere Madison turned were trellis-work frames for flowers&mdash;the
  walls of the cottage were covered, literally covered, with bare, slumbering
  shoots of Virginia creeper. In a little while now the place would be a veritable
  paradise. Madison raised his hat reverently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fancy this on a New York stage!&rdquo; said he esthetically, invoking
  the universe. &ldquo;Could you beat it! I could play the Patriarch myself
  with this setting, and everybody would fall for it. There&rsquo;s nothing
  to it, nothing to it, but his make-up&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll guarantee to take
  care of that. And now we&rsquo;ll have a look at Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp and
  see just what kind of rubbing up will invoke the genii!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison walked along the length of the cottage, past the door, and, as he
  reached the lighted window, drew well away from the wall&mdash;and stared
  inside. Surprise and incredulity swept across his features, and then his
  face beamed and his gray eyes lighted with the fire of an artist who sees
  the elusive imagery of the Great Picture at last transferred to canvas, vivid,
  actual, transcending his wildest hopes. He was gazing upon the sweetest and
  most venerable face he had ever seen.</p>
  <p>Here and there within upon the floor were strewn old-fashioned, round rag
  mats that would enrapture a connoisseur, and the floor where it showed between
  the mats was scrubbed to a glistening white. The furnishings were few and
  homemade, but full of simple artistry&mdash;a chair or two, and a table,
  upon which burned a lamp. In a fireplace, made of stones cemented together,
  the natural effect unspoiled by any attempt to hew the stones into uniformity,
  a log fire glowed, sputtered, and now and then leaped cheerily into flame.</p>
  <p>Between the table and the fire, half turned toward Madison, sat the Patriarch.
  He was reading, his head bent forward, his book held very close to his eyes.
  Hair, a wealth of it, soft, silky and snow-white, reached just below his
  coat collar&mdash;a silvery beard fell far below his book. But it was the
  face itself, no single distinguishing feature, neither the blue eyes, the
  sensitive lips, nor the broad, fine forehead, that held Madison&rsquo;s gaze&mdash;it
  seemed to combine something that he had never seen in a face before, and
  to look upon it was to be drawn instantly to the man&mdash;there was purity
  of thought and act stamped upon it with a seal ineffaceable, and there was
  gentleness there, and sympathy, and trust, and a simple, unassuming dignity
  and self-possession&mdash;and, too, there was a shadow there, a little of
  sadness, a little of weariness, a background, a relief, as it were, a touch
  such as a genius might conceive to lift the picture with his brush into wondrous,
  lingering, haunting consonance.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s eyes, slowly, as though loath to leave the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  face, travelled over the gray homespun suit that clothed the man, the white
  wristbands of the home-washed shirt, unstarched, but spotlessly clean&mdash;and
  his fancy of flowing, Grecian robes with rope girdles seemed to hold him
  up to mockery as a crude and paltry bungler before the perfect, unostentatious
  harmony of reality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to it!&rdquo; whispered Madison softly to himself. &ldquo;Nothing
  to it! There isn&rsquo;t a thing left to do&mdash;not even a chance of making
  a bluff at earning the money&mdash;it&rsquo;s just like <i>stealing</i> it.
  Why, say, it would get <i>me</i> if I weren&rsquo;t behind the scenes&mdash;honest
  now, it would!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison drew back from the window and walked toward the door of the cottage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It should take me about fifteen minutes to establish myself on the
  basis of a long-lost son with the Patriarch clinging confidingly around my
  neck,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;If it takes me any longer than that I&rsquo;d
  feel depressed every time I met myself in the looking-glass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reached the cottage door, and, lifting the brass knocker that shone dimly
  in the darkness, knocked once, lifted it to knock again&mdash;and his hand
  fell away as he smiled a little foolishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I forgot the Patriarch was deaf,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Wonder
  what you&rsquo;re supposed to do? Walk right in, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door swung suddenly wide open, and upon Madison&rsquo;s face, usually
  so perfectly at its owner&rsquo;s control, came a look of stunned surprise.
  The Patriarch was standing on the threshold, and, with a gesture of welcome,
  was motioning him to enter.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  A Strange Conversation</b></h2>
  <p>MADISON, quite in command of himself again in an instant, stepped, smiling,
  into the cottage. He took the Patriarch&rsquo;s extended hand in a cordial
  grip and nodded understandingly as the other, with quick, rapid motions,
  touched lips and ears to signify that he could neither hear nor speak. But,
  inwardly puzzled, Madison searched the Patriarch&rsquo;s face&mdash;was the
  other playing a part? Could he <i>hear</i>, after all&mdash;and perhaps speak
  as well, if he wanted to! There was certainly no guile in the venerable,
  gentle face&mdash;or was it guile of a very high order?</p>
  <p>The Patriarch closed the door, and drawing his own armchair to the table
  offered it to Madison with a courteous smile.</p>
  <p>Madison refused by gently forcing the old man into it himself, pulled another
  up to face the Patriarch, sat down&mdash;and his eyes fixed suddenly on the
  ceiling above his head. Swaying slowly back and forth was a sort of miniature
  punkah of waving white canvas. He studied this for a moment, then his eyes
  shifted to the Patriarch, who was regarding him humorously.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch rose from his chair, walked to the door, opened it, moved
  the knocker up and down&mdash;and pointed to the ceiling. The canvas was
  waving violently now, and Madison traced the cord attachment, on little pulleys,
  across the ceiling to where it ran through the door and was affixed to the
  knocker without. It was very simple, even primitive&mdash;every time the
  knocker was lifted the cord was pulled and the canvas waved back and forth.
  Madison nodded his head and smiled approvingly, as the Patriarch once more
  closed the door and resumed his seat.</p>
  <p>Madison leaned back in his chair and allowed his eyes to stray, not impertinently
  but with pleased endorsement, around the room, to permit an unhampered opportunity
  for the scrutiny of the blue eyes which he felt upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; he mused reproachfully, &ldquo;that I could
  have doubted him for a single instant&mdash;he certainly hung one on me that
  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch reached into the drawer of the table beside him, took out
  a slate and pencil, scratched a few words on the slate and handed both pencil
  and slate to Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your name is Madison, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Madison read. &ldquo;From
  New York? Hiram told me about you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hiram,&rdquo; said Madison to himself, &ldquo;is a man of many parts,
  and the most useful man I have ever known. Hiram, by reflected glory, will
  some day become famous.&rdquo; On the slate he replied: &ldquo;Yes; that
  is my name&mdash;John Madison. It was good of Mr. Higgins to speak of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch held the slate within a bare inch or two of his face, and
  moved it back and forth before his eyes to follow the lines. As he lowered
  it, Madison reached for it politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid you do not see very well,&rdquo; he scribbled. &ldquo;Shall
  I write larger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the Patriarch deciphered the words laboriously; then he wrote, and
  handed the slate to Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going blind,&rdquo; he had written. &ldquo;Please write as large
  as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blind!&rdquo;&mdash;Madison&rsquo;s attitude and expression were
  eloquent enough not only to be a perfect interpretation of his exclamation,
  but to convey his shocked and pained surprise as well.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch bowed his head affirmatively, smiling a little wistfully.</p>
  <p>Madison impetuously drew his chair closer to the other, laid his hand sympathetically
  upon the Patriarch&rsquo;s sleeve, and, with the slate upon his knee, wrote
  with the other hand impulsively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;very, very sorry. Would you care to tell me about
  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch&rsquo;s face lighted up while reading the slate, but he shook
  his head slowly as he smiled again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By and by, if you wish,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;But first about yourself.
  You are sick&mdash;and you have come to me for help?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The slate now passed from hand to hand quite rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; wrote Madison. &ldquo;Can you cure me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Patriarch; &ldquo;not in your present mental
  condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your question itself implies that you are skeptical. While that state
  of mind exists, I can do nothing&mdash;it depends entirely on yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I put skepticism aside?&rdquo; Madison&rsquo;s pencil demanded. &ldquo;Can
  you cure me then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unquestionably,&rdquo; wrote the Patriarch, &ldquo;if you really
  put it aside. Faith is the simplest thing in the world and the most complex&mdash;but
  it is fundamental. Without faith nothing is possible; with faith nothing
  is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s gray eyes rested, magnificently thoughtful and troubled,
  upon the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have never thought much about it,&rdquo; he replied upon the slate,
  after a tactful moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;But I believe that. There is
  something here, about the place, about you that inspires confidence&mdash;I
  was prepared to cling to my skepticism when I came in, but I do not feel
  that way now. If only I knew you a little better, were with you a little
  more, I believe I could have the faith you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long do you remain in Needley?&rdquo; the Patriarch wrote.</p>
  <p>Madison got up from his chair, went slowly to the fireplace, and, with his
  back to the Patriarch, stood watching the crackling logs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old chap&rsquo;s no fool,&rdquo; he informed himself, &ldquo;even
  if he is gone a little in one particular. He certainly does believe in himself
  for fair! Wonder where he got his education&mdash;notice the English he writes?
  And, say&mdash;<i>going blind!</i> Fancy that! Santa Claus, you overwhelm
  me, you are too bountiful, you are too generous&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have nothing
  left for the next chimney! Deaf and dumb&mdash;and blind. Really, I do not
  deserve this&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t&mdash;let me at least tip the hat-boy,
  or I&rsquo;ll feel mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned gravely to the Patriarch; resuming his chair with an expression
  on his face as one arrived at a weighty decision after a mental battle with
  one&rsquo;s self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will stay here until I am cured. I put myself in your hands. What
  am I to do?&rdquo; he wrote quickly&mdash;and held out his hand almost anxiously
  for the other&rsquo;s assent.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch smiled seriously as, after peering at the slate, he took the
  outstretched hand and laid his other one unaffectedly upon Madison&rsquo;s
  shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be sure then that I can help you,&rdquo; wrote the Patriarch cheerfully. &ldquo;There
  is no course of treatment such as you may, perhaps, imagine. My power lies
  in a perfect faith to help you once you, in turn, have faith yourself&mdash;that
  is all. It is but the practical application of the old dogma that mind is
  superior to matter. You must come and see me every day, and we will talk
  together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will come&mdash;gladly,&rdquo; Madison replied; and, taking the
  slate, carefully wiped off the writing&mdash;as he had previously wiped it
  off every time it came into his hands&mdash;with a damp rag that the Patriarch
  had taken from the table drawer when he had produced the slate and pencil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This slate racket is the limit,&rdquo; said Madison to himself, as
  his pencil began to move and screech again; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got to
  get a little deeper under his vest yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He handed the slate to the Patriarch, and on it were the words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me something of yourself, how you came to live
  here alone, and your name, perhaps? I do not mean to presume, but I am deeply
  interested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is never presumption in kindliness and sympathy,&rdquo; answered
  the Patriarch. &ldquo;But my name and story is buried in the past&mdash;perhaps
  when I am gone those who care to know may know. I have not hurt you by refusing
  to answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said Madison politely to himself. &ldquo;The element
  of mystery is one of the best drawing cards I know&mdash;it&rsquo;s got Needley
  going strong. Far, far be it from me to tear the veil asunder. I mentioned
  it only as a feeler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But upon the slate he wrote:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Far from being hurt, I respect your silence. But your eyes&mdash;you
  were to tell me about them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch&rsquo;s face saddened suddenly as he read the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have made no secret of it,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I have been
  going blind for nearly a year now. The end, I am afraid, is very near&mdash;within
  a few days, perhaps even to-morrow. I think I should not mind it much myself,
  for I am very old and have not a great while longer to live in any case,
  but for the time that is left it will mar my usefulness. I have been able
  to help the people here and they have come to depend upon me&mdash;that is
  my life. I trust I am not boastful if I say my greatest joy has been in helping
  others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had come to the bottom of the slate and held it out for Madison to read;
  then wiped it off, and went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have dreamed often of a wider field, of reaching out to help the
  thousands beyond this little town&mdash;but I have realized that it could
  be no more than a dream. I have been successful here because the people believe
  in me and have unquestioning faith in me&mdash;to go outside amongst strangers
  would only have been to be received as a charlatan and faker, or as a poor
  deaf and dumb fool at best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison took the slate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if these thousands of others came to you&mdash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch&rsquo;s face glowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be a wondrous joy,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Too wondrous
  to dwell upon&mdash;because it could never be. If they came I could help
  them, for their very coming would be an evidence of faith&mdash;and faith
  alone is necessary. Think of the joy of helping so many others&mdash;it is
  the fulness of life. But let us not dream any more, friend Madison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; communed Madison, studying the illumined face, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
  slightly touched in his upper story on the faith stunt; but he&rsquo;s in
  dead earnest, and he&rsquo;s got the brotherhood-of-man bug bad. Come to
  think of it, Hiram did say something about his &lsquo;sight failing,&rsquo; but
  I didn&rsquo;t think it was anything like this. If he&rsquo;s going to go
  finally blind in, say, a week, perhaps it would be just as well to postpone
  the opening night until he does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison took the slate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stranger things than that have happened,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I
  never heard of you before, yet I am one of the thousands beyond this little
  town and I am here&mdash;why not the others?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch shook his head sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is but a dream,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
  <p>Madison held the slate in his hands for quite a long time before he wrote
  again; his attitude one of sympathetic hesitancy as his eyes played over
  the form and face before him, while the Patriarch smiled at him with gentle,
  patient resignation. Back in Madison&rsquo;s fertile brain the germ of an
  inspiration was developing into fuller life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will you do here alone when you are blind?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;and
  his face was disturbed and solicitous as he passed the Patriarch the slate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I need very little,&rdquo; the Patriarch wrote back. &ldquo;You must
  not worry about me. My garden supplies nearly all my wants, and there are
  many in the village, I am sure, who will help me with that when the snow
  is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am quite certain of that,&rdquo; Madison&rsquo;s pencil agreed. &ldquo;But
  here in the house you cannot be alone&mdash;there are so many things to do,
  little things that I am sure you have not thought of&mdash;some one must
  cook for you, for instance. You will need a woman&rsquo;s hand here&mdash;have
  you no one, no relative that you can call upon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch lowered the slate from his eyes, shook his head a little pathetically,
  and began to write.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not think they would have cared to come, even if they were still
  alive; but they are all gone many years ago&mdash;except perhaps a grand-niece,
  and I do not know what has become of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s just the thing,&rdquo; wrote Madison. &ldquo;Suppose
  we try to find her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the Patriarch shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that would be impossible. I do not even know that she
  is alive. I know only of her birth, and that is twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even that is not hopeless,&rdquo; wrote Madison optimistically, and
  his face as he looked at the Patriarch was seriously thoughtful. &ldquo;Where
  was she born?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;New York,&rdquo; the Patriarch answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I never half appreciated the old town nor the fulness thereof
  until I came to Needley!&rdquo; said Madison plaintively to the toe of his
  boot, while his hand scrawled the inquiry: &ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vail,&rdquo; wrote the Patriarch. &ldquo;That was her father&rsquo;s
  name. She is my grand-niece on her mother&rsquo;s side. I do not know what
  they christened her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison once more, apparently deep in thought, sought refuge at the fireplace,
  his hands plunged in his pockets, his shoulders drawn a little forward, his
  back to the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fiction,&rdquo; he assured a crack in the cement between two stones, &ldquo;was
  never, never like this. It seems to me that I remember the occurrence. It
  had grown a little dim with the lapse of time, it is true; but now that I
  recall it, it comes back with remarkable clearness. I am quite sure they
  christened her&mdash;Helena. Helena Vail! Now isn&rsquo;t that a perfectly
  lovely name for a novel! And she&rsquo;ll be so good to the dear old chap
  too&mdash;washing and ironing and cooking for him and stealing out into the
  woodshed for a drag on her cigarette&mdash;<i>not</i>. No, my dear, not even
  that&mdash;this is serious business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned, came back to his chair, picked up the slate, and wrote:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have the fortune, or misfortune perhaps, to be what is commonly
  called a rich man. Money, they say, will do anything, and if it will I&rsquo;ll
  find this niece for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch&rsquo;s eyes grew moist as he read the words, and his hand
  trembled a little with emotion as he held the pencil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot let you do that,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You are very
  kind, and it seems almost as though you had been brought to me providentially
  at the end of long years of loneliness for a purpose, when my hour of helplessness
  was near; but, indeed, I have no right to allow you to do this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They tell me in the village,&rdquo; wrote Madison in reply, &ldquo;that
  you have always refused to accept a penny for anything you have ever done
  for them. I have no doubt you would equally refuse to accept anything from
  me for what you may do, and I should hesitate to offer it however much I
  felt indebted, but this is something that you must let me do. It will make
  me feel more&mdash;how shall I say it?&mdash;more as though I had a right
  to the privilege of coming here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch wiped his still moist eyes before he answered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What can I say to you? It does not seem right that I should let a
  stranger do so much, and yet it seems that I should not say no because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison was bending over the slate, reading as the other wrote, and he took
  the pencil gently from the Patriarch&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not look on me any longer as a stranger,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Let
  us just consider that it is all arranged&mdash;only I would strongly advise
  making no mention of it until we make sure that she is alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think nothing should be said,&rdquo; agreed the Patriarch. &ldquo;For
  even if you found her she might not care to come&mdash;I have little here
  to offer a young girl&mdash;few comforts&mdash;the care of a blind man who
  is deaf and dumb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that when we find her&rdquo;&mdash;Madison
  smiled brightly at the Patriarch, as he wrote. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s settled
  for the time being, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dumb lips moved and both hands reached out to Madison.</p>
  <p>Madison took them in a firm, strong, reassuring clasp, then shook his finger
  in a sort of playfully emotional embarrassment, excellently well done, at
  the Patriarch&mdash;and picked up the slate again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and I must not tire you
  out. I am afraid you will think I am far more inquisitive than I have any
  right to be, but there is one more question that I would like to ask&mdash;may
  I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch nodded his head, and laid his hand on Madison&rsquo;s sleeve
  in a quaint, almost affectionate way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is about your education. You came here sixty years ago, and you
  have lived alone. You could have had but few advantages, with your handicap,
  previous to that, and yet you write and use such perfect English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The answer is very simple,&rdquo; replied the Patriarch on the slate. &ldquo;Until
  within the last year, I have read largely. Would you care to look at my books?
  They are there in the nook on the other side of the fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison, promptly and full of interest, rose from his chair, passed around
  the fireplace, and halted before a row of shelves set in against the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pass,&rdquo; Madison admitted to himself after a moment, during
  which his eyes roved over the well chosen classics. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
  of one or two of these before&mdash;casually. I&rsquo;ve an idea that if
  the Patriarch&rsquo;s got all this inside his gray matter, it&rsquo;s just
  as well for the Flopper, for Pale Face Harry, for Helena and yours truly
  that he&rsquo;s deaf and dumb&mdash;and will be blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison came back to the Patriarch with beaming face, and picked up the
  slate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I read a great deal myself,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;It is a pleasure
  to find <i>real</i> books here. May I, during my stay in Needley, look upon
  them in a little way as my own library?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very welcome indeed,&rdquo; the Patriarch answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will,&rdquo; wrote Madison. &ldquo;And now, surely,
  I must go&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled at the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come to-morrow,&rdquo; invited the Patriarch. &ldquo;I would like
  to show you all around my little place here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, I will,&rdquo; Madison scratched upon the slate, &ldquo;and
  do you know that somehow, since I came here to-night, I feel a sense of relief,
  a sort of guarantee that everything is going to be all right with me in the
  future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch smiled quietly, almost tolerantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Keep your mind free of doubt,
  be optimistic and cheerful as regards yourself, nourish the faith that has
  already taken root and that I feel responds to mine; keep in the open air
  and take plenty of exercise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly, with an apparently abstracted air, Madison read the slate, wiped
  it carefully, laid it down, and then held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; he nodded warmly.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch, still with the quiet smile upon his lips, rose from his armchair,
  and, keeping his clasp on Madison&rsquo;s hand, led Madison to the door,
  opened it, and with a gesture at once courtly and affectionate bade his guest
  good-night.</p>
  <p>Madison crossed the lawn at a thoughtful pace, turned into the wagon track,
  and, in the shelter of the woods now, whimsically felt his pulse; then, lighting
  a cigar, tramped on with a buoyant stride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one answer, of course,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;The
  Patriarch&rsquo;s got a brain kink on faith&mdash;it&rsquo;s the natural
  outcome of living alone for sixty years. Outside of that and his books, he&rsquo;s
  as simple and innocent and trusting as a babe. I suppose the thing&rsquo;s
  kind of grown on him&mdash;Hiram said it had taken forty years&mdash;which
  isn&rsquo;t sudden unless you say it quick. Hanged if I don&rsquo;t like
  the old sport though, and if Helena isn&rsquo;t the best ever to him I&rsquo;ll
  stop her chewing gum allowance.&rdquo; Madison looked up through the arched,
  leafless branches overhead. &ldquo;Beautiful night, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
  he pleasantly.</p>
  <p>A little later he reached the main road and paused a moment on the bridge,
  as though to sum up the thoughts and imaginings that had occupied him on
  the way along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer world,&rdquo; said John Garfield Madison profoundly
  to the turbid little stream that flowed beneath his feet. &ldquo;I wonder
  why some of us are born with brains&mdash;and some are born just plain damned
  fools!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went on again, arrived at the Congress Hotel, and, discovering through
  the window that the leading citizens of Needley were still in session, negotiated
  the back entrance. On the way up-stairs he stumbled&mdash;quite inadvertently&mdash;and
  stopped to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There he be now,&rdquo; announced Hiram Higgins&rsquo; voice excitedly. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; up
  to his room to meditate. Knew he&rsquo;d come back feelin&rsquo; like that.
  I be goin&rsquo; out there to-morrow to see the Patriarch myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison smiled, mounted the remaining stairs, entered his room, and lighted
  his lamp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having got my hand in at writing,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I guess
  I&rsquo;d better keep it up and write Helena&mdash;Vail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He extracted a pad of writing paper and an envelope from the tray of his
  trunk, his fountain pen from his pocket, and, drawing his chair to the table
  and laying down his cigar reluctantly at his elbow, began to write. At the
  end of fifteen minutes, he tilted back his chair, relighted the stub of his
  cigar, and critically read over his epistle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Kid,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;Do not be anxious about me&mdash;I
  am feeling better already. Have had my first treatment, and am now eating
  fried eggs and ham regularly three times a day. A Sunday-school picnic taking
  to washboilers full of thin coffee and the left-over cakes kindly contributed
  by Deacon Jones&rsquo; household, is nothing to the way the boobs will take
  to the Patriarch&mdash;who has kindly consented to go blind to make our thorny
  paths as smooth as possible for us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you get that, Helena&mdash;he&rsquo;s going blind! In just a few
  days, my dear, you will be with me, have patience. The meteorological bureau
  is a little hazy yet on the exact date of the total eclipse, but it&rsquo;s
  due to happen any minute. Now listen. Your name is Helena Vail. You&rsquo;re
  the Patriarch&rsquo;s grand-niece, and you&rsquo;re coming to live alone
  with him and soothe his declining years; but you can&rsquo;t come yet because
  I&rsquo;ve got to find you first, and besides, until he&rsquo;s blind, he&rsquo;ll
  stick to a nasty habit he&rsquo;s got of asking questions on his little slate.
  You needn&rsquo;t have any hesitation about coming on the score of propriety,
  I assure you it is perfectly proper&mdash;he is running Methuselah pretty
  near a dead heat. And, as far as the town is concerned, apart from the fact
  that you are a grand-niece, orphaned, you don&rsquo;t have to know anything
  about yourself, either&mdash;that&rsquo;s part of the Patriarch&rsquo;s dark,
  mysterious past, where the lights go out and the fiddles get rickets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all. I&rsquo;ll let you know when to come. Remember
  me to Mr. Coogan and Harry, and keep my picture under your pillow. Ever thine,
  J. G. M.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison picked up his pen again and added another line:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;P.S. Better buy a cook-book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He folded the pages, inserted them in the envelope, sealed the envelope
  and addressed it to Miss Helena Smith&mdash;street and number not far from
  the tenderloin district of New York.</p>
  <p>Then Madison yawned pleasantly, tucked the letter in his pocket&mdash;and
  prepared for bed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Officially Endorsed</b></h2>
  <p>TEN days had passed, bringing with them many changes. The snow was gone,
    and the warm, balmy airs of springtime had brought the buds upon the trees
    almost to leaf. It seemed indeed a new land, and one now full of charm and
    delight&mdash;the
  desolate, straggling hamlet, once so barren, frozen and hopeless looking,
  was now a quaint, alluring little village nestling picturesquely in its hollow,
  framed in green fields and majestic woods. Quiet, restful, peaceful it was&mdash;like
  a dream place, untroubled. Upon the farms about men plowed their furrows,
  calling to each other and to their horses; in the homes the doors and windows
  were thrown hospitably wide to the sweet, fresh, vernal airs, and the thrifty
  housewives were busy at their cleaning.</p>
  <p>And there had been other changes, too. The ten days had found Madison more
  and more a constant visitor, and finally a most intimate one, at the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  cottage&mdash;while to the circle in the hotel office his voice no longer
  rose in even feeble protest, he was one of them. And, perhaps most vital
  change of all, the Patriarch was nearly blind&mdash;so nearly blind that
  conversation now was limited to but little more than a single word at a time
  upon the slate.</p>
  <p>It was morning, in the Patriarch&rsquo;s sitting-room, and Madison was seated
  in his usual place beside the table facing the other. For upwards of an hour,
  it had taken him that long, he had been engaged, having decided that the
  time was ripe, in telling the Patriarch that his grand-niece had been found
  and that now it was only necessary to write and ask her to come to Needley.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch&rsquo;s fine old face was aglow with pleasure as he finally
  understood. Letter writing was beyond him now, a thing of the past, so upon
  the slate he scrawled:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison shook his head; and again with gentle patience explained that perhaps
  it would be better if the letter came from some one holding an official position
  in the village, rather than from one who, even in an abstract way, would
  be unknown to her&mdash;the postmaster, for instance.</p>
  <p>And the Patriarch, patting Madison&rsquo;s sleeve gratefully, agreed.</p>
  <p>Out in the garden behind the cottage, where for the first time in sixty
  seasons the work must be done by other hands, Hiram Higgins, the volunteer
  for the moment, was busy at his &ldquo;spell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison stepped to the door and called him in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Higgins,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Patriarch has just told me
  that he has a grand-niece living in New York, and he wants you to write to
  her and ask her to come to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be that so!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Higgins, gazing earnestly at the
  Patriarch. &ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no surprise to me&mdash;always
  calc&rsquo;lated he must have folks somewheres. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m right
  glad now he needs &rsquo;em he&rsquo;s made up his mind to have &rsquo;em
  come. Wants me to write, does he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t write any more himself,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;He
  seems to think that you, as the postmaster, as well as the town police official,
  are the proper person to do it&mdash;and I quite agree with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I be,&rdquo; declared Mr. Higgins importantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  write it on the town paper, an&rsquo; comin&rsquo; from the postmaster there
  won&rsquo;t be no doubt in her mind that it&rsquo;s any of them bunco games
  or the lurin&rsquo; of young women away such as I&rsquo;ve read about, for
  I reckon perhaps she ain&rsquo;t never heerd of him before&mdash;never knew <i>him</i> to
  write a letter, an&rsquo; I calc&rsquo;late to see most everything that goes
  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Higgins picked up the slate and wrote the word &ldquo;grand-niece?&rdquo; upon
  it in enormous characters; then, amplifying his interrogation by many gestures
  of his hands, deft from long practice, he held the slate up to the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch nodded, and Hiram Higgins nodded back encouragingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where be her address?&rdquo; Mr. Higgins inquired of Madison.</p>
  <p>Madison stepped to the bookshelves out of view of the Patriarch around the
  fireplace, but in full view of Mr. Higgins, and, reaching down the Bible
  from the topmost shelf, extracted from inside its cover the aged, yellow
  slip of paper that he had deposited there when he had entered the cottage
  that morning, and on which was inscribed Helena&rsquo;s name and address
  in a stiff, old-fashioned, angular hand resembling the Patriarch&rsquo;s&mdash;an
  effect that Madison had stayed up half the night to produce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess this must be it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He said it was here&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
  make sure though&rdquo;&mdash;and he handed it to the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>Long and painfully the Patriarch studied it, anxiously deciphering the words
  that he had never seen before, anxious to know all and whatever this might
  tell him about his niece&mdash;then again he nodded his head and expressed
  his gratitude by patting Madison&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s smile modestly disavowed any thanks, as he passed the slip
  to Mr. Higgins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reckon that be it,&rdquo; Mr. Higgins agreed. &ldquo;An&rsquo; now,
  I guess I&rsquo;ll go right back to town an&rsquo; write it&mdash;I allow
  that the sooner we get her down here the better. Folks&rsquo;ll be glad to
  hear this&mdash;the women folks was figurin&rsquo; on takin&rsquo; spells
  an&rsquo; helpin&rsquo; out in the house same as the men in the garden&mdash;&rsquo;pears
  now there won&rsquo;t be no need of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison accompanied Mr. Higgins outside and helped him to harness up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Madison,&rdquo; said Hiram Higgins, as he made ready
  to go and climbed into the democrat, &ldquo;would you allow that the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  goin&rsquo; blind was goin&rsquo; to interfere any with his power of curin&rsquo; folks?
  It&rsquo;ll be a powerful blow to the town if it does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course not!&rdquo; said Madison decisively. &ldquo;Certainly
  not! Indeed, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it enhanced his power&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  purely mental, you know. They say that the loss of any one or more of the
  senses generally tends to make the others only the more acute&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  the&mdash;er&mdash;law of compensation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins, with a sigh of
  relief, &ldquo; &rsquo;cause I got another letter to write &lsquo;sides this
  one for the Patriarch. It come last night, an&rsquo; I was figurin&rsquo; on
  speakin&rsquo; to you about it.&rdquo; Mr. Higgins dropped the reins on the
  dashboard, and dove into first one pocket and then another. &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; said
  he disgustedly. &ldquo;Now if I ain&rsquo;t gone an&rsquo; left it to home
  after all. But I dunno as it makes much difference. It was from a fellow
  up your way by the name of Michael Coogan, an&rsquo; was addressed to the
  postmaster. &rsquo;Pears he read a piece in the papers about the Patriarch
  which he sent along with the letter. Allows he&rsquo;s been ailin&rsquo; quite
  a spell, though he don&rsquo;t say what&rsquo;s the matter with him, an&rsquo; wants
  to know if what&rsquo;s in that piece is all gospel truth, &rsquo;cause if &rsquo;tis
  he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; down. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m right glad to have
  heerd you say what you just said. Bein&rsquo; postmaster an&rsquo; writin&rsquo; &rsquo;fficially,
  I got to be conscientious and pretty partic&rsquo;lar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course&mdash;naturally,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;And what
  are you going to say to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned Mr. Higgins, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t no trouble
  about it now. Goin&rsquo; to tell him that if the Patriarch can&rsquo;t help
  him there ain&rsquo;t nobody on earth can&mdash;thought of mentionin&rsquo; your
  name, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; assented Madison cordially. &ldquo;I feel like
  a new man since I&rsquo;ve come here. I only wish more people knew about
  the Patriarch&mdash;it makes your heart ache to think of the suffering and
  sickness that people endure so hopelessly when there isn&rsquo;t any need
  of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so it do,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins. He picked up the reins. &ldquo;So
  it do,&rdquo; he said heartily.</p>
  <p>Madison watched the democrat as it started off behind the ambling horse&mdash;watched
  with a sort of fascination at the inebriate, sideways stagger of the wheels,
  a sort of wonder that the rear ones didn&rsquo;t shut up like a jack-knife
  under the body of the vehicle and the democrat promptly sit down on its tail-board;
  then, smiling, he walked back into the cottage. The Patriarch was still sitting
  in the armchair beside the table. Madison halted before the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he confidentially to the Patriarch, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
  settled and I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that it&rsquo;s a load off my mind.
  I hate to think of what we&rsquo;d have done without Hiram Higgins&mdash;in
  fact, it distresses me to think of it. Let us think of something else. Day
  after to-morrow Helena &rsquo;ll be along. Helena is the one and only&mdash;but
  you&rsquo;ll find that out for yourself. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you though
  that she wears a number two shoe, and you can guess the rest without any
  help from me. Then a day or so later the Flopper and Pale Face Harry &rsquo;ll
  be along&mdash;you&rsquo;ll enjoy them&mdash;things aren&rsquo;t going to
  be a bit slow from now on. I expect the Flopper will bring some friends with
  him, too, so&rsquo;s to make a nice little house-party&mdash;I wrote him
  about it, and&mdash;&rdquo; Madison stopped abruptly.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch, evidently catching a movement of Madison&rsquo;s lips, was
  gesticulating violently toward his ears, while he smiled half tolerantly,
  half protestingly.</p>
  <p>Madison nodded quickly and smiled deprecatingiy in return.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;I always keep forgetting
  that you can&rsquo;t hear. I was suggesting that perhaps you might like to
  go for a walk&mdash;Mr. Higgins says it&rsquo;s a fine day.&rdquo; Madison
  picked up the slate and in huge letters that sprawled from one end of the
  slate to the other wrote the word: &ldquo;WALK?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch rose from his chair with a pleased expression, and Madison
  helped him solicitously to the door.</p>
  <p>They passed out into the sunshine and headed for the beach&mdash;the Patriarch,
  erect and strong, guiding himself with his hand on Madison&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>Reaching the beach, the Patriarch paused and turned his face toward the
  ocean, while he drew in great breaths of the invigorating air&mdash;and Madison
  involuntarily stepped a little aside to look at the other critically, as
  one might seek a vantage ground from which to view a picture in all its variant
  lights and shades. Against the crested, breaking surf, the fume-sprayed ledges
  of rock, the Patriarch stood out a majestic, almost saintly figure&mdash;tall,
  stately, grand with the true grandeur of simplicity, simple in dress, simple
  in attitude and mien, patience, sweetness and trust illumining his face,
  his silver-crowned head thrown back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can shut my eyes,&rdquo; said Madison softly, &ldquo;and see the
  Flopper being cured right now&mdash;and the Flopper couldn&rsquo;t help it
  if he wanted to!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  The Patriarch&rsquo;s Grand-Niece</b></h2>
  <p>IT was Hiram Higgins who introduced Helena Vail to Madison, two days later.</p>
  <p>Madison had led the Patriarch outside the door of the cottage as the sound
  of wheels announced the expected arrival, and was waiting for her as Mr.
  Higgins drove up in the democrat. Helena, marvelously garbed, in the extreme
  of fashion, was demurely surveying her surroundings; while Mr. Higgins was
  very evidently excited and not a little flustered. A huge trunk and two smaller
  ones occupied the rear of the democrat, with the dismantled back seat lashed
  on top of them.</p>
  <p>Madison, leaving the Patriarch, hastened forward politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Madison,&rdquo; said Hiram Higgins importantly, &ldquo;this be
  the Patriarch&rsquo;s grand-niece come to stay with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From under a picture hat, Helena&rsquo;s eyes smiled down at Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad to meet you, Mr. Madison,&rdquo; she said cordially. &ldquo;Mr.
  Higgins has been telling me about you, and how good you have been to my&mdash;my
  grand-uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind to say so, Miss Vail,&rdquo; responded Madison
  modestly. &ldquo;May I help you down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave him a daintily gloved hand, exposed a daintily stockinged ankle
  as she placed her foot a little hesitantly on the wheel, and jumped lightly
  to the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said quickly and a little anxiously for Mr. Higgins&rsquo; ears,
  indicating the Patriarch, &ldquo;that is my grand-uncle there, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madison, leading her toward the Patriarch. &ldquo;And
  he has been looking forward very anxiously all day to your arrival&mdash;it
  seemed as though the afternoon would never come for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Helena under her breath. &ldquo;I had the rubes
  in the village on the run&mdash;you ought to have seen them stare as the
  chariot drove along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Madison softly. &ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s
  rather strong down here, Helena, and if you&rsquo;re not careful you&rsquo;ll
  scorch your neck with those burning-glasses you&rsquo;ve got in your ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look nice?&rdquo; demanded Helena, with a pout.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet you do!&rdquo; said Madison earnestly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  got the swellest thing on Broadway beaten from Forty-Second Street to the
  Battery. Now, here you are&rdquo;&mdash;they had halted before the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>The venerable face was turned toward them, as though by instinct the Patriarch
  knew that they were there&mdash;and his hands were held out in greeting.</p>
  <p>Helena clasped them firmly, and submitted sweetly as the Patriarch drew
  her into his arms.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch released her after an instant, and his hands, in lieu of eyes,
  reaching out to search her face, came bewilderingly in contact with the picture
  hat.</p>
  <p>Helena, a little uncertainly, looked at Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is he <i>all</i> blind?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite blind,&rdquo; said Madison sadly.</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s face clouded a little, and into the brown eyes crept a strange,
  sudden, sympathetic look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t fair. It&rsquo;s
  a shame&mdash;he can&rsquo;t fight back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One error to you, Miss Vail,&rdquo; said Madison pleasantly. &ldquo;Eliminate
  the &lsquo;Doc.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t shed tears, you&rsquo;re down here to
  be sweet to him, aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;well, get into the game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena turned from Madison, and, impulsively taking the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  groping hands, guided them to her cheeks and held them there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky dog!&rdquo; observed Madison; then, raising his voice: &ldquo;I
  am sure you would like to be alone together, Miss Vail&mdash;perhaps you
  will take him into the cottage. If you will excuse me, I&rsquo;ll help Mr.
  Higgins with the trunks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison turned and walked over to where Mr. Higgins, beside the democrat
  with a handful of chin whiskers, was observing the scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine girl!&rdquo; declared Mr. Higgins, as Helena, with the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  arm in hers, disappeared inside the cottage. &ldquo; &rsquo;Pears she must
  have money, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m right glad &lsquo;count of the Patriarch&mdash;said
  her father an&rsquo; mother was dead an&rsquo; she was alone in the world&mdash;them
  jewels she wore must have cost a pile. Reckon she&rsquo;s been used to livin&rsquo; kinder
  different from the way folks down here do&mdash;hope &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
  goin&rsquo; to be so hard on her she won&rsquo;t want to stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking about that myself,&rdquo; said Madison gravely, knotting
  his brows as he nodded his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt it will be
  a big change for her, but I imagine she had some sort of an idea what to
  expect&mdash;it is certainly greatly to her credit that she would give up
  her own interests unselfishly and come here to devote her life to the care
  of a relative whom she had never seen before. I&rsquo;ve an idea that the
  girl who would do that is the kind of a girl who&rsquo;s got grit enough
  to see it through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So she be,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins heartily. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t every
  one &rsquo;ud do it&mdash;not by a heap!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a hand with the trunks,&rdquo; said Madison thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>They carried the large trunk between them into the cottage and, as Helena
  called to them, down the little hallway past what Madison knew to be the
  Patriarch&rsquo;s bedroom, and stopped before the next door, which was open.
  Madison remembered the room, when nearly two weeks ago now the Patriarch
  had shown him through the cottage, as a sort of store-room full of odds and
  ends. Mr. Higgins, too, evidently had known it only in that guise, for he
  whistled softly and reached for his whiskers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well now, if that ain&rsquo;t right smart of the Patriarch!&rdquo; he
  exclaimed. &ldquo;Real set he must have been on makin&rsquo; you feel to
  home, Miss Vail&mdash;an&rsquo; never said a word to no one, neither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helena, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it pretty? And did he
  really fix this up for me all by himself?&rdquo;&mdash;she was looking at
  Madison, as she stood in the center of the room beside the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must have,&rdquo; said Madison, surveying the room.</p>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t luxurious, the little chamber, nor was there over much of
  furniture, nor was that even of a high order&mdash;there was a bed with a
  red-checkered crazy-quilt; a washstand with severe, heavy white crockery;
  a rocking chair, homemade, of hickory; a rag mat, round, many-colored; and
  white muslin curtains on the windows. It wasn&rsquo;t luxurious, the little
  chamber&mdash;it was fresh and sweet and clean.</p>
  <p>Upon the Patriarch&rsquo;s face was a sort of pleased expectancy, and Helena
  promptly took his arm and pressed it affectionately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it perfectly dear of him!&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;To
  think of him going to all this trouble for me when he could scarcely see!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no more&rsquo;n you deserve,&rdquo; said
  Mr. Higgins gallantly, as he slewed the trunk around against the wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  lug them other trunks in myself, ain&rsquo;t but small ones, they ain&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;and
  he hurried from the room, as though fearful that Madison might secure a share
  in the honors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve made a hit with Mr. Higgins, Helena,&rdquo; observed
  Madison, with a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; returned Helena absently; then abruptly: &ldquo;This
  is a real nice lay you&rsquo;ve steered me into, John Madison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; not bad,&rdquo; said Madison complacently. &ldquo;Bring your
  uncle into the front room, Helena; and then you can get Hiram to show you
  the well and the old oaken bucket and where the pantries and cupboards are,
  he knows more about them than I do&mdash;it&rsquo;s pretty near time for
  you to be thinking about getting supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to stay for it?&rdquo; inquired Helena pertly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the first attempt!&rdquo; ejaculated Madison, with a wry face. &ldquo;Good
  Heavens, no! I&rsquo;m just convalescing from a serious illness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the front room Madison settled himself to a study of the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  beaming, happy face, while Helena under Mr. Higgins&rsquo; attentive guidance
  explored the cottage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know, old chap,&rdquo; he said, and leaned across the
  table to touch the Patriarch&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I feel like a blooming
  philanthropist. An outsider might think I was playing you pretty low and
  taking advantage of you, and even Helena&rsquo;s got a budding hunch that
  way it seems&mdash;but just think of the mess you&rsquo;d have been in if
  it wasn&rsquo;t for me, just think of the good you&rsquo;re going to do,
  and just look at yourself and see how pleased and happy you look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Patriarch smiled responsively to the touch upon his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; said Madison affably.</p>
  <p>Presently there came the sound of an axe busily at work, and a moment later
  Helena came laughingly into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s filling up the wood-box,&rdquo; she explained, and darting
  across to Madison put her arms around his neck. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going
  to tell me you&rsquo;re glad to see me?&rdquo; she whispered coyly. &ldquo;Oh,
  I&rsquo;ve been longing so for you! Kiss me&rdquo;&mdash;she held out tempting
  little red lips, invitingly pursed up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nix on that!&rdquo; said Madison, smiling but firm, as he disengaged
  her arms. &ldquo;Soft pedal, Helena, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t see or hear,&rdquo; pouted Helena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should hope not!&rdquo; said Madison, with a gasp. &ldquo;But you
  never know who else might, or when they might&mdash;we begin right, and run
  no risks&mdash;see? People have a charming habit of dropping around informally
  here&mdash;everybody&rsquo;s at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love me any more?&rdquo; inquired Helena, unconvinced,
  and still pouting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I do!&rdquo; asserted Madison, laughing at her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  be a goose, Helena. You remember what I told you all in the Roost, don&rsquo;t
  you? Well, I haven&rsquo;t been living in a Maine village ten days or two
  weeks for nothing, and what I said then goes now more than ever. Now, don&rsquo;t
  get sore, kid&mdash;there&rsquo;s a big stake up, and if we&rsquo;re going
  to play the game we&rsquo;ve got to play it to the limit. We live perfectly,
  ultra-proper, decent lives, mentally, morally, physically, till we beat it
  out of here for keeps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we going to have a nice time!&rdquo; murmured Helena
  sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, cheer up!&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;It may be quiet for a day
  or two&mdash;but not much longer than that. Now tell me about the Flopper
  and Pale Face before Higgins gets back&mdash;have they got things straight?
  And pat your uncle&rsquo;s hand while you talk, Helena&mdash;get the habit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to get the habit,&rdquo; said Helena a little
  crossly, perching herself on the arm of the Patriarch&rsquo;s chair and taking
  his hand. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a perfect dear, and for us to sit here
  and take advantage of him when he trusts us is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now cut that out,&rdquo; said Madison cheerfully. &ldquo;Think of
  those gondolas in Venice when we get through with this&mdash;that&rsquo;ll
  make you feel better. Go on about the Flopper and Pale Face&mdash;can the
  Flopper speak any English yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena laughed in spite of herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a dream of a time with him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  broken his neck trying, at any rate; and he&rsquo;s not so bad as he was&mdash;quite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I read them your last letter saying they were to come together and
  work the train on the way down,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;The Flopper
  got the postmaster&rsquo;s letter, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did it size up as a testimonial?&rdquo; inquired Madison.</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s dark eyes flashed with amusement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too thick&mdash;fishy?&rdquo; asked Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Helena, &ldquo;not if you have faith&mdash;just
  strong. It&rsquo;s all right, though; I told him he could use it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  a drawing card in itself, for some of them would be curious enough to get
  off and see the finish. Everything is all fixed&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be here
  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; said Madison approvingly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pull
  it off out there on the lawn where all the multitude can see&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
  have to lead his nibs out and guide him to the Flopper while the hush falls
  and you look kind of scared&mdash;you know the lay. There&rsquo;s no one
  can touch you when it comes to playing up to the house. And now, there&rsquo;s
  just one thing more&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need some one around here to help
  you and keep an eye on the offerings when they begin to come in. Well, that&rsquo;s
  the Flopper&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le in the second act&mdash;see? Overwhelmed with
  gratitude at his cure, he attaches himself to the Patriarch with doglike
  fidelity&mdash;beautiful thought!&mdash;get the idea? And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Helena. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Higgins coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Madison, rising and moving to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  going now, then&mdash;guess you understand. See you in the morning for the
  final touches. Tell Mr. Higgins I&rsquo;m waiting outside for him to drive
  me home.&rdquo; He raised his voice. &ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Vail,&rdquo; he
  said, and stepped out onto the lawn.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  In Which The Bait Is Nibbled</b></h2>
  <p>THERE was a group around the Flopper on the Portland platform beside the
  Bar Harbor express; some wore pitying expressions, others smiled a little
  tolerantly&mdash;Pale Face Harry, from the circle, sneered openly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nutty!&rdquo; he coughed, and touched his forehead. &ldquo;Nothing
  doing in the upper story&mdash;some one ought to look after him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper, a crippled thing on the ground, fixed Pale Face Harry with
  a pointed forefinger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse don&rsquo;t look like you had many weeps to spare for anybody
  but yerself&mdash;yer fallin&rsquo; to pieces,&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t ask you nor any of youse to butt in&mdash;I was talkin&rsquo; to
  dis lady here&rdquo;&mdash;he motioned toward a young woman in a wheeled,
  invalid chair, who, between a trained nurse on one side and a gentleman on
  the other, was regarding him with a startled expression in her eyes.</p>
  <p>She turned now and spoke to the gentleman beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she said, in a low, anxious tone, &ldquo;do you think
  that&mdash;that there can be anything in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you lost your head, Naida?&rdquo; the man laughed. &ldquo;The
  age of miracles has passed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he is so <i>sure</i>,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poppycock!&rdquo; said her companion contemptuously.</p>
  <p>The Flopper, in good, if unfashionable and ready-made clothes, fresh linen,
  and a clean shave, turned a bright, intelligent face on the man at this remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess youse are de kind,&rdquo; he said, with a grim smile, &ldquo;dat
  ain&rsquo;t had to kill yerself worryin&rsquo; much about any kind of trouble,
  an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to you to cut de ground of hope out
  from another guy&rsquo;s feet an&rsquo; let him slide. Mabbe you think I&rsquo;m
  nutty too, because I know I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be cured&mdash;but it
  don&rsquo;t hurt you none to have me think so, does it? Mabbe someday you
  might like to hope a little yerself, an&rsquo; if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Board! All aboard!&rdquo;&mdash;the conductor&rsquo;s voice
  boomed down the platform.</p>
  <p>The young woman leaned forward in her chair toward the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know what it is to hope,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Will you
  come back into our car after awhile? I&rsquo;d like to have you tell me more
  about this. Please do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the Flopper amiably. &ldquo;Sure, mum, I will,
  if youse wants me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The crowd broke up, hurrying for the train; and the Flopper, dragging a
  valise along beside him, jerked himself toward the steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me, if I ain&rsquo;t got a bite already!&rdquo; said the Flopper
  to himself. &ldquo;An&rsquo; outer a private car, too&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
  dat bump you! An&rsquo; say, wait till you see de Doc t&rsquo;row up his
  dukes when he listens to me handin&rsquo; out me sterilized English!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The brakeman and a kindly-hearted fellow passenger helped the Flopper into
  the train&mdash;and thereafter for an hour or more, in a first class coach,
  the Flopper held undisputed sway. The passengers, flocking from the other
  cars, filled the aisle and seriously interfered with the lordly movements
  of the train crew, challenging the conductor&rsquo;s authority with passive
  indifference until that functionary, exasperated beyond endurance, threatened
  to curtail the ride the Flopper had paid for and put him off at the next
  station&mdash;whereat the passive attitude of the passengers vanished. The
  American public is always interested in a novelty, and on occasions is not
  to be gainsaid&mdash;the American public, as represented by the patrons of
  the Bar Harbor express, was interested at the moment in the Flopper, and
  they passed the conductor from hand to hand&mdash;it was the only way he
  could have got through the car&mdash;and deposited him outside in the vestibule
  to tell his troubles to the buffer-plate.</p>
  <p>The Flopper was in deadly, serious earnest; there was no doubt, no possible
  room for doubt on that score&mdash;one had but to look at the flush upon
  his cheeks and note the ring of conviction in his voice. Even Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s
  gibes and sneers melted before the unshakable assurance, and he became, with
  reservations, noticeably impressed.</p>
  <p>A metropolitan newspaper man was struck with the idea of a humorous series
  of articles to pay for his vacation, entitled, &ldquo;Characters I Have Met
  In Maine&rdquo;&mdash;and forthwith, perched on the back of the seat behind
  the Flopper, proceeded to sketch out the first one, with the mental determination
  to get off at Needley for the local color necessary to its climax.</p>
  <p>A soap drummer nudged a fellow drummer whose line was lingerie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever do Needley?&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
  <p>The lingerie exponent had a sense of humor&mdash;he grinned back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My house is everlastingly rubbing it into me to open up new territory,&rdquo; said
  the soap salesman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; responded the white-goods man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Needley,&rdquo; said he of the soap persuasion, &ldquo;would be virgin
  soil for any drummer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see the finish,&rdquo; said the lingerie man&mdash;still
  grinning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired the soap man&mdash;still grinning. &ldquo;What
  do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said the man with eight trunks full of daintiness
  in the baggage car ahead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Needley for ours&mdash;you&rsquo;re
  on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper was an artist&mdash;and he was in his glory. Where his position
  was indubitably weak, he side-stepped with the frank admission that he knew
  no more than they. He knew only one thing, and that was the only thing he
  cared about, the rest made no odds to him, he was going down to Needley to
  be cured&mdash;and he let them see Mr. Biggins&rsquo; letter.</p>
  <p>A porter from the rear car squirmed and wriggled his way down to the seat
  occupied by the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistah Tho&rsquo;nton, sah,&rdquo; he announced importantly, &ldquo;would
  like to see you in his private car, if you could done make it convenient,
  sah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the Flopper.</p>
  <p>The passengers crowded up, standing on the seats and arm-rests, to make
  room for the Flopper to crawl down the aisle, while the porter preceded him
  to open the doors.</p>
  <p>Through the car in the rear of the one he had occupied, the regular parlor
  car, the Flopper, a piteous spectacle, made his way&mdash;chairs turned,
  the occupants craned their necks after the deformed and broken creature,
  while smothered exclamations and little cries of sympathy from the women
  followed him along. The Flopper&rsquo;s eyes never lifted from the strip
  of carpet before him, but his lips moved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Dis has de gape-wagon skun a mile.
  Wish I could pass de hat&mdash;I&rsquo;d make de killin&rsquo; of me young
  life. Pipe de hydrogen hair on de gran&rsquo;mother wid de sparkler on her
  thumb an&rsquo; weeps in her eyes, an&rsquo; look at de guy wid de yellow
  gloves rolled back on his wrists to heighten de intelligint look on his face,
  dat she&rsquo;s kiddin&rsquo;&mdash;I could play dem to a fare-thee-well
  if I only had de chanst. Oh, gee!&rdquo;&mdash;the Flopper sighed&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; I
  got to let it go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With regret still poignantly affecting him, the Flopper passed on into the
  private car, and the porter ushered him into a sort of combination observation
  and sitting-room compartment. The Flopper&rsquo;s eyes lifted and made a
  quick, comprehensive tour of his surroundings. The young woman who had spoken
  to him on the platform was reclining on a couch; the nurse sat on the foot
  of the couch; and the man was tilted back in an armchair against the window.</p>
  <p>The young woman raised herself to a sitting posture and held out her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Thornton,&rdquo; she said, with a smile. &ldquo;This is
  my husband, and this is Miss Harvey, my nurse. It was very good of you to
  come, Mr.&mdash;?&rdquo; she paused invitingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coogan,&rdquo; supplied the Flopper. &ldquo;Michael Coogan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me offer you a chair, Mr. Coogan,&rdquo; said Thornton, a little
  ironically, pushing one toward the Flopper. &ldquo;Or would you be more comfortable
  on the floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper&rsquo;s eyelids fell&mdash;covering a quick, ugly glint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;anks!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and swung himself, by his arms,
  into the chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me all about this strange man in Needley, and
  how you came to hear of him and believe in him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton. &ldquo;I
  was only able to get just the barest outline of it out there on the platform
  with the crowd around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; said the Flopper earnestly. &ldquo;Sure,
  I&rsquo;ll tell you. I saw a piece about dis Patriarch in one of de Noo Yoik
  papers, so I writes to de postmaster of de town to find out if he was on
  de level&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton. &ldquo;And what did the postmaster
  say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper took Hiram Higgins&rsquo; letter from his pocket and handed
  it to Mrs. Thornton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse can read it fer yerself, mum,&rdquo; he said, with an air of
  one delivering a final and irrefutable argument.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton read the letter carefully, almost anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only a part of this is true,&rdquo; she said wistfully, passing
  it to her husband, &ldquo;it is perfectly wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Thornton read it&mdash;with a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I am sure,&rdquo; he observed caustically, handing
  the letter to Miss Harvey, &ldquo;how the medical profession would stand
  on this&mdash;would your school endorse it, nurse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Harvey read it with her back to the others&mdash;then she glanced at
  Mrs. Thornton&mdash;and checked herself as she was about to speak. She folded
  the letter slowly and returned it to the Flopper without comment.</p>
  <p>Robert Thornton, master of millions, hard-headed and practical for all his
  youth, leaned forward in his chair toward the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to
  say that you believe this seriously, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said the Flopper softly. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; like
  dat! Of course I don&rsquo;t believe it! I&rsquo;m only guyin&rsquo; myself&mdash;see?
  I&rsquo;m just goin&rsquo; dere fer fun&mdash;an&rsquo; spendin&rsquo; me
  last red to get dere. Say&rdquo;&mdash;his voice snapped&mdash;&ldquo;wot
  do youse t&rsquo;ink I am, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely, Robert,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton gently, &ldquo;it is evident
  enough that he believes it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton did not look at her&mdash;he was still gazing at the Flopper, his
  brows knitted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been like this?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All me life,&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;I was born dat way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you expect to go down here and by some means, which I must confess
  is quite beyond my ability to grasp, be cured in a miraculous manner!&rdquo;&mdash;Thornton
  smiled tolerantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I do!&rdquo; asserted the Flopper doggedly. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s
  done it fer de crowd dere, why can&rsquo;t he do it fer me? Didn&rsquo;t
  de postmaster say all yer gotter have is faith? Well, I got de faith&mdash;an&rsquo; I
  got it hard enough to stake all I got on it. Dis time to-morrow&mdash;say,
  dis time to-morrow I wouldn&rsquo;t change places wid any man in de United
  States.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton&rsquo;s tolerant smile deepened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re sincere enough,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
  not trying to cut the ground of hope out from under your feet, as you put
  it out on the platform&mdash;but it seems to me that it is only the kindly
  thing to do to warn you that the more faith you put in a thing like this
  the worse you are making it for yourself&mdash;you are laying up a bitter
  disappointment in store that can only make your present misfortune the more
  unbearable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s done it fer others, he can do it fer me,&rdquo; he
  repeated, with unshaken conviction. &ldquo;An&rsquo; dat goes&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
  lose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton tilted his chair back again, and stared at the Flopper with pitying
  incredulity.</p>
  <p>There was silence for a moment; then Mrs. Thornton spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I want to stop at Needley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The front legs of Thornton&rsquo;s chair came down on the heavy carpet with
  a dull thud, and he whirled around in his seat to stare at his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say, Naida,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;that
  you&rsquo;ve got faith in this thing, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; not faith,&rdquo; she answered pathetically. &ldquo;I hardly
  dare to <i>hope</i>. I have hoped so much in the last year, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this is sheer nonsense!&rdquo; Thornton broke in with irritable
  impatience. &ldquo;I can understand this man here, in a way&mdash;he has
  the superstition, if you like to call it that, due to lack of education,
  if he&rsquo;ll pardon my saying so in his presence; but you, Naida, surely
  you can&rsquo;t take any stock in it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled at him a little wanly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have told you that I didn&rsquo;t even dare to hope,&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;But I want to see&mdash;I want to see. I have tried sanatoriums
  and consulted specialists until it has all become a nightmare to me and I
  am no better&mdash;I sometimes think I never shall be any better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; exploded Thornton, rising from his chair, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
  nothing to do with this&mdash;this is rank foolishness! Nurse, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Harvey, too, had risen, and was regarding Mrs. Thornton anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is better to humor her than to excite her,&rdquo; she said in
  a low voice.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton had dropped back on the couch and her face was turned away
  from the others, but she stretched out her hand to her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not asking very much, Robert, dear&mdash;am I?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not
  very much. Won&rsquo;t you do this for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton bit his lips and scowled at the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; he muttered&mdash;and moving to
  the side of the car pushed a bell-button viciously. &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; he
  snapped, as his colored man appeared, &ldquo;go and tell the conductor that
  I want my car put off on the siding at Needley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sah,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
  <p>Thornton sat down again heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; announced the Flopper tactfully, &ldquo;mabbe I&rsquo;d
  better be gettin&rsquo; back to me valise&mdash;we&rsquo;re most dere, ain&rsquo;t
  we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton turned toward him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; please don&rsquo;t go, Mr. Coogan&mdash;it&rsquo;s too hard for
  you to get through the train. Sam will get your things as soon as he comes
  back. Do stay right where you are until we get to Needley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t think of going, Mr. Coogan,&rdquo; said Thornton
  savagely.</p>
  <p>The Flopper looked at Mrs. Thornton gratefully, and at Mr. Thornton thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;anks!&rdquo; said the Flopper pleasantly&mdash;and wriggled
  himself into a more comfortable position in his chair.</p>
  <p>Half an hour later, the train, that stopped only on signal to discharge
  eastbound passengers from Portland, drew up at Needley&mdash;and Hiram Higgins,
  on the platform, stared at a scene never before witnessed in the history
  of the town.</p>
  <p>It was not one passenger, or two, or three, that alighted&mdash;they streamed
  in a bewildering fashion from every vestibule of every car. It is true that
  the majority got back into the train later, but that did not lessen the effect
  any on Mr. Higgins. Mr. Higgins&rsquo; jaw dropped, and he grabbed at his
  chin whiskers for support.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merciful daylights!&rdquo; he breathed heavily. &ldquo;Now what in
  the land&rsquo;s sakes be it all about?&rdquo; His eyes, following the hurrying
  passengers, fixed on the twisted shape of the Flopper, being helped to the
  platform from the private car.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Coogan!&rdquo; yelled some excitable passenger.</p>
  <p>The cheers were given with a will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, Coogan!&rdquo; shouted another&mdash;and the crowd
  took it up in chorus: &ldquo;Good luck to you, Coogan!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Coogan!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Higgins&rsquo; face paled, and he
  took a firmer grip on his whiskers. &ldquo;Now if you ain&rsquo;t gone an&rsquo; put
  your fool foot in it, Hiram Higgins,&rdquo; he said miserably. &ldquo;If
  that there&rsquo;s the fellow that you writ to, you&rsquo;ve just laid out
  to make a plumb fool of the Patriarch, &rsquo;cause I reckon the Almighty
  knew His own mind when He made a critter like that, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t
  calc&rsquo;late to have His work upsot much this side of the grave&mdash;not
  even by the Patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  The Pilgrimage</b></h2>
  <p>FAITH is an inheritance common to the human race; and the human race in
  its daily life, in its daily dealings, man to man, could not go on without
  it&mdash;but faith is a matter of degree. Faith, in the abstract, the element
  of it, is inborn in every soul; and while dormant, until put to a crucial
  test along any given line, is boundless and unlimited&mdash;a sort of tacitly
  accepted, existing state, unquestioned. Faith in many is a sturdy, virile
  thing&mdash;to a certain point. It is the fire that proves.</p>
  <p>Needley had faith in the Patriarch&mdash;a faith that never before had been
  questioned. But Needley had more than that&mdash;Needley held the Patriarch
  in affection, as a cherished thing, almost sacredly, almost as an idol. Faith
  the simple people of Needley had always had&mdash;to a certain point&mdash;but
  it faltered before this grotesque, inhuman, twisted shape that squatted in
  the road before the Congress Hotel like a hideous caricature of an abnormal
  toad. Their faith failed to bridge the span that gave the Patriarch power
  over such as this, and they saw their idol shattered in their own eyes, and
  held up to mockery before the eyes of these strangers who had so suddenly
  and tempestuously swarmed upon them.</p>
  <p>Hiram Higgins, seeking out Doc Madison inside the hotel, was in a state
  bordering on distraction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I druve him over from the station &rsquo;cause he couldn&rsquo;t
  walk, him an&rsquo; a man, an&rsquo; two women, an&rsquo; a wheel-chair,&rdquo; Mr.
  Higgins explained. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done now? He wants me to
  drive him out to the Patriarch&rsquo;s. I got faith in the Patriarch, but
  I never said he could work miracles&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t no one on earth
  could straighten that critter out. Don&rsquo;t stand to reason that the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  to be made a fool of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; agreed Madison emphatically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  most unfortunate. I suppose all of us here in Needley&rdquo;&mdash;he looked
  around at the assembled group of leading citizens&mdash;&ldquo;feel the same
  way, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course we do,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins helplessly. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
  feel no ways else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison laid his hand suddenly, impressively, upon Mr. Higgins&rsquo; shoulder
  and looked meaningly into Mr. Higgins&rsquo; eyes&mdash;and into the eyes
  of the selectmen, the overseers of the poor, the general-store proprietor,
  and the school committee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drive him over, then,&rdquo; he said significantly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  any of the rest of you do it either&mdash;and tell everybody else not to.
  Make him <i>crawl</i>. If he&rsquo;s determined to go, let him get there
  by himself if he can, make him crawl&mdash;he&rsquo;ll never be able to do
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Mr. Higgins, brightening, while the
  others nodded; then, dubiously: &ldquo;But s&rsquo;pose he <i>does</i> get
  there&mdash;how be we goin&rsquo; to stop him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he can get there by himself you can&rsquo;t stop him,&rdquo; said
  Madison seriously. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything like that. To use force
  would be carrying things too far, and would only place the Patriarch in a
  worse light. If this fellow&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name?&mdash;Coogan?&mdash;can
  crawl there, let him&mdash;that&rsquo;s his own business. None of <i>us</i> are
  encouraging him, the Patriarch didn&rsquo;t ask him to come, and no one has
  a right to expect miracles&mdash;so it can&rsquo;t hurt the Patriarch seriously
  under those conditions. Besides, if this Coogan has got faith enough to crawl
  that mile, who knows what might happen&mdash;make him crawl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Higgins, with a grim nod, headed a determined exodus from the hotel
  office&mdash;and Madison strolled out onto the veranda.</p>
  <p>Needley was in a furor. The news spread like an oil-fed conflagration. The
  farmers left their work in the fields and hurried into the village; from
  the houses and cottages came the women and children to cluster around the
  Congress Hotel; from the station, scarcely of less interest to the inhabitants
  than the Flopper himself, straggled in those curious enough to have left
  the train, nearly a dozen of them&mdash;and amongst them Pale Face Harry
  coughed, as he trudged laboriously along.</p>
  <p>Larger and larger grew the circle around the Flopper, filling and blocking
  the road, overflowing into front yards, and massing on the little lawn of
  the hotel clear up to the veranda&mdash;until fields and houses were deserted,
  and to the last inhabitant Needley was there.</p>
  <p>Upon the ground squatted the Flopper, his eyes sweeping the ring of faces
  that was like a wall around him&mdash;the grinning faces of his fellow passengers
  from the train; the stony, concerned and rather sullen faces of the men of
  Needley; the anxious, excited faces of the women; the bewildered, curious
  and somewhat frightened faces of the children, who pushed and shoved their
  elders for better vantage ground.</p>
  <p>The Flopper licked his lips, and renewed the appeal he had been making for
  nearly five minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no one goin&rsquo; to drive me out to de Patriarch&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horses are all busy in the fields,&rdquo; said a voice, uncompromisingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Flopper, with bitter irony, &ldquo;drivin&rsquo; each
  other around, while youse are here starin&rsquo; at me an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t
  help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His eyes caught Doc Madison&rsquo;s from the veranda and held an instant
  to read a message and interpret the almost imperceptible, but significant,
  movement of Madison&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said the Flopper to himself, as his eyes swept the faces
  around him again. &ldquo;Dis is a nice game de Doc&rsquo;s planted on me&mdash;he
  wants me to do de wiggle out dere fer de rubes! Ain&rsquo;t dey a peachy
  lot&mdash;look at de saucer eyes on de kids!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton, in her wheel-chair on the inner edge of the circle, turned
  to her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange that no one seems willing to drive him,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not very,&rdquo; responded Thornton, with a short laugh. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t blame them&mdash;they don&rsquo;t want this healer of theirs
  made a monkey of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If no one will drive him, he shall have my wheel-chair,&rdquo; announced
  Mrs. Thornton impulsively. &ldquo;I think it is a perfect shame&mdash;the
  poor man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Thornton gruffly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing
  of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Robert, I will,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Thornton with determination.
  She leaned forward and called to the Flopper. &ldquo;Mr. Coogan,&rdquo; she
  said anxiously, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t find any other way of getting
  out there, I want you to take this chair of mine&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be able
  to manage with it, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper looked at her with gratitude&mdash;but shook his head&mdash;mindful
  of Doc Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;anks, mum,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink
  of it&mdash;you needs it more&rsquo;n me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;anks, mum,&rdquo; said the Flopper again, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t.
  You needs it, an&rsquo; I can get along widout it. Dey&rsquo;re stallin&rsquo; on
  me, but I can get dere by myself if any one&rsquo;ll show me de way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, mister,&rdquo; piped a shrill voice&mdash;and
  young Holmes on his crutch hopped into the circle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show
  you, mister&mdash;an&rsquo; &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t fur, neither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; muttered the Flopper, as he surveyed the lad. &ldquo;Dis
  is de limit fer fair!&rdquo; Perturbed and uncertain what to do, he tried
  to catch Doc Madison&rsquo;s eye again, but a movement in the crowd had hidden
  Madison.</p>
  <p>Some one in the crowd, the lingerie drummer, getting the grim humor of the
  situation, laughed&mdash;and the laugh came like a challenge, taunting the
  quick-tempered, turbulent soul of the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, mister!&rdquo; urged the boy excitedly. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
  fur&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless you, son,&rdquo; said the Flopper, while he flung an inward
  curse at the man who had laughed. &ldquo;Son, God bless you fer yer good
  heart&mdash;go ahead&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stick to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The crowd opened, making a lane through which the boy stumped on his crutch,
  his face flushed and eager, and through which the Flopper followed, slowly,
  rocking from side to side as he helped himself along with the palm of his
  left hand flat in the dust of the road, trailing his wobbling leg behind
  him.</p>
  <p>The crowd closed in behind and moved forward.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s face was fever-flushed, her eyes bright; in her weak
  state she was on the verge of nervous hysteria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to go, Robert,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I must go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; protested Thornton harshly, &ldquo;this is simply
  the height of absurdity. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake be sensible, Naida. Just
  imagine what people would say if they saw us here with this outfit of idiots&mdash;they&rsquo;d
  think we&rsquo;d gone mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they&rsquo;d think,&rdquo; she returned feverishly,
  her frail fingers plucking nervously at the arms of her chair. &ldquo;I must
  go&mdash;I must&mdash;I must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton glanced at the nurse, then stared at his wife&mdash;Miss Harvey&rsquo;s
  meaning look was hardly necessary to drive home to him the fact that Mrs.
  Thornton was in no condition to be denied anything.</p>
  <p>Red-faced, Thornton strode to the back of the chair and began to push it
  along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of all the damned foolishness that ever I heard of,&rdquo; he gritted
  savagely, &ldquo;this is the worst!&rdquo; His face went redder still with
  mortification. &ldquo;If this ever leaks out I&rsquo;ll never hear the last
  of it. Look at us&mdash;bringing up the rear of a gibbering mob of yokels!
  We&rsquo;re fit for a padded cell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the crowd, Madison rubbed shoulders for a moment with Pale Face Harry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the party with the wheel-chair behind?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Millionaire&mdash;Chicago&mdash;private car&mdash; Flopper&rsquo;s
  got the wife going hard&mdash; rode down with them,&rdquo; coughed Pale Face
  Harry behind his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll get acquainted,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;Circulate,
  Harry, and cough your head off&mdash;don&rsquo;t hide your light under a
  bushel&mdash;circulate.&rdquo; And Madison fell back to scrape acquaintance
  with the man of millions.</p>
  <p>Close-packed upon the road, the procession spread out for a hundred yards
  behind the Flopper&mdash;bare-footed children; women in multi-colored gingham
  and calico; men in the uncouth dress of the fields, the uncouthness accentuated
  by the sprinkling of more pretentious clothing worn by those who had come
  from the train. And slowly, very slowly, this conglomerate human cosmorama
  moved on, undulating queerly with the variant movements of its component
  parts, snail-like, for the Flopper&rsquo;s pace was slow&mdash;as strange
  a spectacle, perhaps, as the human eye had ever witnessed, something of grimness,
  something of humor, something of awe, something of fear exuding from it&mdash;it
  seemed to contain within itself the range, and to express, the gamut of all
  human emotion.</p>
  <p>On the procession went&mdash;so slowly as to be almost sinister in its movement.
  And a strange sound rose from it and seemed to float and hover over it like
  a weird, invisible, acoustic canopy. Three hundred voices, men&rsquo;s, women&rsquo;s
  and children&rsquo;s, rose and fell, rose and fell&mdash;at first in a medley
  of scoffings, laughter, sullen murmurs, earnest dispute and children&rsquo;s
  prattle&mdash;a strange composite sound indeed! But as the minutes passed
  and the mass moved on and stopped as the Flopper paused to rest, and moved
  on and stopped and moved on again, gradually this changed, very gradually,
  not abruptly, but as though the scoffings and the laughter were dying away
  almost imperceptibly in the distance. For as the Flopper stopped to rest,
  those near him gazed upon his face, distorted, full of muscular distress,
  sweat pouring from his forehead, pain and suffering written in every lineament&mdash;and
  drew back whispering into the crowd, giving place to others until all had
  seen. And so the strange sound from this strange congregation grew lower,
  until it was a sort of breathless, long-sustained and wavering note, a prescience,
  a premonition of something to come, a ghastly mockery or a tragedy to befall,
  until it was an awe-struck murmuring thing.</p>
  <p>Some spoke to him now and in pity offered to get him a horse and wagon,
  offered even to carry him&mdash;but the Flopper shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be but a few minutes now,&rdquo; he
  panted in an exalted voice, &ldquo;before I&rsquo;m cured&mdash;I got de
  faith to know dat&mdash;I got de faith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the crippled lad upon the crutch beside him urged him on. The boy&rsquo;s
  face was strained and eager, full of mingled emotions&mdash;pride in the
  leading part he played, wonder and expectancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, mister, come on!&rdquo; he kept saying, impatiently accommodating
  his own restricted pace to the Flopper&rsquo;s still slower one.</p>
  <p>Through the wagon track, through the woods beneath the trees, the dead,
  slow, shuffling tread went on&mdash;and now even the murmuring sound was
  hushed. Men and women stared into each other&rsquo;s faces&mdash;children
  sought their elders&rsquo; hands. What did it mean? Faith&mdash;yes, they
  had had faith&mdash;but never faith like this. They looked at the awful deformity
  over one another&rsquo;s heads, crawling inch by inch along before them&mdash;watched
  the stubborn, bitter struggle of pain and suffering of the wretched man who
  led them, spurred on by a faith cast in a heroic mold such as none there
  had ever dreamed of before&mdash;and they spoke no more. There was only the
  sound of movement now&mdash;and that curiously subdued. Men seemed to choose
  their footing, seeking to tread noiselessly, as though in some solemn presence
  that awed them and held them in an intangible, heart-quickening suspense.</p>
  <p>Onward they went&mdash;following the lurching, wriggling, reeling, broken
  thing before them&mdash;following the Flopper, his right hand and arm curved
  piteously inward to his chin, his neck thrown sideways, his sagging leg seeming
  to hold only to his body by spasmodic jerks to catch up with the body itself,
  like the steel when detached from the magnet that bounds forward to re-attach
  itself again, his eyes starting from his head, his face bloodless with exertion
  and twisted as fearfully as were his limbs, but upon his lips a smile of
  resolution, of indomitable assurance.</p>
  <p>Onward they went&mdash;a huddled mass of humanity, literate and illiterate,
  of all ages, of all conditions, and none laughed, none grinned, none smiled,
  none spoke&mdash;all that was past. They stopped, they moved again&mdash;as
  the Flopper stopped and moved. Occasionally a child cried out&mdash;occasionally
  there came a discordant, racking cough&mdash;that was all.</p>
  <p>Tenser grew the very atmosphere they breathed&mdash;heavier upon them fell
  the sense of something almost supernatural, beyond the human and the finite.
  Skeptic and faint believer, sinner, Christian and scoffer, they were all
  alike now in the presence of a faith whose evidence was before them in harrowing
  vividness, in the torment and agony of a fellow creature who sought again
  through faith a restoration to the image of his kind. There was no creed,
  no school of ethical belief, no conflicting orthodoxy to quibble over, no
  ground on which atheist and theologian even might stand apart&mdash;there
  was only <i>faith</i>&mdash;a faith whose trappings none might take issue
  with, for it was naked faith and the trappings were stripped from it&mdash;it
  was faith in its very essence, boundless, utter, simple, limitless, staggering,
  appalling them.</p>
  <p>Its consummation? That was another thing&mdash;a thing that in the presence
  of such faith as this brought human pity, sympathy and sorrow to its full,
  brought dread and terror. Faith such as this they had never conceived; faith
  such as this, if it was to prove a shattered thing, was for its exponent
  to drink the very dregs of misery and despair&mdash;and yet, rising above
  that possibility, flinging grim challenge at their doubts, stood this very
  faith, mighty in itself, perfect in its confidence, heroic in its agony,
  that all might gaze upon from a common standpoint and know&mdash;as faith.</p>
  <p>No whispering breeze stirred the young leaves in the trees; in the stillness
  of the afternoon came only the heavy, pulsing throb of Nature&rsquo;s breathing.
  One hundred, two, three hundred, they moved along, slow, sinuous, troubled,
  their eyes straight before them or upon the ground at their feet&mdash;only
  the children looked with frightened, startled eyes into their parents&rsquo; faces,
  and clung the closer.</p>
  <p>Out upon the wagon track they debouched and spread in a long, thin line
  beneath the maples on either side of the Flopper&mdash;and waited.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Miracle</b></h2>
  <p>THERE was utter silence now&mdash;the tread of shuffling feet was gone&mdash;no
  man moved&mdash;it seemed as though no man <i>breathed</i>&mdash;they stood
  as carven things, inanimate, men, women and children strained forward, their
  faces drawn, tense and rigid. In the very air, around them, everywhere, imprisoning
  them, clutching like an icy hand at the heart, something unseen, a dread,
  intangible presence weighed them down and lay heavy upon them. What was to
  come? What drear tragedy was to be enacted? What awful mockery was to fall
  upon this maimed and mutilated creature within whose deformed and pitiful
  body there too was a human soul?</p>
  <p>From the cottage door across the lawn came two figures&mdash;a girl in simple,
  clinging white, her head bowed, the sun itself seeming to caress the dark
  brown wealth of hair upon her head, changing it to glinting strands of burnished
  copper; and beside her walked the Patriarch, his hand resting lightly upon
  her arm, a wondrous figure of a man, majestic, simple, grand, his silvered-hair
  bared to the sun, his face illumined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There he is, mister!&rdquo; whispered young Holmes hoarsely. &ldquo;There
  he is! Go on, mister, go on&mdash;see what he can do for you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There came a sound that was like a great, gasping intake of breath, as men
  and women watched. Out toward the Patriarch, alone now, the Flopper began
  to wriggle and writhe his way along. God in Heaven have pity! What was this
  sight they looked upon&mdash;this poor, distorted, mangled thing that grovelled
  in the earth&mdash;that figure towering there in the sunlight with venerable
  white beard and hair, erect, symbolic of some strange, mystic power that
  awed them, his head turned slightly in a curious listening attitude, the
  sightless eyes closed, upon the face a great calm like a solemn benediction.</p>
  <p>Fell a stillness that was as the stillness of death; came a hush until in
  men&rsquo;s ears was the quick, fierce pound and throb of their own hearts.
  On, on toward the Patriarch slithered and twisted that frightful deformity
  that they had followed over that long, torturing mile&mdash;on, on he went,
  and they watched scarce drawing breath, their faces white, their very limbs
  held as in a palsied, fearsome spell&mdash;and then, sudden, abrupt, terrifying,
  there rose a shriek, wild, hysterical, prolonged, in a woman&rsquo;s voice,
  the cadence wavering from guttural to shrill and ending in a high-pitched,
  broken scream.</p>
  <p>The Flopper halted and turned himself about, while his left hand swept his
  livid face, brushing from it the spurting drops, sweeping back the damp,
  tangled hair from his eyes&mdash;faced them till they saw an agony on human
  countenance that struck, stabbing, to their souls&mdash;faced them while
  his eyes traversed the long, long line of ghastly white faces before him,
  out of which eyes everywhere, row on row of them, straining, fixed, fascinated,
  seemed to burn like living fires as they held him in their focus.</p>
  <p>He had not gone far, perhaps ten yards&mdash;no more. By the group around
  the wheel-chair, almost in the center of the line, stood Madison, his chin
  in his hand in a meditative, thoughtful attitude, the single soul who watched
  the scene from under lowered lids; Thornton had involuntarily edged a little
  forward from behind the chair until he stood now at its side in a strange,
  abashed way as though his own personality were over-ruled, obliterated, his
  face with a white sternness upon it, his eyes, like all other eyes, agleam
  with an unnatural fire; Mrs. Thornton had pulled herself forward in the chair,
  one hand clutching at her breast, the frail fingers of the other woven in
  a grasp so tight around the arm of the chair that the flesh was bloodless;
  a little way off, a group of three, the two salesmen and the metropolitan
  newspaper man, seemed as though stricken into stone, stripped of all assurance,
  all complacence, awed, tense, palpitant, as the patched, bare-legged tatterdemalion
  of ten from the fields, that stood beside them, was awed and tense and palpitant.</p>
  <p>And away on either side stretched the line of white, rigid faces, the never-ending,
  burning eyes&mdash;but the silence with that shriek was gone now, for another
  woman and another, overwrought, needing but that sudden shock to unnerve
  them utterly, shrieked in turn&mdash;and through the line seemed to run a
  shudder, and it moved a little though no foot stirred, moved with a strange,
  sinuous, rocking, swaying movement, from the hips, backward and forward and
  to either side. Men raised their eyes, stole frightened, questioning glances
  at their neighbors&mdash;and fixed their eyes on the Flopper again&mdash;on
  the Flopper and that majestic figure in the center of the lawn, so calm of
  mien, of attitude and pose.</p>
  <p>Once again the Flopper&rsquo;s eyes swept the scene. A few feet in advance
  of the crowd, as though drawn irresistibly forward, young Holmes hung upon
  his crutch. The boy&rsquo;s soul seemed in his face&mdash;hope, a world of
  it, as he gazed at the Patriarch, sickening fear as he looked at the Flopper;
  his lips moving without sound, his body trembling with emotional excitement.
  Still once again the Flopper&rsquo;s eyes swept the line of men and women
  and children, fast reaching toward a common ungovernable hysteria&mdash;and
  then he turned with an unbalanced, impotent, broken movement, flung out his
  good arm toward the Patriarch in piteous supplication, and, jerking himself
  forward, went on.</p>
  <p>Slowly, very slowly at first, he resumed his way, crawling it seemed by
  no more than a painful inch on inch, in mortal pain, in mortal agony and
  struggle&mdash;then gradually his movements began to quicken, as though growing
  upon him were a mad, elated haste that he could not control&mdash;quicker
  and quicker he went, pitching and lurching wildly from a pace that was beyond
  him.</p>
  <p>A strange, low, moaning sound rose from behind him, fluttering, inarticulate,
  that voiceless utterance that seeks to find some vent for human emotion when
  human emotion sweeps with mighty surge to engulf the soul. It rose and died
  away and rose again&mdash;and died away&mdash;and children began to whimper
  with a fear and terror that they did not understand, and seeking solace in
  their elders&rsquo; faces found added cause for fear instead.</p>
  <p>Nearer to that saintly figure who stood so calm, so quiet, the massive white-locked
  head still turned a little in that curious listening attitude, beside whom,
  close drawn now, was that white-clad girlish form, whose eyes were lowered,
  whose sweet face seemed to hold a heaven of pity and infinite compassion,
  upon whose lips there was a smile of divine tenderness, drew that piteous
  mockery of the image of a man, whose every movement appeared one of agony
  beyond human power to endure&mdash;and the agony found echo in the watchers&rsquo; souls,
  and a low, muffled groan as of men in pain and hurt, ran tremulously along
  the line.</p>
  <p>Still nearer to the Patriarch drew the Flopper. More heart-rending was his
  every movement, for with his quickened pace he sought to move without the
  aid of the only member that was as other men&rsquo;s, his left hand and arm
  that, in pleading, yearning supplication, was stretched out before him to
  the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>The extreme ends of the long line of watchers curled a little inward, almost
  imperceptibly, a half step taken without volition. The crippled boy, swaying
  upon his crutch, his lips parted, trembling in every limb, edged forward
  hesitantly, fearfully, now a foot, now another, now the bare space of a single
  inch. And now down the entire length of the line from end to end that wavering,
  rocking movement in swaying, pregnant unison grew stronger&mdash;men knew
  not what they did&mdash;it seemed the very air they breathed must smother
  them&mdash;and, in that dull, weird, lingering note, rose again the sound
  of moaning that seemed to beat in consonance with the distant mournful rhythm
  of the endless beat of surf on shore.</p>
  <p>Women clutched at their breasts now; men&rsquo;s knuckles went white beneath
  the tight-drawn skin; the children drew behind their mothers&rsquo; skirts
  and, terror-stricken, cried aloud. Surcharged, on the edge, the bare and
  ragged edge of frenzy now was every man and woman in the crowd. It was a
  sight, a spectacle that racked them in every fibre of their beings, that
  stirred them to pity, to hope, to fear, until the awful misery of this blighted
  and crawling thing was their own in its every twitch of agony&mdash;that
  struck them with a terror, the greater because it was indefinable, a prescience,
  a reaching out beyond human realm, the invoking of a supernal power&mdash;the
  thought of which very power, once loosed, chilled them with panic-dread.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000041h-images/page127.jpg" width="516" height="750"></p>
  <p>Yet still they watched&mdash;it was beyond their power to turn their eyes&mdash;enthralled,
  a moaning, swaying, rocking mob, they watched. Madness was creeping upon
  them rampant. Like a mighty tide, the ocean weight behind it, hurling itself
  against flood-gates that could never stand, it mounted higher and higher;
  and already, as the water first seeps between the gates, grim forecast of
  what was to come, it showed itself now in that long, sobbing, convulsive
  inhalation, in that strange, sinuous, restless movement. On went the Flopper.
  There was still a yard to go&mdash;two feet&mdash;<i>one</i>. Stopped in
  a sudden deathless hush was all sound. The Flopper flung himself forward
  upon his face at the Patriarch&rsquo;s feet. Stopped was all movement, haggard
  and tense every face, strained every eye. For a moment that seemed to span
  eternity, in a huddled heap, that crippled, twisted thing lay there before
  them motionless, without sign of life&mdash;the venerable face above it,
  still intent, still listening, turned slowly downwards. Then there was a
  movement, a movement that blanched the watching faces to a more pallid white&mdash;that
  dangling, wobbling leg drew inward slowly, very slowly, and hip and knee,
  as though guided by some mighty power, immutable, supreme, came deliberately
  into normal form.</p>
  <p>A shriek, a cry, a wail, a sob, a prayer&mdash;it came now unrestrained&mdash;hysteria
  was loosed in a mad ungovernable orgasm&mdash;men clutched at each other
  and cowered, hiding their faces with their hands&mdash;women dropped to their
  knees and, sobbing, screaming, prayed. Loud it rose, the turmoil of human
  souls aghast and quailing before a manifestation that seemed to fling them
  face to face, uncovered, naked, before the awful power and majesty and might
  of Heaven itself.</p>
  <p>They looked again&mdash;fearfully. The twisted thing was standing now, standing
  but still deformed&mdash;with crooked neck, with curved, bent, palsied arm.
  And nearer had drawn little Holmes, his head thrust forward, shaking as with
  the ague as he gazed on the group before him, oblivious to all else around
  him.</p>
  <p>A twinge of frightful torture swept the Flopper&rsquo;s face&mdash;and with
  that same slow, awful deliberation the misshapen arm straightened out. Men
  cried aloud again and again&mdash;a woman fainted, another here, another
  there&mdash;children wailed and ran, some shrieking, some whimpering, for
  the woods.</p>
  <p>Again the spasm crossed the Flopper&rsquo;s face, a shuddering, muscular
  contortion&mdash;and from the shoulder rose his head.</p>
  <p>Inward drew the ends of the line of paroxysm-stricken people&mdash;not far,
  not near to that hallowed group for something held them back; but inward
  gradually until the line, no longer straight, was half a circle, crescent
  shaped. Louder came that harrowing medley of sounds, its component parts
  voicing the uttermost depths of the soul of each separate individual man
  and woman there&mdash;some moaned in terror; some prayed, mumbling, still
  upon their knees; some laughed hoarsely, wildly, their senses for the moment
  gone; and some were dumb; and some shrieked their prayers in frenzy. Louder
  it grew&mdash;the end had come&mdash;that deformed thing stood erect, a perfect
  man&mdash;he turned his face toward them&mdash;he stretched out his arms&mdash;and
  they answered him with their wails, their sobs, their moans, their cries&mdash;they
  answered him in their terror, in their shaken senses, clutching at each other
  again&mdash;answered him from their knees, their voices hoarse&mdash;answered
  him with trembling lips and tongues that would not move.</p>
  <p>And then suddenly, as though riven where they stood and kneeled and crouched,
  all movement ceased&mdash;and every heart stood still as ringing clear above
  all else, shocking all else to stunned, petrified silence, there came a cry&mdash;a
  cry in a young voice. It rang again and again, trembling with glad, new life,
  vibrant, a cry that seemed to thrill with chords of happiness and ecstasy
  immeasurable. Again it came, again, exultant, pulsing with a mighty joy&mdash;young
  Holmes had <i>flung his crutch from him</i>, and, with outstretched arms,
  was running toward the Patriarch across the lawn.</p>
  <p>For an instant more that stunned, awed silence held. All eyes were riveted
  and fixed upon the scene&mdash;none looked at Madison&mdash;if any had they
  would have seen that his face had gone an ivory white.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  The Aftermath</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I AM cured, Robert! Robert! Robert! See, I too am cured! Oh, Robert,
  what wondrous joy!&rdquo; Mrs. Thornton had left her wheel-chair and was
  standing beside her husband, standing alone, unaided for the first time in
  many months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo;&mdash;it was a hoarse cry from Thornton. Then his hand
  passed heavily across his face as though to force his brain to coherent action,
  to lift the spell of what seemed a wild phantasm in all around him. &ldquo;Naida!&rdquo;&mdash;he
  sought now to control his voice&mdash;&ldquo;Naida, get back into your chair
  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She laughed&mdash;a little hysterically&mdash;but in the laugh too was the
  uplift of a soul enraptured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am cured, Robert. See, dear, can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; She
  shook his arm. &ldquo;See&mdash;I am cured. I can walk just as I could before
  I was ill. Oh, Robert, Robert! See! See!&rdquo;&mdash;she went from him,
  walking a little, running a little&mdash;and laughing in a low, rippling,
  glorious laugh that was like the music of silver chimes ringing out in glad
  acclaim.</p>
  <p>He stared at her, both hands now to his temples; then he turned to look
  strangely at the empty chair&mdash;but it was not empty. Miss Harvey, the
  nurse, on her knees, had flung herself across it and, with buried head, was
  sobbing unrestrainedly.</p>
  <p>And now upon the lawn was a scene indescribable. The long line was broken.
  Men and women ran hither and thither, for the most part aimlessly, as though
  in some strange state of coma where the mind refused its functions. They
  talked and cried and shouted at each other in frenzy without knowing what
  they said&mdash;some with tears raining down their faces, others with blank
  countenances, no sign of emotion upon them other than in their wild, dilated
  eyes. Here and there they rushed without volition, their throat-noises rising
  above them, floating through the still air in a sound that no ear had ever
  heard before, weird, terrifying, without license, beyond control. Like mad
  creatures rushing against each other in the dark they were, stupified by
  a sight that was no mortal sight, a sight that blinded them mentally because
  it was no <i>human</i> sight.</p>
  <p>Faith? Faith is a matter of degree, is it not?</p>
  <p>Or is it at its full in power and efficacy at moments when hysteria in paroxysm
  is at its height? Who shall define faith? Who shall say what it is, and who
  shall place its limitations upon it?</p>
  <p>Out in the center of the lawn young Holmes was in his mother&rsquo;s arms,
  the father pathetically trying to wrap both mother and child in his own.
  Around them, attracted in that strange uncertain way, the crowd constantly
  grew larger. Further out again, Helena was leading the Patriarch toward the
  cottage, the Flopper close behind her&mdash;the Patriarch walking with a
  slow tread, his head still turned a little in that listening attitude&mdash;and
  at a distance followed a straggling crowd. Then the cottage door was shut&mdash;and
  Helena, the Patriarch and the Flopper disappeared from view.</p>
  <p>A dozen yards from the wheel-chair stood Madison, riveted to the spot, motionless
  save for a nervous twitching of the lips, his eyes, now upon the invalid
  who walked about, now on the little lad who had thrown away his crutch. Some
  one plucked at his sleeve, but Madison gave no heed&mdash;again his arm was
  pulled, and he turned to look into Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s face. The other&rsquo;s
  countenance was gray, the eyes full of a shrinking, terrified light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doc, for God&rsquo;s sake, Doc, what&rsquo;s it mean?&rdquo; whispered
  Pale Face Harry shakily, moistening his dry lips with his tongue. &ldquo;Doc,
  this ain&rsquo;t no bunk&mdash;there&rsquo;s something in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words seemed to rouse Madison&mdash;to leadership. He stared at Pale
  Face Harry for a moment, then a grim smile flickered across his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something in it!&rdquo; he repeated with an ironic laugh&mdash;and
  suddenly grabbed Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s arm and shook him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  so much in it that I&rsquo;m drunk with it, crazy with it&mdash;but I&rsquo;m
  trying to make myself believe it isn&rsquo;t too good to be true. Get that?
  Get a grip on that, and hang on. Don&rsquo;t lose your nerve, Harry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess I ain&rsquo;t much worse than you,&rdquo; mumbled Pale Face
  Harry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re whiter than a sheet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; admitted Madison frankly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  queer, but I&rsquo;m coming around. Helena seems to be the only one who never
  lost her grip&mdash;she&rsquo;s got the Patriarch and the Flopper out of
  the way and under cover. Brace up, Harry&mdash;what I thought we&rsquo;d
  get in the Roost that night is counterfeit money to what&rsquo;ll come from
  this.&rdquo; His eyes fastened on a figure that, separating itself from the
  group around young Holmes, now dashed frantically, hatless, and with dishevelled
  hair to Mr. and Mrs. Thornton. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that, Harry? He came down
  on the train with you&mdash;know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only some newspaper guy or other,&rdquo; answered Pale
  Face Harry mechanically, his eyes still roving wildly over the scene around
  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, is that <i>all!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated Madison with a little
  gasp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already exhausted my thanks to Santa Claus and here
  he comes with another package done up in dinky pink paper tied with baby
  ribbon&mdash;and the gold platter it&rsquo;s on goes with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; asked Pale Face Harry heavily.</p>
  <p>The newspaper man, the instinct of his calling now rising paramount to all
  else, had left the Thorntons and was tearing for the wagon track on his way
  to the station and the telegraph office like one possessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Madison softly, &ldquo;the missionaries
  will be explaining this to the Esquimaux at Oo-lou-lou, the near-invalids
  in California will be packing their trunks, likewise those in the languid
  shade of the Florida palms; they&rsquo;ll be listing it on the stock exchange
  in New York, and the breath of Eden will waft itself o&rsquo;er plain and
  valley until&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped suddenly, as Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s
  voice reached him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going to <i>walk</i> back, Robert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but, Naida,&rdquo; Thornton protested, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not
  strong enough yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; she cried, half laughing, half
  sobbing. &ldquo;There is no &lsquo;yet&rsquo;&mdash;I am cured, dear&mdash;<i>all</i> cured.
  I&rsquo;m well and strong. Try to understand, Robert&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m
  so happy, so&mdash;so thankful. I know it&rsquo;s miraculous, that it&rsquo;s
  almost impossible to believe&mdash;but try to understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am trying to,&rdquo; said Thornton numbly, watching her as she
  moved about. &ldquo;And it seems as though I were in a dream&mdash;that this
  isn&rsquo;t real&mdash;that you&rsquo;re not real.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a dream,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so
  strong again. Why, Robert, it would be just as absurd for me to be wheeled
  back in that chair as for you to be&mdash;and besides I have no right to
  do that now. It would be a sacrilege, profaning the gratitude in my heart&mdash;I
  am cured and these poor people here must see that I am cured&mdash;Robert,
  we must leave that wheel-chair here that others, poor sufferers who will
  come now, will see and believe and be cured too. And, Robert, in some way,
  I do not know just how, we who are rich must do something to help people
  to get here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naida,&rdquo; said Thornton, his voice low, shaken, &ldquo;I feel
  as though I were in another world. I have seen what I can hardly make myself
  believe that I have seen. I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;I am speaking, but
  my very voice seems strange to me. I feel as you do about helping others&mdash;how
  could I feel otherwise? What we could do I do not know as yet, either&mdash;but
  I will do anything. I was a scoffing fool&mdash;and you were cured before
  my eyes&mdash;a boy was cured&mdash;and that other, deformed as no creature
  was ever deformed before, was cured&rdquo;&mdash;Thornton&rsquo;s lips quivered,
  and he hid his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While the iron is hot&mdash;strike,&rdquo; murmured Madison. He gazed
  a moment longer at the group&mdash;Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s hand was on her
  husband&rsquo;s shoulder now&mdash;then his eyes roved over the frenzied
  scenes still being enacted everywhere upon the lawn. &ldquo;I wonder?&rdquo; he
  muttered. The frown on his forehead cleared suddenly. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said
  he to Pale Face Harry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch&mdash;it&rsquo;s as good
  as done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry stared at him queerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Harry,&rdquo; smiled Madison, &ldquo;my pulse is quite normal
  now, thank you. Listen. This is where we call the first showdown on cold
  hands&mdash;and the dealer slips himself an ace.&rdquo; He drew a key from
  his pocket and put it in Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  the key of the small trunk in my room at the hotel&mdash;front room, right
  hand side of the hall. There&rsquo;s a check-book in the tray&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll
  give you twenty minutes to get back here with it. You&rsquo;ll find me somewhere
  around here, but you needn&rsquo;t let the whole earth in on the presentation&mdash;see?
  Now beat it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As Pale Face Harry hurried away, Madison, seemingly as aimless, as hysterical
  as the hundreds about him, moved here and there, but unostentatiously he
  kept nearing the upper end of the lawn, and, finally, hidden by the woodshed
  at the further end of the cottage, he slipped quickly around to the rear.
  Here the garden stretched almost to the edge of the sandy beach&mdash;not
  a soul was in sight&mdash;and the beat of the surf deadened the sound from
  the front lawn to little more than a low, indistinct murmur.</p>
  <p>Quickly now, Madison stepped to where one of the old-fashioned windows,
  that swung inward from the center like double doors, was open, and, reaching
  in his hand, tapped sharply twice in succession with his knuckles on the
  pane. The sill was not quite on a level with his shoulders and he could see
  inside&mdash;it was Helena&rsquo;s room, and the door to the hall was open.
  Again he knocked. Came then the sound of footsteps&mdash;and from the hall
  the Flopper&rsquo;s face peered cautiously around the jamb of the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell Helena to come here,&rdquo; called Madison softly.</p>
  <p>The Flopper turned his head, called obediently, and in a dazed sort of way
  came himself to the window. His face was haggard, and he shivered as he licked
  his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pulled de stunt,&rdquo; said the Flopper in a croaking voice, &ldquo;but
  de kid&mdash;Doc&mdash;did youse see de kid? I got de shakes&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  like de whole of hell an&rsquo; de other place was loose, an&rsquo; Helena&rsquo;s
  gone batty, an&rsquo;&mdash;pipe her, dere she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Into the room came Helena, her face like chalk&mdash;all color gone from
  even her lips. She clutched at the window beside the Flopper for support.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone
  too far&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;John Madison, I&rsquo;m frightened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison did not speak for a moment&mdash;Madison was a consummate leader.
  He looked, smiling reassuringly, from one to the other&mdash;and then leaned
  soothingly, confidentially, in over the sill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know how you feel&mdash;felt just the same myself for a bit,&rdquo; said
  he quietly. &ldquo;But now look here, you&rsquo;ve got to pull yourselves
  together&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of. It&rsquo;s natural
  enough. It&rsquo;s faith, Helena&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what we were banking
  on&mdash;only not quite so hard. That kid and Mrs. Thornton annexed the real
  brand, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;and when the genuine thing is on tap I cross
  my fingers and yell for faith&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to stop it. And
  that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s got both of you too, eh? Well, that only
  makes our game the safer and the more certain, doesn&rsquo;t it? So, come
  on now, pull yourselves together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In de last act when I was gettin&rsquo; me head into joint,&rdquo; mumbled
  the Flopper, &ldquo;was when de kid yelled&mdash;I can hear it yet, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; Madison broke in a little sharply; then, tactfully,
  his voice full of unbounded admiration: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist, Flopper&mdash;a
  wonder. You pulled the greatest act that was ever on the boards, and you
  pulled it as no other man on earth could have pulled it. Flopper, you make
  me feel humble when I look at you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said the Flopper, brightening. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
  mean it, Doc&mdash;honest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean it!&rdquo; ejaculated Madison. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the whole
  thing, Flopper&mdash;you win. Come on now, Helena, buck up&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
  got another little act due in about fifteen minutes&mdash;don&rsquo;t let
  a lot of yowling rubes get your goat. Why, say, we&rsquo;ve got the whole
  show on the stampede&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve got to rush our luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de way to talk&mdash;leave
  it to de Doc every time&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t feazed half de way I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Helena a little tremulously. &ldquo;What
  is it we&rsquo;re to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Madison, smiling at her approvingly. &ldquo;That
  sounds better. Now listen&mdash;and listen hard. From this minute this cottage
  is the Shrine. Get that?&mdash;Shrine. You&rsquo;ve got to keep the hush
  falling here, and keep it falling all the time&mdash;a sort of holy, hallowed
  silence, understand? Lay it on thick&mdash;make the crowd stand back&mdash;make
  the guy that comes in here feel as though he ought to come in on his knees
  and as if he&rsquo;d be struck dead if he didn&rsquo;t. Get the slow music
  and the low lights working. And keep the Patriarch well back of the drop
  except when he&rsquo;s on for a turn. Get me? He&rsquo;s no side-show with
  a barker in front of the tent&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that for a minute.
  The harder it is to see the Patriarch and the less he&rsquo;s seen, the bigger
  he plays up when he&rsquo;s on. He goes to no man under any conditions, and
  the only man or woman that gets to him is through faith and supplication,
  and a double order of it at that. Keep the solemn, breathless tap turned
  on all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena looked at him with a strange little smile quivering on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;ve got a sense of humor,&rdquo; she
  said slowly, &ldquo;or else I think I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Madison cheerfully. &ldquo;But
  time&rsquo;s flying. You&rsquo;re going to have visitors in a few minutes,
  and here&rsquo;s where the Patriarch gets tucked away out of sight behind
  the veil for a starter, leaving his presence hovering and throbbing all around
  in the air&mdash;you stay with him, Flopper, in a back room somewhere and
  hold his hand. Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In his armchair in the sitting-room,&rdquo; said Helena. &ldquo;And
  he&rsquo;s still listening in that queer way he did out on the lawn. I think
  he knows in a little way what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Madison; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll make him
  happy. Well, lead him gently into retirement. I guess that&rsquo;s all&mdash;now
  hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is it that&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo; interposed Helena quickly,
  as Madison started away from the window.</p>
  <p>Madison grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some friends of the Flopper&rsquo;s. Mr. and Mrs. Thankoffering&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
  like them immensely, Helena. The lady walks quite well now, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walks!&rdquo; exclaimed the Flopper, who evidently had not assimilated
  Madison&rsquo;s previous reference to Mrs. Thornton. &ldquo;De lady dat I
  come wid in de private car&mdash;<i>walks?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Madison pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cured? All cured?&rdquo; gasped the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Madison again&mdash;complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the Flopper, &ldquo;say, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; dippy.
  Another one de same as de kid, Doc?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same as the kid, Flopper&mdash;faith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said the Flopper helplessly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  &ldquo;Said The Spider To The Fly</b>&rdquo;</h2>
  <p>BY the wheel-chair, Mrs. Thornton, her husband and Doc Madison were in earnest
  conversation&mdash;and around them was a mass of people. The crowd had divided
  into two, or, rather, was constantly coming and going between two points&mdash;young
  Holmes and Mrs. Thornton&mdash;and still the hysteria was upon men and women,
  still that wavering, moanlike sound floated over the lawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am stunned and stupified,&rdquo; Madison was saying, and his hand
  trembled visibly in its outflung gesture. &ldquo;I am not, I am afraid, a
  man of deep sensibilities, but I cannot help feeling that I have been permitted,
  been chosen even, to witness this sight, a sight that will stay with me till
  I die, for some great, ulterior purpose. It&rsquo;s as though this place
  were hallowed, set apart; that here, if only one has faith, that man&rsquo;s
  miraculous power is boundless&mdash;that I should help someway. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  afraid I don&rsquo;t explain myself well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; Mrs. Thornton returned eagerly. &ldquo;It
  is what I was saying to my husband&mdash;to make this place known, to help
  to bring suffering people here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison nodded silently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if you, who have no personal cause for gratitude, feel like that,
  how much more should we who&mdash;who&mdash;oh, there are no words to tell
  it&mdash;my heart is too full&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Thornton smiled through tears. &ldquo;Robert,
  you said you would do anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; Thornton answered gravely. &ldquo;But what? We
  cannot do things in a moment. If money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Money is only a secondary
  consideration. It&rsquo;s the needs of the place that are paramount. It&rsquo;s
  not so much the bringing of people here&mdash;they will hear of what has
  taken place and will come of their own accord, they will flock here in numbers
  as time goes on. But then&mdash;what? What can be done with them in this
  little village? For a time perhaps they could be accommodated&mdash;but after
  that they must be turned away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turned away!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Thornton, in a hurt cry. &ldquo;Turned
  away from hope&mdash;to bitterness and misery again! No, no, they must not!
  Why&rdquo;&mdash;she grasped her husband&rsquo;s arm agitatedly&mdash;&ldquo;why
  couldn&rsquo;t we buy land and put little houses upon it where they could
  stay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison leaned suddenly toward her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve hit on the idea, Mrs. Thornton,&rdquo; he
  said excitedly. &ldquo;Why not? It would be the finest thing that was ever
  done in the world. But why not go further&mdash;this should not be a private
  enterprise with the burden on the few.&rdquo; He turned abruptly to Mr. Thornton. &ldquo;What
  a monument from grateful hearts, what a tribute to that saintly soul a huge
  sanatorium, built and properly endowed, would be! And it is feasible&mdash;purely
  from the voluntary contributions of those who come here and have money&mdash;free
  as the air to the poor who are sick&mdash;free to <i>all</i>, for that matter&mdash;no
  one asked to give&mdash;but the poorest would gladly lay down their mites.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thornton raptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Thornton thoughtfully; &ldquo;that might
  be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of it,&rdquo; asserted Madison enthusiastically. &ldquo;It
  needs but the initiative on the part of some one, on our part, and the rest
  will take care of itself. But we must, of course, have the endorsement of
  the Patriarch&mdash;why not go to the cottage now, at once, and talk it over? &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can we see <i>him?</i>&rdquo; asked Mrs. Thornton wistfully. &ldquo;Oh,
  I would like to kneel at his feet and pour out my gratitude. But see how
  all these people go no nearer than that row of trees, as though love or fear
  or reverence kept them from going further, as though it were almost forbidden,
  holy ground, as though they were held back by an invisible barrier in spite
  of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Madison; &ldquo;and I sense that very thing myself&mdash;all
  men must sense it after what has taken place, all must feel the presence
  of a power too majestic, too full of awe for the mind to grasp. This faith&mdash;&rdquo; he
  threw out his hands in an impotent gesture&mdash;&ldquo;we can only accept
  it unquestioningly, as a mighty thing, an actual, living, existent thing,
  even if we cannot fully understand. But I feel that with what we have in
  mind we have a right to go there now&mdash;and we should take that little
  lad who was cured as well&mdash;and his parents, they should come too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And shall we see <i>him?</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Thornton asked again tensely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I do not know,&rdquo; Madison replied; &ldquo;but at least we
  shall see his niece, Miss Vail, and it is with her in any case that we would
  have to discuss the plan, for the Patriarch, you know, is deaf and dumb and
  blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know them, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Thornton inquired.</p>
  <p>Madison smiled, a little strangely, a little deprecatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If one can speak of &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; such as they&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;When I came two weeks ago, the Patriarch was not wholly
  blind, and he was very kind to me. I learned to love the gentle soul of the
  man, and in a way, skeptical though I was, I felt his power&mdash;but I never
  realized until this afternoon how stupendous, how immeasurable it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us go to the cottage, then,&rdquo; said Thornton. &ldquo;Naida,
  dear, let me help you; it is quite a little distance and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She put out her hands in a happy, intimate way to hold him off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t realize it, Robert, can you? That dear, practical
  business head of yours makes it even harder for you than it is for me&mdash;and
  I can hardly realize it myself. But I <i>am</i> cured, dear, and I&rsquo;m
  well and strong, and I don&rsquo;t need any help&mdash;why, Robert, I am
  going to help you now, instead of always being a source of worry and anxiety
  to you. Come, let us go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will walk slowly,&rdquo; suggested Madison, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  speak to the little Holmes boy and his parents, and bring them with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He moved away as he spoke&mdash;in the direction of a racking cough, that
  rose above the confused, murmuring, whispering, shaken voices on every hand;
  and in a little knot of people he was, for a moment, pressed close against
  Pale Face Harry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; whispered Pale Face Harry, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in
  your pocket now&mdash;but, say, no more runs like that for me, I&rsquo;m
  all in. I thought sure I was cured myself&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t coughed for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about that now,&rdquo; said Madison rapidly. &ldquo;I
  want the crowd kept away from the doors of the bank vault if they show any
  tendency to get too close, though I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll happen&mdash;they&rsquo;re
  too numbed and scared yet. But you know the game. Keep the awe going and
  the &lsquo;holy ground&rsquo; signs up. Anybody that steps across that stretch
  between the trees and the cottage on and after the present date of writing
  does it with bowed head and his shoes off&mdash;get the idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anything&rsquo;d steer &rsquo;em
  now&mdash;they&rsquo;re like sheep. Leave it to me to keep the soft pedal
  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a nod, Madison turned away, the tense expression on his face assumed
  again&mdash;and presently he was talking to Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, and patting
  the boy&rsquo;s head in a clumsy, overwrought way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t dar&rsquo;st to go,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holmes,
  clutching wildly at the boy, still sobbing, still beyond control of herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Thornton is going,&rdquo; said Madison gently, &ldquo;and
  I know your gratitude is no less than hers&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t be less
  with this little lad restored to you. I am sure you want to show it&mdash;don&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d orter go, ma,&rdquo; said Mr. Holmes uneasily</p>
  <p>The boy put his hand in Madison&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to go, mister,&rdquo; he choked. &ldquo;Take me, mister, won&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think we&rsquo;d orter go,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Holmes. &ldquo;Come
  along, ma,&rdquo; he said, taking his wife&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>It was a strange group&mdash;the Thorntons, rich, refined, to whom luxury
  was necessity; the Holmes, poor, uncultured, coarsely dressed; and Madison,
  who walked with set face, head lowered a little, his pace slowing perceptibly,
  humbly it seemed, the nearer he came to the cottage door. Neither Thornton,
  nor Holmes, nor Holmes&rsquo; wife spoke. Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s arm was flung
  around the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, and he kept looking up into her tearful
  face&mdash;there was a bond between them that, young as he was, held him
  in its thrall. Out across the lawn, dotted here and there, in knots and groups
  and little crowds, men and women stopped where they stood and watched, making
  no effort to follow&mdash;and some, at the renewed evidence of the miraculous,
  once more so vividly before their eyes, dropped again to their knees.</p>
  <p>They reached the door, and Madison drew back a little and with the others
  waited silently after he had knocked. Then the door opened slowly, and Helena,
  slim and girlish in her simple white dress, appeared upon the threshold.
  Her great dark eyes travelled slowly from one to another, and then her face
  lighted with a gentle smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Vail,&rdquo; said Madison diffidently, &ldquo;this is Mrs. Thornton
  and her husband, and the little lad, with his parents, who owes so much to
  the Patriarch, and they have come to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To try and say a little of what is in their hearts&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.
  Thornton stepped impulsively forward and held out her hands to Helena&mdash;and
  then, breaking down suddenly, she began to sob, and the two were in each
  other&rsquo;s arms, Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s head buried on Helena&rsquo;s shoulder,
  Helena&rsquo;s face lowered, her brown hair mingling with the gold of the
  other&rsquo;s, her arms about the frail form that shook convulsively.</p>
  <p>Doc Madison shot a covert glance at the three behind him&mdash;Thornton,
  and Holmes, and Mrs. Holmes. Holmes, with downcast eyes, was shuffling awkwardly
  from foot to foot; Mrs. Holmes, her woman&rsquo;s instinct touched, was watching
  the scene with face aglow, her eyes moist anew; Thornton was staring fascinated
  at Helena, a sort of breathless, wondering admiration in his eyes.</p>
  <p>Madison involuntarily followed Thornton&rsquo;s look; then stole a glance
  back at Thornton again&mdash;Thornton was still gazing intently at Helena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; observed Madison to himself, &ldquo;the longer you live
  the more you learn, don&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s the kind of stuff Helena
  wears from now on, the clinging white with the bare throat effect and all
  that. Why, say, like that she&rsquo;s what the poets call radiantly divine&mdash;eh,
  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton raised her head, and her hands creeping to Helena&rsquo;s
  face brushed the brown hair tenderly back from the white forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, how good and sweet and pure you are!&rdquo; she murmured brokenly.</p>
  <p>A quick, sudden flush, passing to all but Madison as one of demure and startled
  modesty, swept in a crimson tide to Helena&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you must not say that,&rdquo; she faltered, shaking her
  head. &ldquo;I&mdash;you must not say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton smiled at her&mdash;and slipped her arm affectionately around
  Helena&rsquo;s waist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could not help it, dear,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It came spontaneously.
  And it makes me so happy to find you like this, and it makes it so much more
  a joy in doing what we have come to talk to you about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What you have come to talk to me about?&rdquo;&mdash;Helena, steadying
  herself, repeated the words almost composedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton, an eagerness in her voice again. &ldquo;But&mdash;may
  we come in? Is it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All may come in here,&rdquo; Helena answered softly, &ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;her
  eyes met Thornton&rsquo;s fixed gaze and dropped quickly&mdash;&ldquo;please
  come in,&rdquo; she ended abruptly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Real Money</b></h2>
  <p>THE two women passed inside the cottage, Mrs. Thornton holding out her hand
  again to the little lad; while Holmes and his wife followed hesitantly, awed.
  In the rear, Thornton grasped Madison&rsquo;s arm suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never saw such a beautiful face,&rdquo; he whispered tensely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Madison. &ldquo;But everything here seems full
  of a rare, strange beauty, a hallowed something&mdash;it lifts one beyond
  material things. You <i>feel</i> it&mdash;a great, calm solemnity all about
  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He closed the door softly behind him.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s eyes swept questioningly, anxiously and a little timidly
  about the plain, simple, quiet room; and then she spoke, her voice unconsciously
  hushed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he is not here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena shook her head, as she led Mrs. Thornton to a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;The strain of this
  afternoon has left him very weary and very tired&mdash;much has gone out
  of him in response to the faith he felt but could not see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he knows?&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton eagerly, reaching for Helena&rsquo;s
  hand. &ldquo;He knows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helena replied quietly, &ldquo;he knows. He always knows.&rdquo; She
  nodded gravely to the others. &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Madison quietly took the chair nearest the table; Thornton one a little
  in front of Madison and nearer his wife and Helena, who were close by the
  big, open fireplace; the two Holmes sat down on the edges of chairs a little
  behind Madison; while young Holmes knelt, his arms in Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s
  lap, his head turned a little sideways, his chin cupped in one hand, as he
  stared breathlessly around him.</p>
  <p>It was the boy who broke the momentary silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that other fellow here, neither&mdash;the fellow that
  was worse&rsquo;n me?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
  <p>Helena leaned toward him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; he is here,&rdquo; she answered, smiling sweetly. &ldquo;He
  is with the Patriarch.&rdquo; She lifted her head to include the others in
  her words. &ldquo;It is very wonderful, his gratitude. He will not leave
  the Patriarch&mdash;he says he will not leave him ever, that all he has to
  give for the debt he owes is the life that the Patriarch gave back to him,
  and he will listen to nothing but that he should devote that life to the
  Patriarch&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, too,&rdquo; said young Holmes, with a quick flush
  on his face. &ldquo;Can I, miss&mdash;can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Helena gently. &ldquo;Who knows what there may
  be that you can do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton, stroking the lad&rsquo;s head.
  She looked quickly at Helena. &ldquo;We, too, are grateful, more than there
  are words to tell, and we, too, would like to show our gratitude. We are
  rich and money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; the word came in shocked, hurt interruption from Helena,
  as a signal flashed from Madison&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;The Patriarch does
  not do these things for money&mdash;it would be a bitter grief to him to
  be misjudged in that way, even in thought. It is the love in his heart for
  the suffering ones, and his power goes out to all who ask it freely, with
  no thought of recompense or gain, and his joy and happiness is the joy and
  happiness of others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And right off the bat too!&rdquo; said Madison admiringly to himself. &ldquo;Now,
  wouldn&rsquo;t that get you! Say, could you beat it&mdash;could you beat
  it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I did not mean that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton almost piteously. &ldquo;Please,
  please do not think so, for I know so well that money in a personal sense
  could have no place here, that it would indeed be sacrilege. It is in quite
  another way&mdash;Robert, Mr. Madison, you explain what we would like to
  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Madison who explained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s idea, Miss Vail,&rdquo; he said earnestly; &ldquo;and
  it is one that I know will realize the Patriarch&rsquo;s dearest wish&mdash;to
  extend his sphere of helpfulness to others, to reach out to all who are stricken
  and have faith to come. I remember his writing that on the slate, which he
  used for conversation before his sight was completely taken from him. I remember
  the words as though they were before me now: &lsquo;I have dreamed often
  of a wider field, of reaching out to help the thousands beyond this little
  town&mdash;it would be wondrous joy.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Helena in a suppressed voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; Madison went on gravely, &ldquo;his dream is already
  realized. What has happened here this afternoon will in a few hours be known
  to the whole civilized world, and there will be no room for incredulity or
  doubt&mdash;on whatever ground people see fit to base their belief, they
  must still believe; and, believing, they will come here in ever increasing
  numbers&mdash;but this little village is totally inadequate to accommodate
  them. At first, yes, as I said to Mrs. Thornton; but afterwards&mdash;no.
  Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s idea, Mr. Thornton&rsquo;s idea and my own, if I may
  say so, is to build and endow a great sanatorium that, in consonance with
  the Patriarch&rsquo;s ideals, shall be free to all&mdash;and we feel that
  the money for this purpose will come gladly and spontaneously, as it so appropriately
  should come, from those who find joy and peace and health again at the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena half rose from her chair, as she stole a veiled glance at Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be wonderful,&rdquo; she said, with a little catch in her
  voice. &ldquo;And he&mdash;it would be the one thing in the world for him.
  But&mdash;but it would take a great deal of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madison slowly; &ldquo;at least half a million.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton turned toward Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As much as that?&rdquo; he asked tentatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; replied Madison thoughtfully. &ldquo;You
  see, it&rsquo;s the endowment after all that is the most important. Say that
  the building and equipment cost only a hundred thousand, that would only
  leave an income, from the other four hundred thousand at six per cent., of
  twenty-four thousand dollars&mdash;not enough in itself even, but it would
  be augmented of course by the contributions that would still go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton nodded his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; he agreed; &ldquo;but there is the time to consider&mdash;it
  would take a long time to raise that amount.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;A few months at the outside. Thornton&rdquo;&mdash;he
  reached out and laid his hand impressively on the other&rsquo;s sleeve&mdash;&ldquo;we
  are not dealing with ordinary things here&mdash;we have witnessed this afternoon
  a sight that should teach us that. Here, in this very room, beside us now,
  your wife, that little boy, is evidence of power beyond anything we have
  ever known before. Have we not that same power to count on still? It would
  be an ingrate heart indeed that, owing all, returned nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Thornton. &ldquo;Mr. Madison is right.
  I know it, I feel it&mdash;the money will come faster than we have any idea
  of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison smiled at her quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People will give their money,
  their jewels, anything, and give joyfully&mdash;and until the amount in hand
  is large enough to warrant beginning operations, Miss Vail naturally will
  be its guardian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Helena hesitatingly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am only a girl,
  I would not know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would not have to do anything, Miss Vail,&rdquo; Madison informed
  her reassuringly. &ldquo;When the time comes for advice, the making of plans
  and the carrying of them out, the brightest minds in this country will be
  offered freely and voluntarily, you will see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And meanwhile,&rdquo; inquired Thornton&mdash;he had been studying
  Helena&rsquo;s profile intently, &ldquo;would you propose keeping the contributions
  here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;And not only here, but openly
  displayed as an added incentive for others to give&mdash;if added incentive
  be needed. Here, for instance&rdquo;&mdash;he rose as he spoke, went to the
  mantel over the fireplace and lifted down a quaint, japanned box, fashioned
  in the shape of a little chest, which he placed upon the table. &ldquo;And
  here, too&rdquo;&mdash;he crossed to the bookshelves in the alcove, and took
  down a very old, flexible-covered book. &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
  Patriarch showed me this. It was a blank book originally, half of it is blank
  still; but in the front, in the Patriarch&rsquo;s own writing, is an essay
  he wrote in the years gone by on &lsquo;The Power of Faith&rsquo;&mdash;what
  could be more fitting than that the remaining pages should be filled with
  a record of the contributions to that faith?&rdquo; He laid the book on the
  table beside the little chest, and sat down again. &ldquo;There is no display,
  no ornamentation, no attempt at anything of that kind&mdash;it is simplicity,
  those things serving which are first at hand&mdash;as it seems to me it should
  be&mdash;those who give record their names and gifts in this book&mdash;the
  little chest to hold the gifts is open, free to the inspection of all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But is that wise?&rdquo; demurred Thornton. &ldquo;So large a sum
  of money as must accumulate to be left openly about? Would it not be a temptation
  to some to steal? Might it not even endanger Miss Vail and the Patriarch
  himself&mdash;subject them, indeed, to attack?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I get your idea,&rdquo; said Madison to himself&mdash;while he gazed
  at Thornton in pained surprise; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;ll never be more than
  the day&rsquo;s catch in the box at a time, though of course you don&rsquo;t
  know that. You see, we&rsquo;ll empty it every night, and start it off fresh
  every morning, with a trinket or two put back for bait. I&rsquo;m glad you
  mentioned it though, it&rsquo;s a little detail I mustn&rsquo;t forget to
  speak to the Flopper about.&rdquo; But aloud he said, and there was a sort
  of shocked awe in his voice: &ldquo;Steal<i>&mdash;here!</i> In this sacred
  place! No man would dare&mdash;the most hardened criminal would draw back.
  Why do even we who sit here speak as we have been speaking with hushed and
  lowered voices?&mdash;that very sense of a presence unseen around us, that
  hovers over us, is a mightier safeguard than the strongest bolts and locks,
  than the steel-barred vaults of any bank. It would seem indeed to profane
  our own faith even to entertain such an idea&mdash;to me this place is a
  solemn shrine, and there is only purity and faith and stillness here, the
  dwelling place of a power as compassionate as it is mighty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison stopped abruptly&mdash;and a silence fell. Each seemed busy with
  their own thoughts. About them was quiet, stillness, peace&mdash;twilight
  was falling, and a soft, mellow light was in the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one would dare&rdquo;&mdash;the words came from Mrs. Thornton
  in almost breathless corroboration, almost of their own accord it seemed,
  as though heavy upon her lay the solemnity of her surroundings.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s hand went to his pocket&mdash;slowly he drew out his check-book
  and laid it upon the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not a rich man&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was very low, very earnest&mdash;&ldquo;but
  I feel that this is something deeper, grander, bigger than anything the world
  perhaps has ever known before; something higher and above one&rsquo;s own
  self; it seems as though here were the chrysalis that, once developed to
  its perfect state, would sweep pain and sorrow from suffering humanity; it
  is as though a new, glad era had dawned for all mankind. I am glad to give
  and humbly proud to have a part in this.&rdquo; He took out his fountain
  pen, opened the check-book, and began to write.</p>
  <p>Thornton leaned forward a little, watching him.</p>
  <p>Silence fell again&mdash;there was no sound save the almost inaudible scratching
  of Madison&rsquo;s pen. Upon Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s face was a happy, radiant
  smile; Helena&rsquo;s face was impassive, but in the dark eyes lurked a puzzled
  light; the two Holmes sat awkwardly, still upon the edges of their chairs,
  gazing at their son across the room, incredulously, as though they still
  could not believe&mdash;and occasionally Mrs. Holmes wiped her eyes.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s pen moved on: &ldquo;Pay to the order of Miss Helena Vail
  the sum of ten thousand dollars.&rdquo; He carefully inscribed the amount
  in numerals in the lower left-hand corner. &ldquo;Honest,&rdquo; he confided
  to himself, as he signed the check, &ldquo;I feel so philanthropic I could
  almost make myself believe I had this money in the bank.&rdquo; He tore the
  check from its stub, and, standing up, handed it to Helena. &ldquo;I am
  not a rich man, Miss Vail, as I said,&rdquo; he smiled gravely, &ldquo;but
  I can give this, and I give it with great joy in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena took the check, glanced at it, gasped a little, lifted her eyes,
  an instant&rsquo;s mocking glint in them, and veiled them quickly with her
  long lashes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;Madison&rsquo;s hand, palm up, went out protestingly&mdash;&ldquo;no,
  do not thank me&mdash;it is little enough.&rdquo; He sat down again, drew
  the Patriarch&rsquo;s blank book toward him, and, on the line beneath the
  one where the Patriarch had ended his essay with the words, &ldquo;such is
  the power of faith,&rdquo; wrote his name and set down the amount of his
  contribution after it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten thousand dollars!&rdquo;&mdash;it was Mrs. Thornton speaking,
  as she took the check from Helena. She turned quickly to her husband. &ldquo;Robert,
  have you your check-book here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton brightly. &ldquo;You
  can use one of Mr. Madison&rsquo;s checks and write the name of your own
  bank on it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve often done that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A suggestion,&rdquo; said Madison to himself, &ldquo;for which I
  thank you, Mrs. Thornton&mdash;it sounds so much less crude coming from you
  than from me.&rdquo; But aloud he said courteously. &ldquo;Take my pen, Mr.
  Thornton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Thornton, as Madison placed it in his hand.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton and her husband had their heads together now, and were whispering&mdash;Thornton
  with his eyes on Helena, who sat with lowered head, twirling Madison&rsquo;s
  check in her hands. Then Thornton drew the check-book toward him, scratched
  out the printed name of the bank that it bore, wrote in another, and went
  on filling out the check.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eeny-meeny-miny-mo,&rdquo; said Madison to himself. &ldquo;The suspense
  is awful. How much does he raise the ante? Next to the miracle, this is the
  first real thrill I&rsquo;ve had&mdash;I feel like an elevator starting down
  quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As Madison had done, Thornton tore out the check and handed it to Helena.
  Helena stared at it, lifted her eyes to Thornton, flushed&mdash;and looked
  down at the check again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Fifty thousand</i>,&rdquo; she murmured breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Madison enthusiastically, rising from his
  chair and pushing the newly established record of contributions toward Thornton. &ldquo;Splendid!
  There&rsquo;s sixty thousand of the five hundred already. Splendid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young Holmes ran toward his parents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to give too, dad,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I want to give
  too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reckon so,&rdquo; said Holmes, getting up heavily. &ldquo;Reckon
  so&mdash;an&rsquo; I was a-goin&rsquo; to. I ain&rsquo;t got much though,&rdquo; he
  added timorously, as his hand went into his pocket.</p>
  <p>There was a little exclamation from Helena, and she moved a step forward
  as though to interpose. Madison looked at her quickly&mdash;and quietly stepped
  around the table, placing himself between her and Holmes; and, facing Holmes,
  leaned over the table from the far side toward the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the amount, Holmes,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;In
  the broad, true sense the amount counts for nothing&mdash;all cannot give
  the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Reckon that&rsquo;s the way I feel.&rdquo; He
  counted the bills in his hand, and dropped them into the little japanned
  box; then scrawled his name in the book beneath Thornton&rsquo;s, adding
  the amount&mdash;eight dollars.</p>
  <p>Madison looked around the group benignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think they should know out there what we have done,&rdquo; he
  said, pointing toward the lawn. &ldquo;Let us go and tell them, not in any
  set speech, but just simply&mdash;each of us speaking to a few the few&mdash;will
  tell others. Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton. &ldquo;Yes; let us tell them.&rdquo; She
  turned to Helena and kissed her. &ldquo;Try and come often to see me, dear&mdash;we
  shall be here now for a little while at least. Is it asking too much? Robert
  will bring you back and forth from the village. And perhaps, if I may, I
  will come out here to see you&mdash;may I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to do as my wife suggests,&rdquo; said Thornton,
  holding out his hand. &ldquo;You will come, Miss Vail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very good, both of you,&rdquo; Helena answered simply. She
  raised her eyes to Thornton&mdash;her hand was still in his. &ldquo;Yes,
  I will try to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, break away!&rdquo; muttered Madison impatiently&mdash;but silently.
  He stepped to the door and opened it. &ldquo;Will you lead the way, Mrs.
  Thornton?&rdquo; he said calmly.</p>
  <p>Thornton and his wife passed out; and the Holmes, with clumsy, earnest words
  upon their lips to Helena, followed. Madison hung back&mdash;then stepped
  quickly to Helena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tear up that check of mine so small you can&rsquo;t find the pieces,
  Helena,&rdquo; he said hurriedly; &ldquo;and send Thornton&rsquo;s right
  off to any old bank you like in New York. Endorse it, and write them a note
  saying you wish to open an account. Enclose your signature, and tell them
  to mail back the bank-book, a check-book, deposit slips and all that. They&rsquo;ll
  know by the newspapers that Thornton&rsquo;s subscribed fifty thousand before
  they get the check, and they&rsquo;ll feel honored to be your depository.
  Do it to-night, understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helena, nodding her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
  to it all right.&rdquo; Then, a little perturbed: &ldquo;But those poor Holmes
  and their eight dollars, Doc, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be greedy, Helena,&rdquo; said Madison cheerfully. &ldquo;You
  mustn&rsquo;t expect everybody to hand out ten and fifty thousand, just because
  Thornton and I did&mdash;try and appreciate the little things of life too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Helena angrily. &ldquo;Doc Madison, I&rsquo;d
  like to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, all right, of course,&rdquo; interrupted Madison, grinning. &ldquo;Good-by,
  that&rsquo;s all&mdash;I&rsquo;m off&mdash;see, they&rsquo;re waiting for
  me&rdquo;&mdash;and leaving Helena with an outraged little flush upon her
  cheek, he hurried through the door after the others.</p>

  Knotting The Strings</b></h2>
  <p>IT is a very old saying, and therefore of course indisputably true, that
  some have greatness thrust upon them. True of men, it is, in one instance
  at least, true of places&mdash;Needley, from an unheard of, modest, innocuous
  and unassuming little hamlet, leaped in a flash into the focus of the world&rsquo;s
  eyes. In huge headlines the papers in every city of every State carried it
  on their front pages. And while the first astounding despatch from the metropolitan
  newspaper man was being copied by leading dailies everywhere, there came
  on top of it, clinching its veracity beyond possibility of doubt, the news
  that Robert Thornton, the well known Chicago multi-millionaire, had given
  fifty thousand dollars to the cause. A man, much less a multi-millionaire,
  does not give fifty thousand dollars for a bubble, so the managing editors
  of the leading dailies rushed for their star reporters&mdash;and the star
  reporters rushed for Needley&mdash;and the red-haired, sorrowful-faced man
  in the Needley station grew haggard, tottered on the verge of collapse, and,
  between the sheafs of flimsy that the reporters fought for the opportunity
  of pushing at him, wired desperately for a relief.</p>
  <p>Needley awoke and came to life&mdash;as from the dead. There was bustle,
  activity, and suppressed and unsuppressed excitement on every hand&mdash;the
  Waldorf Hotel once more opened its doors&mdash;the Congress Hotel was already
  full.</p>
  <p>The reporters interviewed everybody with but one exception&mdash;the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>They interviewed Madison&mdash;and Madison talked to them gravely, quietly,
  a little self-deprecatingly, a little abashed at the thought of personal
  exploitage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be interviewed at all,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;if
  it were not that mankind at large is entitled to every bit of evidence that
  can be obtained. Yes; I gave what I could afford, but it was Holmes, a poor
  man, who gave most of all&mdash;have you seen him? Myself? What does that
  matter? I am unknown, my personality, unlike Mr. Thornton&rsquo;s, can carry
  no weight. I am, I suppose, what you might call a rolling stone, a world
  wanderer. My parents left me a moderate fortune, and I have travelled pretty
  well and pretty constantly all over the world during the last twelve or fifteen
  years. How did I come to Needley? Well, you can call it luck, or something
  more than that, whichever way it appeals to you. I was feeling seedy, a little
  off-color, and I started down for a rest and lay-off in Maine. I happened
  to ask a man in Portland if he knew of a quiet place. He meant to be humorous,
  I imagine. He said Needley was the quietest place he knew of. I took him
  at his word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how do you account for these miraculous cures?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have seen them&mdash;the results,&rdquo; Madison replied. &ldquo;You
  know the cures to be living, vital, irrefutable facts&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they agreed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Madison, &ldquo;there can be but one answer&mdash;faith.
  There is no other&mdash;faith. Are we not, in view of what has happened,
  of what exists before our very eyes, forced to the belief that faith is the
  greatest thing, the most potential factor in the world?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you believe then that all who come here will be cured?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;far from it. Many will come with but
  the semblance of faith, and for those there can be no cure&mdash;that is
  evident on the face of it, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They interviewed Thornton&mdash;and Thornton, too, talked to them, but the
  very presence of Mrs. Thornton was weightier far than words.</p>
  <p>They interviewed the Holmes, and they interviewed Needley individually and
  collectively; and they interviewed Helena&mdash;but they did not interview
  the Patriarch. Here Helena barred their way&mdash;they were free to enter
  the cottage, to copy the names, the record of gifts inscribed in the book,
  already a long list for Needley had required no other incentive to give than
  the example that had been set&mdash;but that was all. Quietly, with demure
  simplicity, Helena, prompted by Madison, like a priestess who guards some
  holy, inner shrine, told them that sensational notoriety had no place there&mdash;and
  the notoriety for that very cause became the greater! Not that they were
  denied a sight of the Patriarch&rsquo;s venerable and saintly form&mdash;they
  were permitted to catch glimpses of him on the beach, on the lawn, walking
  with bowed head in meditation, a figure whose simple majesty inspired words
  and columns of glowing tribute&mdash;but from personal contact, Helena and
  the Flopper, always in attendance, warded them off; retreating always to
  the privacy of the cottage, to the inner rooms.</p>
  <p>All this had taken four days; and now, on the fourth day, there came to
  Needley the vanguard of those who sought this new healing power&mdash;just
  a few of them, two or three, like far, outflung skirmishers evidencing the
  presence of the army corps to follow. With the reporters, as far as Madison
  was concerned, it was simple enough; he had but to let them go their way,
  to let them revel in the stories that were on every tongue, to let them view
  with their own eyes <i>facts</i>, while he, modestly and diffidently, full
  of quiet earnestness, effaced himself, never thrusting himself forward, talking
  to them only when they pressed him&mdash;but the handling of the sufferers
  who would flock to Needley in response to a newspaper publicity and endorsement
  that had been beyond his wildest dreams, was quite another matter. Madison
  viewed the first arrivals&mdash;brought in from the station on cot beds to
  the Waldorf Hotel&mdash;and retired to his room in the Congress Hotel to
  wrestle with the niceties and minuti&aelig; of the problem.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Madison to the tip of his cigar, as he tilted
  back his chair and extended his legs full length with his heels comfortably
  up on the table edge, &ldquo;you see, I believe in faith all right&mdash;and
  that&rsquo;s no josh. But the trouble with faith is that it&rsquo;s about
  the scarcest article on earth&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t got any more Floppers
  to lead the way.&rdquo; Madison adroitly sent the cigar ash through the window
  with a tap of his forefinger on the body of the cigar&mdash;he frowned, and
  for a long time sat musingly silent. Then he spoke again; this time addressing
  the toes of his boots: &ldquo;With the house sold out for the season, the
  box-office doing itself proud and the audience crazy over the first two acts,
  how about Act Three&mdash;h&rsquo;m?&mdash;how about Act Three? Kind of a
  delicate proposition, the staging of Act Three&mdash;and it&rsquo;s time
  for the curtain to go up. I can hear &rsquo;em stamping out front now. I
  can&rsquo;t pull off any more orgies like last Monday afternoon, even if
  I wanted to&mdash;but everybody&rsquo;s got to have a run for their money.
  Say, how about Act Three?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison burned up quite a little tobacco in the interval before supper,
  and quite a little more afterward before the setting for his perplexing &ldquo;Third
  Act&rdquo; appeared to unfold itself satisfactorily before his mind&mdash;indeed,
  it was close onto half past ten when, by a roundabout way, he very cautiously
  and silently approached the Patriarch&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>In the front of the cottage, the Shrine-room, as he christened it, and the
  Patriarch&rsquo;s sleeping room were both dark. Madison passed around to
  the beach side&mdash;here, Helena&rsquo;s room was dark too, but in the Flopper&rsquo;s
  window, the end room next to the kitchen and woodshed, there was a light.
  The night was warm, and, though the shade was drawn, the window was open.
  Madison whistled softly, and the Flopper stuck out his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Flopper,&rdquo; said Madison; &ldquo;come out here&mdash;I
  want to have a talk with you. Helena in bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; she&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; replied the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up!&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;Come around in front
  by the trellis where we can see the other fellow first if anybody happens
  to be strolling about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison withdrew from the window and walked around to the front of the cottage.
  Here, a few yards from the porch, by the trellis, already beginning to be
  leafy green, was a rustic bench on which he seated himself. The moon was
  not full, but there was light enough to enable him to see across the lawn
  through the interposing row of maples, and, hidden by the shadows himself,
  the seat strategetically met his requirements.</p>
  <p>Presently, the Flopper came out of the front door and joined him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Doc,&rdquo; announced the Flopper abruptly, &ldquo;de Patriarch&rsquo;s
  been askin&rsquo; fer youse yesterday an&rsquo; to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asking?&rdquo; repeated Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;He can scrawl if he is blind,
  can&rsquo;t he? He scrawls yer name on de slate. We can&rsquo;t tell him
  nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s kinder got de fidgets like he t&rsquo;inks
  youse had flown de coop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;It is rather difficult
  to communicate with him, isn&rsquo;t it? I guess we&rsquo;ll have to get
  him some raised letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s them?&rdquo; inquired the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly,&rdquo; Madison answered. &ldquo;I never
  saw any, but I believe they have such things. Been asking for me, has he?
  Well, I&rsquo;ll fix it to see him to-morrow. Where did you say Helena had
  gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said she was out,&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;If you ask me
  where, I&rsquo;d say de same place as last night an&rsquo; de night before&mdash;down
  to dat private car wid his nibs. Say, dere&rsquo;s some class to dat guy
  all right, an&rsquo; I guess Helena ain&rsquo;t got her eyes shut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; ejaculated Madison. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got de rocks, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; declared the
  Flopper. &ldquo; Why shouldn&rsquo;t she be after him? Dat&rsquo;s wot we&rsquo;re
  here fer, ain&rsquo;t it, de whole bunch of us?&mdash;an&rsquo; she ain&rsquo;t
  t&rsquo;rowin&rsquo; us, is she, if she sees a chanst to pick up somet&rsquo;ing
  on her own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison turned quickly on the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s something
  going on between Helena and Thornton&mdash;already?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, stop kiddin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;Already!
  Wot&rsquo;s &lsquo;already&rsquo; got to do wid it? We ain&rsquo;t none
  of us church members, are we? Say, where&rsquo;d you pick up Helena yerself&mdash;and
  how long did it take youse? I don&rsquo;t know whether dere&rsquo;s anyt&rsquo;ing
  goin&rsquo; on or&mdash;not mabbe she&rsquo;s only gettin&rsquo; lonely&mdash;youse
  ain&rsquo;t hung around her much lately, Doc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison laughed suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking through your hat, Flopper,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t know Helena.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wise guy dat knows skirts,&rdquo; said the Flopper profoundly;
  then, with something approaching a sigh: &ldquo;Say, Doc, dere&rsquo;s a
  lalapazoozoo, a peach down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; exclaimed Madison, shooting a hurried and critical
  glance at the Flopper in the moonlight. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Flopper&mdash;what&rsquo;s
  this? What have you been up to? You&rsquo;re supposed to be attending strictly
  to business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you needn&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; asserted
  the Flopper. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t stop de town fallin&rsquo; over itself
  to bring de whole farmyard, an&rsquo; eggs, an&rsquo; butter, an&rsquo; flour,
  an&rsquo; everyt&rsquo;ing else out here every mornin&rsquo;, can I? She&rsquo;s
  blown in twice wid cream fer de Patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo; inquired Madison quizzically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mamie Rodgers,&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;She says her old man
  keeps a store in de village.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know her,&rdquo; nodded Madison. &ldquo;Pretty girl and all right,
  Flopper. But mind what you&rsquo;re doing, that&rsquo;s all. I don&rsquo;t
  want any complications to queer things around here&mdash;understand? But
  let&rsquo;s get down to the business that I came out about&mdash;the lay
  from now on. You can put Helena wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the Flopper earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, listen,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;The patients have
  begun to arrive&mdash;there were three of them in to-day. There&rsquo;s no
  more circus parades&mdash;everything&rsquo;s under the tent after this. I
  want you to wean the Patriarch entirely from that front room&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  to be free for anybody to enter so&rsquo;s they can drink in atmosphere&mdash;and
  see the contribution box. But they don&rsquo;t see the Patriarch. Get his
  armchair into his own room, make him comfortable there&mdash;get the idea?
  Now, there&rsquo;s no consultation hours&mdash;the Patriarch can&rsquo;t
  be seen just by asking for him&mdash;the only chance they get at the Patriarch
  is by an exercise of patience that&rsquo;ll work their faith up to a pitch
  that&rsquo;ll do them some good. The harder it is to get a thing, the more
  it&rsquo;s worth and the more you want it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the principle.
  See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the Flopper, licking his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Madison went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re to keep the
  Patriarch under cover for two or three days, while they hang around working
  themselves into a frenzy. And when they do see him they have to scramble
  for it. You don&rsquo;t lead him out to them&mdash;ever. Make them waylay
  him when you take him for a walk&mdash;make them crawl and hop and show they&rsquo;ve
  got faith, make them believe they&rsquo;ve got faith themselves&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
  get some more cures, or near-cures anyway, that way, and we won&rsquo;t get
  them any other way, and we&rsquo;ve got to have some sort of cures coming
  along fairly regularly. Do you get me, Flopper? If there&rsquo;s a party
  on a cot a hundred yards away and he begs you to bring the Patriarch to him,
  say him nay. Everybody has got to get into the reserved paddock by themselves&mdash;tell
  them that no man can be cured who has not got the faith to reach the Patriarch
  by himself&mdash;tell them to get up and <i>walk</i> to him&mdash;tell them
  what you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said the Flopper. &ldquo;Say, Doc, youse are de
  one an&rsquo; only. I gotcher&mdash;put it up to <i>dem</i> everytime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their move every
  minute&mdash;make them feel that if they don&rsquo;t get what they&rsquo;re
  after it&rsquo;s their own fault&mdash;that it&rsquo;s their own lack of
  faith that&rsquo;s to blame. And the longer they have to wait to see the
  Patriarch, the more they become impressed that faith is necessary, and&mdash;oh,
  well, psychology is the greatest jollier of them all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; inquired the Flopper. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t on dere, Doc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; smiled Madison. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
  want to convince themselves that they <i>have</i> got faith, that it&rsquo;s
  all bottled up and ready to have the cork drawn when called for, and they&rsquo;ll
  prove it to themselves by laying an offering upon the shrine as evidence
  of faith <i>before</i> the goods are delivered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gotcher!&rdquo; said the Flopper enthusiastically. &ldquo;Why say,
  Doc, dat&rsquo;s de way I&rsquo;d do meself&mdash;swipe me, if I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way nearly everybody would do,&rdquo; said Madison,
  laughing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s at least a few similar kinks common to our
  noble race&mdash;we&rsquo;re busy most of the time trying to fool ourselves
  one way or another. Well, that&rsquo;s about all. I can&rsquo;t lay out a
  programme for every minute of the day&mdash;you and Helena have got to use
  your heads and work along that general idea. You play up your gratitude strong.
  And, oh yes&mdash;keep the altar box well baited. Let Helena put some of
  her near-diamond rings and joujabs in until we collect some genuine ones&mdash;and
  then keep the genuine ones going&mdash;change every day for variety, you
  know. And take the silver money out every time you see any in&mdash;not that
  we scorn it in the great aggregate, far from it&mdash;it&rsquo;s just psychology
  again, Flopper. I went to church once and sat beside a duck with a white
  waistcoat and chop whiskers, who wore the dollar sign sticking out so thick
  all over him that you couldn&rsquo;t see anything else; and when it came
  time for collection he peeled a bill off a roll the size of a house, and
  waited for the collection plate to come along. But he got his eye on the
  plate a couple of pews ahead and it was full of coppers and chicken feed,
  and he did the palming act with the bill slicker than a faro dealer&mdash;and
  whispered to me to change a quarter for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you?&rdquo; asked the Flopper anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, wake up, Flopper!&rdquo; grinned Madison then, suddenly: &ldquo;Hullo!
  Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Across the lawn, coming through the row of maples from the direction of
  the wagon track, appeared two figures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s who,&rdquo; said the Flopper, after gazing an instant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  Helena an&rsquo; Thornton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; agreed Madison. &ldquo;Get behind the trellis here
  then&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t do for him to see me out here at this time of
  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They rose noiselessly from the bench, and slipped quickly behind the trellis.
  Toward them, walking slowly came the two figures, Helena leaning on Thornton&rsquo;s
  arm. Thornton was talking, but in too low a tone to be overheard. Then a
  silence appeared to fall between the two, and it was not until they reached
  the porch, close to Madison and the Flopper, that either spoke again.</p>
  <p>Then Thornton held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, Miss Vail&mdash;and good-by temporarily,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  suppose I shall be gone four or five days; I&rsquo;m going up on the morning
  train, you know. I wish you&rsquo;d go as often as you can to see Naida in
  the car while I&rsquo;m away&mdash;will you? Her condition worries me, though
  she insists that she is completely cured, and she will not listen to any
  advice. I have an idea that she has overtaxed herself&mdash;apart from her
  hip disease, her heart was in a very critical state. You&rsquo;ll go to her,
  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helena, &ldquo;of course, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Their voices dropped lower, and for a moment only a murmur reached Madison;
  and then, with another &ldquo;Good-night, Miss Vail,&rdquo; Thornton started
  back across the lawn.</p>
  <p>Madison could hear Helena fumbling with the door latch, and by the time
  she had succeeded in opening the door the retreating figure of Thornton was
  a safe distance away. Madison called in a whisper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Helena! Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a quick, startled little exclamation from the doorway, and Helena
  came out hurriedly from the porch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she cried in a low voice. &ldquo;Oh&rdquo;&mdash;as
  they stepped into view&mdash;&ldquo;you, Doc, and the Flopper! What were
  you doing behind that trellis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeping out of Thornton&rsquo;s road,&rdquo; said Madison. &ldquo;So
  he&rsquo;s going away, eh? What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Business,&rdquo; replied Helena. &ldquo;Has to go to some meeting
  in Chicago&mdash;he&rsquo;s leaving his wife and the private car here. What
  did you come at this hour for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lines for the next act,&rdquo; said Madison; &ldquo;but the Flopper&rsquo;s
  got it all, and he&rsquo;ll put you on.&rdquo; He stepped toward Helena and
  slipped his arm around her waist. &ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s early yet, let&rsquo;s
  go for a little walk. The Flopper&rsquo;ll excuse us, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you said,&rdquo; Helena interrupted, disengaging herself
  quietly, &ldquo;that we had to play the game to the limit and take no chances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, so I did,&rdquo; admitted Madison, and his arm crept around
  her again; &ldquo;but I guess we&rsquo;ve earned a little holiday and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Nix on that,&rsquo; I think was what you said,&rdquo; said
  Helena with a queer little laugh, drawing away again. &ldquo;And I really
  think you were right, Doc&mdash;we ought to play the game without breaking
  the rules, and so&mdash;good-night&rdquo;&mdash;and she turned and ran from
  him into the cottage.</p>
  <p>Madison stared after her in a sort of helpless state of chagrin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; said the Flopper, &ldquo;mabbe she&rsquo;s lonely.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  A Miracle Overdone</b></h2>
  <p>HELENA sat in the Patriarch&rsquo;s room, and her piquant little face was
  pursed up into a scowl so daintily grim as to be almost ludicrous. The Patriarch,
  in his armchair, had been scrawling words upon the slate all evening&mdash;and
  she had been wiping them off! He scrawled another now&mdash;and mechanically,
  without looking at it, by way of answer she pressed his arm to appease him.</p>
  <p>She had been restless all day, and she was restless now. What had induced
  her to treat Madison the way she had the night before? Pique, probably. No;
  it wasn&rsquo;t pique. It was just getting back at him&mdash;and he deserved
  it. He hadn&rsquo;t seemed to mind it much, though&mdash;he had only laughed
  and teased her about it that morning when he had joined the Patriarch and
  herself in their walk along the beach.</p>
  <p>With her chin in her hands, she began to study the Patriarch through half
  closed eyes&mdash;deaf and dumb and blind&mdash;and somehow it all seemed
  excruciatingly funny and she wanted to laugh hysterically. He seemed to sense
  the fact that she was looking at him, and, with quick, instant intuition,
  he smiled and reached out his hand toward her.</p>
  <p>Unconsciously, involuntarily, she drew back&mdash;then, recovering herself
  the next instant, she took his hand. Now, why had she done that? What was
  the matter with her? Again she felt that sudden impulse to scream, or laugh,
  or shout, or make some noise&mdash;it seemed as though she were penned in,
  smothered somehow, imprisoned. What <i>was</i> the matter? Nerves? She had
  never known what nerves were in all her life! Couldn&rsquo;t she play the
  game and act her part without making a fool of herself? She had played a
  part all her life, hadn&rsquo;t she? Maybe it was quite a shock to her system
  to take a place amongst really good and simple folk!</p>
  <p>She laughed a little shortly&mdash;then rose abruptly from her chair, and
  began to walk up and down the room. The trouble was that the soft pedal was
  getting unbearable. That air of awed hush and solemnity, morning, noon and
  night, without anything to relieve it, was just a trifle too drastic and
  sudden a change in life for her to accept calmly and swallow in one dose
  without feeling any effects from it! If she could be transported now for
  an hour, say, to the Roost, or Heligman&rsquo;s and the turkey trot, or the
  Rivoli, or any old place&mdash;except Needley, Maine!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Helena to herself. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t break
  loose and kick the traces over for a minute or two, I&rsquo;ll be clawing
  the bars of a dippy asylum before I&rsquo;m through&mdash;and just listen
  to the sweet, girlish language I&rsquo;m using&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to bite
  something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned impulsively to the door, stepped out into the hall, and called
  the Flopper from his room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flopper, you go in there and stay with the Patriarch for awhile,&rdquo; she
  ordered curtly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down on the beach to yell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yell?&rdquo; inquired the Flopper, blinking helplessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going outside to yell&mdash;<i>yell</i>. You know what &lsquo;yell&rsquo; means,
  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she snapped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; observed the Flopper, gazing at her anxiously. &ldquo;Skirts
  is all de same&mdash;youse never know wot dey&rsquo;ll do next. Wot you wanter
  yell fer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mind your own business and do as you&rsquo;re told!&rdquo; said
  Helena tartly. &ldquo;Go in there and stay with the Patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the Flopper, grinning a little now. &ldquo;Sure
  t&rsquo;ing&mdash;but youse needn&rsquo;t get on yer ear about it. Cheer
  up, mabbe de Doc &rsquo;ll be out to-night, an&rsquo; if he don&rsquo;t hear
  youse yellin&rsquo; himself will I tell him youse are out on de beach t&rsquo;rowin&rsquo; a
  fit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Helena answered sharply; &ldquo;tell him nothing&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  out.&rdquo; Then, quite as quickly, changing her mind: &ldquo;Yes; tell him
  I&rsquo;m down there&mdash;or come and get me yourself&rdquo;&mdash;and she
  walked abruptly into her own room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now wot do youse t&rsquo;ink of dat?&rdquo; demanded the Flopper
  of the universe. He blinked at the door she had closed in his face. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he
  asserted, with sublime inconsistency, &ldquo;if Mamie Rodgers was like all
  de rest of dem, I&rsquo;d t&rsquo;row up me dukes before de gong rang.&rdquo; The
  Flopper went into the Patriarch&rsquo;s room, and took the chair beside the
  other that Helena had vacated. &ldquo;Swipe me, if I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he
  added fervently, by way of confirmation.</p>
  <p>Helena, in her own room, opened one of her trunks, lifted out the tray,
  worked somewhat impatiently down through several layers of yellow, paper-covered
  literature, that would have made the classics on the Patriarch&rsquo;s bookshelves
  shrivel up and draw their skirts hurriedly around them in righteous horror
  could they but have known or been capable of such intensely human characteristics,
  and finally produced a daintily jewelled little cigarette case and match
  box. She slammed the tray back, slammed the cover of the trunk down, snatched
  up a wrap, flung it over her head and shoulders&mdash;and left the cottage.</p>
  <p>She ran down to the beach at top speed, as if she couldn&rsquo;t get there
  fast enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m just going to yell and go crazy as much as ever
  I like!&rdquo; panted Helena to the rollers.</p>
  <p>Instead, she sat down with her back to a rock, and opened her cigarette
  case. She took out a cigarette, extracted a match from the match box, lighted
  the match&mdash;and flung both cigarette and match from her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be crazy&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I want,&rdquo; said
  Helena petulantly. Her chin went into her hands, and she stared wide-eyed
  at the breaking surf. &ldquo;I wonder what it all means?&rdquo; she murmured,
  with a mirthless little laugh.</p>
  <p>Her thoughts began to run riot. What <i>did</i> it all mean? What was this
  faith? There was, there <i>must</i> be something in it. There was the Holmes
  boy&mdash;suppose it <i>was</i> only some nervous disorder&mdash;well, something
  had risen superior to whatever it was and had <i>cured</i> him. There was
  Naida Thornton&mdash;true, she was ill again&mdash;her heart, Mr. Thornton
  had said&mdash;but she could still walk, a thing she had not been able to
  do for a long time until she came to Needley.</p>
  <p>Helena laughed again&mdash;oh, it was a good game! The Doc had made no mistake
  about that&mdash;but then, when it came to planting anything the Doc rarely
  did make a mistake. Fancy fifty thousand dollars in one haul! <i>Fifty thousand
  in one haul!</i> The bank had sent her a passbook with that amount to her
  credit. And that was only the beginning&mdash;hardly anybody had come yet,
  and already there was several hundred dollars more in real money that she
  had handed over to Madison from the offering box.</p>
  <p>Money! They&rsquo;d have more money than they&rsquo;d know what to do with
  before they got through&mdash;there was nothing the matter with the game&mdash;all
  there was to do was to play it to a finish. And there wasn&rsquo;t the slightest
  risk about it&mdash;everything was given voluntarily. Oh, the game was all
  right&mdash;but somehow she wasn&rsquo;t happy&mdash;not nearly so happy
  as she had been in New York, even in lean periods when she and the Doc had
  been pressed for money. But, anyway, then they had been together, and fought,
  and laughed, and loved, and quarrelled through flush times and bad.</p>
  <p>Maybe that was it! The Doc! Of course, she loved him&mdash;she had loved
  him ever since she had known him. There was no secret about that&mdash;she
  loved him fiercely, passionately, more than she loved anything else in the
  world, with all the love she was capable of&mdash;more than he loved her&mdash;he
  seemed to accept her, too often, so casually, so indifferently, so much as
  a matter of course. He was so confidently and complacently sure of her&mdash;and
  she was not at all sure of him. She was only sure that he was quite right
  in being sure&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t help loving him if she tried.</p>
  <p>She had hardly seen anything of him since that night in the Roost before
  he had left for Needley &mdash;and he hadn&rsquo;t seemed to care much whether
  she did or not. That talk about playing the game and taking no chances was
  all bosh&mdash;there had been plenty of chances where it wouldn&rsquo;t have
  hurt the game any. Perhaps the little jolt she had given him last night,
  turning the tables a little, would wake him up a bit. Perhaps, as the Flopper
  had said, he would come out to-night, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena! Helena!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena sat suddenly upright&mdash;the noise of the surf muffled the sound
  of the voice, but that was probably Doc now&mdash;she could hear footsteps
  running from the direction of the cottage. Deliberately, Helena leaned back
  again against the rock, took out a cigarette and with no attempt to shade
  the flame of the match, rather to use it as a challenging beacon, held it
  to the cigarette&mdash;but for the second time she flung both match and cigarette
  hurriedly away. It wasn&rsquo;t Madison at all&mdash;it was only the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; gasped the Flopper, blowing hard. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t
  youse answer when yer called? Wot you tryin&rsquo; ter do&mdash;light a bonfire
  ter save yer voice? Say, youse wanter get a wiggle on&mdash;beat it&mdash;quick!
  Dey&rsquo;re after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Helena sharply, jumping to her feet. &ldquo;After
  me? Who? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the Flopper with sudden imperturbability&mdash;and
  evidently quite pleased with the agitation he had caused. &ldquo;He talks
  like his mouth was full, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got a scare t&rsquo;rown inter
  him so&rsquo;s his teeth have got de jiggles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena caught the Flopper&rsquo;s arm and shook him angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you talking about&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; she demanded
  fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s de porter from de private car,&rdquo; said the Flopper,
  wriggling away from her. &ldquo;He drove out here. De lady&rsquo;s on de
  toboggan&mdash;sick. She&rsquo;s askin&rsquo; fer youse an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena waited for no more. She raced to the cottage and around to the front.
  A wagon was standing before the porch; the negro porter on the seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Sam?&rdquo; she called anxiously, as she came up. &ldquo;Is
  Mrs. Thornton seriously ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yas&mdash;yas&rsquo;um, miss,&rdquo; Sam answered excitedly. &ldquo;I
  done feel in mah bones she&rsquo;s gwine to die. Miss Harvey she done tole
  me to get a team an&rsquo; drive foh you-all like de debbil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without waste of words, Helena clambered in beside him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then drive,&rdquo; she said shortly. &ldquo;Drive as fast as you
  can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At first, as they drove along, Helena plied Sam with questions&mdash;and
  then lapsed into silence. The man did not know very much&mdash;only that
  Mrs. Thornton had been taken suddenly ill, and that the nurse had sent him
  on the errand that had brought him to the cottage. A turmoil of conflicting
  emotions filled Helena&rsquo;s mind, obtruding upon her anxiety, for she
  had grown to care a great deal for Naida Thornton&mdash;this was a complication
  that Doc Madison must know about&mdash;Thornton had left that morning and
  was already far away&mdash;the newspaper men, or some of them at least, were
  still in the town&mdash;and there were so many things else&mdash;they all
  came crowding upon her, as she clung to her seat in the jolting wagon. But
  Doc must know&mdash;that rose a paramount consideration. It seemed an age,
  an eternity before they stopped finally at the station.</p>
  <p>She sprang out and turned to Sam.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she directed hurriedly, &ldquo;you go back to the Congress
  Hotel and get Mr. Madison. Mr. Madison is a friend of Mr. Thornton&rsquo;s,
  you know. Go about it quietly&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t let any one know what
  you came for. You can tell Mr. Madison what the trouble is&mdash;and tell
  him that I sent you, and that I am here. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yas&rsquo;um, mum,&rdquo; said Sam impressively. &ldquo;Just you
  done leab all that to me, missy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Across the track on the siding, the private car was dimly lighted, the window
  curtains down. Helena crossed the track and mounted the steps. As she reached
  the platform, Miss Harvey, who had evidently heard her coming, opened the
  door and drew her quietly inside.</p>
  <p>A glance at the nurse&rsquo;s face brought a sudden chill to Helena&rsquo;s
  heart. Miss Harvey, capable, controlled, grave, smiled at her a little sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sent for you, Miss Vail,&rdquo; she said in a low tone, &ldquo;because
  Mrs. Thornton has been asking for you incessantly ever since the attack came
  on three-quarters of an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Helena, &ldquo;that&mdash;that there is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No hope,&rdquo; the nurse completed. &ldquo;I am afraid there is
  none&mdash;it is her heart. The condition has been aggravated by her activity
  during the last few days since she has been able to walk&mdash;though I have
  done everything within my power to keep her quiet.&rdquo; Miss Harvey laid
  her hand on Helena&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;There is one thing, Miss Vail, I feel
  that I must say to you, in justice both to you and to myself, before you
  see her. Whatever my personal ideas may be of what has taken place here,
  my professional duty as a nurse demanded that I send for a doctor at once,
  and I want you to know that is what I did, though I have not been successful
  in getting one. There is no doctor here, so I telegraphed; but the doctor
  at Barton&rsquo;s Mills is away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helena mechanically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I just wanted you to understand,&rdquo; said Miss Harvey. &ldquo;Will
  you come and see Mrs. Thornton now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does she know,&rdquo; whispered Helena, as she followed the nurse
  down the corridor of the car, &ldquo;does she know that&mdash;how ill she
  is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Miss Harvey answered simply. She stopped before a compartment
  door, opened it softly, and, stepping aside, motioned Helena to enter.</p>
  <p>A little cry rose to Helena&rsquo;s lips that she choked back somehow, and
  a mist for a moment blinded her eyes&mdash;then she was kneeling beside the
  brass bed, and was holding in both her own the hand that was stretched out
  to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena&mdash;dear&mdash;I am so glad you came,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thornton
  faintly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am not going to get better, and there are some
  things I want to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but you are,&rdquo; returned Helena quickly, smiling bravely
  now. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know. And I know that what I have
  to say I must say quickly.&rdquo; Her voice seemed to grow suddenly stronger
  with a great earnestness. &ldquo;Listen, dear. This must not make any difference
  to this wonderful work that has just begun here. I was cured of my hip disease&mdash;perfectly
  cured&mdash;no one can deny that&mdash;this is my own fault, I have overdone
  it&mdash;I would not listen to reason&mdash;to do what I have done in the
  last few days, when for a year and a half I had never moved a step, was more
  than my heart could stand. I should have been more quiet&mdash;but I was
  so glad, so happy&mdash;and I wanted to tell everybody&mdash;I wanted all
  the world to know, so that others could find the joy that I had found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused&mdash;and Helena sought for words that, somehow, would not come.</p>
  <p>The nurse was bending over the bed on the other side, and Mrs. Thornton
  turned her head toward Miss Harvey now. She smiled gently, as though to rob
  her words of any possible hurt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nurse, I want&mdash;to be alone with Miss Vail for just a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Harvey, doubtful, hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only for a moment,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Thornton. &ldquo;You can stay
  just outside the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Reluctantly, Miss Harvey complied, and left the room.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton pressed Helena&rsquo;s hand tightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, dear&mdash;this must not make any difference. It&mdash;it
  is the one thing that will make me happy now&mdash;to know that. I&mdash;I
  have written a little note to Robert about it, to be given to him. Oh, if
  I could only have lived to help&mdash;I should have tried so hard to be worthy
  to have a part in it. Not like you, dear, with your sweetness and nobleness,
  for God seems to have singled you out for this&mdash;but just to have had
  a little part. How wonderful it would have been, bringing peace and health
  and gladness where only sorrow and misery was before, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s eyes closed, and she lay for a moment quiet.</p>
  <p>A blackness seemed to settle upon Helena&mdash;and how cold it was! She
  shivered. Her dark eyes, wide, tearless now, stared, startled, dazed, at
  the white face on the pillow crowned with its mass of golden hair. Her sweetness!
  Her nobleness! Helena&rsquo;s lips half parted and her breath came in quick,
  fierce, little gasps&mdash;it seemed as though she had been struck a blow
  that she could not quite understand because somehow it had numbed her senses&mdash;only
  there was a hurt that curiously, strangely seemed to mock as it stabbed with
  pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is Robert&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Thornton spoke again&mdash;&ldquo;I
  am sure he will do as I have asked him to do about this, but&mdash;you can
  have a great deal of influence with him. It&mdash;it perhaps may seem a strange
  thing to say, but I pray that you two may be brought very close to each other.
  Robert needs a good, true woman so much in his life&mdash;and I&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;my
  illness&mdash;we have never had a home in its truest sense. Yes, it is strange
  for me perhaps to talk like this&mdash;but it is in my heart. I would like
  to think of you both engaged in this wonderful work together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again, through exhaustion, Mrs. Thornton stopped&mdash;and Helena, from
  gazing at the other&rsquo;s pallid countenance in a sort of involuntary,
  frightened fascination, dropped her head suddenly upon the bed-spread and
  hid her face.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s hand found Helena&rsquo;s head and rested upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would like to see Robert happy,&rdquo; she murmured, after a little
  silence. &ldquo;Riches do not make happiness&mdash;they are so sad and empty
  a thing when the heart is empty. I know he would be happy with you&mdash;he
  has spoken so much of you lately&mdash;perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s voice was very faint&mdash;the words reached Helena
  plainly enough as words, but they seemed to reach her consciousness in an
  unreal, unnatural, blunted way, coma-like&mdash;pregnant of significance,
  yet with the significance itself elusive, evading her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A good woman,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Thornton, &ldquo;I have tried
  to be a good woman&mdash;but&mdash;but my life, our wealth, our position
  has made it so artificial. You have never known these things, dear&mdash;and
  so you are just as God made you&mdash;a good woman, so pure, so wonderful
  in your freshness and your innocence. Robert&rsquo;s life has been so barren&mdash;so
  barren. I would like to know that&mdash;that it will not always be so. Oh,
  if it could only be that you and he should carry on this great, glad work
  together&mdash;and love should come into his life&mdash;and yours&mdash;and
  sunshine&mdash;promise me, dear, that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice died away. Helena, with head still buried, waited for Mrs. Thornton
  to speak again. It seemed she waited for a great length of time&mdash;and
  yet there was no such thing as time. It seemed as though she were transported
  to a place of great and intense blackness where it was miserably cold and
  chill, and she stood alone and lost, and strove to find her way&mdash;and
  there was no way&mdash;only blackness everywhere, immeasurable. She lifted
  her head suddenly, desperately, to shake the unreality from her&mdash;and
  her eyes fell upon the gentle face, peaceful, smiling, calm, and so <i>still</i>&mdash;and
  a startled, frightened cry rang from her lips.</p>
  <p>There was the quick, hurried rush of some one coming into the room, and
  the nurse brushed by her and bent instantly over the bed&mdash;after that,
  quite soon after that it seemed, and yet it might have been quite a little
  while, she found herself outside in the corridor and the nurse was speaking
  to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sam is still out there,&rdquo; said Miss Harvey gently. &ldquo;I
  told him to keep the team. You cannot help me, and I want you to go home,
  dear. And will you ask Sam to go for Mr. Madison at the hotel on the way
  back&mdash;I do not know who else I can call upon for advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent for him already,&rdquo; said Helena numbly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you, dear?&rdquo; Miss Harvey said. &ldquo;That was very thoughtful
  of you&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be here presently then. And now,
  dear, it is much better that you should go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were no tears in Helena&rsquo;s eyes as she stepped down from the
  car vestibule to the tracks&mdash;only a drawn misery in her face. That was
  Doc over there, pacing up and down on the platform in the darkness&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
  it weird the way his cigar glowed bright and then went out and then glowed
  bright again&mdash;like a gigantic firefly!</p>
  <p>She was across the tracks before he saw her, then, hurrying forward, he
  helped her to the platform.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>
  <p>Helena did not answer.</p>
  <p>Madison took the cigar from his lips, leaned forward, and peered into Helena&rsquo;s
  face&mdash;then drew back with a low whistle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Helena nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Harvey wants to see you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Madison slowly, &ldquo;first crack out of the box
  this looks bad, don&rsquo;t it? If this gets around here without a muffler
  on it, it might make the railroad companies hang fire with those circulars
  for excursion rates to Needley&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I hate you!&rdquo; Helena cried out suddenly, passionately. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s
  dead&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all you think about!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison stared at Helena for a moment calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Helena,&rdquo; said he quietly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  get excited. Of course I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a brute and I&rsquo;ve
  got feelings&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t afford to lose my head. Something&rsquo;s
  got to be done, and done quick. We don&rsquo;t want this headlined in every
  paper in the United States to-morrow morning&mdash;Thornton wouldn&rsquo;t
  want it either. You say Miss Harvey wants to see me? Well, that&rsquo;ll
  help some&mdash;she&rsquo;ll probably do as she&rsquo;s told, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison paused abruptly, gazed abstractedly at the private car across the
  tracks on the siding, and pulled at his cigar.</p>
  <p>Helena watched him in silence&mdash;a little bitterly. That quick, clever,
  cunning brain of his was at work again&mdash;scheming&mdash;scheming&mdash;always
  scheming&mdash;and Naida Thornton was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Madison, speaking again as abruptly
  as he had stopped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough. There&rsquo;s a westbound
  train due in an hour or so&mdash;we&rsquo;ll couple the private car onto
  that and send it right along to Chicago. What the authorities don&rsquo;t
  know won&rsquo;t hurt them. There&rsquo;s no reason for anybody except Thornton
  to know what&rsquo;s happened till she gets there&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wire him.
  The main thing is that the car won&rsquo;t be here in the morning, and that&rsquo;ll
  take a little of the intimate touch of Needley off. It might well have happened
  on her way home&mdash;journey too much for her&mdash;left too soon&mdash;see?
  Thornton&rsquo;ll see it in the right light because he&rsquo;s got fifty
  thousand dollars worth of faith in what&rsquo;s going on here&mdash;get that?
  He won&rsquo;t want to harm the &rsquo;cause.&rsquo; There&rsquo;ll be some
  publicity of course, we can&rsquo;t help that&mdash;but it won&rsquo;t hurt
  much&mdash;and Thornton can gag a whole lot of it&mdash;he&rsquo;d want to
  anyway for his own sake. Now then, kid, there&rsquo;s Sam over there&mdash;you
  pile into the wagon and go home, while I get busy&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you
  say a word about this, even to the Flopper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so Helena drove back to the Patriarch&rsquo;s cottage that night, a
  little silent figure in the back seat of the wagon&mdash;and her hands were
  locked tightly together in her lap&mdash;and to her, as she drove over the
  peaceful, moonlit road, and under the still, arched branches of the trees
  in the wood that hid the starlight, came again and again the words of one
  who had gone, who perhaps better now&mdash;&ldquo;you are as God made you.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  A Fly In The Ointment</b></h2>
  <p>The days passed. And with the days, morning, noon and night, they came by
  almost every train, the sick and suffering, the lame, the paralytics and
  the maimed&mdash;a steady influx by twos and threes and fours from north
  over the Canadian boundary line, from the far west, and from the southernmost
  tip of the Florida coast. No longer on the company&rsquo;s schedule was Needley
  a flag station&mdash;it was a regular stop, and its passenger traffic returns
  were benign and pleasing things in the auditor&rsquo;s office. And it was
  an accustomed sight now, many times a day&mdash;what had once been a strange,
  rare spectacle&mdash;that slow procession wending its way from the station
  to the town, some carried, some limping upon crutches, all snatching at hope
  of life and health and happiness again. Needley, perforce, had become a vast
  boarding house, as it were&mdash;there were few homes indeed that did not
  harbor their quota of those who sought the &ldquo;cure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But there were others too who came&mdash;who were not sick&mdash;who had
  not faith&mdash;who came to laugh and peer and peek. Pleasure yachts dropped
  their anchors in the cove around the headland from the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  cottage&mdash;and their dingeys brought women decked out <i>de rigeur</i> in
  middy blouses and sailor collars, and nattily attired gentlemen whose only
  claim to seamanship was the clothes, or rather, the costumes that they wore.</p>
  <p>They came laughing, supercilious, tolerant, contemptuous, pitying the inanity
  of those they held less strongly-minded than themselves who should be taken
  in by so apparent, glaring and monstrous a fake. They came because it was
  the rage, the thing to do, quite the thing to do, quite a necessary part
  of the summer&rsquo;s itinerary. But that they, should they have been sick,
  would ever have dreamed of coming there was too perfectly ridiculous an idea
  for words. How strange a thing is the human animal!</p>
  <p>They came in their rather cruel, merciless gaiety&mdash;and they left sobered
  and impressed; the ladies holding their embroidered parasols at a less jaunty
  angle; the men with lightened pockets, their names enrolled in the contribution
  book in that quiet, simple room, whose door was open, whose cash-box was
  unguarded, where none asked them to either enter or withdraw. They came and
  found no air of charlatanism such as they had looked for&mdash;only a peaceful,
  unostentatious, patient air of sincerity that left them remorseful and abashed.
  They came and went, a source of revenue not counted on or thought of before
  by Madison; but a source that swelled the coffers, brimming fuller day by
  day, to overflowing.</p>
  <p>In three weeks from the night of Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s death, which had
  had at least no visible effect on Needley, Needley was metamorphosed&mdash;with
  a spontaneity, so to speak, that astounded even Madison himself&mdash;into
  something that approximated very closely in reality the word-picture he had
  drawn of it that night in the Roost. Madison looked upon his work and saw
  that it was pleasing beyond his dreams. Money was pouring in&mdash;no single
  breath of suspicion came to disquiet him. Even the cures were working satisfactorily&mdash;even
  Pale Face Harry, who had become great friends with the farmer at whose house
  he boarded, and who now spent most of his time in the fields, was showing
  an improvement&mdash;Pale Face Harry coughed less. The Flopper was as happy
  as a lark&mdash;and Mamie Rodgers blushed now at mention of the name of Coogan.
  Helena, demure, adored by all who saw her, went daily about her housework
  in the cottage, and waited upon the Patriarch with gentle tenderness; while
  the Patriarch, docile, full of supreme trust and confidence in every one,
  radiant in Helena&rsquo;s companionship, was as putty in their hands. And
  so Madison looked upon his work and saw no flaw&mdash;but with the days he
  grew ill at ease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too easy,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s
  it&mdash;it&rsquo;s too easy. The whole show runs itself. Why, there&rsquo;s
  nothing to do but count the cash!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And yet in his heart he knew that wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;it was Helena. Helena
  was beginning to trouble him a little. She was playing the game all right&mdash;playing
  it to the limit&mdash;and making a hit at every performance. Her name was
  on every tongue, and men and women alike spoke of her sweetness, her goodness,
  her loveliness. Well, that was all right, Helena was a star no matter where
  you put her&mdash;but something was the matter. Helena wasn&rsquo;t the Helena
  of a month ago back in little old New York. He hadn&rsquo;t managed to get
  a dozen words with her since that night on the station platform, without
  taking chances and gaining admission to the cottage through the Flopper&rsquo;s
  window after dark&mdash;and then she had held him at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The matter with me?&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
  anything the matter with me&mdash;is there? I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m playing
  the game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It certainly couldn&rsquo;t be grief over Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s death&mdash;she
  had begun to act that way before Mrs. Thornton died&mdash;that night when
  she came home with Thornton, and he and the Flopper were behind the trellis.
  Thornton! Had Thornton anything to do with it, after all? No&mdash;Madison
  had laughed at it then, and he had much more reason to laugh at it now. Thornton
  was still in Chicago, and hadn&rsquo;t been back to Needley.</p>
  <p>For three weeks this sort of thing occupied a considerably larger share
  of Madison&rsquo;s thoughts than he was wont to allow even the most vexing
  problems to disturb his usually imperturbable and complacent self&mdash;and
  then one afternoon, he smiled a little grimly, and, leaving the hotel, started
  along the road toward the Patriarch&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What Helena needs is&mdash;a jolt!&rdquo; said Madison to himself. &ldquo;I
  guess her trouble is one of those everlasting feminine kinks that all women
  since Adam&rsquo;s wife have patted themselves on the back over, because
  they think it&rsquo;s a dark veil of mystery that is beyond the acumen of
  brute man to understand. That&rsquo;s what the novelists write pages about&mdash;wade
  right in up to the armpits in it&mdash;feminine psychology&mdash;great! And
  the women smile commiseratingly at the novelist&mdash;the idea of a man even
  pretending to understand them&mdash;kind of a blooming merry-go-round and
  everybody happy! Feminine psychology! I guess a little masculine kick-up
  is about the right dope! What the deuce have I been standing for it for?
  I don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have to go around making sheep&rsquo;s-eyes
  at her&mdash;what? She wants grabbing up and being rushed right off her feet <i>&agrave; la</i> Roost,
  and&mdash;hello, Mr. Marvin, how are you to-day!&rdquo;&mdash;he had halted
  beside a middle-aged man who was sitting on the grass at the roadside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better, Mr. Madison, better,&rdquo; returned the man, heartily. &ldquo;Really
  very much better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all saw the Patriarch to-day&mdash;God bless him!&rdquo; said
  Marvin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been waiting out there two days, you know&mdash;that
  woman with the bad back got up off her stretcher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; exclaimed Madison enthusiastically. &ldquo;And the
  glorious thing about it is that there&rsquo;s no reason why everybody can&rsquo;t
  be cured if they&rsquo;ll only come here in the right spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; agreed Marvin. &ldquo;None are so blind as
  those who won&rsquo;t see&mdash;they&rsquo;re in utter blackness compared
  with the physical blindness of that grand and marvelous man. I&rsquo;m going
  home myself in another week&mdash;better than ever I was in my life. It was
  stomach with me, you know&mdash;doctors said there wasn&rsquo;t any chance
  except to operate, and that an operation was too slim a chance to be worth
  risking it.&rdquo; He got up and laughed, carefree, joyous. &ldquo;God-given
  place down here, isn&rsquo;t it? Clean&mdash;that&rsquo;s it. Clean air,
  clean-souled people, clean everything you see or do or hear. Say, it kind
  of opens your eyes to real living, doesn&rsquo;t it&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
  luxuries and the worries and the pace and the damn-fooleries that kill. Well,
  I&rsquo;m going along back now to get some of Mrs. Perkins&rsquo; cream&mdash;clean,
  rich cream&mdash;and home-made bread and butter&mdash;imagine me with an
  appetite and able to eat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed again&mdash;and Madison joined him in the laugh, slapping him
  a cordial good-by on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>Madison started on once more&mdash;but now his progress was slow, frequently
  interrupted, for he stopped a score of times to chat and exchange a few words
  with those whom he passed on the road. There were cheery faces everywhere&mdash;even
  those of the sufferers who straggled out along the road coming back from
  the Patriarch&rsquo;s cottage. It was a cheery afternoon, warm and balmy
  and bright&mdash;everything was cheery. The farmers, their vocations for
  the moment changed, waved their whips at him and shouted friendly pleasantries
  as they drove by with those who were unable to make the trip from the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  unaided.</p>
  <p>Madison began to experience a strange, exhilarating sense of uplift upon
  him, a sort of rather commendatory and gratified feeling with himself. Marvin
  had hit it pretty nearly right with his &ldquo;clean-wholesomeness&rdquo; idea&mdash;it
  kind of made one feel good to be a part of it. Madison, for the time being,
  relegated Helena and his immediate mission to a secondary place in his thoughts.</p>
  <p>Young girls, young men, middle-aged men, elderly women, all ages of both
  sexes he passed as he went along; some alone, some in couples, some in little
  groups, some on crutches, some in wheel-chairs, some walking without extraneous
  aid&mdash;he had turned into the woods now, and he could see them strewn
  out all along the wagon track under the cool, interlacing branches overhead.</p>
  <p>Now he stepped aside to let a wagon pass him, and answered the farmer&rsquo;s
  call and the smile of the occupants in kind; now some one stopped to tell
  him again the story of the afternoon&mdash;there had been cures that day
  and the Patriarch had come amongst them. Some laughed, some sang a little,
  softly, to themselves&mdash;all smiled&mdash;all spoke in glad, hopeful words,
  clean words&mdash;there seemed no base thought in any mind, only that cleanness,
  that wholesomeness that had so appealed to Marvin&mdash;that somehow Madison
  found he was taking a delight in responding to, and, because it afforded
  him whimsical pleasure, chose to pretend that he was quite a genuine exponent
  of it himself.</p>
  <p>He reached the end of the wagon track, and paused involuntarily on the edge
  of the Patriarch&rsquo;s lawn as he came out from the trees. Like low, lulling
  music came the distant, mellowed noise of waters, the breaking surf. And
  the cottage was a bower of green now, clothed in ivy and vine&mdash;upon
  the trellises the early roses were budding&mdash;fragrance of growing things
  blended with the salt, invigorating breeze from the ocean. And upon the lawn,
  flanked with its sturdy maples, all in leaf, that toned the sunshine in soft-falling
  shadows, stood, or sat, or reclined on cots, the supplicants who still tarried
  though the Patriarch had gone. And now one came reverently out of the cottage
  door from that room that was never closed; now another went in&mdash;and
  still another.</p>
  <p>Madison smiled suddenly, broadly, with immense satisfaction and contentment&mdash;and
  then his eyes fixed quite as suddenly on the single-seated buggy that was
  coming toward him on the driveway across the lawn. That was Mamie Rodgers
  driving&mdash;and that was Helena beside her.</p>
  <p>Madison recalled instantly the object of his visit&mdash;and instantly he
  whistled a rather surprised little whistle under his breath. How alluringly
  Helena&rsquo;s brown hair coiled in wavy wealth upon her head; there wasn&rsquo;t
  any need of rouge for color in the oval face; the dark eyes were soft and
  deep and glorious; and she sat there in a little white muslin frock as dainty
  as a medallion from a master&rsquo;s brush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Madison to himself, &ldquo;say, I never quite got
  it before. Say, she&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s lovely&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
  my Helena. It&rsquo;s no wonder Thornton stared at her that day we touched
  him for the fifty, and&rdquo;&mdash;suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;damn Thornton!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the buggy was beside him now, and he lifted his hat as Mamie Rodgers
  pulled up the horse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Rodgers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good afternoon,
  Miss Vail&mdash;how is the Patriarch to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is very well, thank you,&rdquo; Helena answered&mdash;and being
  custodian of the whip brushed a fly off the horse&rsquo;s flank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was just coming out to pay you a little visit,&rdquo; remarked
  Madison, trying to catch her eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry!&rdquo; said Helena sweetly, still
  busy with the fly. &ldquo;Mamie is going to take me for a drive&mdash;and
  afterwards we are going to her house for tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Madison, a little blankly.</p>
  <p>Helena smiled at him, nodded, and touched the horse with the whip&mdash;and
  then she leaned suddenly out toward him, as the buggy started forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Madison,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;I forgot to tell you!
  I had a letter from Mr. Thornton to-day&mdash;and he&rsquo;s coming back
  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  In Which Helena Takes A Ride</b></h2>
  <p>THE wind kissed Helena&rsquo;s face, bringing dainty color to her cheeks,
  tossing truant wisps of hair this way and that, as the car swept onward.
  But she sat strangely silent now beside Thornton at the steering wheel.</p>
  <p>It seemed to her that she was living, not her own life, not life as she
  had known and looked upon it in the years before, but living, as it were,
  in a strange, suspended state that was neither real nor unreal, as in a dream
  that led her, now through cool, deep forests, beside clear, sparkling streams
  where all was a great peace and the soul was at rest, serene, untroubled,
  now into desolate places where misery had its birth and shame was, where
  there was fear, and the mind stood staggered and appalled and lost and knew
  not how to guide her that she might flee from it all.</p>
  <p>At moments most unexpected, as now when motoring with Thornton in the car
  that he had brought back with him on his return to Needley, when laughing
  at the Flopper&rsquo;s determined pursuit of Mamie Rodgers, when engaged
  in the homely, practical details of housekeeping about the cottage, there
  came flashing suddenly upon her the picture of Mrs. Thornton lying on the
  brass bed in the car compartment that night, every line of the pale, gentle
  face as vivid, as actual as though it were once more before her in reality,
  and in her ears rang again, stabbing her with their unmeant condemnation,
  those words of sweetness, love and purity that held her up to gaze upon herself
  in ghastly, terrifying mockery.</p>
  <p>It stupified her, bewildered her, frightened her. She seemed, for days and
  weeks now, to be drifting with a current that, eddying, swirling, swept her
  this way and that. How wonderful it was, this life she was now leading compared
  with the old life&mdash;so full of the better things, the better emotions,
  the better thoughts that she had never known before! How monstrous in its
  irony that she was leading it to <i>steal</i>, that she might play her part
  in a criminal scheme for a criminal end! And yet, somehow, it did not all
  seem sham, this part she played&mdash;and that very thought, too, frightened
  her. Why was it now that Madison&rsquo;s oft-attempted, and as oft-repulsed,
  kiss upon her lips was something from which she shrank and battled back,
  no longer from a sense of pique or to bring him to his knees, but because
  something new within her, intangible, that she did not understand, rose up
  against it! Why did she do this&mdash;she, who had known the depths, who
  had known no other guide or mentor than the turbulent, passionate love she
  had yielded him and in her abandonment had once found contentment! Was her
  love for him gone? Or, if it was not that&mdash;what was it?</p>
  <p>What was it? A week, another, two more, a month had slipped away since Thornton
  had returned, and there had been so much of genuineness crowded into this
  sham part of hers that it seemed at times the part itself was genuine. She
  had come to love that little room of hers, love it for its dear simplicity,
  the white muslin curtains, the rag mat, the patch-quilt on the bed; those
  daily duties of a woman, that she had never done before, that she had at
  first looked at askance, brought now a sense of keen, housewifely pride;
  the gentle patience of the Patriarch, his love for her, his simple trust
  in her had found a quick and instant response in her own heart, and daily
  her affection for him had grown; and there was Thornton&mdash;this man beside
  her, whose companionship somehow she seemed to crave for, who, in his grave,
  quiet manliness, seemed a sort of inspiration to her, who seemed in a curious
  way to appease a new hunger that had come to her for association, for contact
  with better thoughts and better ideals.</p>
  <p>What was it? Environment? Yes; there must be something in that. It was having
  its effect even on Pale Face Harry and the Flopper. What was it that Harry,
  a surprisingly lusty farmhand now, had said to her a week or so ago: &ldquo;Say,
  Helena, do you ever feel that while you was trying to kid the crowd about
  this living on the square, you was kind of getting kidded yourself? I dunno!
  I ain&rsquo;t coughed for a month&mdash;honest. But it ain&rsquo;t only that.
  Say&mdash;I dunno! Do you ever feel that way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yes; there must be something in environment. The old life had never brought
  her thoughts such as these, thoughts that had been with her now almost since
  the first day she had come to Needley &mdash;this disquiet, this self-questioning,
  these sudden, floods of condemnatory confusion; and, mingling with them,
  a startled thrill, a strange, half-glad, half-premonitory awakening, a vague
  pronouncement that innately it might be true that she was not what she <i>really</i> was&mdash;but
  what all those around her held her to be&mdash;what Mrs. Thornton had said
  she was&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Her fingers closed with a quick, fierce pressure on the arm-rest of her
  seat&mdash;and she shifted her position with a sudden, involuntary movement.</p>
  <p>Thornton, a road-map tacked on a piece of board and propped up at his feet,
  raised his head, and, self-occupied himself, had apparently not noticed her
  silence, for he spoke irrelevantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t mind if the road is a bit rougher than usual
  for a few miles,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you know we decided we didn&rsquo;t
  like the looks of the weather at tea-time, and according to the map, which
  labels it &lsquo;rough but passable,&rsquo; this is a short cut that will
  lop off about ten miles and take us back to Needley through Barton&rsquo;s
  Mills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Helena answered. &ldquo;How
  far are we from Needley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About thirty-five miles or so,&rdquo; Thornton replied. &ldquo;Say,
  an hour and a half with any kind of going at all. We ought to be back by
  nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena nodded brightly and leaned back in her seat. Rather than objecting
  to the short cut that Thornton had begun to negotiate, the road, now that
  she gave her attention to it, she found to be quite the prettiest bit she
  had seen in the whole afternoon&rsquo;s run, where, in the rough, sparsely
  settled north country, all was both pretty and a delight&mdash;miles and
  miles without the sign of even a farmhouse, just the great Maine forests,
  so majestic and grand in their solitude, bordering the road that undulated
  with the country, now to a rise with its magnificent sweep of scenery, now
  to the cool, fresh valleys full of the sweet pine-scent of the woods. They
  had explored much of it together in the little &lsquo;run-about,&rsquo; nearly
  every day a short spin somewhere; to-day a little more ambitious run&mdash;the
  whole afternoon, and tea, a picnic tea, an hour or more back, in a charming
  glade beside a little brook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, this is perfectly lovely!&rdquo; she exclaimed; and then, with
  a breathless laugh, as a bump lifted her out of her seat: &ldquo;It <i>is</i> rough&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton laughed and slowed down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy it&rsquo;s used much, except in the winter for
  logging. But if the map says we can get through, I guess we&rsquo;re all
  right&mdash;there&rsquo;s about an eight mile stretch of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was growing dusk, and the shadows, fanciful and picturesque, were deepening
  around them. Now it showed a solid mass of green ahead, and, like a sylvan
  path, the road, converging in the distance, lost itself in a wall of foliage;
  now it swerved rapidly, this way and that, in short curves, as though, like
  one lost, it sought its way.</p>
  <p>A half hour passed. Thornton stopped the car, got down and lighted his lamps,
  then started on again. The going had seemed to be growing steadily worse&mdash;the
  road, as Thornton had said, was little more indeed than a logging trail through
  the heart of the woods; and now, deeper in, with increasing frequency, the
  tires slipped and skidded on damp, moist earth that at times approached very
  nearly to being oozy mud.</p>
  <p>Silence for a long while had held between them. It was taking Thornton all
  his time now to guide the car, that, negotiating fallen branches strewn across
  the way, bad holes and ruts, was crawling at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rough but passable&rsquo;!&rdquo; he laughed once, clambering
  back to his seat after clearing away a dead tree-trunk from in front of them. &ldquo;But
  there&rsquo;s no use trying to go back, as we must be halfway through, and
  it can&rsquo;t be any worse ahead than it&rsquo;s been behind. I&rsquo;d
  like to tell the fellow that made this map something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then upon Helena, just why she could not tell, began to steal an uneasiness
  that frightened her a little. It had grown suddenly, intensely dark&mdash;quicker
  than the slow, creeping change of dusk blending softly into night. Sort of
  eerie, it seemed&mdash;and a wind springing up and rustling through the branches
  made strange noises all about. They seemed to be shut in by a wall of blackness
  on every hand, except ahead where, like great streaming eyes of fire, the
  powerful lamps shot out their rays making weird color effects in the forest&mdash;huge
  tree-trunks loomed a dead drab, like mute sentinels, grim and ominous, that
  barred their way; now, in the full glare, the foliage took on the softest
  fairy shade of green; now, tapering off, heavier in color, it merged into
  impenetrable black; and, with the jouncing of the car, the light rays jiggling
  up and down gave an unnatural semblance as of moving, animate things before
  them, a myriad of them, ever retreating, but ever marshalling their forces
  again as though threatening attack, as though to oppose the car&rsquo;s advance.</p>
  <p>What was there to be afraid of? She tried to laugh at herself&mdash;it was
  perfectly ridiculous. A little bit of rough road&mdash;the forest that she
  loved around her&mdash;even if it was very dark. They would come out eventually
  somewhere on the trunk-road to Barton&rsquo;s Mills&mdash;that was all there
  was to it. Meanwhile, it was quite an experience, and she had every confidence
  in Thornton. She glanced at him now. It was too dark to get more than an
  indistinct outline of the clean-cut profile, but there was something inspiriting
  in the alert, self-possessed, competent poise of his body as he croched well
  forward over the wheel, his eyes never lifting from the road ahead.</p>
  <p>They appeared to be going a little faster now, too&mdash;undoubtedly the
  road was getting better. What was there to be afraid of? It didn&rsquo;t
  make it any more pleasant for Thornton, who was probably reproaching himself
  rather bitterly for having been tempted by the &ldquo;short cut,&rdquo; to
  have her sit and mope beside him!</p>
  <p>She began to hum an air softly to herself&mdash;and then laughingly sang
  a bar or two aloud.</p>
  <p>Thornton shot a quick, appreciative glance at her and nodded, joining in
  the laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said approvingly. &ldquo;That sounds good to me.
  I was afraid this beastly stretch, bumping and crawling along in the dark,
  was making you miserable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miserable!&rdquo; exclaimed Helena. &ldquo;Why, the idea! What is
  there to be miserable about? We&rsquo;ll get through after a while&mdash;and
  the road&rsquo;s better now than it was anyhow, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re running faster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes, of course,&rdquo; said Thornton -quickly. &ldquo;I
  wasn&rsquo;t thinking of what I said. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stopped suddenly, as Helena lifted her hand to her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s beginning to rain,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I was hoping
  we would get out of here before it came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Helena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the worst of it is,&rdquo; he added hurriedly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
  no top to the car, and you&rsquo;ve no wraps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it won&rsquo;t be anything more than a shower,&rdquo; said
  Helena hopefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Anyway&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped
  the car, and took off his coat&mdash;&ldquo;put this on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;please,&rdquo; protested Helena. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need
  it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Thornton cheerily. &ldquo;And that light
  dress of yours would be soaked through in no time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held the coat for her, and she slipped it on&mdash;and his hand around
  her shoulder and neck, as he turned the collar up and buttoned it gently
  about her, seemed to linger as it touched her throat, and yet linger with
  the most curious diffidence&mdash;a sort of reverence. Helena suddenly wanted
  to laugh&mdash;and, quick in her intuition, as suddenly wanted to cry. It
  wasn&rsquo;t much&mdash;only a little touch. It didn&rsquo;t mean love, or
  passion, or feeling&mdash;only that, unconsciously in his respect, he held
  her up to gaze upon herself again in that mocking mirror where all was sham.</p>
  <p>They started on&mdash;Thornton silent once more, busy with the car; Helena,
  her mind in riot, with no wish for words.</p>
  <p>The rain came steadily in a drizzle. She could feel her dress growing damp
  around her knees&mdash;and she shivered a little. How strangely wonderful
  the rain-beads looked on their background of green leaves where the lamps
  played upon them&mdash;they seemed to catch and hold and reflect back the
  light in a quick, passing procession of clear, sparkling crystals. But it
  was raining more heavily now, wasn&rsquo;t it? The drops were no longer clinging
  to the leaves, they were spattering dull and lustrelessly to the ground.
  And Thornton seemed suddenly to be in trouble&mdash;he was bending down working
  at something. How jerkily the car was moving! And now it stopped.</p>
  <p>Thornton swung out of his seat to the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he called out reassuringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  have it fixed in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was muddy enough now, and the ruts, holding the rain, were regular wheel-traps.
  Apart from any other trouble, Thornton did not like the prospect&mdash;and,
  away from Helena now, his face was serious. He cranked the engine&mdash;no
  result. He tried it again with equal futility&mdash;then, going to the tool-box,
  he took out his electric flashlight, and, lifting the engine hood, began
  to peer into the machinery. Everything seemed all right. He tried the crank
  again&mdash;the engine, like some cold, dead thing, refused to respond.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Helena asked him from the car.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Thornton answered lightly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
  found out yet&mdash;but don&rsquo;t you worry, it&rsquo;s nothing serious.
  I&rsquo;ll have it in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s knowledge of motor cars and engine trouble was not extensive&mdash;she
  was conversant only with the &ldquo;fool&rsquo;s mate&rdquo; of motoring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s no gasoline,&rdquo; she suggested helpfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; returned Thornton, with a laugh. &ldquo;I told Babson
  to see that the tank was full before he brought the car around&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t
  forget a thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton, nevertheless, tested the gasoline tank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired Helena, breaking the silence that followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no&mdash;gasoline,&rdquo; said Thornton heavily.</p>
  <p>Neither spoke for a moment. There was no sound but the steady drip from
  the leaves. Then Helena forced a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is what one
  is always making fun of others for. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
  going to stop raining&mdash;do you? And we&rsquo;re miles and miles from
  anywhere. What <i>do</i> people do when they&rsquo;re caught like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton did not answer at once. Bitterly reproachful with himself, he stood
  there coatless in the rain. If it had been a breakdown, an accident that
  was unavoidable, a little of the sting might have gone out of the situation&mdash;but <i>gasoline!</i> This&mdash;from
  rank, blatant, glaring, inexcusable idiocy. Not on his part perhaps&mdash;but
  that did not lessen his responsibility. They were miles, as she had said,
  from anywhere&mdash;four miles at least in either direction from the main
  road, and as many more probably after that from any farm-house&mdash;he remembered
  that for half an hour before they had turned into the &ldquo;short cut&rdquo; they
  had seen no sign of habitation&mdash;and what lay in the other direction,
  ahead, would in all probability be the same&mdash;they were up in the timber
  regions, in the heart of them&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t walk miles in the
  rain with the roads in a vile condition, and growing viler every minute as
  the rain sank in and the mud grew deeper. And then another thought&mdash;a
  thought that came now, sharp and quick, engulfing the mere discomfort of
  a miserable night spent there in the woods&mdash;the clatter of busy, gossiping
  tongues seemed already to be dinning their abominable noises in his ears.
  And that he, that he&mdash;yes, it seemed to sweep upon him in a sudden,
  overmastering surge, the realization that the delight and joy of her companionship
  through the month that was gone was love that leaped now into fierce, jealous
  flame, maddened at a breath that would smirch her in the eyes of others&mdash;that <i>he</i> should
  be the cause of it! &ldquo;What <i>do</i> people do when they&rsquo;re caught
  like this?&rdquo;&mdash;in their innocence there seemed an unfathomed depth
  of irony in her words, but as he unconsciously repeated them they cleared
  his brain and brought him suddenly to face the immediate practical problem
  that confronted them. What was to be done?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall&mdash;shall I get out?&rdquo; she called to him, a hint of
  reminder in her tones that she had spoken to him before and received no answer.</p>
  <p>Thornton moved back to the side of the car.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Vail,&rdquo; he said contritely, &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
  know what to say to you for getting you into this. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she interrupted quickly, leaning over the side of
  the car and placing her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to say anything.
  It&rsquo;s not your fault&mdash;it&rsquo;s not either of our faults. Now
  tell me what you think the best thing is to do, and, you&rsquo;ll see, I&rsquo;ll
  make the best of it&mdash;there&rsquo;s no use being miserable about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a game little woman!&rdquo; he said earnestly, quite
  unnecessarily clasping the hand on his arm and wringing it to endorse his
  verdict. &ldquo;And that makes it a lot easier, you know. Well then, we
  might as well face the whole truth at one fell swoop. We&rsquo;re up against
  it&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed cheerfully&mdash;&ldquo;hard. It&rsquo;s miles
  to anywhere&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know where &lsquo;anywhere&rsquo; is&mdash;and
  of course you can&rsquo;t walk aimlessly around in the mud and rain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s
  no sense in that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And of course you can&rsquo;t sit out here in the wet all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That sounds comforting&mdash;propitious even,&rdquo; commented Helena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite!&rdquo; agreed Thornton, laughing again. &ldquo;Well, you wait
  here a moment, and I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t knock up some sort of
  shelter&mdash;I used to be pretty good at that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; announced Helena, preparing to get out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By keeping at least your feet dry,&rdquo; he amended. &ldquo;No&mdash;please.
  Just stay where you are, Miss Vail. You&rsquo;ll get as much protection here
  from the branches overhead as you will anywhere meanwhile, and you&rsquo;ll
  be more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She watched him as he disappeared into the wood, and after that, like a
  flitting will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, watched his flashlight moving about amongst
  the trees. Then presently the cheery blaze of a fire from where he was at
  work sprang up, and she heard the crackle of resinous pine knots&mdash;then
  a great crashing about, the snapping of branches as he broke them from larger
  limbs&mdash;and a rapid fire of small talk from him as he worked.</p>
  <p>Helena answered him more or less mechanically&mdash;her mind, roving from
  one consideration of their plight to another, had caught at a certain viewpoint
  and was groping with it. They were stalled more effectively than any accident
  to the car could have stalled them&mdash;they were there for the night, there
  seemed no escape from that. But there was nothing to be afraid of. She had
  no fears about passing the night alone with him here in the woods&mdash;why
  should she? <i>Why should she!</i> She laughed low, suddenly, bitterly. Why
  should she&mdash;even if he were other than the man he was, even if he were
  of the lowest type! Fear&mdash;of <i>that!</i> A yearning, so intense as
  for an instant to leave her weak, swept upon her&mdash;a yearning full of
  pain, of shame, of remorse, of hopelessness&mdash;oh, God, if only she might
  have had the <i>right</i> to fear! Then passion seized her in wild, turbulent
  unrestraint&mdash;hatred for this clean-limbed, pure-minded man, who flaunted
  all that his life stood for in her face&mdash;hatred for everybody in this
  life of hers, for all were good save her&mdash;hatred, miserable, unbridled
  hatred for herself.</p>
  <p>And then it passed, the mood&mdash;and she tried to think more calmly, still
  answering him as he called from the woods. She had seen a great deal of Thornton
  lately&mdash;a great deal. He had been kind and thoughtful and considerate&mdash;nothing
  more. More! What more could there have been? Love! There was something of
  mockery in that, wasn&rsquo;t there? Everything she thought about lately,
  every way her mind turned seemed to hold something of mockery now. Of course,
  Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s words expressing the wish that she and Thornton might
  come together had been often enough with her&mdash;mockingly again!&mdash;but
  Thornton could have known nothing of that&mdash;so, after all, what did that
  matter? She had snatched at every opportunity to motor with Thornton despite
  Doc&rsquo;s protests, protests that had grown sullen and angry of late&mdash;snatched
  at the opportunities eagerly, as she would snatch at a breath of air where
  all else stifled her&mdash;snatched at them because they took her out of
  herself temporarily, away from everything, where everything at times seemed
  to be driving her mad. Hate Thornton! No, of course, she didn&rsquo;t hate
  him&mdash;she had thought that a moment ago because&mdash;because her brain
  was&mdash;was&mdash;oh, she didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;so tired and weary, and
  she was cold now and quite wet. She didn&rsquo;t hate him, she even&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All ready now&mdash;house to let furnished&rdquo;&mdash;he was calling
  out, laughing as he came thrashing through the undergrowth&mdash;&ldquo;excellent
  situation, high altitude, luxuriant pine grove surrounds the property, and&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;he
  had halted beside the car and opened the door&mdash;&ldquo;what else do they
  say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena caught his spirit&mdash;or, rather, forced herself to do so. It wasn&rsquo;t
  quite fair that one of them should do all the pretending.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flies,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;They always speak of flies in Maine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo; said Thornton promptly. &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been
  one since the house was built. Now then, Miss Vail&rdquo;&mdash;he held out
  his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but really, I can walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I can carry you,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and, from the step, gathered
  her into his arms.</p>
  <p>And then, as she lay there passively at first, she seemed to sense again
  that curious diffidence, that gentleness, like the touch upon her throat
  of a little while ago, though now he held her in both his arms. How strong
  he was&mdash;and, oh, how miserably wet&mdash;her hand around his shoulder
  felt the thin shirt clinging soggily to his arm. Yes; she was glad he hadn&rsquo;t
  let her walk&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t far, but she would have had to force her
  way continually through bushes that scattered showers from their dripping
  leaves, and underfoot she could hear his boots squash through the mud. And
  then suddenly it happened&mdash;the trees, just a yard or so from the fire,
  were thick together, tangled&mdash;she bent her head quickly, instinctively,
  to avoid a low-hanging branch as he for the same reason swerved a little&mdash;and
  their cheeks lay close-pressed against each other&rsquo;s, her hair sweeping
  his forehead, their lips mingling one another&rsquo;s breaths. He seemed
  to stumble&mdash;then his arms closed about her in a quick, fierce pressure,
  clasping her, straining her to him&mdash;relaxed as suddenly&mdash;and then
  he had set her down inside the shelter he had built.</p>
  <p>Quick her breath was coming now, and across the fire for a moment she met
  his eyes. His face was gray, and his hands at his sides were clenched.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get the seat out of the car,&rdquo; he
  said hoarsely. &ldquo;It will help to make things more comfortable.&rdquo; And
  turning abruptly, he started back for the road again.</p>
  <p>Helena did not move. Mechanically her eyes took in the little hut, crude,
  but rainproof at least&mdash;branches heaped across two forked limbs for
  a roof; the trunk of a big tree for the rear wall; branches thrust upright
  into the ground for the sides&mdash;the whole a little triangular shaped
  affair. The fire blazed in front just within shelter at the entrance; and
  beside it was piled quite a little heap of fuel that he had gathered.</p>
  <p>He came back bringing the leather upholstered seat, shook the rain from
  it, and dried it with the help of the fire and his handkerchief&mdash;then
  set it down inside the hut. His face was turned from her; and as he spoke,
  breaking an awkward silence, his voice was conscious, hurried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be gone a minute more than I can help, Miss
  Vail. It&rsquo;s mighty rough accommodation for you, but there&rsquo;s one
  consolation at least&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena seated herself, and held her skirt to the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she said, a little dully. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, to get help of course,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo;&mdash;she shook her head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
  where to find any&mdash;you only know for a certainty that there isn&rsquo;t
  any within miles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s a house back on the main road,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  noticed it as we came along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s seven or eight miles from here,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;And
  it&rsquo;s raining harder than ever&mdash;mud up to your ankles&mdash;it
  would take you hours to reach it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly two, or two and a half,&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and another two at least to get back. I won&rsquo;t hear of
  you doing any such thing&mdash;you are wet through now. It&rsquo;s far better
  to wait for daylight and then probably the storm will be over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see, Miss Vail&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was suddenly
  grave, masterful&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that there is no other
  thing to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Helena. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything of the
  kind. I won&rsquo;t have you do anything like that for me&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  not to be thought of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thornton stooped, placed a knot upon the fire, straightened up&mdash;and
  faced her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you to think of me,&rdquo; he said in
  a low tone; &ldquo;but, really, it won&rsquo;t be half as bad as you are
  picturing it in your mind. And really&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated, fumbling
  for his words&mdash;&ldquo;you see&mdash;that is&mdash;what other people
  might say&mdash;your&mdash;reputation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a sudden cry, white-faced, Helena was on her feet, staring at him,
  her hands clutched at her bosom&mdash;a wild, demoniacal, mocking orgy in
  her soul. Her reputation! It seemed she wanted to scream out the words&mdash;<i>her
  reputation!</i></p>
  <p>Thornton&rsquo;s face flushed with a quick-sweeping flood of crimson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a brute&mdash;a brute with a blundering tongue!&rdquo; he
  cried miserably. &ldquo;You had not thought of that&mdash;and I made you.
  I could have found another excuse for going if I had only had wit enough.
  I was a brute once before to-night, and&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, and for
  a moment stood there looking at her, stood in the firelight, his face white
  again even in the ruddy glow&mdash;and then he was gone.</p>
  <p>Time passed without meaning to Helena. The steady patter of the rain was
  on the leaves, the sullen, constant drip of water to the ground, and now,
  occasionally, a rush of wind, a heavier downpour. She sat before the fire,
  staring into it, her elbows on her knees, her face held tightly in her hands,
  the brown hair, wet and wayward now, about her temples. Once she moved, once
  her eyes changed their direction&mdash;to fix upon her sleeve in a strange,
  questioning surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I let him go without his coat,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Boomerang</b></h2>
  <p>IT was early afternoon, as Madison, emerging from the wagon track, and walking
  slowly, started across the lawn toward the Patriarch&rsquo;s cottage. He
  was in a mood that he made no attempt to define&mdash;except that it wasn&rsquo;t
  a very pleasant mood. Before Thornton had returned to Needley it had been
  bad enough, after that, with his infernal car, it had been&mdash;hell.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s fists clenched, and his gray eyes glinted angrily. His hands
  had been tied like a baby&rsquo;s&mdash;like a damned infant&rsquo;s! Helena
  was getting away from him further every day, and he couldn&rsquo;t stop it&mdash;without
  stopping the game! He couldn&rsquo;t tell Thornton that Helena belonged to
  him&mdash;had belonged to him! He couldn&rsquo;t even evidence an interest
  in what was going on. He had to put on a front, a suave, cordial, dignified
  front before Thornton&mdash;while he itched to smash the other&rsquo;s face
  to pulp! Hell&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it was&mdash;pure, unadulterated hell!
  He couldn&rsquo;t get near Helena alone with a ten-foot pole, morning, noon
  or night&mdash;she had taken good care of that. And he wanted Helena&mdash;he <i>wanted</i> her!
  It was an obsession with him now&mdash;at times driving him half crazy&mdash;and
  it didn&rsquo;t help any that he saw her grow more glorious, more beautiful
  every day! Of course she knew she had him&mdash;had him where she knew he
  couldn&rsquo;t do a thing&mdash;where she could laugh at him&mdash;go the
  limit with Thornton if she liked. But, curse it, it wasn&rsquo;t only Thornton&mdash;that
  was what he could not understand&mdash;she had begun to keep away from him
  before ever Thornton had come back. Madison was near the porch now, and,
  raising his eyes, noted a supplicant going into the shrine-room&mdash;a woman,
  richly dressed but in widow&rsquo;s weeds, who walked feebly. The game went
  on by itself, once started&mdash;there were half a hundred more about the
  lawn! Like a snowball rolling down hill, as he had put it at the Roost. The
  Roost! If he only had Helena back there for about a minute there&rsquo;d
  be an end of this! She&rsquo;d go a little too far one of these days&mdash;a
  little too far&mdash;it was pretty near far enough now&mdash;and then there&rsquo;d
  be a showdown, game or no game, and somebody would get hurt in the smash,
  and&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000041h-images/page222.jpg" width="850" height="622"></p>
  <p>He lifted his eyes again, as some one came hurrying through the cottage
  door. It was the Flopper. And then to his surprise, he found himself being
  pushed unceremoniously from the porch and pulled excitedly behind the trellis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you!&rdquo; he demanded angrily. &ldquo;Are
  you crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ank de Lord youse have showed up!&rdquo; gasped the Flopper. &ldquo;Say,
  honest, I can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; wid him&mdash;he&rsquo;s got me near
  bughouse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;&mdash;Madison scowled irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De Patriarch, of course. He&rsquo;s noivous, an&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; worse
  all de time. He won&rsquo;t eat an&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t keep still. He wants
  Helena, an&rsquo; he keeps writin&rsquo; her name on de slate&mdash;he&rsquo;s
  got me going fer fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not Helena!&rdquo; growled Madison. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t
  she go to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now wouldn&rsquo;t dat sting youse!&rdquo; ejaculated the Flopper. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
  she goin&rsquo; to him when she ain&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not here?&rdquo; repeated Madison sharply. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper looked down his nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Madison stared at him for a moment&mdash;then he reached out and caught
  the Flopper&rsquo;s arm in a sudden and far from gentle grip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out with it!&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno where she is,&rdquo; said the Flopper, with some reluctance. &ldquo;She
  ain&rsquo;t back yet, dat&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Back from where?&rdquo;&mdash;Madison&rsquo;s grip tightened.</p>
  <p>The Flopper blinked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, wot&rsquo;s de use!&rdquo; he blurted out, as though his mind,
  suddenly made up, brought him unbounded relief. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;ll find
  it out anyhow. Say, she went off wid Thornton in de buzz-wagon yesterday,
  an&rsquo; I put de Patriarch to bed last night &rsquo;cause she wasn&rsquo;t
  back, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s de matter wid him, she ain&rsquo;t
  showed up since an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s near off his chump, an&rsquo;&mdash;fer
  God&rsquo;s sake let go my arm, Doc, youse&rsquo;re breakin&rsquo; it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sort of cold frenzy seemed to seize Madison. He was perfectly calm, he
  felt himself perfectly calm and composed. Off all night with Thornton&mdash;eh?
  Funny, wasn&rsquo;t it? She&rsquo;d gone pretty far at last&mdash;gone the
  limit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send me word this morning?&rdquo;&mdash;was
  that his own voice speaking? Well, he wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized it&mdash;but
  he was perfectly calm nevertheless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fer God&rsquo;s sake let go my arm,&rdquo; whimpered the Flopper. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
  ain&rsquo;t no squealer, dat&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s arm fell away&mdash;to his side. He felt a whiteness creeping
  to his face and lips, felt his lips twitch, felt the fingers of his hands
  curl in and the nails begin to press into the palms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; suggested the Flopper timidly, &ldquo;mabbe dere was
  an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison made no answer.</p>
  <p>The Flopper shifted from foot to foot and licked his lips, stealing frightened
  glances at Madison&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&mdash;wot&rsquo;ll I do wid de Patriarch?&rdquo; he stammered
  out miserably.</p>
  <p>And then Madison smiled at him&mdash;not happily, but eloquently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; mumbled the Flopper, as he backed out from the trellis. &ldquo;Dis
  love game&rsquo;s fierce&mdash;an&rsquo; mabbe <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know! &lsquo;Sposin&rsquo; she&rsquo;d
  been Mamie an&rsquo; me the Doc&mdash;&rsquo;sposin&rsquo; it had!&rdquo; He
  gulped hastily. &ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; said the Flopper with emotion.</p>
  <p>Madison, motionless, watched the Flopper disappear. He wasn&rsquo;t quite
  so calm now, not so cool and collected and composed. He must go somewhere
  and think this out&mdash;somewhere where it would be quiet and he wouldn&rsquo;t
  be disturbed.</p>
  <p>A step sounded on the path&mdash;Madison looked through the trellis. A man,
  with yellow, unhealthy skin and sunken cheeks, his head bowed, was passing
  in through the porch. It caught Madison with fierce, exquisite irony. Why
  not go there himself if he wanted quiet&mdash;the shrine-room&mdash;the place
  of meditation! Well, he wanted to <i>meditate!</i> He laughed jarringly.
  The shrine-room&mdash;for him! Great! Immense! Magnificent! Why not? That&rsquo;s
  what he had created it for, wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;to meditate in!</p>
  <p>He stepped inside. The woman, whom he had seen enter a short while before,
  was sitting in a sort of rigid, strained attitude in the far corner; the
  man, who had just preceded him, had taken the chair by the fireplace&mdash;they
  were the only occupants of the room. There was no sound save his own footsteps&mdash;neither
  of the others looked at him. There was quiet, a profound stillness&mdash;and
  the softened light from the shuttered window fell mellow all about, fell
  like a benediction upon the simplicity of the few plain articles that the
  room contained&mdash;the round rag mats upon the white-scrubbed floor; the
  hickory chairs, severe, uncushioned; the table, with its little japanned
  box and book.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon the japanned box, as he leaned now, arms
  folded, against the wall&mdash;a jewel, even in the subdued light, glowed
  crimson-warm where it nested on a crumpled bed of bank-notes&mdash;a ruby
  ring&mdash;the last contribution&mdash;it must have been the woman who had
  placed it there. Madison glanced at her involuntarily&mdash;but his thoughts
  were far away again in a moment.</p>
  <p>Anger and a blind rage of jealousy were gripping him now. <i>Accident!</i> The
  thought only fanned his fury. Accident! Yes; it was likely&mdash;as an excuse!
  There would have been an accident all right&mdash;leave that to them! Thornton
  perhaps wasn&rsquo;t the stamp of man to seek an adventure of that kind deliberately&mdash;perhaps
  he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;and perhaps he was&mdash;you never could tell&mdash;but
  what difference did that make! <i>Helena was that kind of a woman</i>&mdash;though
  he&rsquo;d always thought her true to him since he&rsquo;d known her&mdash;and
  Thornton, whatever kind of a man he was, wouldn&rsquo;t run away from her
  arms, would he?</p>
  <p>The red glow from the ruby ring had vanished &mdash;the man had risen from
  his seat and was placing something in the box on top of the ring&mdash;Madison&rsquo;s
  mind subconsciously absorbed the fact that it was a little sheaf of yellow-backed
  bills. And now the man bent to the table and was writing in the book.</p>
  <p>Yellow-backs and rubies! Rubies and yellow-backs! Madison&rsquo;s lips thinned
  and curled downward at the corners. Oh, it was coming all right, money, jewels,
  pelf, rolling in merrily every day, there wasn&rsquo;t any stopping it, but
  he was paying for it, and paying for it at a price he didn&rsquo;t like&mdash;Helena.
  Helena! She wanted Thornton, did she&mdash;with his money! Wanted to dangle
  a millionaire on her string&mdash;eh? She&rsquo;d throw him over&mdash;would
  she! And she thought she had him where he couldn&rsquo;t lift a finger to
  stop it&mdash;just sit back and grin like a poor, sick fool!</p>
  <p>The red crept up the knotted cords of Madison&rsquo;s neck, suffused the
  set jaws, and, as though suddenly liberated to run its course where it would,
  swept in a tide over cheeks and temples.</p>
  <p>He couldn&rsquo;t do a thing&mdash;<i>couldn&rsquo;t he!</i> Well, he&rsquo;d
  see the game in Gehenna before Thornton or any other man got her away from
  him. She belonged to him&mdash;to <i>him!</i> And he&rsquo;d have her, hold
  her, own her&mdash;she was his&mdash;<i>his!</i> And he&rsquo;d settle with
  Thornton too, by Heaven!</p>
  <p>A laugh, low, unpleasant, purled to his lips&mdash;and he checked it with
  a sort of strange mechanical realization that he must not laugh aloud. His
  eyes swept the room&mdash;the man had returned to his seat, the woman had
  not moved, both were silent, motionless&mdash;that ghastly, hallowed, sanctimonious
  hush&mdash;that subdued, damnable light&mdash;meditation!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake let me get out of here,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;or
  I&rsquo;ll go mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned&mdash;and stopped. Came a cry spontaneously from the man and the
  woman&mdash;they were on their feet&mdash;no, on their knees. The doorway
  at the further end of the room was framing a majestic figure, tall and stately&mdash;and
  a sun-gleam struggling suddenly through the lattice seemed to leap in a golden
  ray to caress in homage the snow-white hair, the silver beard that fell upon
  the breast, the saintly face of the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>Then into the room advanced the Patriarch, and his hands were outstretched
  before him, and he moved them a little to and fro&mdash;and the gesture,
  the poise, the mien, as, touching nothing he seemed to feel his way through
  space itself, was as one invoking a blessing of peace ineffable.</p>
  <p>Spellbound, Madison watched. Upon the face was a yearning that saddened
  it, and, saddening, glorified it; the head was slightly turned as though
  to listen&mdash;while slowly, with measured, certain tread, as though indeed
  he had no need for eyes, the Patriarch, circled the table and passed on down
  the room. The man and the woman reached out and touched him reverently, and
  drew back reverently to let him pass, and, rising from their knees, followed
  him through the door and out onto the porch.</p>
  <p>The room was empty. Madison stared at the doorway. Upon him fell a sudden
  awe&mdash;it was as though a vision, an ethereal presence, some strange embodiment
  of power, had been and gone&mdash;and yet still remained.</p>
  <p>And now from without there came a sound like a distant murmur. It rose and
  swelled, and began to roll in its volume, and then, like the clarion sound
  of trumpets, voices burst into glad acclaim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Patriarch! The Patriarch! The Patriarch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From the little hallway came the Flopper, running&mdash;and he stopped and
  gaped at Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I left him in his room fer a minute,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s
  lookin&rsquo; fer Helena.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then Madison shook himself together&mdash;and smiled ironically. And
  at the smile the Flopper hurried on.</p>
  <p>Madison stepped out onto the porch. Helena! Helena! Within him seemed to
  burn a rage of hell; but it seemed, too, most strangely that for the moment
  this rage was held in abeyance, that something temporarily supplanted it&mdash;this
  scene before him.</p>
  <p>Onward across the lawn moved the Patriarch, and the Flopper had joined him
  now; but the Patriarch, unheeding, turning neither to the right nor to the
  left, his arms still extended before him, kept on. And the people cried aloud:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is coming&mdash;he is coming! The Patriarch! The Patriarch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison moved on&mdash;out upon the lawn himself.</p>
  <p>From everywhere, from every scattered spot where they had been, men and
  women ran and limped and dragged themselves along, all converging on one
  point&mdash;the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>Madison, in the midst of them now, hurried&mdash;for it was plainly evident
  that the Flopper&rsquo;s control over the Patriarch was gone. He reached
  the Patriarch and touched the other&rsquo;s arm&mdash;and at the touch the
  Patriarch halted instantly, his hand went out and lay upon Madison&rsquo;s
  sleeve in recognition, and he turned his face, and it was smiling and there
  was relief upon it&mdash;and confidence and trust, as, suffering himself
  to be guided, they started back toward the cottage.</p>
  <p>And then upon Madison came again that sense of awe, but now intensified.
  From every hand tear-stained faces greeted him, white faces, faces full of
  sorrow and suffering through which struggled hope&mdash;hope&mdash;hope.
  They flung themselves before the Patriarch&mdash;yet never blocked the way.
  They cried, they wept, they prayed&mdash;and some were silent. It seemed
  that souls, naked, stripped, bare, held themselves up to his gaze. Men, prostrate
  on stretchers, tried to rise and stagger nearer&mdash;and fell. Friends,
  where there were friends to help, tugged and dragged desperately at cots&mdash;and
  from the cots in piteous, agonized appeal the helpless cried out to the Patriarch
  to come to them. All of human agony and fear and hope and despair and terror
  seemed loosed in a mad and swirling vortex. And ever the cries arose, and
  ever around them, giving way, closing in again, pressed the soul-rent throng.</p>
  <p>And presently to Madison it seemed as though he had awakened from some terrifying
  dream, as, in the Patriarch&rsquo;s room again, he swept away a bead of sweat
  from his forehead, and stood and looked at the Patriarch and the Flopper.</p>
  <p>The Flopper licked his lips, and pulled the Patriarch&rsquo;s chair forward&mdash;but
  his hands trembled violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been gettin&rsquo; me, Doc,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I
  can&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s been gettin&rsquo; into me all de time. Say,
  I wisht it was over. Honest to God I do! Dis&mdash;dis makes me queer. Say,
  de Patriarch&rsquo;s got me, Doc&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;say&mdash;dere&rsquo;s
  been somethin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on inside me dat&rsquo;s got me hard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison did not answer&mdash;but he started suddenly&mdash;and as suddenly
  stepped to the window and looked out. Over the cries, the wailings, the confused
  medley of voices, growing lower now, subsiding, there had come the throb
  of a motor car.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s eyes narrowed&mdash;<i>that</i> was supreme again. A car
  was coming to a stop before the porch&mdash;Thornton was helping Helena to
  alight.</p>
  <p>Madison turned and caught the Flopper&rsquo;s arm in a fierce, imperative
  grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You keep your mouth shut&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo; he flung out,
  clipping off his words. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen me to-day&mdash;understand!&rdquo; And,
  dropping the Flopper&rsquo;s arm, he stepped quickly across the little hall
  to Helena&rsquo;s door, opened it, went in&mdash;and closed the door behind
  him.</p>
  <p>And the Flopper, staring, licked his lips again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me! &ldquo; he croaked hoarsely. &ldquo;Pipe de eyes on de
  Doc! Dere&rsquo;ll be somethin&rsquo; doin&rsquo; now!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  The Sanctuary Of Darkness</b></h2>
  <p>THERE was a grim, merciless smile on Madison&rsquo;s lips; and a whiteness
  in his face windowed the passion that seethed within him. He stood motionless,
  listening, in Helena&rsquo;s room. He heard the automobile going away again;
  then he heard Helena&rsquo;s light step in the hallway without&mdash;and
  the smile died as his lips thinned.</p>
  <p>But she did not come in&mdash;instead, he heard her go into the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  room, heard her talking to the Patriarch, and bid the Flopper go to the kitchen
  and make her some tea. Then the Flopper&rsquo;s step sounded, passing down
  to the rear of the cottage.</p>
  <p>The minutes passed&mdash;then that light footfall again. The door of the
  room swung suddenly wide&mdash;and closed&mdash;there was a cry&mdash;and
  Helena, wide-eyed, the red of her cheeks fading away, leaned heavily back
  against the door.</p>
  <p>Neither spoke. Madison, in the center of the room, did not move. The smile
  came back to his lips.</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s great brown eyes met the gray ones, read the ugly glint,
  dropped, raised again&mdash;and held the gray ones steadily.</p>
  <p>Madison gave a short laugh&mdash;that was like a curse. His hands at his
  sides knotted into lumps.</p>
  <p>Then Madison spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say, &lsquo;you!&mdash;<i>you!</i>&rsquo;&mdash;and
  scream it out and clutch at your bosom the way they do in story books!&rdquo; he
  flung out raucously. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do your little stunt&mdash;go
  on, you&rsquo;re on for the turn&mdash;you can put anything over me, I&rsquo;m
  only a complacent, blind-eyed fool! Anything goes! Why don&rsquo;t you start
  your act?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are saying,&rdquo; she said in a low
  voice. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything you want to talk about, we&rsquo;d
  better wait until you&rsquo;re cooler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; he roared, his passion full to the surface now. &ldquo;Cut
  out the bunk&mdash;cut it out! <i>Anything!</i> No, it isn&rsquo;t much of
  anything&mdash;for you&mdash;out all night with Thornton. Do you think I&rsquo;m
  going to stand for it! Do you think I&rsquo;m going to sit and suck my thumb
  and <i>share</i> you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; She was away from the door now, close before him,
  her breath coming fast, white to the lips, and in a frenzy her little fists
  pummelled upon him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie&mdash;a lie&mdash;a lie! It&rsquo;s
  a lie&mdash;and you know it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He pushed her roughly from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is, eh?&rdquo;&mdash;his words came in a sort of wild laugh. &ldquo;And
  I know it&mdash;do I? Why should I know it? What do you think you are? Say,
  you&rsquo;d think you were trying to kid yourself into believing you&rsquo;re
  the real thing&mdash;the real, sweet, shy, modest Miss Vail. Cut it out!
  You&rsquo;re name&rsquo;s Smith&mdash;maybe! And it&rsquo;s my money that&rsquo;s
  keeping you, and you belong to me&mdash;do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood swaying a little, her hands still tightly clenched, breathing
  through half parted lips in short, quick, jerky inhalations like dry sobs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she faltered suddenly&mdash;and suddenly
  buried her face in her hands. And then she looked up again, and the brown
  eyes in their depths held an anger and a shame. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true&mdash;I
  was&mdash;was&mdash;what you say. But now&rdquo;&mdash;her voice hurried
  on, an eagerness, a strange earnestness in it&mdash;&ldquo;you must believe
  me&mdash;you must. I&rsquo;ll make you&mdash;I must make you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t hurt yourself trying to do it!&rdquo; jeered Madison. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
  talking plain now. I&rsquo;m not taking into account how you feel about it&mdash;don&rsquo;t
  you fool yourself for a minute. The sanctity of my home hasn&rsquo;t been
  ruined&mdash;because it couldn&rsquo;t be! Get that? Thornton don&rsquo;t
  get you&mdash;not for <i>keeps!</i> But you and he don&rsquo;t make a monkey
  of me again. Do you understand&mdash;say, do you get that? You&rsquo;re <i>mine</i>&mdash;whether
  you like it or not&mdash;whether you&rsquo;d rather have Thornton or not.
  But I&rsquo;ll fix you both for this&mdash;I&rsquo;m no angel with a cherub&rsquo;s
  smile! I&rsquo;ll take it out of Thornton till the laugh he&rsquo;s got now
  fades to a fare-thee-well; and I&rsquo;ll put you where there aren&rsquo;t
  any strings tying me up the way there are here. Do you understand!&rdquo; His
  voice rose suddenly, and for a moment he seemed to lose all control of himself
  as he reached for her and caught her shoulder. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he
  flashed out between his teeth. &ldquo;I love you&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
  the matter with me! And you know that&mdash;you know you&rsquo;ve got me
  there&mdash;and you&rsquo;d play the fool with me, would you!&rdquo; He dropped
  his hands and laughed a short, savage bark&mdash;and stepped back and stared
  at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you listen?&rdquo;&mdash;she was twisting her hands, her head
  was drooped, the long lashes veiled her eyes, her lips were quivering. &ldquo;Will
  you listen?&rdquo; she said again, fighting to steady her voice. &ldquo;It
  was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw the machine when you drove up&mdash;it was a wreck!&rdquo; snapped
  Madison sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We ran out of gasoline,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>And then Madison laughed&mdash;fiercely&mdash;in his derision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, keep on!&rdquo; he rasped. &ldquo;I told you I was only a blind
  fool that you could put anything over on! That accounts for it, of course&mdash;a
  breakdown isn&rsquo;t so easy to get away with. Gasoline!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were miles from anywhere,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;We had taken
  what we thought was a short cut. Mr. Thornton built a shelter for me in the
  woods, and went to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He caught up her hesitation like a flash.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fake the lines, Helena, if you haven&rsquo;t had enough rehearsals,&rdquo; he
  suggested ironically. &ldquo;Anything goes&mdash;with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And now a tinge of color came to Helena&rsquo;s cheeks, and the brown eyes
  raised, and flashed, and dropped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He went to try and find help,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was out
  all night in the storm. I do not know how far he must have walked. I know
  the nearest house was five or six miles away&mdash;and there was no horse
  there&mdash;the man had driven to some town that morning. It was almost daylight
  before Mr. Thornton at last came back with a team. We were forty miles from
  here&mdash;we sent the team to the nearest town for gasoline and then motored
  back.&rdquo; She stopped&mdash;and then, with a catch in her voice: &ldquo;He&mdash;he
  was very good to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good to me&rdquo;&mdash;the words seemed to stab at Madison, seemed
  to ring in his ears and goad him with a fiercer jealousy&mdash;and her story
  of the night, what she had been saying, save those words, was as nothing,
  meant nothing, was swept from his consciousness&mdash;and only she, standing
  there before him, glorious, maddening in her beauty, remained. Soul, mind
  and body leaped into fiery passion&mdash;she was his, and his she always
  would be&mdash;those eyes, those lips, the white throat, those perfect arms
  to cling about his neck&mdash;and all of heaven and hell and earth were naught
  beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;&mdash;his face was white, his words fierce-breathed,
  almost incoherent&mdash;and he leaned toward her with a sudden, uncontrollable
  movement, his arms sweeping out to clasp her. &ldquo;I love you, Helena&mdash;I
  love you. Do you understand&mdash;it&rsquo;s <i>you!</i> You&mdash;I love
  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>love</i> me!&rdquo;&mdash;she retreated from him, but her
  head was raised now, and her voice rang with a bitterness cold as the touch
  of death. &ldquo;Love! What do you know of <i>love!</i> We talk plain, you
  say. Love&mdash;love for me! Passion, vice, lust, sin&mdash;and, oh, my God,
  degradation and misery and shame&mdash;love! Love! That is <i>your</i> love!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stood for a moment and stared at her again&mdash;and her face was as
  pallid ivory. And something seemed to daze him, and he brushed his hand across
  his eyes&mdash;the logic was faulty, torn and pitiful, and he groped after
  the flaw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s your love as well as mine,&rdquo; he
  said in a stumbling way&mdash;then his brain flashed quick into action. &ldquo;My
  love&mdash;what other love have <i>you</i> known but that?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>our</i> love&mdash;the
  love we have known together&mdash;and we&rsquo;re going back to it&mdash;see?
  I&rsquo;ve had enough of this. You pack your trunks&mdash;and pack them quick!
  We&rsquo;re going to beat it out of here! We&rsquo;re going back to our&mdash;love.
  We&rsquo;re going back where I don&rsquo;t have to sit around like a puling
  fool and watch Thornton chuck you under the chin&mdash;we&rsquo;re going
  where he&rsquo;ll want a tombstone if he ever shows his face there. You thought
  the game would hold me to the last jackpot&mdash;did you? Well, I&rsquo;ve
  got enough&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no game big enough to make me stand for
  this. That looks like love&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He burst again
  into a sudden, mirthless laugh&mdash;and once again swept his hand across
  his eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to beat it out of here now&mdash;to-night&mdash;to-morrow
  morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But now she had drawn further away from him&mdash;and there was a frightened
  look in her eyes, and her lips quivered pitifully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;No,
  no&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t go back to <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That! That&mdash;is love,&rdquo; he said wildly. &ldquo;The only
  love you know. What more do you want? There&rsquo;s loot enough now, and&mdash;ha,
  ha!&mdash;that little contribution of Thornton&rsquo;s, to give you all the
  money you want. Love, Helena&mdash;you and I&mdash;the old love&mdash;you
  and I together again, Helena. I tell you I love&mdash;you do you hear? I
  love you&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll have you&mdash;I love you! What do you know,
  what do you care about any other kind of love!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him, misery and fear still in her eyes, and her slight figure
  seemed to droop, and her hands hung heavy, listless, at her sides.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I care&rdquo;&mdash;the words came in a strange mechanical way from
  her lips. &ldquo;Oh, I care. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I won&rsquo;t go back to
  that. And I know&mdash;I know now. I have learned what love is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quick over Madison&rsquo;s face surged the red in an unstemmed tide&mdash;volcanic
  within him his love that he knew now possessed his very soul, jealousy that,
  blinding, robbed him of his senses, roused him to frenzy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve learned what love is, have you&mdash;<i>with him!</i>&rdquo; he
  cried&mdash;and sprang for her and snatched her into his arms. &ldquo;And
  you won&rsquo;t come, eh? Well, I&rsquo;ve learned what love is too in the
  last month&mdash;and if I can&rsquo;t get it one way, I&rsquo;ll get it another&rdquo;&mdash;he
  was raining mad kisses upon her face, her hair, her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I love
  you, I tell you&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a cry she tried to struggle from him&mdash;and then fought and struck
  at him, beating upon his face with her fists. Fiercer, closer he held her&mdash;around
  the little room, staggering this way and that, they circled. He kissed her,
  laughing hoarsely like a madman, laughing at the blows, beside himself, not
  knowing what he did&mdash;mad&mdash;mad&mdash;mad. He kissed her, kissed
  the white throat where the dress was torn now at the neck; imprisoned a little
  fist that struck at him and kissed the quivering knuckles; kissed the wealth
  of glorious, burnished-copper hair that, unloosened, fell about her, kissed
  it and buried his face in its rare fragrance. And then&mdash;and then his
  arms were empty&mdash;and he was staring at the calm, majestic figure of
  the Patriarch&mdash;and Helena was crouched upon the floor, and, sobbing,
  was clinging with arms entwined around the old man&rsquo;s knees.</p>
  <p>And so for a little while Madison stood and stared&mdash;what had brought
  the Patriarch there&mdash;the Patriarch who could neither see nor hear nor
  speak&mdash;what had brought him from his own room across the hall! And Madison
  stared, and his hands crept to his temples and pressed upon them&mdash;weak
  he seemed as from some paroxysm of madness that had passed over him. The
  sunlight streaming through the window sheened the luxuriant mass of hair
  that falling over shoulders and to the waist seemed alone to cloak the little
  figure in its crouched position&mdash;the little figure that shook so convulsively
  with sobs&mdash;the little figure that clung so desperately at the feet of
  this god-like, regal man, whose beard was silver, whose hair was hoary white,
  upon whose face, marring none its strength or self-possession, was a troubled,
  anxious, questioning look.</p>
  <p>Strange! Strange! Madison&rsquo;s hands fell to his sides. The Patriarch&rsquo;s
  eyes were turned full upon him, wavering not so much as by the fraction of
  an inch&mdash;full upon him. And then, as into some holy sanctuary, fending
  her from harm and danger, the Patriarch turned a little to interpose himself
  before Madison, and, raising Helena, held her in his arms, her head against
  his bosom&mdash;and one hand lay upon her head and stroked it tenderly. But
  upon Madison was still turned those sightless eyes, that noble face, serene,
  commanding even in its perturbation, even in its alert and searching look.</p>
  <p>Madison stirred now&mdash;stirred uneasily&mdash;while the silence held.
  There was a solemnity in the silence that seemed to creep upon and pervade
  the room&mdash;a sense of a vast something that was the antithesis of turmoil,
  passion, strife, that seemed to radiate from the saintly figure whose lips
  were mute, whose ears heard no sound, whose eyes saw no sight. And upon Madison
  it fell potent, masterful, and passion fled, and in its place came a strange,
  groping response within him, a revulsion, a penitence&mdash;and he bowed
  his head.</p>
  <p>And then Helena spoke&mdash;but her head was turned away from him, hidden
  on the Patriarch&rsquo;s breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; she said, and her words were like broken whispers, for
  she was sobbing still, &ldquo;once, long, long ago, when I was a little girl,
  I read the story of Mary Magdalen. I had almost forgotten it, it was so long
  ago, but it has come back to me, and&mdash;and it is a glad story&mdash;at
  the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stopped&mdash;and Madison raised his head, and his face was strained
  as with some sudden wonder as he looked at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a glad story,&rdquo; she said presently. &ldquo;It&mdash;it
  is my story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean&rdquo;&mdash;Madison&rsquo;s voice was hoarse&mdash;&ldquo;you
  mean that you&rsquo;ve turned&mdash;<i>straight!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They love me here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They trust me and they
  think me good&mdash;as they are. All think me that&mdash;the little children
  and this dear man here&mdash;and for a little while, since I have been here,
  I have lived like that. They made me believe that it was true&mdash;<i>true</i>.
  And there was shame and agony&mdash;and hope. It seemed they could not all
  be wrong, and I have asked and prayed that I might make it true always&mdash;and&mdash;and
  forgiveness for what I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said again hoarsely, and he stepped toward her
  now, &ldquo;you mean that you are&mdash;<i>straight!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not answer&mdash;only now she turned her face toward him and lifted
  up her head.</p>
  <p>And for a long minute Madison gazed into the tear-splashed eyes, deep, brave
  in chastened wistfulness, gazed&mdash;and like a man stunned walked from
  the room, the cottage, and out across the lawn.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  To The Victor Are The Spoils</b></h2>
  <p>MANY were still about the lawn as he left the cottage&mdash;they were all
  about him, those sick, half frantic creatures&mdash;and still they made noises;
  still some of them cried and sobbed; still in their waning paroxysms they
  moved hither and thither. They appealed to some numbed, dormant sense in
  Madison, in a subconscious way, as things to be avoided. And so, almost mechanically,
  he took the little path that, striking off at right angles to the wagon track
  where it joined the Patriarch&rsquo;s lawn, came out again upon the main
  road at the further end of the village.</p>
  <p>And, as he walked, like tidal waves on-rushing, emotions, utterly at variance
  one with another, hurled themselves upon him, and he was swept from his mental
  balance, tossed here and there, rolled gasping, strangling in the chaos and
  turmoil of the waters, as it were, and, rising, was hurled back again.</p>
  <p>White as death itself was Madison&rsquo;s face; and at times his fingers
  with a twitching movement curled into clenched fists, at times his open palms
  sought his temples in a queer wriggling way and pressed upon them. Doubt,
  anger, fear, a rage unhallowed&mdash;in cycles&mdash;buffeted him until his
  brain reeled, and he was as a man distraught.</p>
  <p>It began at the beginning, that cycle, and dragged him along&mdash;and left
  him like one swooning, tottering, upon the edge of a precipice. And then
  it began over again.</p>
  <p>And it began always with a picture of the Roost that night&mdash;the vicious,
  unkempt, ragged figure of the Flopper&mdash;the sickly, thin, greedy face
  of Pale Face Harry, the drug fiend, winching a little as he plunged the needle
  into his flesh&mdash;the easy, unprincipled gaiety and eagerness of Helena
  for the new path of crime&mdash;crime&mdash;crime&mdash;the Roost exuded
  crime&mdash;filth&mdash;immorality&mdash;typified them, framed them well
  as they had sat there, the four of them, while that bruised-nosed bouncer
  had brought them drink on his rattling tin tray. And then his own self-satisfied,
  smug, complacent egotism at his own cleverness, his unbounded confidence
  in his own ability to pull off the game, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Well, he had pulled it off&mdash;he&rsquo;d won it&mdash;won it&mdash;won
  it&mdash;everybody had fallen for it&mdash;the boobs had been plentiful&mdash;the
  harvest rich. What was the matter with him! He&rsquo;d won&mdash;was winning
  every time the clock ticked. Somebody back there was probably throwing good
  hard coin at him this minute&mdash;the damned fool! Madison threw back his
  head to laugh in derision, for there was mocking, contemptuous laughter in
  his soul&mdash;but the laugh died still-born upon his lips.</p>
  <p>It was fear now&mdash;fear&mdash;staggering, appalling him. He was facing
  something&mdash;<i>something</i>&mdash;his brain did not seem to define it&mdash;a
  something that was cold and stern and immutable, that was omnipotent, that
  embodied awe&mdash;a condemnation unalterable, unchangeable, before which
  he shrank back with his soul afraid. Before him seemed to unfold itself the
  wagon track, the road to the Patriarch&rsquo;s cottage; and he was there
  again, and whispering lips were around him, and men and women and children
  were there, and in front of them, leading them, slithered that twisted, misshapen,
  formless thing&mdash;and now they were upon the lawn, and about him everywhere,
  everywhere, everywhere was a sea of white faces out of which the eyes burned
  like living coals. What power was this that, loosed, had stricken them to
  palsied, moaning things!</p>
  <p>Madison shivered a little&mdash;and a sweat bead oozed out and glistened
  upon his forehead. Hark&mdash;what was that! Clarionlike, clear as the chimes
  of a silver bell, rang now that childish voice&mdash;rang out, and rang out
  again&mdash;and the crutch was gone&mdash;and the lame boy ran, ran&mdash;<i>ran!</i> And
  who was that, that stood before him now&mdash;that golden-haired woman beside
  an empty wheel-chair, whose face was radiant, who cried aloud that she was <i>cured!</i> And
  who were these others of later days, this motley crowd of old and young,
  that passed before him in procession, that cried out the same words that
  golden-haired woman by the wheel-chair had cried&mdash;and cried out: &ldquo;Faith!
  Faith! Faith!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison swept the sweat bead from his forehead with a trembling hand. It
  was a lie&mdash;a lie&mdash;a lie! He had taught them to say that&mdash;but
  it was all bunk&mdash;and all were fools! He could laugh at them, jeer at
  them, mock at them, deride them&mdash;they were his playthings&mdash;and
  faith was his plaything&mdash;and he could laugh at them all!</p>
  <p>And again he raised his head to laugh; and again the laugh was choked in
  his throat, still-born&mdash;<i>Helena was straight!</i> To his temples went
  his twitching hands. Anger raged upon him&mdash;and died in fear. Anger,
  for the instant maddening him, that he should lose her; rage in ungovernable
  fury that the game, his plans, the hoard accumulated, was bursting like a
  bubble before his eyes&mdash;died in fear. No, no; he had not meant to laugh
  or mock&mdash;no, no; not that, not that! What was this loosed titanic power
  that had done these things&mdash;that had brought this change in Helena;
  that had brought a change in the Flopper, transforming the miserable, pitiful,
  whining thief into a man reaching out for decent things; that had wrought
  at least a physical metamorphosis in Pale Face Harry&mdash;that had transfigured
  those three who, in their ugly, abandoned natures then, had hung like vultures
  on his words in the Roost that night! What was this power that he was trifling
  with, that brought him now this cold, dead fear before which he quailed!
  What was this <i>something</i> that in his temerity he had dared invoke&mdash;that
  rose now engulfing him a puny maggot&mdash;that snatched him up and flung
  him headlong, shackled, before this nebulous, terrifying tribunal, where
  out of nothingness, out of a void, the calm, majestic features of the Patriarch
  took form and changed, and changed, and kept changing, and grew implacable,
  set with the stamp of doom. What was it&mdash;in God&rsquo;s name, what was
  it brought these sweat beads bursting to his forehead! Was he going mad&mdash;was
  he mad already!</p>
  <p>And then the cycle again&mdash;doubt, anger, fear&mdash;until his brain,
  exhausted, seemed to refuse its functions; and it was as though, heavy, oppressing,
  a dense fog shut down upon his mind and enveloped it; and now he walked as
  a man in great haste, hurrying, and now his pace was slow, uncertain.</p>
  <p>And so he went on, following the little path that bordered the woods on
  one hand and the fields on the other; went on until he neared the village&mdash;and
  then he stopped suddenly, and turned about. Some one had called his name.</p>
  <p>From the field, a man climbed over the fence and came toward him. The man&rsquo;s
  face was tanned and rugged, his form erect, and the sleeves rolled back above
  the elbows displayed browned and muscular forearms. Madison stared at the
  man apathetically. This was the farm of course where Pale Face Harry boarded,
  and this was Pale Face Harry&mdash;but&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; said Pale Face Harry, and he shuffled his feet and looked
  down, &ldquo;Doc, I got something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to say to you for
  a week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison still gazed at him apathetically&mdash;Pale Face Harry for the moment
  was as some unwarrantable apparition suddenly appearing before him.</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry raised his eyes, lowered them, kicked at a clod of earth
  with the toe of his boot&mdash;and raised his eyes again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through, Doc. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  going to quit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Into Madison&rsquo;s stumbling brain leaped and took form but one idea&mdash;and
  he jumped forward, reaching savagely for Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d throw me, would you! You&rsquo;d throw the game&mdash;would
  you!&rdquo; he snarled, as his fingers locked.</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry, twisting, wriggled free&mdash;and retreated a step.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he gasped&mdash;and then his sentences
  came tumbling out upon each other jerkily, as though he were trying to compress
  what he had to say into as few words as possible and as quickly as he could,
  while he watched Madison warily. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t throwing nothing. I
  just want to quit myself. I keeps my mouth shut&mdash;see? I don&rsquo;t
  want none of the share what&rsquo;s coming. Say, I&rsquo;ve got more&rsquo;n
  a hundred times that out of it. Look at me, Doc! Say, I&rsquo;m like a horse.
  That&rsquo;s the Patriarch and living honest. Say, in all me life I never
  knew what it was before till we comes here. If I took the dough what&rsquo;s
  coming I&rsquo;d go back to the old hell, and I&rsquo;d go down and out again.
  Say, it ain&rsquo;t worth it, there&rsquo;s nothing in it. I ain&rsquo;t
  throwing you, Doc&mdash;I just blows out of here with me trap closed. Say,
  look at me, Doc&mdash;don&rsquo;t you get what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then Madison burst into a peal of wild, strange laughter; and, as though
  no man stood before him, started on along the path&mdash;and Pale Face Harry
  sidled out of his way and stared after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, Doc,&rdquo; he called out, stammering, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
  the matter? &ldquo;</p>
  <p>But Madison made no answer. He heard Pale Face Harry call out behind him;
  in a subconscious, mazed way, he sensed the other following him, gropingly,
  hesitantly, for a few yards, then hold back&mdash;and finally stop.</p>
  <p>The path swerved. Madison went on&mdash;blindly, mechanically, as though,
  once set in motion, he must go on. Some ghastly, unnatural thing was clogging
  his brain; not only in a mental way, but clogging it until there was physical
  hurt and pain, an awful tightness&mdash;something&mdash;if he could only
  reach it with his fingers and claw it away! There was black madness here,
  and a pain insufferable&mdash;a damnable impotence, robbing him of even the
  power, the faculty to think or reason, or to make himself understand in any
  logical degree the meaning or the cause of this thing that sent his brain
  swirling sick.</p>
  <p>He halted. His lips were working; the muscles of his face quivered. And
  suddenly, snatching his hat from his head, he flung himself on the ground
  and plunged face and head, feverishly, tigerishly, into the little brook
  that ran beside the path. Again and again he buried his face in the cold,
  clear, refreshing water&mdash;and then, still on hands and knees, he raised
  his head to listen. Softly, full of a great peace, full of a strange sweetness
  that knew no discord, no strife, the notes of the chapel bell floated across
  the fields. Evening had come; the day&rsquo;s work was done&mdash;it was
  benediction time. It was the call of the faithful&mdash;the Angelus of those
  who believed.</p>
  <p>It came, the revulsion, to Madison in a choked sob&mdash;and he stood up.
  The day&rsquo;s work was done&mdash;here. Here they would go in quiet thankfulness
  each from the farm to his little cottage, each to his simple, wholesome meal,
  each to the twilight hours of gentle communion as they talked to one another
  from their doorways, each to his bed and his rest, tranquil in the love of
  God and of man.</p>
  <p>Madison flung back the dripping hair from his forehead. Strange, the contrast
  that, unbidden, came insistently to him now: The liquid notes of the bell
  wafted sweetly on the evening breeze; the howling, jangling turmoil of the
  city slums, of his familiar haunts where, in mad chaos, reigned the hawkers&rsquo; cries,
  the thunder of the elevated trains, the noisome traffic of the street, the
  raucous clang of trolley bells&mdash;the sweet perfume of the fields, the
  smell of trees, of earth, of all of God&rsquo;s pure things untouched, unsoiled;
  the stench of Chatham Square, the reek of whiskey spilled with the breath
  of obscene, filthy lips&mdash;the little village that he could see beyond
  him, the tiny curls of blue smoke rising like the incense from an altar over
  the roofs of houses whose doors had no locks, whose windows were not barred,
  where plain, homely folk, unsullied, lived at peace with God and the world;
  the closed areaways of the Bowery, the creaking stairs, the dim hallways
  leading to dens of vileness and iniquity where, safe by bolts from interruption,
  crime bred its offsprings and vice was hatched. What did it mean!</p>
  <p>And so he stood there for a little space; then presently he started forward
  again; and presently he reached the village street, walked down its length,
  greeted from every doorway with hearty, unaffected sincerity, and after a
  little while he came to the hotel, and to his room&mdash;and there he locked
  the door.</p>
  <p>Helena was straight&mdash;the words were repeating themselves over and over
  in his brain. He began to pace up and down the room. The words seemed to
  take form and shape in fiery red letters, being scrawled by invisible hands
  upon the walls&mdash;<i>Helena was straight</i>. Straight with Thornton,
  straight with any man&mdash;straight with her Maker. He knew that now&mdash;he
  had read it as a soul-truth in those brave, deep, tear-dimmed eyes. And he
  had <i>lost</i> her! It seemed as though he had become suddenly conscious
  that he was enduring some agony that was never to know an end, that from
  now on must be with him always. He had lost her&mdash;lost Helena.</p>
  <p>From his pocket he drew out his keys and opened his trunks, and took out
  the trays and spread them about. There were very many trays, they nested
  one upon the other&mdash;and they were exceedingly ingenious trays&mdash;false-bottomed
  every one. And now he opened these false-bottoms, every one of them, and
  stood and looked at them. The surest, safest, biggest game he had ever played,
  the game that had known no single hitch, the game that had brought no whispering
  breath of suspicion flung its tribute in his face. Money that he had never
  tried to count, notes of all denominations, large and small, glutted the
  receptacles&mdash;jewels in necklaces, in rings, in pendants, in brooches,
  in bracelets, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, winked at him and scintillated
  and glowed and were afire.</p>
  <p>And he stood and looked upon them. What was it the Flopper had said when
  they had brought the Patriarch back&mdash;he did not remember. What was it
  that Pale Face Harry had said a little while ago&mdash;he did not remember.
  These were jewels here and money&mdash;wealth&mdash;and he had won the greatest
  game that was ever played&mdash;only he had lost her&mdash;lost Helena. And
  he stood and looked upon them&mdash;and slowly there crept to his face a
  white-lipped smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beat!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;Beat&mdash;by
  the game&mdash;I won.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  Face Value</b></h2>
  <p>IT was evening of the same day&mdash;and there came a knock at the outer
  door of the cottage porch.</p>
  <p>The Flopper answered it, and came back to the Patriarch&rsquo;s room; where
  the Patriarch sat in his armchair; where the lamp, turned low, throwing the
  little room into half shadow, burned upon the table; where Helena, far away
  from her immediate surroundings, quite silent and still, her own chair close
  beside the other&rsquo;s, nestled with her head on the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  shoulder.</p>
  <p>Helena looked up as the Flopper returned.</p>
  <p>Upon the Flopper&rsquo;s face was a curious expression&mdash;not one that
  in the days gone by had been habitual&mdash;it seemed to mingle a diffidence,
  a kindly solicitude and a sort of anxious responsibility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Thornton askin&rsquo; fer youse,&rdquo; announced the
  Flopper.</p>
  <p>Helena rose from her chair, and started for the door&mdash;but the Flopper
  blocked the way. Helena halted and looked at him in astonishment.</p>
  <p>The Flopper licked his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Helena,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;if I was youse I wouldn&rsquo;t
  go&mdash;say, I&rsquo;ll tell him youse have got de pip an&rsquo; gone ter
  bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not go?&rdquo; echoed Helena. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper scratched at his chin uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you know!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;De Doc let youse down easy ter-day.
  Say, if youse had piped his lamps when you drives up in de buzz-wagon dis
  afternoon youse wouldn&rsquo;t be lookin&rsquo; fer any more trouble. Say,
  I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; youse straight, Helena. When I was out dere in de
  kitchen an&rsquo; youse was in yer room wid him me heart was in me mouth
  all de time. Youse can take it from me, Helena, he let youse down easy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s brown eyes, a little wistfully, a little softly, held upon
  the Flopper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse had better cut it out ter-night, Helena,&rdquo; the Flopper
  went on. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;oughter know de Doc by dis time&mdash;de guy dat
  starts anything wid de Doc gets his&mdash;dat&rsquo;s all! Remember de night
  he threw Cleggy down de stairs in de Roost?&mdash;an&rsquo; he was only havin&rsquo; fun!
  Say, you go out wid Thornton again ter-night an&rsquo; de Doc finds it out&mdash;an&rsquo; something&rsquo;ll
  happen. Say, Helena, fer God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t youse do it&mdash;de
  Doc was bad enough dis afternoon when he let youse down easy, but he&rsquo;s
  worse now, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Worse?&rdquo; Helena interrupted, smiling a little apathetically. &ldquo;In
  what way is he worse? And how do you know? You haven&rsquo;t seen Doc, have
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Flopper answered, circling his lips with his tongue
  again. &ldquo;No; I ain&rsquo;t seen de Doc since&mdash;but I seen Pale Face.
  Say, Helena&rdquo;&mdash;the Flopper&rsquo;s words came stumbling out now,
  agitated, perturbed, not altogether coherent&mdash;&ldquo;wot&rsquo;s de
  answer I dunno; I dunno wot&rsquo;s de matter here. Say&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed
  suddenly to the Patriarch, whose face was turned toward then as he stroked
  thoughtfully at his silver beard&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s got me fer fair&mdash;dere
  ain&rsquo;t no fake here&mdash;dis way ter live is de real t&rsquo;ing&mdash;he
  ain&rsquo;t like you an&rsquo; me&mdash;he&rsquo;s <i>more&rsquo;n</i> dat&mdash;look
  at him now&mdash;youse&rsquo;d t&rsquo;ink he could see us, an&rsquo; was
  listenin&rsquo; ter wot we said. I dunno wot&rsquo;s de end&mdash;I dunno
  wot&rsquo;s de matter wid me. I was scared more&rsquo;n ever out dere dis
  afternoon on de lawn, an&rsquo; I thought mabbe God &rsquo;ud strike me dead&mdash;but &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
  only dat I&rsquo;m scared ter buck de game any more, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
  only dat&mdash;I don&rsquo;t <i>wanter</i> any more, an&rsquo; it don&rsquo;t
  make no difference about de dough&mdash;I wanter live straight, same as him,
  same as de guys around here, same&mdash;same as Mamie. Say, Helena, say,
  do youse believe in love&mdash;in&mdash;in de <i>real</i> t&rsquo;ing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s apathy was gone now&mdash;a flush dyed her cheeks. She was
  not startled at what the Flopper had said&mdash;she had seen it coming, subconsciously,
  vaguely, mistily, for days now, only she had been immersed in herself&mdash;she
  was not startled, and yet, in a way, she was. The end! She too had been thinking
  about that&mdash;and she too did not know. What <i>was</i> the end?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were going to say something about Pale Face,&rdquo; she said,
  prompting the Flopper. &ldquo;Something about Pale Face and Doc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Flopper, and again the tip of his tongue sought
  his lips nervously. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want youse ter go
  out wid Thornton ter-night; Pale Face has got it de same as me, an&rsquo; he
  told de Doc dis afternoon, out in de path dere, after de Doc left de cottage
  here. Dere was a showdown&mdash;see? De Doc &rsquo;ud kill youse an&rsquo; Thornton
  ter-night if he caught youse tergether. He&rsquo;s like a wild man. When
  Pale Face tells him he was goin&rsquo; ter quit, de Doc makes a grab fer
  him by de t&rsquo;roat like a tiger, only Pale Face gets away, an&rsquo; den
  de Doc goes off widout a word, laughin&rsquo; like he&rsquo;d escaped out
  of a dippy-house. An&rsquo; Pale Face was shakin&rsquo; like he had a fit
  when he gets here. Say, Helena, don&rsquo;t youse go ter-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena made no answer for a moment. Thoughts, a world of them, confused
    her, crowded upon her, as they had ever since Madison had left her room a
    few hours ago&mdash;and the future was as some dread, bewildering maze through
  which she had tried to stumble and grope her way&mdash;and had lost herself
  ever deeper. How full of utter, miserable, bitter irony it was that this
  thing, unscrupulous and shameful, that they had created in their guilt should
  have brought the beauty and the glory and the yearning of a new life to her&mdash;and
  yet should chain her remorselessly to the old! True, she had broken with
  Madison, irrevocably, forever, she supposed, it could not be other than that,
  for the ugly bond between them was severed&mdash;but the game still went
  on! In repentance, on her bended knees, sobbing as a tired and worn-out child,
  she could ask for forgiveness; but the double life, the duplicity, by reason
  of the very nature in which they had fashioned this iniquitous monster, still
  went on, and like some hideous octopus reached out its waving, feeling tentacles
  to encircle her&mdash;the Patriarch there; the world-wide publicity, those
  poor creatures upon whose misery and whose suffering, upon whose frantic,
  frenzied snatching out at hope they had preyed and fed and gorged themselves;
  the life itself that she had taken up, in its minuti&aelig;, in its care
  of this great-souled, great-hearted man so dear to her now, the life itself
  because it was what it was, changed though she herself might be, though her
  soul cried out against it in its new-found purity&mdash;all this still held
  her fast! The end&mdash;she could not see the end. What would Madison do&mdash;and
  there was Thornton. Thornton! She caught her breath a little. Yes; she had
  promised Thornton she would see him to-night&mdash;she knew well enough why
  he wanted to see her&mdash;last night had told her that&mdash;he loved her.
  Her face softened. Last night&mdash;it seemed a thousand years ago, and it
  seemed but as an instant passed&mdash;last night&mdash;she had learned what
  love was, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>The Flopper stirred uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;ll I tell him?&rdquo; asked the Flopper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  waitin&rsquo; out dere by de porch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why nothing,&rdquo; said Helena, and she smiled a little
  tremulously at the Flopper. &ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go
  and see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Helena,&rdquo; protested the Flopper, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t youse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Helena stepped by him now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave the Patriarch,&rdquo; she cautioned, turning on
  the threshold. &ldquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t be late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She passed down the little hall, through the still, quiet room beyond, empty
  now, through the porch, and out into the night&mdash;and then from out the
  shadows by the row of maples, Thornton came hurriedly toward her, holding
  out his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you to come, Miss Vail,&rdquo; he said, in his
  grave, quiet way. &ldquo;You must be nearly dead with weariness after last
  night, and I am afraid I am not very thoughtful&mdash;only I&mdash;&rdquo; he
  broke off suddenly. &ldquo;Shall we sit here on the bench for a little while,
  or would you rather walk&mdash;I&mdash;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was very dark&mdash;the storm of the night before still lingered in a
  wrack of flying clouds, scurrying one after the other, veiling the stars&mdash;and
  the moon was hidden&mdash;and hidden too was the sudden whiteness of Helena&rsquo;s
  face. She knew what he had to say, knew it before she had come to him&mdash;and
  yet she was there&mdash;and she had come resolutely enough&mdash;only now
  she was afraid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would rather walk a little, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here
  where&mdash;where I can be within call. My absence last night seems to have
  made the Patriarch very uneasy, you know, and&mdash;and&mdash;let us just
  walk up and down here beneath the maples in front of the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How heavy upon the air lay the fragrance of the flowers; how still the night
  was, save for the constant muffled boom of the breaking surf!&mdash;for a
  moment an almost ungovernable impulse swept upon her to make some excuse,
  anything, no matter how wild, a sudden faintness, anything, and run from
  him back into the cottage. And then she tried to think, think in a desperate
  sort of way of some subject of conversation that she might introduce that
  would stave off, postpone, defer the words that she knew were even now on
  his lips&mdash;nothing&mdash;she could think of nothing&mdash;only that she
  might have let the Flopper have his way, have let him tell Thornton that
  she had gone to bed with&mdash;the pip. The <i>pip!</i> She could have screamed
  out hysterically as the word flashed all unbidden upon her&mdash;it stood
  for a very great deal that word&mdash;her world of the years of yesterday.
  Could she never get away from that world; was it too late&mdash;already!
  Could she, even with all the earnestness, all the yearning that filled her
  soul, ever live it down, ever be what Naida Thornton had called her that
  night&mdash;a good woman! Could she&mdash;</p>
  <p>Thornton was speaking now&mdash;how strange that she would have done anything,
  given anything to prevent his speaking&mdash;and done anything, given anything
  to make him speak! How strange and perplexed and dismayed her brain was!
  Love! Yes; she wanted love! God knew she wanted love such as his was&mdash;for
  he had shown her what love, free from abasing passion, in its purest sense,
  was. Like a glimpse of glory, hallowed, full of wondrous amazement, it came
  to her&mdash;and then her head was lowered, and the whiteness was upon her
  face again.</p>
  <p>He had halted suddenly and detained her with his hand upon her arm&mdash;with
  that touch, so full of reverence, of fine deference, that had thrilled her
  before&mdash;that thrilled her now, awakening into fuller life these new
  emotions whose birth was in gladder, sweeter, purer aspirations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Vail,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice, &ldquo;there was a letter&mdash;a
  letter that Naida left&mdash;did you know of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They were close together, and it was very dark&mdash;but was it dark enough
  to hide the crimson that she felt sweeping in a flood to her face! What was
  in that letter? Had Mrs. Thornton written as she had talked, or only about
  the Patriarch and the work in Needley? She had forgotten for the moment about
  the letter&mdash;if there were more in it than that, if it were about Thornton
  and herself and what Mrs. Thornton had hoped for between them, and she admitted
  knowledge of it, what would he think, what <i>could</i> he think of her!
  But to deny it&mdash;no, not now. Once, and this came to her in a little
  thrill of gladness, she would not have hesitated; but now it&mdash;it was&mdash;it
  was not that world of yesterday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said faintly; &ldquo;she told me that she had left
  a letter for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If was about the work here,&rdquo; said Thornton gently. &ldquo;Her
  whole soul seemed wrapt up in that&mdash;and she asked me as her last wish
  to do what she would have done if she had lived; and she spoke of you very
  beautifully.&rdquo; Thornton paused for a moment&mdash;then he laid his
  hands on Helena&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;and she felt them tremble a little. &ldquo;Miss
  Vail&mdash;Helena,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was full of passionate earnestness
  now, &ldquo;I cannot say these things well&mdash;only simply. I came back
  here to take an interest in the work, for I too have it at heart&mdash;but
  I have more than that now&mdash;there is <i>you</i>&mdash;your dear self.
  I love you, Helena&mdash;you have come into my life until you are everything
  and all to me. Helena, look up at me&mdash;will you marry me, dear? Tell
  me what I long to hear. Helena, Helena&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Helena did not answer&mdash;only very slowly she raised her head. And
  his hands on her shoulders tightened, and he was drawing her gently toward
  him. Then he bent his head until it was close to hers, and his breath was
  upon her cheek as it had been that other night&mdash;and the longing to know
  that it was hers, a caress, pure in its motive, hers, snatched out of all
  that had gone before that sought to rob her of the right to ever know it,
  fascinated her, held her spellbound, possessed her. Closer his lips came
  to hers, closer, until they touched her&mdash;and then, with a cry, she sprang
  back, and her hands were fiercely pressed against her cheeks, her throbbing
  temples. Was she mad! Mad! Was it for this that she had forced herself to
  give him the opportunity to speak to-night, when her motive was so different,
  when it had seemed the only <i>right</i> thing left for her to do!</p>
  <p>And now, still holding her temples, she raised her eyes to Thornton&mdash;he
  had stepped back like a man stricken, his hands dropped to his sides.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;we are mad!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; he said in a numbed way; and again: &ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; Then,
  with an effort to control his voice: &ldquo;You&mdash;you do not care&mdash;you
  do not love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and thereafter for a long time a silence
  held between them.</p>
  <p>Then Thornton spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some day perhaps, Helena,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you could learn
  to love me&mdash;for I would teach you. Perhaps now you feel that your whole
  duty lies here in this work to which you have so unselfishly given your life;
  but I would not hinder that, only try to help as best I could. Perhaps I
  have been abrupt, have spoken too soon&mdash;it is only a few weeks since
  I saw you first, but it seems as though in those few weeks I had come to
  know you as if I had known you all my life and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But now she interrupted him, shaking her head in a sad little fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not know me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sometimes I think I do
  not know myself. Think! You do not know where I came from to join the Patriarch
  here; you have no single shred of knowledge about me; you do not know a single
  particular of my life before you knew me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not need to know,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;You are
  as genuine as pure gold is genuine&mdash;it is in your voice, your smile,
  your eyes. It is a crude simile perhaps, but one never asks where the pure
  gold was dug&mdash;it stands for itself, for what it is, because it is what
  it is&mdash;pure gold&mdash;at its face value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words seemed to stab at Helena, condemning, accusing; and yet, too,
  in a strange, vague way, they seemed to bring her a hope, a promise for the
  days to come&mdash;at face value! If she could live hereafter&mdash;at face
  value!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was very low. &ldquo;I do
  not know how to say what I must say to you. Last night I knew that&mdash;that
  you loved me. I had not thought of you like that, in that way, until then,
  or&mdash;or I should have tried never to have let this hurt come to you.
  But last night I knew, and since then I have known that sooner or later you
  would&mdash;would tell me of it.&rdquo; She stopped for an instant&mdash;her
  eyes full of tears now. &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she went on presently, &ldquo;I
  have let you speak to-night because it was better, it was even necessary
  that I should do so at once&mdash;because this could not go on&mdash;because
  you must go away and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Necessary?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I&mdash;I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said helplessly; &ldquo;you do not understand&mdash;and
  I&mdash;I cannot explain. Oh, I do not know what to say to you, only that
  you must take what I say, as you have taken me&mdash;at face value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;Helena, I do not
  understand. Are you in trouble&mdash;tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I cannot go away like this!&rdquo; he cried out suddenly. &ldquo;I
  cannot go and leave you, Helena. You have come into my life and filled it;
  and I cannot let you pass out of it&mdash;like this&mdash;without an effort
  to hold what has come to mean everything to me now. You may not love me now,
  but some day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head, interrupting him once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There can never be a &lsquo;some day&rsquo; &rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh,
  I do not want to hurt you&mdash;you, to whom I owe more than you will ever
  know&mdash;but&mdash;but there can never be anything between us, and&mdash;and
  we are only making it harder for ourselves now&mdash;aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then he leaned abruptly toward her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there&mdash;some one else?&rdquo; he asked in a strained voice.</p>
  <p>And to Helena the question came as though it had been an inspiration given
  him&mdash;for after that he would ask no more, seek no more to understand,
  for he was too big and strong and fine for that; and even if it was hopeless
  now this love that she had known for Madison, even if it could never be again,
  still that love was hers, and she could answer truthfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said beneath her breath.</p>
  <p>For a moment Thornton neither moved nor spoke. Then he held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Vail,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;will you tell this &lsquo;some
  one else&rsquo; that another man beside himself is the better for having
  known you. Good-night. And may God bring you happiness through all your life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she did not speak&mdash;they were standing by the rustic bench and she
  sank down upon it, and, with her head hidden in one arm outflung across the
  back of the seat, was sobbing softly.</p>
  <p>And he stood and watched her for a little space, his face grave and white;
  then taking the hand that lay listlessly in her lap, he raised it to his
  lips&mdash;and turned away.</p>
  <p>And so he left her&mdash;and so, because of this, he knocked upon another
  door that night, and all unwittingly gave to that &ldquo;some one else&rdquo; himself
  the message that he had asked Helena to deliver.</p>
  <p>Madison, pacing his room like a caged beast, his teeth working upon the
  cigar that he had never thought to light, paid no attention to the summons
  until it had been repeated twice; then, with a glance around the room, his
  eyes lingering for a critical instant upon the trunks, closed now, the trays
  restored to their hiding places, he stepped to the door, unlocked it, and
  flung it open. And at sight of Thornton, mechanically, as second nature to
  him, outwardly, like a mask, there came a smile upon his working lips, a
  suave, unconcerned composure to his face; while inwardly, in his dazed, fogged
  brain where chaos raged, surged an impulse to fling himself upon the other,
  wreck a mad vengeance upon the man&mdash;and then swift upon the heels of
  this an impulse to refrain, for if Helena was straight why should he harm
  Thornton&mdash;and then the shuttle again&mdash;why should he not&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
  Helena said that she had learned what love was last night&mdash;and last
  night she had been with Thornton. How his brain whirled! What had brought
  Thornton here, anyhow? If he stayed very long perhaps he would batter Thornton
  to jelly after all! Quick, almost instantaneous in their sequence came this
  wild jumble singing dizzily its crazy refrain through his mind&mdash;and
  then to his amazement he heard some one speaking pleasantly&mdash;and to
  his amazement it was himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Thornton. Come in&mdash;and take a chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Thornton answered; and, entering the room, closed
  the door behind him. &ldquo;No; I won&rsquo;t sit down&mdash;I shall only
  remain a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lamp was on the washstand, and, intuitively again, Madison shifted his
  position to bring his face into shadow&mdash;and leaned against the foot
  of the bed. He stared at Thornton, nodding&mdash;Thornton&rsquo;s face was
  white and exceedingly haggard&mdash;rather curious for Thornton to look that
  way!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madison,&rdquo; said Thornton abruptly, &ldquo;I believe you to be
  a gentleman in the best sense of the word, and because of that, and because
  of the unusual circumstances that first brought us together and the mutual
  interests that have since been ours, I have come to you to-night to tell you,
  first, that I am going away from Needley and that I shall not return&mdash;and
  then to ask a service and repose a trust in you. You have said several times
  that you intended to remain here and take a personal and active part in the
  work? &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Madison removed the chewed cigar end from one corner of his mouth&mdash;and
  placed it in the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then this is what I want to say,&rdquo; said Thornton seriously. &ldquo;For
  my own sake, because it was my wife&rsquo;s wish, and for other reasons as
  well, my interest here, though I am going away, will be just as great as
  it has ever been; and so I want you to keep me thoroughly posted, and when
  the time comes that I can be of further material assistance to let me know.
  I impose only one condition&mdash;you are to say nothing to Miss Vail about
  it&mdash;you can make anything that I may do appear to come from yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say nothing to Miss Vail!&rdquo; repeated Madison vaguely&mdash;then
  a sort of ironic jest seemed to take possession of him: &ldquo;But Miss Vail
  keeps all the funds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is why I am asking you to represent me,&rdquo; said Thornton
  quietly. &ldquo;I am afraid that she might have a natural diffidence about
  accepting anything more from me&mdash;I asked Miss Vail to marry me to-night,
  and she refused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cigar kind of slid down unnoticed from the corner of Madison&rsquo;s
  mouth&mdash;and he leaned forward, hanging with a hand behind him to the
  bedpost&mdash;and stared at Thornton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;<i>what!</i>&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I know,&rdquo; Thornton answered&mdash;and moved abruptly toward
  the door. &ldquo;Love makes one&rsquo;s temerity very great&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
  it? I asked her to marry me&mdash;because I loved her.&rdquo; He came back
  from the door and held out his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you what I would
  tell no other man, Madison. You understand now why&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll
  do this for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What answer Madison made he never knew himself&mdash;he only knew that he
  was staring at the door after Thornton had gone out, and that he wanted to
  laugh crazily. Marry Helena! Thornton had asked Helena to marry him because
  he loved her. God, there was humor here! His brain itself seemed to cackle
  at it&mdash;<i>marry</i> Helena!</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000041h-images/page271.jpg" width="850" height="601"></p>
  <p>And then suddenly there seemed no humor at all&mdash;only black, infamous
  shame and condemnation&mdash;and he straightened up from where he leaned
  against the bedpost, his face set and strained. &ldquo;Thornton had asked
  Helena to marry him because he <i>loved</i> her&rdquo;&mdash;the words came
  slowly, haltingly, aloud&mdash;and then he covered his face with his hands.
  But he, he who loved her too&mdash;what had <i>he</i> done!</p>

  <p>FOR a little time Madison stood there in his room, motionless, staring unseeingly
  before him&mdash;and then, as one awakening from a dream that had brought
  dismay and a torment too realistic to be thrown from him on the instant,
  his brain still a little blunted, he took up his hat mechanically, went out
  from the room, descended by the back stairs to the rear door of the hotel,
  and took the road to the Patriarch&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>And as he walked in the freshness of the night, the restless turmoil of
  his soul that since early afternoon had brought him near to the verge of
  madness itself, that had robbed him of sane virility, that a moment since
  in his room had suddenly begun to lift from him even as the leaden clouds
  in the vault above him now were scattering, breaking, and through the rifts
  a moon-glint and the starlight came, passed from him utterly&mdash;and a
  strange calm, a strange joy, a strange sadness was upon him&mdash;and his
  brain for the first time in many hours was rational, keen&mdash;and he was
  master of himself again&mdash;and yet master of himself no more!</p>
  <p>He smiled a little at the seeming paradox&mdash;smiled a little wistfully.
  He was beaten&mdash;by the game&mdash;he had won. How strange it was that
  sense of more than resignation now&mdash;a sense that seemed like one of
  thankfulness&mdash;a sense that bade him fling wide his arms as though suddenly
  they had been loosed from bondage and he was free, free as the God-given
  air around him.</p>
  <p>He could understand Helena, and the Flopper, and Pale Face Harry now. With
  them it had come slowly, in a gradual concatenation, a progression, as it
  were, that had worked upon them, molding them, changing them day by day&mdash;and
  he had been too blind to see, or, seeing, had measured the changes only by
  a standard as false as all his life had been false. With him it had come
  in a crash, unheralded, that had left him a naked, quivering, stricken thing
  to know madness, terror and despair, to taste of emotions that had sickened
  the soul itself.</p>
  <p>On Madison walked&mdash;along the road, across the little bridge, into the
  wagon track where, under the arched branches, it was utter dark. There was
  no one upon the road&mdash;he passed no one&mdash;saw no one&mdash;he was
  alone.</p>
  <p>He had lost Helena&mdash;but he understood her now&mdash;understood the
  depth of remorse that she was living through, the terror and the dread as
  she sought escape, the fear of him&mdash;yes, it would be fear now where
  once it had been love! He had lost Helena&mdash;that was the price he had
  paid&mdash;but he understood her now, and he was going to her to help her
  if he could, going to tell her that he, too, was changed&mdash;as she was
  changed.</p>
  <p>His hands clenched suddenly. God, the misery, the hopelessness, the wreck
  and ruin that lay at his door! And amends&mdash;what amends could he make&mdash;it
  was too late for that! How clearly he saw now&mdash;when it was too late!
  Her life was a broken thing, robbed, stripped and despoiled for all the years
  to come. Their love had not been love&mdash;she had given it its name&mdash;&ldquo;passion,
  vice, lust, sin, degradation and misery and shame.&rdquo; And then love had
  come to her, into her life, love as God had meant love to be, and she had
  learned what love was she had said&mdash;only that she might never know its
  fulness, only that it might bring her added bitterness and added sorrow!
  Thornton had asked her to marry him that night&mdash;and she had refused
  him&mdash;because the past, it must have been as a shuddering, hideous phantom
  that the past had risen before her, had left her no other thing to do but
  turn away. It seemed he could see her&mdash;see her bury her face in her
  hands and&mdash;</p>
  <p>He stopped short in his walk. Was he changed so much as this! Did he care
  so much that it was her happiness&mdash;even with another&mdash;that counted
  most! Yes; it was true&mdash;he was changed indeed. And the change had brought
  him too, it seemed, to learn what love was&mdash;too late.</p>
  <p>He went forward again&mdash;a little more slowly now; a sadness upon him,
  but, through the sadness, an uplift from that new sense of freedom that was
  as a balm, soothing him in the most curious way. His had been a rude awakening&mdash;mind
  and body and soul had been torn asunder; but he knew now, as he recalled
  the hours just past when he had looked on fear, when the gamut of human passion
  had raged over him, when he had stood staggered and appalled before, yes,
  before his God, that he had come forth a new man. And how strange had been
  the ending, how strange and simple, and yet how significant, typifying the
  broad, clean outlook on life, bringing coherency to his tottering mind, had
  been those words of Thornton&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;because he loved her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had reached the end of the wagon track now, and he walked across the
  lawn, his steps noiseless on the velvet sward, and passed between the maples;
  and the moon gleam&mdash;for the flying clouds, rear-guard of the routed
  storm, were flung wide apart, dispersed&mdash;fell upon a coiled and huddled
  little figure all in white, that was quite still and motionless upon the
  rustic seat beside the porch.</p>
  <p>She did not see him, did not hear him, until he stood before her and called
  her name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; he said unsteadily. &ldquo;Helena!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She raised her head and looked at him; and then she rose from the bench,
  and, still holding to it by one hand, drew back a little. There was no outcry,
  no startled action. Her dark eyes played questioningly upon him&mdash;and
  he could see that they were wet with tears, and that the face from out of
  which they looked was very white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why have you come back here to-night?&rdquo; she asked in a low tone;
  and then, suddenly, a fear, a terror in her voice, as the Flopper&rsquo;s
  warning flashed upon her: &ldquo;Thornton&mdash;you have seen Thornton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, surprised a little that she should know; &ldquo;I
  saw Thornton a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She came toward him now and clutched his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; she cried tensely. &ldquo;Answer me! You&mdash;you
  met him on your way here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a moment before Madison replied. He had schooled himself of course
  for more than this, yet the words hurt&mdash;that was why she had asked for
  Thornton&mdash;she was afraid that he had harmed the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I did not meet him. I think you must have
  been longer here on that bench than you imagined&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you?
  He came to my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your room! What for? Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison smiled with grave whimsicality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To call me a gentleman and repose a trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stepped back again, uncertainly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know what you are talking about,&rdquo; she said in a strained
  way. &ldquo;And you are talking very strangely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everything is strange to-night. It is
  like a new world, and&mdash;and I have not found my way&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew back still further.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Not now&mdash;that is past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him for a little time; and, her hands joined before her, her
  fingers locked and interlocked nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and Thornton?&rdquo; she asked, at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a trust,&rdquo; said Madison slowly; &ldquo;but it was betrayed
  before it was given. He did not know&mdash;the game. He did not know what
  was between&mdash;you and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and the word came almost inaudibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will tell you, for it cannot matter
  now in any case. He told me that he had asked you to marry him to-night&mdash;and
  that you had refused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison paused, and swept his hand across his forehead&mdash;his voice somehow
  had suddenly grown hoarse, beyond control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said and reached again for the back of the bench,
  supporting herself against it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is going away,&rdquo; Madison continued; &ldquo;and he is to send
  more money here for the &rsquo;cause&rsquo;&mdash;when I ask for it&mdash;only
  you are not to know, because you might be diffident about taking it after
  refusing him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stared at him numbly&mdash;there was no sarcasm in his words; in his
  tones only a sort of dreary monotony. She shivered a little&mdash;how cold
  it seemed! She did not quite grasp his words&mdash;and yet she shrank from
  them. And then her very soul seemed to cry out against them, to pit itself
  against their meaning, as their meaning surged upon her. And unconsciously
  she drew herself up, and the whiteness of her face fled before a rush of
  color.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the shame of it!&rdquo; she burst out. &ldquo;The bitter shame
  of it! You shall not touch the money&mdash;do you hear! You shall not touch
  it! I&mdash;I thought that you had understood this afternoon. I am glad then
  that you have come to-night&mdash;if I must say more to make you understand.
  This is the end! I do not care what happens&mdash;the little I can do now
  to atone for what I have done, I am going to do. The game is at an end&mdash;you
  shall not touch another cent&mdash;and everything that we have taken goes
  back to those whom we have worse than robbed it from! You hear&mdash;you
  understand! I will cry it out in the town street if there is no other way&mdash;but
  it shall stop&mdash;it shall stop to-night&rdquo;&mdash;she was panting,
  breathless, the little figure erect, outraged, quivering&mdash;and then suddenly
  the shoulders seemed to droop, the lips to tremble, and she was on her knees
  upon the grass beside the bench, and sobbing as a child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; Madison said hoarsely. &ldquo;Helena! Listen! That
  is what I came for to-night&mdash;to find a way out for you, for us all,
  if I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The passionate outburst passed&mdash;and she was on her feet again, facing
  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are clever&mdash;clever!&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;But
  you shall not play with me&mdash;you shall not trick me&mdash;I meant every
  word I said!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But now Madison made no answer. The moonlight bathed them both in its clear,
  white radiance; and touched the sward, shading it to softest green; and the
  trees limned out like fairy things against the night; and the calm light
  flooded the little cottage with its hidden walls where the ivy and the creepers
  grew, and lingered over the trellises to drink the fragrance of the flowers
  that peeped out from their leafy beds. And upon Madison&rsquo;s face crept
  slowly the anguish that was in his soul&mdash;until it was mirrored there&mdash;until
  unconsciously it answered her where words would have been useless things.
  Like some white-robed, sorrowing angel, she seemed, as she stood there before
  him&mdash;the brown eyes full of shadow, troubled; the sweet face tear-splashed;
  the little figure in its simple muslin frock, pitiful in its brave defiance.
  And pure&mdash;just God, how pure she looked!&mdash;the brow stainless white
  under the mass of dark, coiled hair; the perfect throat of ivory. And&mdash;and
  the misery that was in every feature of her face, in every line of her poise&mdash;and
  he had brought her that&mdash;<i>he</i> had brought her to that&mdash;and
  now when he loved her as he might have loved her once and known her love
  in return, when his heart cried out for her, when she was all in life he
  cared for, she was gone from him, out of his life, and between them was a
  barrier he could never pass&mdash;a barrier of his own raising.</p>
  <p>And so he made no answer, for indeed he had not heard her; but she was coming
  toward him now, her hands outstretched in a wondering way, wistfully, pleadingly,
  as though to hold back a refutation that would change the dawning light upon
  her face to dismay and grief again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it is true,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;It has come to you
  too&mdash;this change, this new life that has come to me. It is true&mdash;I
  can see it in your face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; it is true,&rdquo; he answered, in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; she whispered&mdash;and hid her face in her hands&mdash;and
  presently he heard her sob again.</p>
  <p>A tiny cloud edged the moon, and the light faded, and it grew dark, and
  the darkness hid her; then softly, timidly almost it seemed, the radiance
  came creeping through the branches overhead again&mdash;and then he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; he said, steadying his voice with an effort, &ldquo;you
  spoke of atonement a little while ago; but there is no atonement that I can
  make to you&mdash;nothing that I can do to change what I would give my soul
  to change. I know what it meant to you to send Thornton away to-night, for
  I love you now as you love him&mdash;I know why you did it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was staring at him a little wildly&mdash;her hands pressed against her
  cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love&mdash;Thornton,&rdquo; she repeated in a sort of wondering way,
  a long pause between the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said gently; &ldquo;I know. Have you forgotten what
  you told me this afternoon?&mdash;that you had learned&mdash;last night&mdash;what
  love was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not love Thornton,&rdquo; she said in a monotone. &ldquo;And
  yet it is true that through him I learned what love was, what it <i>could</i> be&mdash;don&rsquo;t
  you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Understand! No; it seemed that he could never understand! She did not love
  Thornton! And then, as some fiery cordial, the words seemed to whip through
  his veins, quickening the beat of his heart into wild, tumultuous throbbing.
  Yes, yes, he could understand&mdash;it was true&mdash;true&mdash;she did
  not love Thornton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;and stretched out his arms to her. &ldquo;I
  thought, oh, God, I thought that I had lost you&mdash;Helena!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she did not move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does it matter to you whether I love Thornton or not?&rdquo; she
  said dully. &ldquo;Does it change anything where you and I are concerned&mdash;does
  it change what I told you this afternoon&mdash;that I would not go back to <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To that! Ah, no!&rdquo; his voice rang dominant, vibrant, triumphant
  now. &ldquo;Helena, don&rsquo;t you understand? We are to begin life again&mdash;in
  a new way, the true way, the only way. Don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still she did not move&mdash;but there was a great whiteness in her face,
  and in the whiteness a great light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean?&rdquo;&mdash;her lips scarcely seemed to form the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yes; to make a home for you, to marry
  you if only you love me still, to live in God&rsquo;s own sight and hold
  you as a sacred gift&mdash;Helena! Helena!&rdquo;&mdash;his arms went out
  to her again, and the yearning in his soul was in his voice&mdash;to crush
  her to him, to hold her in his arms, and hold her there where none should
  take her from him, to shield and guard her through the years to come, to
  live with her a life that seemed to break now in a vista of gladness, of
  glory, as the day-dawn breaks with its golden rays of God-given promise&mdash;the
  new life, perfect and pure and innocent&mdash;because he loved her. &ldquo;Helena!
  Speak to me. Tell me that it is not too late&mdash;tell me that you love
  me too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then her eyes were raised to his, and they were wet&mdash;but there
  was love-light and a wondrous happiness shining through the tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; he murmured brokenly&mdash;and swept her into his
  arms&mdash;and kissed the eyelids, lowered now, the hair, the white brow,
  the lips&mdash;kissed her, and held her there, her clinging arms about his
  neck, her face half hidden on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>And so for a space they stood there&mdash;and there were no words to say,
  only the song in their hearts in deathless melody&mdash;but after a little
  time he held her from him, and lifted up her face that he might look his
  fill upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot understand it all yet&mdash;it
  is as though it were born out of the sin and the darkness and the blackness
  of what is gone&mdash;as though here at this Shrine that we created in mockery
  and crime it was meant that you and I should save each other for each other.
  And yet this Shrine as we have made it is a thing of guilt, and it has brought
  us all, you and I, and Harry, and the Flopper to a new life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She lay still for a moment in his arms&mdash;then her hand crept up and
  touched his forehead and smoothed back his hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not quite know how to say it,&rdquo; she said a little timidly. &ldquo;When
  you went away this afternoon, the Patriarch took me back into his room, and&mdash;and
  I knelt at his knees&mdash;and after a little while my mind seemed very calm
  and quiet&mdash;do you know what I mean? And I tried to think things out&mdash;and
  understand. And it seemed to come to me that there was a shrine everywhere
  if we would only look for it&mdash;that God has put a shrine in every heart,
  only we are so blind&mdash;that every one can make their own surroundings
  beautiful and good and true, no matter where they are, or how poor, or how
  rich&mdash;and if they live like that they must be good and true themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly; then, after a moment: &ldquo;And faith
  too is very much like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only some need a sign,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>There was silence again, while her hand crept over his face and back to
  his forehead to smooth his hair once more&mdash;and then very gently she
  slipped out of his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are we to do about&mdash;about everything here?&rdquo; she
  asked soberly. &ldquo;We are forgetting that in our own happiness. How are
  we going to return the money that we have taken?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
  thought much about it&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll manage somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought a great deal about it since yesterday&mdash;and
  I&rsquo;m not so sure it is to be &lsquo;managed somehow&rsquo;&mdash;and
  the more I&rsquo;ve thought the more tangled and complicated it has become.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll untangle it to-morrow,&rdquo; said Madison, with
  a smile, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;she touched his sleeve. &ldquo;To-night. Let us do
  it now&mdash;to-night. I should be so happy then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He smiled at her again, and drew her to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we ought to have Pale Face and the Flopper too, don&rsquo;t you
  think so?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and so we will. The Flopper is
  here, and we can send him for Harry. It&rsquo;s early yet&mdash;not ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Madison; &ldquo;if you wish it. We&rsquo;ll
  go in then and get the Flopper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so they walked to the cottage door, and into the porch&mdash;but in
  the porch Madison held her for a moment, and lifted up her face again and
  looked into her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;wife,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;and took her in his arms.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  The Way Out</b></h2>
  <p>STRANGE scene indeed! Strange antithesis to that other night when these
  four were gathered in that crime-reeked, sordid room at the Roost&mdash;where
  Pale Face Harry, gaunt, emaciated, coughed, and, trembling, plunged a morphine
  needle in his arm; where the Flopper, a wretched tatterdemalion from the
  gutter, licked greedy lips and gloated in his rascality; where Helena, flushed-faced,
  inhaled her interminable cigarettes and dangled her legs from the table edge;
  where Madison, suave, flippant, so certain of his own infallibility, glorying
  in his crooked masterpiece, laid the tribute to genius at his own feet!</p>
  <p>Strange scene! Strange antithesis indeed! It was quiet here&mdash;very still&mdash;only
  the distant, muffled boom of the pounding surf. And the shrine-room, for
  the first time since its creation, was locked against the night. It lay now
  in shadow from the single lamp upon the table&mdash;and the light, where
  it fell in a shortened circle, for the lamp itself had a little green paper
  shade, was soft, subdued and mellow.</p>
  <p>Where he had been wont to sit in the days gone by, the Patriarch sat now
  in his armchair by the empty fireplace&mdash;in the shadow&mdash;his head
  turned in his strange, listening, attentive way toward the table&mdash;toward
  the four who were grouped around it. There had been no one to stay with him
  in his own room, and so Helena had brought him there&mdash;to play his silent
  part.</p>
  <p>At the table, Pale Face Harry, bronzed and rugged, clear-eyed, a robust
  figure from his clean living, his months of the out-of-doors, traced the
  grain of the wood on the table mechanically with his finger nail, his face
  sober, perplexed; while the Flopper, clear-eyed too, his face almost a handsome
  one in its bright alertness, now that it had rounded out and the hard, premature
  lines were gone, mirrored Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s perturbed expression, his
  eyes fixed anxiously on Madison opposite him; and Helena, sitting beside
  Madison, was very quiet, her forehead wrinkled and pursed up into little
  furrows, the brown eyes with a hint of dismay and consternation lurking in
  their depths, one hand stretched out to lay quite unconsciously on Madison&rsquo;s
  sleeve&mdash;and from the sleeve to steal occasionally into Madison&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>
  <p>Madison, his lips tight, pushed back his chair suddenly&mdash;they had been
  sitting there an hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were right, Helena,&rdquo; he said, with a nervous laugh. &ldquo;The
  more you try to figure it out the worse it gets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, say, Doc,&rdquo; pleaded the Flopper desperately, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  youse give it up&mdash;youse have got de head&mdash;youse ain&rsquo;t never
  left us in a hole yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison looked at him, and smiled mirthlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My head!&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly. &ldquo;I got you into this,
  all of you&mdash;but it will take more than my head to get you out. If I
  could stand for it myself, I&rsquo;d do it&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t without
  dragging you in too&mdash;we&rsquo;re too intimately mixed up. If I said
  it was a deal of mine&mdash;they&rsquo;d ask where Helena came from&mdash;they&rsquo;d
  ask where you came from, Flopper. We&rsquo;re beaten&mdash;beaten every way
  we turn. The game has got us&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t a move. We played it
  to the limit, the slickest swindle that was ever worked, and it worked till
  there&rsquo;s more money than I&rsquo;ve tried to count. And then it changed
  us from thieves, from&mdash;from anything you like&mdash;and now that we
  want to quit, now that we want a chance to make good, it&rsquo;s got us in
  its grip and we can&rsquo;t get away.&rdquo; He flirted a bead of moisture
  from his forehead. &ldquo;My God, I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo; he
  muttered hoarsely. &ldquo;It was easy enough to <i>talk</i> about stopping
  this thing, about returning the money&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t see the way
  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one answered him&mdash;all were silent&mdash;as silent as the mute and
  venerable figure that sat, listening attentively it seemed, in the armchair
  by the fireplace.</p>
  <p>Madison turned abruptly after a moment to Pale Face Harry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, Harry,&rdquo; he said, laying a hand on the other&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
  the only one of the four that can walk out of it&mdash;you don&rsquo;t show
  in the center of the stage&mdash;you go. You said the old folks would cry
  over you&mdash;twenty years is a long time to stay away from the old folks&mdash;I&mdash;I
  never knew mine. You go on back to the little farm out there in the West
  where you said you&rsquo;d like to go, and&mdash;and give the old people
  a hand for the years they&rsquo;ve got left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God knows I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; he said, choking a little; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
  what I counted on. God knows I&rsquo;d like to go out there and lead a decent
  life&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t go that way&mdash;I don&rsquo;t crawl out and
  leave you&mdash;what&rsquo;s coming to you is coming to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t help us any, Harry,&rdquo; said Madison softly,
  and his hand tightened in an eloquent pressure on Pale Face Harry&rsquo;s
  shoulder. &ldquo;You go&mdash;and God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Pale Face Harry shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I stick. If the game&rsquo;s got you,
  it&rsquo;s got me too&mdash;to the limit. There&rsquo;s no use talking about
  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Flopper licked his lips miserably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Hell wasn&rsquo;t never like
  dis! Me an&rsquo; Mamie we&rsquo;ve got it fixed, an&rsquo; her old man says
  he&rsquo;ll take me inter de store. Say, Doc, say&mdash;ain&rsquo;t dere
  a chanst ter live straight now we wants ter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Madison did not hear the Flopper save in a vague, inconsequential way&mdash;he
  was looking at Helena. She had drooped forward a little over the table, her
  chin in her hands, her lips quivering&mdash;and a white misery in her face
  seemed to bring a chill, a numbness to his heart. His hands clenched, and
  he began to pace up and down the room.</p>
  <p>How buoyantly he had tackled the problem&mdash;buoyant in his own emancipation,
  buoyant in his love, in the future full of dreams, full of inspiration, full
  of the new life that Helena and he would live together! How confidently he
  had settled himself to undo in a moment the work of months, to outline a
  mere matter of detail, with never a thought that he was face to face with
  a problem that he could never solve&mdash;that brought him to the realization
  that the game, not he, was the master still, iron-handed, implacable&mdash;that
  though the mental chains were loosed it was but as if, in ironic justice,
  in grim punishment, only that he might look, clear-visioned, upon the ignominy
  of the physical shackles he himself had forged and fashioned so readily,
  whose breaking now was beyond his strength.</p>
  <p>He had done his work well! In the first few moments, an hour ago, when he
  had begun to consider the problem, as seeming difficulties arose,he had turned
  coolly from one alternative to another. And then slowly a sickening sense
  of the truth had begun to dawn upon him&mdash;and like a man lost in a great
  forest, peril around him, he had plunged then desperately in this direction
  and in that, as a glimmering point of light here or there had seemed to promise
  an avenue of escape&mdash;only to find it vanish at almost the first step,
  the way closed as by some invisible, remorseless power. No, not invisible&mdash;it
  seemed to take the form of the Patriarch&mdash;for at every turn the majestic
  figure stood and would not let him pass.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s face was gray now as he walked up and down the room&mdash;there
  was his own revulsion, his abhorrence at the part he had played, a frantic,
  honorable eagerness to be rid of it; there were these others too who looked
  to him, the Flopper and Pale Face Harry; and there was&mdash;Helena! He did
  not dare to look at the misery in her face again&mdash;he was unmanned enough
  now.</p>
  <p>And then Helena spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it seems,&rdquo; she said, in a low broken way, &ldquo;as
  if&mdash;as if God did not want to pardon us&mdash;as if our repentance had
  come too late, and that there was no Eleventh Hour for us.&rdquo; Then, in
  passionate pleading, facing Madison: &ldquo;God cannot mean that&mdash;it
  is we who cannot see. There is some way out&mdash;there must be&mdash;there <i>must</i> be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It begins and ends with the Patriarch,&rdquo; said Madison monotonously. &ldquo;We
  can&rsquo;t sacrifice him&mdash;can we! What&rsquo;s the use of going over
  it again? It all comes back to the same point&mdash;the Patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I know, I know,&rdquo; she said piteously. &ldquo;But think,
  Doc&mdash;<i>think!</i> See now, we just send back all the money and jewels&mdash;we
  know to whom they belong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what reason do we give?&rdquo; Madison said heavily. &ldquo;The
  Patriarch is alive and well. The immediate corollary is that from the moment
  we do that, to-morrow morning for instance, every gift, every offering here
  is suddenly refused. What reason do we give? If it were only the donors who
  were to be considered it might be done. It&rsquo;s human nature that ninety-nine
  out of every hundred of them&rdquo;&mdash;his voice rose a little bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;would
  probably be only too glad to get their money back&mdash;and the mere statement
  that you, as the Patriarch&rsquo;s grand-niece, his only relative, on mature
  thought did not consider the project as planned advisable might suffice.
  But this thing goes beyond that, beyond even the remaining few who are earnestly
  interested and would cause us trouble&mdash;it is worldwide in its publicity!
  Every newspaper in the land would snatch at it for a headline, and ask&mdash;why?
  And they would not be content with simply asking why&mdash;this thing is
  too big for that&mdash;too much before the people&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;too
  good &lsquo;copy.&rsquo; They&rsquo;d start in to find out&mdash;and the
  result is inevitable. Our safety so far has lain in the fact that there has
  been no suspicion aroused; but snooping around a bank vault at midnight with
  a mask on and a bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern fades to a whisper as a suspicion-arouser
  compared with anybody willingly coughing up a bunch of money once they&rsquo;ve
  got their claws on it&mdash;and a yellow journal, let alone an army corps
  of them, on the scent of a possible sensation has all the detective bureaus
  in the country pinned to the ropes&mdash;they&rsquo;d have us uncovered quicker
  than I like to think about it&mdash;and that means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stopped, and with a hurried motion carried his hands across his eyes&mdash;Helena,
  pure as one of God&rsquo;s own angels now, to come to that, to come to&mdash;</p>
  <p>It was the Flopper who completed the sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten spaces up de river,&rdquo; said the Flopper, and shivered, and
  his tongue sought his lips; &ldquo;or mabbe&mdash;mabbe twenty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pale Face Harry stirred uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the other way,&rdquo; he said without looking up, his
  eyes on his finger nail that traced the grain of the wood again. &ldquo;Get
  the money and the sparklers all done up and addressed to the ones they came
  from, send &rsquo;em off in a bunch to Thornton&mdash;and we fly the coop
  before he gets them, disappear, fade away&mdash;and take our chances of getting
  caught.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; den it&rsquo;s all off wid me an&rsquo; Mamie&rdquo;&mdash;the
  Flopper&rsquo;s face grew hard. &ldquo;Nix on dat! Dat don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot do that, Harry,&rdquo; said Helena, in a tired voice. &ldquo;There
  is&mdash;the Patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madison, beginning his stride up and down the room
  again. &ldquo;After all, whether we could give back the money without being
  caught, or whether we couldn&rsquo;t, is not the vital thing; there is&mdash;the
  Patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s eyes were on the silent figure in the shadows by the fireplace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If if it were not for him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think that perhaps&mdash;perhaps
  I might be brave enough to confess it all, and&mdash;and not try to escape
  from the punishment that I deserve. But he would know&mdash;he cannot see,
  nor hear, nor speak, but he would know&mdash;as he seems so strangely, so
  wonderfully, so supernaturally to know and understand everything. And, oh,
  he means so much to me, to us all, for it is he, more than any one else,
  who has saved us from&mdash;from what we were. And he loves us. It would
  shatter his faith, ruin all that his life has meant to him, and&mdash;and
  we cannot bring him grief and sorrow like that. Oh, what can we do! What <i>can</i> we
  do! We cannot stop&mdash;and we cannot go on! We cannot stay here even if
  we returned the money successfully, and we cannot stay here if we kept it
  as it is; for things would still have to go on as they are, even if we didn&rsquo;t
  mean to steal any more, no matter what we might say or do, for it&rsquo;s
  beyond our control now, and to stay means that we should still have to live
  and lead our double lives, still have to practise hypocrisy and deceit, and&mdash;and
  I cannot&mdash;we cannot do that any more. And the only way to get away from
  it all is to run away&mdash;and we can&rsquo;t do that, either! There is&mdash;the
  Patriarch. We cannot leave him&mdash;to break his heart&mdash;with none he
  loves to care for him. We can&rsquo;t do that. He is a very old, old man,
  and&mdash;and I think he has been happy with us, and&mdash;and we must make
  him happy always as long as he lives. We cannot go away and leave him. We
  can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Then, in a heartbroken, despairing cry: &ldquo;We
  can&rsquo;t do&mdash;<i>anything!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one answered her. She had begged Madison to go over it all again&mdash;and
  she had summed it up herself. There was&mdash;the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>There was utter silence in the room now, save only for that low, solemn
  boom of distant surf&mdash;for Madison had stopped his nervous pacing up
  and down, and stood now by the Patriarch&rsquo;s armchair gazing into the
  fireplace.</p>
  <p>The minutes passed, and the silence in that dim, shadowed room grew tense&mdash;and
  tenser still&mdash;until the very shadows themselves, as the lamp flickered
  now and then, seemed to creep and shift and readjust themselves in stealth.
  No sound&mdash;no movement&mdash;utter stillness&mdash;only, from without,
  the mourning of the surf, like a dirge now.</p>
  <p>And then, with a sudden sob, Helena flung out her arms across the table
  toward the Patriarch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if he could only speak!&rdquo; she cried pitifully. &ldquo;If
  he could only speak&mdash;he would show us the way out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words seemed to come to Madison as an added pang. He turned his eyes
  instinctively from the fireplace to the Patriarch beside him&mdash;and then,
  a moment, as a man stricken, he stood there&mdash;and then reaching quickly
  for the lamp from the table he held it up, and leaned forward toward the
  figure in the chair.</p>
  <p>Helena, startled at the act, rose almost unconsciously to her feet, her
  hands holding tightly to the table edge&mdash;looking at Madison, looking
  at the silent form where Pale Face Harry, where the Flopper looked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked tensely, under her breath.</p>
  <p>Madison&rsquo;s lips moved&mdash;silently. His face was white, ashen&mdash;there
  was no color in it. Then his lips moved once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The way out,&rdquo; he said; and again, in a low, awed way: &ldquo;<i>The
   way out.</i> We can make restitution now&mdash;we can give it all back&mdash;he <i>has</i> shown
   us the way out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helena&rsquo;s lips were quivering, tears were dimming the brown eyes, trembling
  on the lashes, as she stepped now to Madison&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is God who has shown us the way out,&rdquo; she whispered brokenly&mdash;and
  dropping down before the chair, her little form shaken with sobs, she hid
  her face on the Patriarch&rsquo;s knees.</p>
  <p>And serene and peaceful as a child in sleep, a smile like a benediction
  on the saintly face, the Patriarch sat in his armchair by the fireplace where
  he had been wont to sit in years gone by&mdash;and so he had passed on.</p>
  <p>The Patriarch was dead.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  Vale!</b></h2>
  <p>THE years have passed&mdash;but in their passing have brought few changes
  to the little village nestling in the Maine pines that border on the sea.
  Not many changes&mdash;it is as though Time had touched it loath to touch
  at all; as though some spirit lingering there, sweet and fresh and vernal,
  had bade Time stay its hand.</p>
  <p>Not many changes&mdash;the same familiar faces gather around the stove in
  the hotel office; and, neither as a memory, nor yet as of one who has gone,
  but as if he were amongst them, living still, they speak of the Patriarch
  as of yore.</p>
  <p>And with this little circle of kindly, simple folk Time has dealt gently
  too, for there is only one who is no more&mdash;Cale Rodgers, the proprietor
  of the general store.</p>
  <p>But the general store on the village street still flourishes, and in Cale
  Rodgers&rsquo; place is one whose speech is still a marvelous thing in staid
  old New England ears&mdash;it is an Irish brogue perhaps, for his name is
  Michael Coogan. There are little Coogans too, and Mamie is a happy wife.
  And to the Coogans come sometimes letters from a far-western farm to say
  that things are well and that prosperity has come to one who signs himself&mdash;facetiously
  it always seems to Mamie who reads the letters to her husband&mdash;as Pale
  Face Harry.</p>
  <p>And so the years have passed, and it is summer time again. The fields are
  green; the trees in leaf; the flowers in bloom. And there are visitors who
  have come again to the scenes of yesterday&mdash;a man and woman&mdash;and
  between them a sturdy little lad of eight. They stop at the end of the wagon
  track and look out across the lawn.</p>
  <p>It is still and peaceful, tranquil&mdash;and to them comes the soft, low
  murmur of the surf. Slowly they walk across the lawn, and pass beneath the
  splendid maples&mdash;and pause again.</p>
  <p>The cottage is like some poet&rsquo;s fancy, hidden shyly in its creepers
  and its vines; and seems to speak and breathe in its simple beauty of the
  gentle soul who once had lived there&mdash;and loved his fellow-men. It is
  as it always was, open, free for all to pass within who wish to enter; for
  loving hands have cared for it, and grateful purses, opened to its needs,
  have kept it as&mdash;a Shrine.</p>
  <p>But they do not enter now, for Madison points to where the sunlight, as
  it glints through the trees at the far end of the cottage, falls on a slender
  shaft of marble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us go there, Helena,&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
  <p>And so they walked that way, past the trellises laden with flowers, past
  the end of the cottage, and presently they stopped again where, beneath the
  maples&rsquo; shade, rises the pure white stone&mdash;and beyond it is the
  sweep of the eternal sea.</p>
  <p>Madison, his hair streaking just a little gray at the temples now, removed
  his hat and his face softened, saddened, as he read the simple inscription:</p>
  <p align="center">THE PATRIARCH</p>
  <p>The boy glanced at his father a little wonderingly&mdash;and then spelt
  out the words. He shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that means,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What does
  that word mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madison patted his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You tell him, Helena,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and came and stood beside
  her.</p>
  <p>And so Helena told the boy in simple language as much of the Patriarch&rsquo;s
  story as she thought he could understand&mdash;and when she had finished
  the boy&rsquo;s face was aglow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And!&rdquo; he said breathlessly, &ldquo;and&mdash;and did he ever
  do a really, truly-truly miracle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence for an instant&mdash;then a tender smile came trembling
  to Helena&rsquo;s lips, and into the brown eyes crept the love-light, as
  she reached out to Madison and her hand found his and held it very tightly.</p>
  <p>And Madison bent and kissed her; and drew the little lad between them and
  laid his hand on the boy&rsquo;s head, and answered for Helena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and some day when you are a man
  you will understand how great a miracle it was.&rdquo; </p>
