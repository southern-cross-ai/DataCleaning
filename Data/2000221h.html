  <h3 align="center"><b>by<br>

  <p align="center"><i>Photographs reproduced by permission of Professor A. J.
      Krolopp, representing the Royal Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture.</i></p>
  <p align="center"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Windsor Magazine,&rdquo; December
      1908.</i></p>
  <p>I should have called him peasant proprietor, for, properly speaking, there
    is no such thing as a Hungarian farmer in the English acceptance of the term.</p>
  <p>Estates in Hungary are of very large dimensions, and are farmed in their
    entirety by the seigneur or lord who owns them. No portions of them are ever
    let&mdash;on lease or otherwise&mdash;at fixed rentals.</p>
  <p>To understand thoroughly, however, the position of the modern Magyar peasant
    proprietor, it is necessary to throw a brief glance into his past history.</p>
  <p>Until the middle of the last century, the peasantry&mdash;<i>i.e</i>.,the
    rural population of the country&mdash;was under the suzerainty of the seigneur
    who owned the land, descendants, all of them, of the ancient Magyar families.
    The word &ldquo;serf,&rdquo; which naturally springs to the Anglo-Saxon mind
    in connection with this fact, is not, however, strictly applicable to the
    then condition of the Hungarian peasant.</p>
  <p>The house he lived in certainly belonged to his lord, who also gave him
    and his entire family food and clothing, looked after them when they were
    sick, and saw to their being baptised, married, and buried, all in due course.
    In exchange for this, the labour of their hands belonged to the seigneur&mdash;men
    and women alike had to work for him, according as he required their services,
    and, strictly speaking, the peasant was in bondage to this extent, that he
    could not leave the homestead provided for him by his lord, nor his native
    village, for he and his family would have starved elsewhere. There was, under
    such circumstances, of course, no demand for hired labour, and the Hungarian
    peasant has always been totally unfit by nature and temperament for any kind
    of commercial pursuits.</p>
  <p>At the same time, he was free enough to go, his daughter was at liberty
    to marry whom she pleased, there was nothing here of the brutality and degradation
    of that semi-slavery which in Eastern Europe was termed serfdom.</p>
  <p>But this old order of things changed during the first half of the nineteenth
    century, when the State compulsorily bought up the villages from the seigneurs
    who owned them.</p>
  <p>They were then villages only in name, rows of cottages extending in single
    file on each side of the country roads: the State now organised them into
    Communes, with a rural mayor at the head of affairs, to act as magistrate
    and registrar when required: it also took over the roads, and subsequently
    built the schools.</p>
  <p>The cottages thus acquired by the State were given freehold to the peasantry
    who dwelt in them. The Hungarian peasant pays no rent, he owns the house
    in which he lives, but he pays taxes to the Government, who gives him the
    house.</p>
  <p>And taxes mean money.</p>
  <p>Up to this time the peasant had had no use for coin of the realm. He received
    everything from his lord, in exchange for the work of his hands.</p>
  <p>Now he was free, his time was his own, he was absolutely independent, but
    twice a year the mayor collected taxes from him on behalf of the Government,
    who had done so much for him.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000221h-images/image02.jpg" width="850" height="495"></p>
  <p>The lord, on the other hand, still needed hands to work on his estate, and
    the same peasant, whose work was paid for by shelter, food, and clothing,
    now became a hired labourer with a monthly wage paid in coin.</p>
  <p>The evolution after that was only what could be expected; capabilities and
    temperament very soon began to assert themselves. The natural differences
    of character varied the conditions of all these people, who had started their
    new life on exactly the same economic basis.</p>
  <p>The intelligent labourer commanded higher wages than the lout, the thrifty
    housewife put a few coppers by, where her neighbour barely eked out her husband&rsquo;s
    pittance.</p>
  <p>Within a very few years of their emancipation there was already such a thing
    as a rich peasant and a poor one&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., one who had savings at
    the local savings-bank, and one who had none.</p>
  <p>Then there was gradually developed in the entire Magyar peasantry that wonderful,
    inalienable characteristic which is its chief feature to-day: and that is
    an ardent, obstinate desire to own a bit of land.</p>
  <p>They were still hired labourers all of them. The seigneurs either farmed
    their own estates or let them in their entirety. Farming on a small scale
    would never pay in a country where corn grown on enormous tracts, and horses
    bred in large quantities for military purposes, are the chief sources of
    revenue.</p>
  <p>In spite of his savings in the local agrarian bank, even the richest peasant
    had not sufficient substance to take over the lease of an estate of five
    or six thousand acres. Nor would he have cared to do so. The Magyar peasant
    wanted to <i>own</i> land, not to pay rent for it.</p>
  <p>It is within the last ten years that a new phase in the evolution of the
    agrarian population of the country has taken place. The agrarian banks, realising
    the intense desire of the peasant for actual ownership of the land, together
    with his want of substance to buy the large estates which occasionally come
    into the market, devised the system, which at the present moment is called <i>parzellirung</i>.</p>
  <p>It is simple enough. A seigneur desires to sell his estate, the Jew middleman&mdash;for
    initiative and enterprise in Eastern Europe always come from the Jews&mdash;finds
    out the lowest price which the owner will take. The local agrarian bank&mdash;backed
    by one or more important banks from the capital&mdash; buys the four or ten
    or twenty thousand acres in the market, money down, cuts them up into small
    portions of from fifty to a hundred acres, and sells these small holdings
    to the peasants.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000221h-images/image03.jpg" width="850" height="420"></p>
  <p>Not only that: the benevolent agrarian bank goes one better, for the wealth
    of the peasants consists at best but of a few savings, so the same bank which
    is now selling off the land lends to the purchaser the money with which to
    buy it, and thus becomes seller and mortgagee at one and the same time.</p>
  <p>The peasant, eager to possess, will pay almost any price for the land he
    wants, more especially as he only pays for it on paper. And, strangely enough,
    he makes his small holding pay.</p>
  <p>He hires no labour, breeds no cattle, nor does he keep an overseer or buy
    expensive machinery. He works his own land himself, and harnesses his wife
    and daughters to the plough if necessary.</p>
  <p>The family do the entire work of the farm, and when harvest is over, the
    local Jewish trader buys his surplus produce from the farmer: with the ready
    money thus received the latter pays the interest to the bank. Otherwise he
    has practically no need of money.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000221h-images/image04.jpg" width="850" height="719"></p>
  <p>As the actual village is probably some distance from his new holding, he
    builds himself a house on his small property, buying for a few coppers the
    mud bricks which are baked in the sun by the gypsies. He and his sons and
    daughters then build the house, thatch it with last year&rsquo;s straw, whitewash
    it, ornament it all around with a decorative frieze of brilliant colours,
    and make the necessary furniture from the acacia wood, which can be bought
    locally, very cheaply.</p>
  <p>All Hungarian cottages are built on tbe same pattern: oblong in shape, with
    a thatched roof, and a rough verandah supported on two or three beams, to
    shelter one side of the house from the grilling sun.</p>
  <p>The interior is divided into three rooms. One in the centre, with an enormous
    hearth occupying the whole of the wall which faces you as you enter. This
    serves for cooking and washing purposes, and also for warming the rooms on
    either side. The other two rooms are bedrooms, one for best, the other for
    daily use.</p>
  <p>If the peasant is rich and prosperous, these three rooms are perhaps a little
    larger, a little loftier than those of his poorer neighbour. But that is
    the only difference between rich and poor.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000221h-images/image05.jpg" width="850" height="407"></p>
  <p>In the best bedroom are three or four, sometimes more beds, heaped up to
    the ceiling with downy plumeaus and pillows encased in snow-white, home-woven
    linen. This room is never used, save by bride and bridegroom on their first
    home-coming. Otherwise, it is the abode of the more precious poultry. The
    turkeys and Orpington hens lay and hatch their eggs in the best beds.</p>
  <p>The family sleep in the second bedroom, on benches, which run round the
    walls, and, perhaps, there will be a couple of bedsteads for the older members
    of the household.</p>
  <p>The Hungarian peasant does not take off his clothes for the night. The men
    curled up in their huge sheepskin mantles, the women wrapped in coarse, woollen
    blankets, take the necessary rest after the day&rsquo;s toil, but that is
    all. All round them sleep the geese and goslings which are not of sufficient
    importance to occupy the best bedroom.</p>
  <p>Practically all the year round, the peasant proprietor and his family work
    their bit of land for all it is worth. The younger children are out all day
    driving their flocks of geese or their few pigs. All the efforts of the Government
    have been unavailing to force these people to send their children regularly
    to school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who would look after the geese and pigs?&rdquo; is the Hungarian
    peasant&rsquo;s unanswerable argument, &ldquo;if the young ones are to go
    to school?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The State would be compelled to build huge prisons, in which the entire
    rural population of Central Hungary would have to be locked up, if it seriously
    meant to enforce compulsory education.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000221h-images/image06.jpg" width="850" height="651"></p>
  <p>Sunday alone is the great day of rest. The whole family begins by having
    a grand wash. There is a well outside and a pump. Vigorous scrubbing does
    the rest.</p>
  <p>Then everybody goes to Mass, and this without any exception whatever, save
    the actual bedridden. At Aroksz&agrave;ll&agrave;s, which is a typical Magyar
    township, situated in the very heart of a number of peasant holdings, every
    one of the fourteen thousand parishioners, except the children under ten,
    goes to confession and Holy Communion at Easter time. The priest&mdash;usually
    himself recruited from the peasant class&mdash;has two coadjutors, and together
    they attend to the very simple spiritual wants of their flock.</p>
  <p>Mass on Sundays in a Hungarian village church is a sight to see. The women
    on one side, the men on the other, ranged according to age. The old women
    at the back, in dark bodices and petticoats, and with a black silk kerchief
    tied round their heads, then the younger matrons in gayer colours, with bright
    yellow or blue bordered kerchiefs. In front of these, again, the unmarried
    girls. They wear no kerchiefs on their heads, their hair is tightly plaited
    and made into a small knob at the back of the head, and dragged away from
    the forehead, leaving to the face a decidedly Chinese type of countenance.</p>
  <p>Beyond again, close to the chancel rails, kneel the younger girls; the little
    ones have to find room in the chancel, and the tiny ones right behind the
    altar.</p>
  <p>All the women wear innumerable petticoats, one heaped over the other; the
    rich peasant proprietor&rsquo;s wife is distinguished by the greater multitude
    of petticoats which she ties round her waist. And when everyone kneels down
    at a given solemn moment on the flagstones of the church, the many-hued petticoats
    bulge out like a number of fantastic bells.</p>
  <p>The men, in the same order according to age, occupy the other side of the
    church, also the vestry and the organ-loft.</p>
  <p>A deep religious feeling is a special characteristic of the Magyar peasant,
    also his reverence for and belief in the great wisdom of his priest.</p>
  <p>That same priest will tell you that his people are &ldquo;good children&rdquo;&mdash;a
    little quarrelsome, perhaps, quick to take offence and to resent it, but
    as honest as the day.</p>
  <p>On Sunday afternoons the young people dance the <i>cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s</i> in
    the big village barn, or, in the summer, in one of the cottage yards. It
    is the national dance; akin to none, and consisting of a slow, dreamy movement
    called <i>lass&ugrave;</i>, a sort of rhythmic motion of the body, soon followed
    by the mad whirl or <i>cs&agrave;rd&agrave;s</i> proper. Brahms with his
    immortal  &ldquo;Hungarian dances&rdquo; has made the music familiar to European
    and American ears.</p>
  <p>For hours the young people will dance, while the gypsies scrape their fiddles,
    to the accompaniment of the clarionet and of the wonderful <i>czimbalom</i> which
    is an essentially national instrument; it is shaped somewhat like a huge
    zither, and played with a small wadded hammer.</p>
  <p>When the young people are resting from their wild dancing, the band plays
    some of those exquisite Hungarian melodies, full of poetry and gentle melancholy,
    which are dear to the heart of every Magyar peasant. The rich peasant-proprietor,
    together with his poorer colleague, will sit for hours gently humming the
    words of the ditty, as the gypsies continue to play indefatigably.</p>
  <p>That great love for music and dancing is inherent in every Hungarian peasant,
    together with the love he has for the actual soil which he tills. Beyond
    that, he holds wheat, the great product of that rich soil, as a sort of fetish.</p>
  <p><i>Tiszta b&ugrave;za</i> (pure corn) are words only to be spoken reverentially,
    when passing a field of waving corn, gently stirred by the breeze and ripening
    in the sun. Every other product of this wonderfully fruitful country the
    Hungarian peasant holds in sublime contempt.</p>
