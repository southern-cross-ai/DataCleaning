  <h2 align="center"><b>Prologue<br>
    1783 A. D.</b></h2>
  <p>They brought the boy home, the three of them&mdash;his two friends and the
    doctor &mdash;brought him home to die, for the surgeon said he could only
    last an hour at most.</p>
  <p>Juliette did not cry, did not even utter a sound. Her great eyes wandered
    from the inanimate form of her brother before her to that of her father,
    whose joy and pride the boy had been.</p>
  <p>The lad had quarrelled with the young Baron Deroul&egrave;de&mdash;as gallant
    and honorable a gentleman as could be found at the King&rsquo;s Court.</p>
  <p>The motive of the quarrel? Ah, who could tell? Ostensibly a dispute over
    a deal at cards. Probably the bright eyes of one of the Queen&rsquo;s Maids
    of Honor might not be altogether out of the question.</p>
  <p>And so this morning they fought, in a <i>carrefour</i> of the Bois de Vincennes.
    The Baron Deroul&egrave;de was a noted swordsman, and the lad fell after
    the third attack with a thrust through his left lung. The doctor thought
    it best to bring him home&mdash;to die in his father&rsquo;s, his sister&rsquo;s
    arms.</p>
  <p>Presently, when it was all over, when the young body lay in marble-like
    majesty, when the friends had departed, and the old Count Marny was alone
    with his daughter, face to face with his great grief, he took Juliette&rsquo;s
    hand, and placing it on her dead brother&rsquo;s head, he spoke in tones
    that were almost those of a maniac, so wild and purposeless they seemed;
    though to <i>her</i> they had the solemnity born of unconquerable sorrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Juliette, I may be too old to accomplish it, but you are young; swear,
    Juliette, swear that he will not remain unavenged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Juliette repeated the oath her father thus dictated to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will find him out, Juliette; remember, you must be cunning, but
    God will help you to track him, the murderer. And I too, Juliette, when I
    am dead, my spirit will help you. Swear, little one . . . swear, once more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Juliette swore, as her father commanded. Then the old man seemed satisfied.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter 1<br>
    1793 A.D.</b></h2>
  <p>It was never safe in that terrible year of 1793 for any woman of outwardly
    refined appearance to walk in the streets of Paris alone. Any passerby, therefore,
    would have wondered at what could have possessed that graceful young girl
    to walk down the Rue Taitbout alone in the middle of the afternoon, when
    there are more idlers than ever at the corners, more absinthe than at any
    other time of the day in the heads of the good citizens and citizenesses
    of Paris.</p>
  <p>She walked rapidly the whole length of the street toward an imposing group
    of tall houses, where dwelt several well-known citizen-deputies. So far she
    had been left fairly unmolested, save for a few jeering remarks at her dainty
    appearance.</p>
  <p>Doubtless the broad tricolor scarf the young girl wore tied round her waist
    had contributed in no small measure to her comparative safety. It seemed,
    therefore, an act of absolute folly on her part that, having reached a spot
    close to No. 25 of the Rue Taitbout, a handsome house inhabited by the popular
    Citizen-Deputy Deroul&egrave;de, she should suddenly tear off the Republican
    badge, which had been her safe-conduct, and throw it ostentatiously in the
    mud.</p>
  <p>This extraordinary overt act of anti-patriotism was the spark that set the
    pent-up tempers aflame. For one moment positive stupor petrified the lookers-on;
    but this only lasted a second. The next, twenty hoarse voices shrieked with
    frenzied passion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down with the aristocrat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the lantern, to death with her who insults the Republic!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shrieking women, half-tipsy men, yelling urchins seemed to have sprung up
    from the very ground, for in less than a minute the foolhardy girl was attacked
    by a regular crowd of the lowest Paris mob, gesticulating, hooting, yelling,
    while those in the foremost rank had already snatched at her skirt, and were
    dragging her away from the porch of the house, to which, after her curious
    act of defiance, she now clung with the energy of wild terror and hopeless
    despair, her back against the door, facing the hideous crowd. In an agony
    of terror she gave forth one piteous shriek, hammering at the door with her
    small fists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help, Citizen Deroul&egrave;de! Help! murder! Here, at your very
    door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A long, mocking laugh from the mob greeted this piteous appeal. At that
    moment the door behind her was gently opened, a strong arm swiftly and suddenly
    encircled her waist, and in less than a second she felt herself dragged away
    from the mob.</p>
  <p>Five minutes later the young girl, whose foolhardy and apparently purposeless
    action had so nearly proved her own undoing, was sitting comfortably installed
    before a gayly blazing fire, while an elegant and dignified-looking old lady
    leant over her, trying further to soothe her still agitated nerves.</p>
  <p>Through the window, which was partially open, came the sound of a powerful
    voice, evidently accustomed to command and to be obeyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; said the old lady with undisguised pride; &ldquo;you
    need have no more fear now, mademoiselle; he is talking to the mob; you are
    under the protection and in the house of Citizen-Deputy Deroul&egrave;de.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A look of exultation and triumph crossed the girl&rdquo;s eyes, but it was
    a momentary flash; the next instant she was thanking Citizen Deroul&egrave;de,
    who had stepped into the room once more, for his timely aid in a moment of
    such deadly peril.</p>
  <p>The girl looked very beautiful in her helplessness and gratitude. No wonder
    that the Citizen-Deputy, who was but a young man, after all, stooped and
    kissed the dainty hand that was stretched out toward him, forgetting that
    such customs would have been called &ldquo;aristocratic,&rdquo; and most
    unworthy of a representative of the people.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter 2</b></h2>
  <p>About a week after the events recorded in the last chapter, five men were
    sitting in Citizen Deroul&egrave;de&rsquo;s comfortably furnished study,
    round a table covered with a green cloth and encumbered with cards, counters,
    and the usual accessories that are necessary for a game of hazard. Though
    each held in his hand a few cards, and from time to time made a jerky attempt
    at following some sort of game, it was nevertheless quite obvious that these
    five men were discussing other matters than the hazards of baccarat or the
    latest production at the &ldquo;Moli&egrave;re.&rdquo;  The face of each
    looked anxious and careworn, and all of them started visibly at the slightest
    sound behind the heavily curtained door or closely shuttered windows.</p>
  <p>The host himself, a powerful, well-built figure, with handsome, refined
    features, so well known in the assemblies of the &ldquo;Convention,&rdquo;  seemed
    eager, alert, watchful, and his strong fist was doubled up on the table with
    a gesture of determination and energy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must succeed this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see no eventuality
    to stop us. We five who have planned this thing are alone to know of it.
    We cannot, we shall not fail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate, there is no chance of a traitor among us,&rdquo; said
    one of the guests. &ldquo;Money is plentiful; our measures are well taken.
    There is only the great, the difficult task of apprising the unfortunate
    Queen of the means we have devised for her escape, and of conveying to her
    the necessary funds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you all know,&rdquo; said Deroul&egrave;de, &ldquo;fate has wonderfully
    favored us. I am on duty as governor at the Conciergerie after to-morrow,
    and though I can never have long talks with her Majesty&mdash;whom may God
    preserve and protect!&mdash;yet I can always slip money and letters into
    her hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, are the letters and money safe in your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Safely locked up in that desk,&rdquo; said Deroul&egrave;de reassuringly. &ldquo;My
    mother has our cause as much to heart as any of us, and our two Auvergnat
    servants, terrified though they are into a semblance of republicanism, are
    staunch to the holy cause, and devoted slaves to my mother and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Citizen Deroul&egrave;de,&rdquo; said one of the guests, an
    oldish man, somewhat tentatively, &ldquo;you have a visitor in your house.
    What of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The daughter of a good Royalist who died for his convictions,&rdquo; said
    Deroul&egrave;de rapidly; &ldquo;a girl who nearly met with a terrible death
    through a foolhardy exhibition of her principles, in the open streets; moreover,&rdquo;  he
    added fervently, &ldquo;one of God&rsquo;s most beautiful creatures, full
    of guilelessness and innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A smile went round the faces of those assembled; but evidently Deroul&egrave;de
    had succeeded in reassuring them. No doubt the girl was his fianc&eacute;e,
    or almost so, and as such there would be no cause for the fear of her indiscretion.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The hour was getting late, and all that was necessary had been fully discussed.
    The four men prepared to leave, and were wrapping themselves in their mantles
    and cloaks while shaking hands with their host.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you, for our own satisfaction,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;let us
    assure ourselves with our very eyes that the letters and money are absolutely
    safe? It is a great responsibility on such young shoulders as yours, Citizen
    Deroul&egrave;de, to conduct this great affair almost single-handed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know no fear,&rdquo; said Deroulede proudly; &ldquo;and here,&rdquo; he
    added, taking a key from his breast pocket and unlocking his desk, &ldquo;is
    the casket that contains all that is needed to place our beloved Queen out
    of the clutches of the bloodthirsty tigers who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused; the casket was still in his hand. All heads were turned, terror-stricken,
    toward the door, which had been gently and silently opened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mme. Deroul&egrave;de has desired me to ask monsieur if she should
    send in some refreshments for his friends before they leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Juliette&rsquo;s figure was standing in the doorway, one tiny hand holding
    back the heavy draperies that framed her like a picture. As well have suspected
    one of the saints of Notre Dame to harbor thoughts of treachery or even indiscretion,
    as this sweet face, all youth and girlishness.</p>
  <p>Deroul&egrave;de smiled, reassured, and with deliberation and calmness replaced
    the casket in his desk, and once more turned the key. The others seemed to
    have conquered their fright.</p>
  <p>Juliette, after hearing Deroul&egrave;de&rsquo;s thanks, again retired,
    and the five men were once more alone.</p>
  <p>Not one of them made any comment on the little incident that had so much
    disturbed them, and their host seemed anxious not to provoke any.</p>
  <p>Ah! had they but been gifted with second sight, or had the bandage of wilful
    blindness been torn away from their host&rsquo;s eyes, the bandage placed there
    by the most beautiful hands in Paris, their quietude would not have been
    of long duration. Juliette had paused one instant outside the door, her hand
    pressed against her heart, as if to repress its very beating. A look of triumph,
    of exultation, aye, of vengeance satisfied, distorted for a moment those
    Madonna-like features.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter 3</b></h2>
  <p>The next evening Deroul&egrave;de was to leave his mother and his home for
    his new quarters within the Conciergerie, in his capacity as temporary lieutenant,
    which function he intended to utilize for the furtherance of the great plan
    he and his comrades had conceived, to effect the unfortunate Queen&rsquo;s
    escape.</p>
  <p>He had said good-by to his mother, who had already retired to her room,
    and now stood in his study, ready to go, the fateful casket in a small valise
    which he held in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell Mlle. Juliette that if she will favor me with her presence,
    I would wish to bid her good-by,&rdquo; he said to his servant,  &ldquo;and
    in half an hour see that a carriage is at the door, to take me and my luggage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Five minutes later she came in, tall and graceful. Her cheeks were very
    pale, her lips trembled slightly, and there was a wild, curious look in her
    large, wide-open eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is kind of you, mademoiselle, to grant my request,&rdquo; he said,
    with a timidity most unusual in this man accustomed to face and speak to
    the most unruly mob the world has ever known, &ldquo;and to come to bid me
    godspeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not going for long, Citizen Deroul&egrave;de?&rdquo;  she
    asked.</p>
  <p>She seemed strangely nervous and agitated, and once almost seemed as if
    she would fall. He led her to the sofa, and took a low seat beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In these times, mademoiselle, any farewell might be forever. But
    I am actually going for a month to take charge of the unfortunate prisoner
    at the Conciergerie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In any case, then, Citizen Deroul&egrave;de, the farewell I bid you
    to-night will be a very long one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A month will seem a century to me, since I am destined to spend it
    without seeing you,&rdquo; he said, as if involuntarily; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and looked long and searchingly into those eyes, that still wore
    that wild, haggard gaze. Then he whispered, almost inaudibly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I should not dare to hope that the same reason would cause you
    to call that month a long one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned perhaps a trifle paler than before, and drew her hand hurriedly
    away, for he had tried to seize it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You misunderstand me, Citizen,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;I meant that
    I cannot stay any longer under Mme. Deroul&egrave;de&rsquo;s hospitable roof.
    I have already trespassed too long on her kindness, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not been happy with us?&rdquo; he said, half reproachfully,
    half sadly; &ldquo;you wish to leave us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, do not speak like that!&rdquo; she said, almost
    wildly. &ldquo;You do not know, you do not understand, or else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand, Juliette,&rdquo; he said, with the determination
    of the strong man wishing at any cost to know what fate has in store for
    him. &ldquo;I understand your sweet, innocent nature, I understand your beauty,
    which God gave you as a mirror to your angelic mind. How could I have lived
    all these days under the same roof with you without learning the sweet lesson
    which the angels from heaven have taught me&mdash;to love you, Juliette?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was useless now for her to attempt to withdraw her hand, for he had seized
    it in both his, and was covering it and the tiny wrist with kisses, aye,
    and with hot tears, tears of an emotion so deep, and so pathetic to witness
    in a strong man.</p>
  <p>Juliette had tried to rise, to tear herself away. In an agony of mind, she
    tried to stop her ears, tried not to hear this man&rsquo;s voice telling
    her of his love, this man whom she had dogged, whose hospitality she had
    betrayed to serve her own vengeance. She tried to think of him only as the
    murderer of her brother, the guilty cause of her stricken father&rsquo;s early
    tragic death. She made every effort to conjure up the picture of the boy
    brought home on a stretcher to die, of the old man holding out a trembling
    hand toward her, and muttering feebly,  &ldquo;Juliette, live to avenge us
    both!&rdquo; But oh! that picture would not stay before her throbbing eyes.
    Instead of it, she saw this man at her feet, telling her with a voice that
    forced its way in spite of all to her heart, &ldquo;I love you, Juliette!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she&mdash;what had she done? She had forced her way into his house at
    peril of her own life, had dogged his footsteps, watched his every movement,
    and&mdash;oh, the horror of it!&mdash;finally denounced him to those who
    know no pity. And all in pursuit of the implacable vengeance that had seemed
    a sacred duty until, a few moments ago, she first had heard those words,
    and, womanlike, had begun to pity. And having pitied, hatred made way for
    its twin brother love, with whom it so often walks hand in hand. Ah! if she
    could but forget, could but undo what was irrevocably done, could but allow
    her hand to rest in his, her ears to listen to what he had to say! . . .</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open, in the name of the Republic!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deroul&egrave;de leapt to his feet as this ominous summons, the meaning
    of which he knew all too well, sounded outside his street door. A minute
    elapsed while the Auvergnat&rsquo;s timorous hands were heard to fumble with
    the chain and bolts. Juliette had also jumped, horror-stricken, from her
    couch. Her eyes, dilated and haggard, were fixed with a look of terror on
    the door, which, in another moment, she knew would open before the members
    of the Committee of Public Safety, Marat and his fraternity, whom her own
    hand had summoned hither. Deroul&egrave;de was now deathly pale. Like a wild
    animal at bay, he looked round at the walls of his study, up toward heaven,
    or down toward hell, to find some place to which to flee with his precious
    casket, that lay still there, in the valise close to his hand.</p>
  <p>Already the sound of the heavy footsteps, the muttered curses and oaths,
    had filled the hall, and were now heard rapidly approaching the study door.
    One common terror for an instant now held these two enthralled. For a space
    of a minute their thoughts, their longings, and desires met over the safety
    of the precious casket. The next Juliette had seized the valise and thrown
    it on the sofa. Then reseating herself, with the gesture of a queen and the
    grace of a Parisienne she spread the ample folds of her skirts over the compromising
    bundle, and, as the door was thrown violently open, she said, in calm, somewhat
    haughty tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How strange it is, Citizen Deroul&egrave;de, that in the year 1793
    Frenchmen so easily forget what is due to women, and interrupt a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
    without so much as saying &lsquo;Gare!&rsquo; Your pleasure, citizens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marat, followed by some half-dozen men, each wearing the red cap and cockade
    and tricolor sash, had entered the room, and the cunning eyes of the dreaded
    terrorist had wandered first ironically from one to the other of the two
    young people, then suspiciously to the desk and other furniture round him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this strange visit, Citizen Marat?&rdquo; said
    Deroul&egrave;de, who had tried to recover his calm and self-possession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Information has been laid against you, Citizen-Deputy,&rdquo;  said
    Marat, &ldquo;by an anonymous writer, that you have just now in your possession
    correspondence intended for the Widow Capet; and the Committee of Public
    Safety has entrusted me and these citizens to seize such correspondence and
    make you answerable for its presence in your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always supposing such correspondence to exist,&rdquo;  said Deroul&egrave;de,
    sneeringly. &ldquo;I should have thought my services to the Republic had
    been too widely known to allow a nameless enemy&rsquo;s denunciations to
    weigh against them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Committee of Public Safety is bound to do its duty by the people
    whose representatives they are,&rdquo; said Marat, doggedly;  &ldquo;but
    you know best, Citizen Deroul&egrave;de, whether you have anything to hide.
    If the accusation prove a calumny, so much the better for you. I presume,&rdquo; he
    added sneeringly, &ldquo;that you do not propose to offer any resistance
    while these citizens and I search your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deroul&egrave;de answered nothing, and quietly handed over a bunch of keys
    to one of the men, who, aided by the others, proceeded to unlock the desk
    and turn over every scrap of paper he came across.</p>
  <p>Deroul&egrave;de dared not turn toward Juliette; he felt that at this moment
    her life, as well as his own, lay in a look, in a quiver of the eyelid. The
    terrorist&rsquo;s eyes were fixed unceasingly upon him, and he dared not
    attempt to read in Juliette&rsquo;s what was passing in her mind.</p>
  <p>The girl, though very pale, seemed to have complete mastery over her nerves.
    She still sat on the sofa, enthroned queen-like, the folds of her silken
    gown hiding that which would have sent her enemy to the scaffold, him whom
    she hated so bitterly, whose hand had slain her brother, driven her father
    to despair, but whose voice had so strangely moved her just now when he said, &ldquo;I
    love you, Juliette!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men, after a fruitless search through the desk, had turned over every
    article of furniture that might have contained papers or correspondence,
    and were now preparing for their further search throughout the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall have to ask you, Citizen Deroul&egrave;de,&rdquo;  said Marat,
    with mock urbanity, &ldquo;to accompany us while we execute our painful duty.
    I can assure you that if we find nothing compromising against you, we will
    soon restore you to a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te which the citizeness
    is so wrathful at seeing interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The request was practically a command, and Deroul&egrave;de prepared to
    follow, vainly trying to force his brain to find a way out of the situation
    of deadly peril in which so many were now involved. Juliette&rsquo;s impulsive
    act had merely succeeded in involving her into the tangled meshes, without
    saving the conspirators or the unhappy Queen. Marat and his men would surely
    return. The comedy could not be kept up through another visit from them.
    Discovery was imminent. What was passing in that young girl&rsquo;s mind
    while Deroul&egrave;de reluctantly followed the human bloodhounds out of
    the room?</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>She listened till the sound of their heavy footsteps died away down the
    passage, then she rose, and picked up the valise. Cautiously she opened the
    window, and peeped out. . . . Four more men were stationed outside in the
    street, guarding the exit. Escape, therefore, in that quarter was impossible.
    She hesitated for one brief instant, then she quietly slipped out of the
    door, down the semi-dark passage, up the carpeted stairs, still carrying
    the fateful valise in her hand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter 4</b></h2>
  <p>Half an hour later the Republicans, having fruitlessly searched throughout
    the house, were busying themselves on the floor above, terrifying almost
    beyond their wits the two Auvergnat servants, an occupation that seemed to
    afford them considerable amusement, for loud laughter was heard from time
    to time from that quarter.</p>
  <p>Deroul&egrave;de had been allowed to remain with his mother, guarded by
    two of the men, who watched his every movement, and listened to every word
    he said. The old lady sat rigid in her upright chair. There was a curious
    look in her wide-open eyes, fixed, and staring straight in front of her.
    It was a look more of suspicion than anxiety, more of wrath than of terror.
    Her son held her wrinkled hand in his, and was trying with soft, endearing
    words to soothe and reassure her.</p>
  <p>The soft sound of a rustling gown made them both start. It was Juliette,
    pale still &mdash;from the emotions, no doubt, of the last half hour. Deroul&egrave;de
    dared not ask her any questions. The men were there, close to him, ever watchful.
    He tried to read in her face, but it was almost sphinx-like in its impenetrability.</p>
  <p>Mme. Deroul&egrave;de had not turned toward the young girl; she still sat
    quite rigid, idly toying with a scrap of paper she held in her wrinkled old
    hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; she said suddenly, quite loudly, so that the men at
    the door might hear if they chose, &ldquo;have you any idea as to who the
    dastardly, nameless accuser is, who has dared to frame the calumny that the
    Citizen-Deputy Deroul&egrave;de is a traitor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young man, wondering what his mother might possibly mean, did not answer;
    he had looked at Juliette and thought how pale she appeared, and his heart
    ached to see that wild, scared look in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Citizen Marat, from whom I vainly tried to obtain certainty on the
    subject,&rdquo; continued the old lady in the same hard and dry voice, &ldquo;could
    not himself tell me, but he had in his hand this letter, the anonymous denunciation
    that reached the Committee this evening, and he thought that perhaps I might
    know the handwriting, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Juliette, for God&rsquo;s sake, what is the matter?&rdquo;  here interrupted
    Deroul&egrave;de, unable to understand, not daring to trust to his senses,
    as Juliette with a wild cry had thrown herself between mother and son, and
    seizing the letter from the old lady&rsquo;s hand began tearing it into shreds
    with the nervous gestures of one half-demented, while her trembling lips
    framed the half-incoherent words: &ldquo;No! no!&mdash;you shall not read&mdash;not
    yet&mdash;Citizen Deroul&egrave;de &mdash;not yet&mdash;wait&mdash;a little
    while longer&mdash;wait&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And her haggard face, her appealing look turned upward toward Deroul&egrave;de,
    spoke with pitiable clearness of her guilt and of her treachery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; laughed the old lady, shrugging her shoulders and looking
    contemptuously at the young, girlish form, so pathetic in its helpless confession
    of guilt. &ldquo;Look at her, my son, as she stands self-accused, the vilest
    thing on earth, a snake in the grass, whom we both have loved and nurtured;
    aye, self-accused, for, fool that she is, that empty paper bore no witness
    against her till her own conscience changed it into a damning proof of her
    guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deroul&egrave;de had stood all this while as if paralyzed. His mind seemed
    unable to grasp the hideous truth that would force itself into his aching
    brain, and instinctively he shut his eyes, that they at least might not see
    this fearful vision of the terrible downfall of one of God&rsquo;s purest
    angels.</p>
  <p>Thus a few minutes sped rapidly by. Mme. Deroul&egrave;de had sunk back
    exhausted in her arm-chair, and naught was heard now save the low mocking
    comments made by the men, who had looked on without interfering at the curious
    scene which had been enacted before them.</p>
  <p>It was almost a relief to Deroul&egrave;de to hear Marat and his companions
    once more descending the stairs, and the terrorist&rsquo;s sarcastic laugh and
    coarse jests, when the men told him of the short drama they had just witnessed,
    seemed even more endurable than the sight of this girl whom he had so deeply
    loved, and who had waited all these days to repay him&mdash;thus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Citizen-Deputy,&rdquo; said Marat, &ldquo;we are all glad to say
    that we have found nothing in your house that in any way can place your loyalty
    to the Republic in doubt. At the same time, it is my duty to ask you to follow
    me to-night, for there are several questions the Committee of Public Safety
    will desire to ask you to-morrow. They can but lead to your more complete
    justification.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deroul&egrave;de, as if in a dream, prepared to follow the men. What cared
    he what happened to him now, since the one idea of his life, his faith, his
    hope, his love had been so completely shattered? Forgotten were his plans,
    his friends, the unhappy royal prisoner in the Conciergerie. All had vanished
    before this picture of the fallen angel at his feet. He kissed his mother,
    bidding her good-by, not heeding the old lady&rsquo;s sorrowful agony and terror
    for her only son, and forcing himself not to look once more at the young
    face he had so dearly loved, he walked out of the room escorted by two of
    Marat&rsquo;s men.</p>
  <p>His footsteps, and those of his escort, were heard echoing down the staircase.
    Then the hall door was heard to open and to shut with a loud bang. Mine.
    Deroul&egrave;de had at last given way to tears, and sat in her great arm-chair,
    weeping piteously. Marat&rsquo;s eyes were fixed with a mixture of sarcasm and
    contempt on Juliette, who had recovered her self-possession, and stood erect,
    calmly awaiting the final d&eacute;nouement of the drama she had written
    with her own hand.</p>
  <p>Two of the men, who on Deroul&egrave;de&rsquo;s departure had withdrawn,
    after a whispered order from their chief, now returned. One of them carried
    the casket containing the fateful papers; these he placed on the table close
    to Juliette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You recognize this casket?&rdquo; asked Marat, pointing to it, and
    speaking to the young girl, who nodded in reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you know where it was found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hidden underneath your mattress. What have you to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will answer when I am on my trial,&rdquo; she said mechanically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You acknowledge, then, that they are yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she again asserted, this time defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then your denunciation of Citizen-Deputy Deroul&egrave;de  &mdash;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was a lie to screen myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spoke quietly now, without hesitation.</p>
  <p>Mme. Deroul&egrave;de gazed at the young girl, trying to understand the
    enigma that her feeble brain still refused to grasp.</p>
  <p>Marat cared little for enigmas. He had not wasted his evening. Here was
    a most interesting capture, a delightful victim, such as he and his followers
    loved to see on the tumbrils; a head refined, sweet, aristocratic, such as
    they loved to see falling under the guillotine.</p>
  <p>She was quite prepared to follow the men, prepared to leave this house whose
    hospitality she had so cruelly betrayed, for that dark, crowded prison at
    the Conciergerie, from which there was but one exit&mdash;the one that led
    to the guillotine.</p>
  <p>But before going she seemed to hesitate a moment, and looked appealingly
    at Mme. Deroul&egrave;de. The old lady made no sign, only sitting with her
    hands clasped, her face averted.</p>
  <p>The girl turned to Marat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I&mdash;may I speak one word to her? Only a last message. I understand
    quite well that it is the last time I shall see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marat paused, then he nodded assent. She went up to madame, and whispering
    so low that even Marat&rsquo;s inimical ears could not hear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you tell him&mdash;presently&mdash;when it is all over&mdash;in
    about two days&mdash;that when I sinned so deeply against him&mdash;I did
    not guess&mdash;what he told me to-night &mdash;did not know&mdash;did not
    realize. My name is Marny&mdash;and he killed my brother &mdash;he will remember.
    I thought only of vengeance&mdash;while he dreamt of love. But to-night I
    understood him&mdash;I learnt to know myself&mdash;and&mdash;tell him&mdash;madame,
    that it was Juliette who saved him&mdash;by giving her life for his&mdash;but
    remember&mdash;only afterward&mdash;promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a firm, quiet step she followed Marat and his men out of the room.</p>
