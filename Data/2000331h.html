  Faded Splendour</b></h2>
  <p>Midway between Apt and the shores of the Durance, on the southern slope
  of Luberon there stands an old ch&acirc;teau. It had once been the fortified
  stronghold of the proud seigneurs de Ventadour, who were direct descendants
  of the great troubadour, and claimed kinship with the Comtes de Provence,
  but already in the days when Bertrand de Ventadour was a boy, it had fallen
  into partial decay. The battlemented towers were in ruin, the roof in many
  places had fallen in; only the square block, containing the old living-rooms,
  had been kept in a moderate state of repair. As for the rest, it was a dwelling-place
  for owls and rooks, the walls were pitted with crevices caused by crumbling
  masonry, the corbellings and battlements had long since broken away, whilst
  many of the windows, innocent of glass, stared, like tear-dimmed eyes, way
  away down the mountain slope, past the terraced gradients of dwarf olives
  and carob trees, to the fertile, green valley below.</p>
  <p>It is, in truth, fair, this land of Provence; but fair with the sad, subtle
  beauty of a dream&mdash;dream of splendour, of chivalry and daring deeds,
  of troubadours and noble ladies; fair with the romance of undying traditions,
  of Courts of Love and gallant minstrels, of King Ren&eacute; and lovely Marguerite.
  Fair because it is sad and silent, like a gentle and beautiful mother whose
  children have gone out into the great world to seek fortunes in richer climes,
  whilst she has remained alone in the old nest, waiting with sorrow in her
  heart and arms ever outstretched in loving welcome in case they should return;
  tending and cherishing the faded splendours of yesterday; and burying with
  reverence and tears, one by one, the treasures that once had been her pride,
  but which the cruel hand of time had slowly turned to dust.</p>
  <p>And thus it was with the once splendid domaine of the Comtes de Ventadour.
  The ancient family, once feudal seigneurs who owed alliance to none save
  to the Kings of Anjou, had long since fallen on evil days. The wild extravagance
  of five generations of gallant gentlemen had hopelessly impoverished the
  last of their line. One acre after another of the vineyards and lemon groves
  of old Provence were sold in order to pay the gambling debts of M. le Comte,
  or to purchase a new diamond necklace for Madame, his wife. At the time of
  which this chronicle is a faithful record, nothing remained of the extensive
  family possessions, but the ch&acirc;teau perched high up on the side of
  the mountain and a few acres of woodland which spread in terraced gradients
  down as far as the valley. Oh! those woods, with their overhanging olive
  trees, and feathery pines, and clumps of dull-coloured carob and silvery,
  sweet-scented rosemary: with their serpentine paths on the edge of which
  buttercups and daisies and wild violets grew in such profusion in the spring,
  and which in the summer the wild valerian adorned with patches of purple
  and crimson: with their scrub and granite boulders, their mysterious by-ways,
  their nooks and leafy arbours, wherein it was good to hide or lie in wait
  for imaginary foes. Woods that were a heaven for small tripping feet, a garden
  of Eden for playing hide-and-seek, a land of pirates, of captive maidens
  and robbers, of dark chasms and crevasses, and of unequal fights between
  dauntless knights and fierce dragons. Woods, too, where in the autumn the
  leaves of the beech and chestnut turned a daffodil yellow, and those of oak
  and hazel-nut a vivid red, and where bunches of crimson berries fell from
  the mountain ash and crowds of chattering starlings came to feed on the fruit
  of the dwarf olive trees. Woods where tiny lizards could be found lying so
  still, so still as the stone of which they seemed to form a part, until you
  moved just a trifle nearer, and, with a delicious tremor of fear, put out
  your little finger, hoping yet dreading to touch the tiny, lithe body with
  its tip, when lo! it would dart away; out of sight even before you could
  call Tan-tan to come and have a look.</p>
  <p>Tan-tan had decided that lizards were the baby children of the dragon which
  he had slain on the day when Nicolette was a captive maiden, tied to the
  big carob tree by means of her stockings securely knotted around her wee
  body, and that the patch of crimson hazel-bush close by was a pool of that
  same dragon&rsquo;s blood. Nicolette had spent a very uncomfortable half-hour
  that day, because Tan-tan took a very long time slaying that dragon, a huge
  tree stump, decayed and covered with fungi which were the scales upon the
  brute&rsquo;s body; he had to slash at the dragon with his sword, and the
  dragon had great twisted branches upon him which were his arms and legs,
  and these had to be hacked off one by one. And all the while Nicolette had
  to weep and to pray for the success of her gallant deliverer in this unequal
  fight. And she got very tired and very hot, and the wind blew her brown curls
  all over her face, and they stuck into her mouth and her eyes and round her
  nose; and Tan-tan got fiercer and fiercer, and very red and very hot, until
  Nicolette got really sorry for the poor dragon, and wept real tears because
  his body and legs and arms had been a favourite resting-place of Micheline&rsquo;s
  when Micheline was too tired for play. And now the dragon had no more arms
  and legs, and Nicolette wept, and her loose hair stuck to her eyes, and her
  stockings were tied so tightly around her that they began to hurt, whilst
  a wasp began buzzing round her fat little bare knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Courage, fair maiden!&rdquo; Tan-tan exclaimed from time to time, &ldquo;the
  hour of thy deliverance is nigh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But not for all the world would Nicolette have allowed Tan-tan to know that
  she had really been crying. And presently when the dragon was duly slain
  and the crimson hazel-bush duly testified that he lay in a pool of blood,
  the victorious knight cut the bonds which held Nicolette to the carob tree,
  and lifting her in his arms, he carried her to his gallant steed, which was
  a young pine tree that the mistral had uprooted some few years ago, and which
  lay prone upon the ground&mdash;the most perfect charger any knight could
  possibly wish for.</p>
  <p>What mattered after that, that old Marga&iuml; was cross because Nicolette&rsquo;s
  stockings were all in holes? Tan-tan had deigned to say that Nicolette had
  a very good idea of play, which enigmatic utterance threw Nicolette into
  a veritable heaven of bliss. She did not know what it meant, but the tiny,
  podgy hand went seeking Tan-tan&rsquo;s big, hot one and nestled there like
  a bird in its nest, and her large liquid eyes, still wet with tears, were
  turned on him with the look of perfect adoration, which was wont to bring
  a flush of impatience into his cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art stupid, Nicolette,&rdquo; he would say almost shamefacedly,
  when that look came into her eyes, and with a war-whoop, he would dart up
  the winding path, bounding over rocks and broken boughs like a young stag,
  or swarming up the mountain ash like a squirrel, shutting his manly ears
  to the sweet, insidious call of baby lips that called pathetically to him
  from below:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tan-tan!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Then, when outside it rained, or the mistral blew across the valley, it
  meant delicious wanderings through the interminable halls and corridors of
  the old ch&acirc;teau&mdash;more distressed maidens held in durance in castellated
  towers, Nicolette and Micheline held captive by cruel, unseen foes: there
  were walls to be scaled, prisons to be stormed, hasty flights along stone
  passages, discovery of fresh hiding-places, and always the same intrepid
  knight, energetic, hot and eager to rescue the damsels in distress.</p>
  <p>And when the distressed damsels were really too tired to go on being rescued,
  there would be those long and lovely halts in the great hall where past Comtes
  and Comtesses de Ventadour, vicomtes and demoiselles looked down with silent
  scorn from out the mildewed canvases and tarnished gold frames upon the decayed
  splendour of their ancient home. Here, Tan-tan would for the time being renounce
  his r&ocirc;le of chivalrous knight-errant, and would stand thoughtful and
  absorbed before the portraits of his dead forbears. These pictures had a
  strange fascination for the boy. He never tired of gazing on them and repeating
  to his two devoted little listeners the tales which for the most part his
  grandmother had told him about these dead and gone ancestors.</p>
  <p>There was Rambaud de Ventadour, the handsome Comte of the days of the Grand
  Monarque, who had hied him from his old ch&acirc;teau in Provence to the
  Court of Versailles, where he cut a gallant figure with the best of that
  brilliant crowd of courtiers, stars of greater and lesser magnitude that
  revolved around the dazzling central sun. There was Madame la Comtesse Beatrix,
  the proud beauty whom he took for wife. They were rich in those days, the
  seigneurs of Ventadour, and Jaume Deydier, who was Nicolette&rsquo;s ancestor,
  was nothing but a lacquey in their service; he used to take care of the old
  ch&acirc;teau while M. le Comte and Mme. la Comtesse went out into the gay
  and giddy world, to Paris, Versailles or Rambouillet.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas not often the old lands of Provence saw their seigneurs in those
  days, not until misfortune overtook them and Geoffroy, Comte de Ventadour,
  Tan-tan&rsquo;s great-grandfather, he whose portrait hung just above the
  monumental hearth, returned, a somewhat sobered man, to the home of his forbears.
  Here he settled down with his two sons, and here Tan-tan&rsquo;s father was
  born, and Tan-tan himself, and Micheline. But Nicolette&rsquo;s father, Jaume
  Deydier, the descendant of the lacquey, now owned all the lands that once
  had belonged to the Comtes de Ventadour, and he was reputed to be the richest
  man in Provence, but he never set foot inside the old ch&acirc;teau.</p>
  <p>Nicolette did not really mind that her ancestor had been a lacquey. At six
  years of age that sort of information leaves one cold; nor did she quite
  know what a lacquey was, as there were none in the old homestead, over on
  the other side of the valley, where Marga&iuml; did the scrubbing, and the
  washing and the baking, put Nicolette to bed, and knitted innumerable pairs
  of woollen stockings. But she liked to hear about her ancestor because Tan-tan
  liked to talk about him, and about those wonderful times when the Comtes
  de Ventadour had gilded coaches and rode out on gaily caparisoned horses,
  going hawking, or chasing, or fishing in the Durance, the while old Jaume
  Deydier, the lacquey, had to stay at home and clean boots.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose boots, Tan-tan?&rdquo; Nicolette would venture to ask, and
  a look of deep puzzlement would for a moment put to flight the laughter that
  dwelt in her hazel eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art stupid, Nicolette,&rdquo; Tan-tan would reply with a shrug
  of his shoulders. &ldquo;Those of the Comte and Comtesse de Ventadour, of
  course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the day ... would he clean boots?&rdquo; she insisted, in her
  halting little lisp. Then, as Tan-tan simply vouchsafed no reply to this
  foolish query, she added with a sigh of mixed emotions: &ldquo;They must
  have worn boots and boots and boots!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which she dismissed the subject of her ancestor from her mind because
  Tan-tan had gone on talking about his: about the Comte Joseph-Alexis, and
  the Vicomtesse Yolande, the Marquis de Croze (a collateral), and Damoysella
  Ysabeau d&rsquo;Agoult, she who married the Comte Jeanroy de Ventadour, and
  was Lady-in-waiting to Mme. de Maintenon, the uncrowned Queen of France,
  and about a score or more of others, all great and gallant gentlemen or beautiful,
  proud ladies. But above all he would never weary of talking about the lovely
  Rixende, who was known throughout the land as the Lady of the Laurels. They
  also called her Riande, for short, because she was always laughing, and was
  so gay, so gay, until the day when M. le Comte her husband brought her here
  to his old home in Provence, after which she never even smiled again. She
  hated the old ch&acirc;teau, and vowed that such an owl&rsquo;s nest gave
  her the megrims: in truth she was pining for the gaieties of Paris and Versailles,
  and even the people here, round about, marvelled why M. le Comte chose to
  imprison so gay a bird in this grim and lonely cage, and though he himself
  oft visited the Court of Versailles after that, went to Paris and to Rambouillet,
  he never again took his fair young wife with him, and she soon fell into
  melancholia and died, just like a song-bird in captivity.</p>
  <p>Tan-tan related all this with bated breath, and his great dark eyes were
  fixed with a kind of awed admiration on the picture which, in truth, portrayed
  a woman of surpassing beauty. Her hair was of vivid gold, and nestled in
  ringlets all around her sweet face, her eyes were as blue as the gentian
  that grew on the mountain-side; they looked out of the canvas with an expression
  of unbounded gaiety and joy of life, whilst her lips, which were full and
  red, were parted in a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I marry,&rdquo; Tan-tan would declare, and set his arms akimbo
  in an attitude of unswerving determination, &ldquo;I shall choose a wife
  who will be the exact image of Rixende, she will be beautiful and merry,
  and she will have eyes that are as blue as the sky. Then I shall take her
  with me to Paris, where she will put all the ladies of the Court to the blush.
  But when she comes back with me to Ventadour, I shall love her so, and love
  her so that she will go on smiling and laughing, and never pine for the courtiers
  and the balls and the routs, no, not for the Emperor himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolette, sitting on the floor, and with her podgy arms encircling her
  knees, gazed wide-eyed on the beautiful Rixende who was to be the very image
  of Tan-tan&rsquo;s future wife. She was not thinking about anything in particular,
  she just looked and looked, and wondered as one does when one is six and
  does not quite understand. Her great wondering eyes were just beginning to
  fill with tears, when a harsh voice broke in on Tan-tan&rsquo;s eloquence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A perfect programme, by my faith! Bertrand, my child, you may come
  and kiss my hand, and then run to your mother and tell her that I will join
  her at coffee this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand did as he was commanded. The austere grandmother, tall and proud,
  and forbidding in a hooped gown, cut after the fashion of three decades ago,
  which she had never laid aside for the new-fangled modes of the mushroom
  Empire, held out her thin white hand, and the boy approached and kissed it,
  and she patted his cheek, and called him a true Ventadour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While we sit over coffee,&rdquo; she said, vainly trying to subdue
  her harsh voice to tones of gentleness, &ldquo;I will tell you about your
  little cousin. She is called Rixende, after your beautiful ancestress, and
  when she grows up, she will be just as lovely as this picture....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused and raised a lorgnette to her eyes, gazed for a moment on the
  picture of the departed Riande, and then allowed her cold, wearied glance
  to wander round and down and about until they rested on the hunched-up little
  figure of Nicolette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that child doing here?&rdquo; she asked, speaking to Micheline
  who stood by, mute and shy, as she always was when her grandmama was nigh.</p>
  <p>It was Bertrand who replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette came to ask us to go over to the mas and have coffee there,&rdquo; he
  said, hesitating, blushing, looking foolish, and avoiding Nicolette&rsquo;s
  innocent glance. &ldquo;Marga&iuml; has baked a big, big brioche,&rdquo; Nicolette
  chimed in, in her piping little voice, &ldquo;and churned some butter&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;there&rsquo;s
  cream&mdash;heaps and heaps of cream&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, Bertrand,&rdquo; the old Comtesse broke in coldly, &ldquo;and
  you too, Micheline, to your mother. I will join you all at coffee directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even Bertrand, the favourite, the <i>enfant g&acirc;t&eacute;</i>, dared
  not disobey when grandmama spoke in that tone of voice. He said: &ldquo;Yes,
  grandmama,&rdquo; quite meekly, and went out without daring to look again
  at Nicolette, for of a surety he knew that her eyes must be full of tears,
  and he himself was sorely tempted to cry, because he was so fond, so very
  fond of Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s brioches, and of her yellow butter, and lovely
  jars of cream, whilst in mother&rsquo;s room there would only be black bread
  with the coffee. So he threw back his head and ran, just ran out of the room;
  and as Nicolette had an uncomfortable lump in her wee throat she did not
  call to Tan-tan to come back, but sat there on the floor like a little round
  ball, her head buried between her knees, her brown curls all tangled and
  tossed around her head. Micheline on the other hand made no attempt to disguise
  her tears. Grandmama could not very well be more contemptuous and distant
  towards her than she always was, for Micheline was plain, and slightly misshapen,
  she limped, and her little face always looked pinched and sickly. Grandmama
  despised ugliness, she herself was so very tall and stately, and had been
  a noted beauty in the days before the Revolution. But being ugly and of no
  account had its advantages, because one could cry when one&rsquo;s heart
  was full and pride did not stand in the way of tears. So when grandmama presently
  sailed out of the hall, taking no more notice of Nicolette than if the child
  had been a bundle of rags, Micheline knelt down beside her little friend,
  and hugged and kissed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about to-day, Nicolette,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;run back
  and tell Marga&iuml; that we will come to-morrow. Grandmama never wants us
  two days running, and the brioche won&rsquo;t be stale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But at six years of age, when a whole life-time is stretched out before
  one, every day of waiting seems an eternity, and Nicolette cried and cried
  long after Micheline had gone.</p>
  <p>But presently a slight void inside her reminded her of Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s
  brioche, and of the jar of cream, and the tears dried off, of themselves;
  she picked herself up, and ran out of the hall, along the familiar corridors
  where she had so often been a damsel in distress, and out of the postern
  gate. She ran down the mountain-side as fast as her short legs would carry
  her, down and down into the valley, then up again, bounding like a young
  kid, up the winding track to the old house which her much-despised ancestor
  had built on the slope above the L&egrave;ze when first he laid the foundations
  of the fortune which his descendants had consolidated after him. Up she ran,
  safe as a bird in its familiar haunts, up the gradients between the lines
  of olive trees now laden with fruit, the source of her father&rsquo;s wealth.
  For while the noble Comtes de Ventadour had wasted their patrimony in luxury
  and in gambling, the Deydiers, father and son, had established a trade in
  oil, and in orange-flower water, both of which they extracted from the trees
  on the very land that they had bought bit by bit from their former seigneurs;
  and their oil was famed throughout the country, because one of the Deydiers
  had invented a process whereby his oil was sweeter than any other in the
  whole of Provence, and was sought after far and wide, and even in distant
  lands. But of this Nicolette knew nothing as yet: she did not even know that
  she loved the grey-green olive trees, and the terraced gradients down which
  she was just able to jump without tumbling, now that she was six and her
  legs had grown; she did not know that she loved the old house with its whitewashed
  walls, its sky-blue shutters, and multi-coloured tiled roof, and the crimson
  rose that climbed up the wall to the very window sill of her room, and the
  clumps of orange and lemon trees that smelt so sweet in the spring when they
  were laden with blossom, and the dark ficus trees, and feathery mimosa, and
  vine-covered arbours. She did not know that she loved them because her baby-heart
  had not yet begun to speak. All that she knew was that Tan-tan was beautiful,
  and the most wonderful boy that ever, ever was. There was nothing that Tan-tan
  could not do. He could jump on one leg far longer than any other boy in the
  country-side. He could throw the bar and the disc much farther even than
  Ameyric who was reckoned the finest thrower at the f&ecirc;tes of Apt. He
  could play bows, and shoot with arrows, and to see him wrestle with some
  of the boys of the neighbourhood was enough to make one scream with excitement.</p>
  <p>Nicolette also knew that Tan-tan could make her cry whenever he was cross
  or impatient with her, but that it was nice, oh! ever so nice!&mdash;when
  he condescended to play with her, and carried her about in his arms, and
  when, at times, when she had been crying just in play, he comforted her with
  a kiss.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>But that was all long, long, so very long ago. Tan-tan now was a big boy,
  and he never slew dragons any more; and when Nicolette through force of habit
  called him Tan-tan, there was always somebody to reprove her; either the
  old Comtesse of whom she stood in mortal awe, or P&eacute;rone who was grandmama&rsquo;s
  maid, and seemed to hold Nicolette in especial aversion, or the reverend
  Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce who came daily from Manosque to the ch&acirc;teau
  in order to give lessons to Bertrand in all sorts of wonderful subjects.
  And so Nicolette had to say Bertrand like everybody else, only when she was
  quite alone with him, would she still say Tan-tan, and slide her small hand
  into his, and look up at him with wonder and admiration expressed in her
  luminous eyes. She took to coming less and less to the ch&acirc;teau; somehow
  she preferred to think of Tan-tan quietly, alone in her cheerful little room,
  from the windows of which she could see the top of the big carob tree to
  which he used to tie her, when she was a captive maiden and he would be slaying
  dragons for her sake. Bertrand was not really Tan-tan when he was at the
  ch&acirc;teau, and Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce or grandmama were nigh and talked
  of subjects which Nicolette did not understand. The happy moments were when
  he and Micheline would come over to the mas, and Marga&iuml; would bake
  a lovely brioche, and they would all sit round the polished table and drink
  cups of delicious coffee with whipped cream on the top, and Bertrand&rsquo;s
  eyes would glow, and he would exclaim: &ldquo;Ah! it is good to be here!
  I wish I could stay here always.&rdquo; An exclamation which threw Nicolette
  into a veritable ecstasy of happiness, until Jaume Deydier, her father, who
  was usually so kind and gentle with them all, would retort in a voice that
  was harsh and almost cruel:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had better express that wish before my lady, your grandmother,
  my lad, and see how she will receive it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But there were other happy moments, too. Though Bertrand no longer slew
  dragons, he went fishing in the L&egrave;ze on his half-holidays, and Nicolette
  was allowed to accompany him, and to carry his basket, or hold his rod, or
  pick up the fish when they wriggled and flopped about upon the stones. Micheline
  seldom came upon these occasions because the way was rough, and it made her
  tired to walk quite so far, and at the ch&acirc;teau no one knew that Nicolette
  was with Bertrand when he fished. Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce was away on parish
  work over at Manosque, and grandmama never walked where it was rough, so
  Bertrand would call at the mas for Nicolette, and together the two children
  would wander up the bank of the turbulent little mountain stream, till they
  came to a pool way beyond Jourdans where fish was abundant, and where a group
  of boulders, grass-covered and shaded by feathery pines and grim carobs,
  made a palace fit for a fairy-king to dwell in. Here they would pretend that
  they were Paul and Virginie cast out on a desert island, dependent on their
  own exertions for their very existence. Bertrand had to fish, else they would
  have nothing to eat on the morrow.</p>
  <p>All the good things which Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s loving hands had packed for
  them in the morning, were really either the result of mysterious foraging
  expeditions which Bertrand had undertaken at peril of his life, or of marvellous
  ingenuity on the part of Nicolette. Thus the luscious brioches were in reality
  crusts of bread which she had succeeded in baking in the sun, the milk she
  had really taken from a wild goat captured and held in duress amongst the
  mountain fastnesses of the island, the eggs Bertrand had collected in invisible
  crags where sea-fowls had their nests. Oh! it was a lovely game of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
  pretend!&rdquo; which lasted until the shadows of evening crept over the
  crest of Luberon, and Bertrand would cast aside his rod, remembering that
  the hour was getting late, and grandmama would be waiting for him. Then they
  would return hand in hand, their shoes slung over their shoulders, their
  feet paddling in the cold, rippling stream. Way away to the west the setting
  sun would light a gorgeous fire in the sky behind Luberon, a golden fire
  that presently turned red, and against which the crests and crags stood out
  clear-cut and sharp, just as if the world ended there, and there was nothing
  behind the mountain-tops.</p>
  <p>In very truth for Nicolette the world did end here; her world! the world
  which held the mas that was her home, and to which she would have liked to
  have taken Tan-tan, and never let him go again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  Le Livre De Raison</b></h2>
  <p>Grandmama sat very stiff and erect at the head of the table; and Bertrand
  sat next to her with the big, metal-clasped book still open before him, and
  a huge key placed upon the book. Micheline was making vain endeavours to
  swallow her tears, and mother sat as usual in her high-backed chair, her
  head resting against the cushions; she looked even paler, more tired than
  was her wont, her eyes were more swollen and red, as if she, too, had been
  crying.</p>
  <p>As Bertrand was going away on the morrow, going to St. Cyr, where he would
  learn to become an officer of the King, grandmama had opened the great brass-bound
  chest that stood in a corner of the living-room, and taken out the &ldquo;Book
  of Reason,&rdquo; a book which contained the family chronicles of the de
  Ventadours from time immemorial, copies of their baptism and marriage certificates,
  their wills, and many other deeds and archives which had a bearing upon the
  family history. Such a book&mdash;called &ldquo;<i>Livre de Raison</i>&rdquo;&mdash;exists
  in every ancient family of Provence; it is kept in a chest of which the head
  of the house has the key, and whenever occasion demands the book is taken
  out of its resting-place, and the eldest son reads out loud, to the assembled
  members of the family, extracts from it, as his father commands him to do.</p>
  <p>Just for a time, when Bertrand&rsquo;s father brought a young wife home
  to the old ch&acirc;teau, his old mother&mdash;over-reluctantly no doubt&mdash;resigned
  her position as head of the house, but since his death, which occurred when
  Bertrand was a mere baby, and Micheline not yet born, grandmama had resumed
  the reins of authority which she had wielded to her own complete satisfaction
  ever since she had been widowed. Of a truth, her weak, backboneless daughter-in-law,
  with her persistent ill-health and constant repinings and tears, was not
  fit to conduct family affairs that were in such a hopeless tangle as those
  of the de Ventadours. The young Comtesse had yielded without a struggle to
  her mother-in-law&rsquo;s masterful assumption of authority; and since that
  hour it was grandmama who had ruled the household, superintended the education
  of her grandchildren, regulated their future, ordered the few servants about,
  and kept the keys of the dower-chests. It was she also who put the traditional &ldquo;Book
  of Reason&rdquo; to what uses she thought best. Mother acquiesced in everything,
  never attempted to argue; it would have been useless, for grandmama would
  brook neither argument nor contradiction, and mother was too ill, too apathetic
  to attempt a conflict in which of a surety she would have been defeated.</p>
  <p>And so when grandmama decided that as soon as Bertrand had attained his
  seventeenth year he should go to St. Cyr, mother had acquiesced without a
  murmur, even though she felt that the boy was too young, too inexperienced
  to be thus launched into the world where his isolated upbringing in far-off
  old Provence would handicap him in face of his more sophisticated companions.
  Only once did she suggest meekly, in her weak and tired voice, that the life
  at St. Cyr offered many temptations to a boy hitherto unaccustomed to freedom,
  and to the society of strangers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cadets have so many days&rsquo; leave,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Bertrand
  will be in Paris a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; grandmama had retorted with a shrug of her shoulders, &ldquo;Sybille
  de Mont-Pahon is no fool, else she were not my sister. She will look after
  Bertrand well enough if only for the sake of Rixende.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which feeble effort mother said nothing more, and in her gentle, unobtrusive
  way set to, to get Bertrand&rsquo;s things in order. Of course she was bound
  to admit that it was a mightily good thing for the boy to go to St. Cyr,
  where he would receive an education suited to his rank, as well as learn
  those airs and graces which since the restoration of King Louis had once
  more become the hall-mark that proclaimed a gentleman. It would also be a
  mightily good thing for him to spend a year or two in the house of his great-aunt,
  Mme. de Mont-Pahon, a lady of immense wealth, whose niece Rixende would in
  truth be a suitable wife for Bertrand in the years to come. But he was still
  so young, so very young even for his age, and to put thoughts of a mercenary
  marriage, or even of a love-match into the boy&rsquo;s head seemed to the
  mother almost a sin.</p>
  <p>But grandmama thought otherwise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is never too soon,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;to make a boy understand
  something of his future destiny, and of the responsibilities which he will
  have to shoulder. Sybille de Mont-Pahon desires the marriage as much as I
  do: she speaks of it again in her last letter to me: Rixende&rsquo;s father,
  our younger sister&rsquo;s child, was one of those abominable traitors to
  his King who chose to lick the boots of that Corsican upstart who had dared
  to call himself Emperor of the French. Heaven being just, the renegade has
  fallen into dire penury and Sybille has cared for his daughter as if she
  were her own, but the stain upon her name can be wiped out only by an alliance
  with a family such as ours. Bertrand&rsquo;s path lies clear before him:
  win Sybille&rsquo;s regard and the affection of Rixende, and the Mont-Pahon
  millions will help to regild the tarnished escutcheon of the Ventadours,
  and drag us all out of this slough of penury and degradation in which some
  of our kindred have already gone under.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus the day drew nigh when Bertrand would have to go. Everything was ready
  for his departure and his box was packed, and Jasmin, the man of all work,
  had already taken it across to Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s; for at six o&rsquo;clock
  on the morrow Deydier&rsquo;s barouche would be on the road down below, and
  it would take Bertrand as far as Pertuis, where he would pick up the diligence
  to Avignon and thence to Paris.</p>
  <p>What wonder that mother wept! Bertrand had never been away from home, and
  Paris was such a long, such a very long way off! Bertrand who had never slept
  elsewhere than in his own little bed, in the room next to Micheline&rsquo;s,
  would have to sleep in strange inns, or on the cushions of the diligence.
  The journey would take a week, and he would have so very little money to
  spend on small comforts and a good meal now and then. It was indeed awful
  to be so poor, that Micheline&rsquo;s christening cup had to be sold to provide
  Bertrand with pocket money on the way. Oh, pray God! pray God that the boy
  found favour in the eyes of his rich relative, and that Rixende should grow
  up to love him as he deserved to be loved!</p>
  <p>But grandmama did not weep. She was fond of Bertrand in her way, fonder
  of him than she was, or had been, of any one else in the world, but in an
  entirely unemotional way. She was ambitious for him, chiefly because in him
  and through him she foresaw the re-establishment of the family fortunes.</p>
  <p>Ever since he had come to the age of understanding, she had talked to him
  about his name, his family, his ancestors, the traditions and glories of
  the past which were recorded in the Book of Reason. And on this last afternoon
  which Bertrand would spend at home for many a long year, she got the book
  out of the chest, and made him read extracts from it, from the story of Guilhem
  de Ventadour who went to the Crusades with King Louis, down to Bertrand&rsquo;s
  great-great-grandfather who was one of the pall-bearers at the funeral of
  the Grand Monarque.</p>
  <p>The reading of these extracts from the Book of Reason took on, on this occasion,
  the aspect of a solemn rite. Bertrand, who loved his family history, read
  on with enthusiasm and fervour, his eyes glowing with pride, his young voice
  rolling out the sentences, when the book told of some marvellous deed of
  valour perpetrated by one of his forbears, or of the riches and splendours
  which were theirs in those days, wherever they went. Nor did he tire or wish
  to leave off until grandmama suddenly and peremptorily bade him close the
  book. He had come to the page where his grandfather had taken up the family
  chronicles, and he had nought but tales of disappointments, of extravagance
  and of ever-growing poverty to record.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, it&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; grandmama said decisively, &ldquo;put
  down the book, Bertrand, and you may lock it up in the chest, and then give
  me back the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;But Bertrand lingered on, the book still open before him, the heavy
  key of the chest laid upon its open pages. He was so longing to read about
  his grandfather, and about his uncle Raymond, around whose name and personality
  there hung some kind of mystery. He thought that since he was going away
  on the morrow, the privileges of an <i>enfant g&acirc;t&eacute;</i> might
  be accorded him to-night, and his eagerly expressed wish fulfilled. But the
  words had scarcely risen to his lips before grandmama said peremptorily: &ldquo;Go,
  Bertrand, do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And when grandmama spoke in that tone it was useless to attempt to disobey.
  Swallowing his mortification, Bertrand closed the book and, without another
  word, he picked up the big key and took the book and locked it up in the
  chest that stood in the furthest corner of the room. He felt cross and disappointed,
  conscious of a slight put upon him as the eldest son of the house and the
  only male representative of the Ventadours. He was by right the head of the
  family, and it was not just that he should be governed by women. Ah! when
  he came back from St. Cyr...!</p>
  <p>But here his meditations were interrupted by the sound of his name spoken
  by his mother.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Bertrand ought to go,&rdquo; she was saying in her gentle and
  hesitating way, &ldquo;and say good-bye to Nicolette and to Jaume Deydier
  and thank him for lending his barouche to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not see the necessity,&rdquo; grandmama replied. &ldquo;He saw
  Deydier last Sunday, and methought he would have preferred to spend the rest
  of his time with his own sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Micheline might go with him,&rdquo; mother urged, &ldquo;as far as
  the mas. She would enjoy half an hour&rsquo;s play with Nicolette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In very truth,&rdquo; grandmama broke in with marked irritation, &ldquo;I
  do not understand, my good Marcelle, how you can encourage Micheline to associate
  with that Deydier child. I vow her manners get worse every day, and no wonder;
  the brat is shockingly brought up by that old fool Marga&iuml;, and Jaume
  Deydier himself has never been more than a peasant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette is only a child,&rdquo; mother had replied with a weary
  sigh, &ldquo;and Micheline will have no one of her own age to speak to,
  when Bertrand has gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As to that, my dear,&rdquo; grandmama retorted icily, &ldquo;you
  have brought this early separation on yourself. Bertrand might have remained
  at home another couple of years, studying with Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce,
  but frankly this intimacy with the Deydiers frightened me, and hastened my
  decision to send him to St. Cyr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a cruel decision, madame,&rdquo; the Comtesse Marcelle rejoined
  with unwonted energy, &ldquo;Bertrand is young and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is seventeen,&rdquo; the old Comtesse interposed in her hard,
  trenchant voice, &ldquo;an impressionable age. And we do not want a repetition
  of the adventure which sent Raymond de Ventadour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, madame, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; her daughter-in-law
  broke in hastily, and glanced with quick apprehension in the direction where
  Bertrand stood gazing with the eager curiosity of his age, wide-eyed and
  excited, upon the old Comtesse, scenting a mystery of life and adventure
  which was being withheld from him.</p>
  <p>Grandmama beckoned to him, and made him kneel on the little cushion at her
  feet. He had grown into a tall and handsome lad of late, with the graceful,
  slim stature of his race, and that wistful expression in the eyes which is
  noticeable in most of the portraits of the de Ventadours, and which gave
  to his young face an almost tragic look.</p>
  <p>Grandmama with delicate, masterful hand, pushed back the fair unruly hair
  from the lad&rsquo;s forehead and gazed searchingly into his face. He returned
  her glance fearlessly, even lovingly, for he was fond, in a cool kind of
  way, of his stately grandmother, who was so austere and so stern to everybody
  and unbent only for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes, which time had not yet dimmed,
  appeared to search the boy&rsquo;s very soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What at, grandmama?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I can trust you, Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trust me?&rdquo; the boy exclaimed, indignant at the doubt. &ldquo;I
  am Comte de Ventadour,&rdquo; he went on proudly. &ldquo;I would sooner die
  than commit a dishonourable action....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereat grandmama laughed;&mdash;an unpleasant, grating laugh it was, which
  acted like an icy douche upon the boy&rsquo;s enthusiasm. She turned her
  gaze on her daughter-in-law, whose pale face took on a curious ashen hue,
  whilst her trembling lips murmured half incoherently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame&mdash;for pity&rsquo;s sake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah bah!&rdquo; the old lady rejoined with a shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;the
  boy will have to know sooner or later that his father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame&mdash;!&rdquo; the younger woman pleaded once more,
  but this time there was just a thought of menace, and less of humility in
  her tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; grandmama rejoined dryly, &ldquo;calm your fears,
  my good Marcelle, I won&rsquo;t say anything to-day. Bertrand goes to-morrow.
  We shall not see him for two years: let him by all means go under the belief
  that no de Ventadour has ever committed a dishonourable action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Throughout this short passage of arms between his mother and grandmother,
  Bertrand had remained on his knees, his great dark eyes, with that wistful
  look of impending tragedy in them, wandering excitedly from one familiar
  face to the other. This was not the first time that his keen ears had caught
  a hint of some dark mystery that clung around the memory of the father whom
  he had never known. Like most children, however, he would sooner have died
  than ask a direct question, but this he knew, that whenever his father&rsquo;s
  name was mentioned, his mother wept, and grandmama&rsquo;s glance became
  more stern, more forbidding than its wont. And, now on the eve of his departure
  for St. Cyr, he felt that mystery encompass him, poisoning the joy he had
  in going away from the gloomy old ch&acirc;teau, from old women and girls
  and senile servitors, out into the great gay world of Paris, where the romance
  and adventures of which he had dreamt ever since he could remember anything,
  would at last fall to his lot, with all the good things of this life. He
  felt that he was old enough now to know what it was that made his mother
  so perpetually sad, that she had become old before her time, sick and weary,
  an absolute nonentity in family affairs over which grandmama ruled with a
  masterful hand. But now he was too proud to ask. They treated him as a child&mdash;very
  well! he was going away, and when he returned he would show them who would
  henceforth be the master of his family&rsquo;s destiny. But for the moment
  all that he ventured on was a renewed protest:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can trust me in everything, grandmama,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  am not a child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grandmama was still gazing into his face, gazing as if she would read all
  the secrets of his young unsophisticated soul: he returned her gaze with
  a glance as searching as her own. For a moment they were in perfect communion
  these two, the old woman with one foot in the grave, and the boy on the threshold
  of life. They understood one another, and each read in the other&rsquo;s
  face, the same pride, the same ambition, and the same challenge to an adverse
  fate. For a moment, too, it seemed as if the grandmother would speak, tell
  the boy something at least of the tragedies which had darkened the last few
  pages of the family chronicles; and Bertrand, quite unconsciously, put so
  much compelling force into his gaze that the old woman was on the point of
  yielding. But once more the mother&rsquo;s piteous voice pleaded for silence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>Her voice broke the spell; grandmama rose abruptly to her feet, which caused
  Bertrand to tumble backwards off the cushion. By the time he had picked himself
  up again, grandmama had gone.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Bertrand felt low and dispirited, above all cross with his mother for interfering.
  He went out of the room without kissing her. At first he thought of following
  grandmama into her room and forcing her to tell him all that he wanted to
  know, but pride held him back. He would not be a suppliant: he would not
  beg, there where in a very short time he would command. There could be nothing
  dishonourable in the history of the de Ventadours. They were too proud, too
  noble, for dishonour even to touch their name. Instinctively Bertrand had
  wandered down to the great hall where hung the portraits of those Ventadours
  who had been so rich and so great in the past. Bertrand was now going out
  into the world in order to rebuild those fortunes which an unjust fate had
  wrested from him. He gazed on the portrait of lovely Rixende. She, too, had
  been rich and brought a splendid dowry to her lord when she married him.
  He had proved ungrateful and she had died of sorrow. Bertrand marvelled if
  in truth his cousin Rixende was like her namesake. Anyway she was rich, and
  he would love her to his dying day if she consented to be his wife.</p>
  <p>Already he loved her because he had been told that she had hair glossy and
  golden like the Rixende of the picture, and great mysterious eyes as blue
  as the gentian; and that her lips smiled like those of Rixende had done,
  whereupon he marvelled if they would be good to kiss. After which, by an
  unexplainable train of thought, he fell to thinking of Nicolette. She had
  sent him a message by Micheline yesterday that she would wait for him all
  the afternoon, on their island beside the pool. It was now past four o&rsquo;clock.
  The shades of evening were fast gathering in, in the valley below, and even
  up here on the heights the ciliated shadows of carob and olive were beginning
  to lengthen. It would take an hour to run as far as the pool; and then it
  would be almost time to come home again, for of late Jaume Deydier had insisted
  that Nicolette must be home before dark. It was foolish of Nicolette to be
  waiting for him so far away. Why could she not be sensible and come across
  to the ch&acirc;teau to say good-bye? The boy was fighting within himself,
  fighting a battle wherein tenderness and vanity were on the one side, and
  a false sense of pride and manliness on the other. In the end it was perhaps
  vanity that won the fight. All day he had been treated as a child that was
  being packed up and sent to school: all day he had been talked to, and admonished,
  and preached at, first by grandmama, and then by Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce;
  he had been wept over by mother and by Micheline: now Nicolette neither admonished
  nor wept. He would not allow her to do the former and she was too sensible
  to attempt the latter. She would probably stand quite still and listen while
  he told her of his plans for the future, and all the fine things he would
  do when he was of age, and rich, and had married his cousin Rixende.</p>
  <p>Nicolette was sensible, she would soothe his ruffled self-esteem and restore
  to him some of that confidence in himself of which he would stand in sore
  need during the long and lonely voyage that lay before him.</p>
  <p>Hardly conscious of his own purpose, Bertrand sauntered down the mountain-side.
  It was still hot on this late September afternoon, and the boy instinctively
  sought, as he descended, the cool shadows that lay across the terraced gradients.
  A pungent scent of rosemary and eucalyptus was in the air, and from the undergrowth
  around came the muffled sound of mysterious, little pattering feet, or call
  of tiny beasts to their mates. Bertrand&rsquo;s head ached, and his hands
  felt as if they were on fire. A curious restlessness and dissatisfaction
  made him feel out of tune with these woods which he loved more than he knew,
  with the blood-red berries of the mountain ash that littered the ground,
  and the low bushes of hazel-nut which autumn had painted a vivid crimson.
  Now he was down in the valley and up again on the spur behind which tossed
  and twirled the clear mountain stream.</p>
  <p>The rough walk was doing him good: his body felt hot but his hands were
  cooler and his temples ceased to throb. When he reached the water&rsquo;s
  edge, he sat down on a boulder and took off his boots and his stockings and
  slung them over his shoulder, and walked up the bed of the stream until the
  waters widened into that broad, silent pool which washed the shores of his
  fairy island. Already from afar he had spied Nicolette; she was watching
  for him on the grassy slope, clinging with one hand to the big carob that
  overhung the pool. She had on a short kirtle of faded blue linen, and a white
  apron and shift, the things she always wore when she was Virginie and he
  was Paul on their fairy island. She had obviously been paddling, for she
  had taken off her shoes and stockings, and her feet and legs shone like rose-tinted
  metal in the cool shade of the trees. Her head was bare and a soft breeze
  stirred the loose brown curls about her head, but Bertrand could not see
  her face, for her head was bent as if she were gazing intently into the pool.
  Way up beyond the valley, the sinking sun had tinged the mountain peaks with
  gold, and had already lit the big, big fire in the sky behind Luberon, but
  here on the island everything was cool and grey and peaceful, with only the
  murmur of the stream over the pebbles to break the great solemn silence of
  the woods.</p>
  <p>When Bertrand jumped upon the big boulder, the one from which he was always
  wont to fish, Nicolette looked up and smiled. But she did not say anything,
  not at first, and Bertrand stood by a little shamefaced and quite unaccountably
  bashful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fish have been shy all the afternoon,&rdquo; were the first words
  that Nicolette said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you try and fish?&rdquo; Bertrand asked.</p>
  <p>Nicolette pointed to a rod and empty basket which lay on the grass close
  by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I borrowed those from Ameyric over at La Bastide,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  wanted to try my hand at it.&rdquo; She paused. Then she swallowed; swallowed
  hard and resolutely as if there had been a very big lump in her throat. Then
  she said quite simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall have to do something on long afternoons when I come here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you are going away too,&rdquo; the boy rejoined, quite angry
  with himself because his voice was husky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not till after the New Year. Then I am going to Avignon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avignon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To school at the Ladies of the Visitation,&rdquo; she explained,
  and added quaintly: &ldquo;I am very ignorant, you know, Tan-tan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;He frowned and she thought that he was cross because she had called
  him Tan-tan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the time you come back,&rdquo; she said meekly, &ldquo;I shall
  be quite used to calling you M. le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid, Nicolette,&rdquo; was all that Bertrand could
  think of saying.</p>
  <p>They were both silent after that, and as Nicolette turned to climb up the
  gradient, Bertrand followed her, half reluctantly. He knew she was going
  to the hut of Paul et Virginie: the place they were wont to call their island
  home. It was just an old, a very old olive tree, with a huge, hollow trunk,
  in which they, as children, could easily find shelter, and in the spring
  the ground around it was gay with buttercups and daisies; and bunches of
  vivid blue gentian and lavender and broom nestled against the great grey
  boulders. Here Bertrand and Nicolette had been in the habit of sitting when
  they pretended to be Paul et Virginie cast off on a desert island, and here
  they would eat the food which &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; had found at peril of his
  life, and which &ldquo;Virginie&rdquo; had cooked with such marvellous ingenuity.
  They had been so happy there, so often. The wood-pigeons would come and pick
  up the crumbs after they had finished eating, and now and then, when they
  sat very, very still, a hare would dart out from behind a great big boulder,
  and peep out at them with large frightened eyes, his long ears sharply silhouetted
  against the sun-kissed earth, and at the slightest motion from them, or wilful
  clapping of their hands, it would dart away again, leaving Bertrand morose
  and fretful because, though he was a big man, he was not yet allowed to have
  a gun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I am a man,&rdquo; was the burden of his sighing, and Nicolette
  would have much ado to bring the smile back into his eyes.</p>
  <p>They had been so happy&mdash;so often. The flowers were their friends, the
  wild pansy with its quizzical wee face, the daisy with the secrets, which
  its petals plucked off one by one, revealed, the lavender which had to be
  carried home in huge bunches for Marga&iuml; to put in muslin bags. All but
  the gentian. Nicolette never liked the gentian, though its petals were of
  such a lovely, heavenly blue. But whenever Bertrand spied one he would pluck
  it, and stick it into his buttonhole: &ldquo;The eyes of my Rixende,&rdquo; he
  would say, &ldquo;will be bluer than this.&rdquo; Fortunately there was not
  much gentian growing on the island of Paul et Virginie.</p>
  <p>They had been so happy here&mdash;so often, away from grandmama&rsquo;s
  stern gaze and Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce&rsquo;s admonitions, when they had
  just pretended and pretended: pretended that the L&egrave;ze was the great
  open sea, on which never a ship came in sight to take them away from their
  beloved island, out into the great world which they had never known.</p>
  <p>But to-day to Bertrand, who was going away on the morrow into that same
  great and unknown world, the game of pretence appeared futile and childish.
  He was a man now, and could no longer play. Somehow he felt cross with Nicolette
  for having put on her &ldquo;Virginie&rdquo; dress, and he pretended that
  his feet were cold, and proceeded to put on his stockings and his boots.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The big ship has come in sight, Bertrand,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;We
  will never see our island again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is nonsense, Nicolette,&rdquo; Bertrand rejoined, seemingly
  deeply occupied in the putting on of his boots. &ldquo;We will often come
  here, very often, when the trout are plentiful and I am home for the holidays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marga&iuml;,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;overheard P&eacute;rone talking
  to Jasmin the other day, and P&eacute;rone said that Mme. la Comtesse did
  not wish you to come home for at least two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! in two years&rsquo; time....&rdquo; he argued, with a shrug
  of his shoulders.</p>
  <p>She offered him some lovely buttered brioche, and said it was fish she had
  dried by a new process on slabs of heated stone, and she also had some milk,
  which she said she had found inside a coconut.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The coconut trees are plentiful on the island,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
  the milk from the nuts is as sweet as if it were sugared.&rdquo; But Bertrand
  would not eat, he said he had already had coffee and cakes in grandmama&rsquo;s
  room, and Nicolette abstractedly started crumbling up the brioche, hoping
  that the wood-pigeons would soon come for their meal. She was trying to recapture
  the spirit of a past that was no more: the elusive spirit of that happy world
  in which she had dwelt alone with Tan-tan. But strive how she might, she
  felt that the outer gates of that world were being closed against her for
  ever. Suddenly she realised that it was getting dark, and that she felt a
  little cold. She squatted on the ground and put on her shoes and stockings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We shall have to hurry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;father does not like
  me to be out long after dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Then she jumped to her feet and started climbing quickly up the stone-built
  terraces, darting at break-neck speed round and about the olive trees, and
  deliberately turning her back on the pool, and the fairy island which she
  knew now that she would never, never see again. Bertrand had some difficulty
  in following her. Though he felt rather cross, he also felt vaguely remorseful.
  Somehow he wished now that he had not come at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;why, you have not said good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And this he said because Nicolette had in truth scurried just like a young
  hare, way off to the right, and was now running and leaping down the gradients
  till she reached the fence of the mas which was her home. Here she leaned
  against the gate. Bertrand, running after her as fast as he could, could
  scarce distinguish her in the fast gathering gloom. He could only vaguely
  see the gleam of her white shift and apron. She was leaning against the gate,
  and a pale gleam of twilight outlined her arm and hand and the silhouette
  of her curly head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; he called again, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go in, I must
  kiss you good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As usual she was obedient to his command, and waited, panting a little after
  this madcap run through the woods, till he was near her.</p>
  <p>He took her hand and kissed her on the temple.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Nicolette,&rdquo; he said cheerily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  forget me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Bertrand,&rdquo; she murmured under her breath.</p>
  <p>Then she turned quickly: and was through the gate and out of sight before
  he could say another word. Ah well! girls were strange beings. So unreliable.
  A man never knew, when she smiled, if she was going to frown the very next
  minute.</p>
  <p>As to that, Bertrand was glad that Nicolette had not cried, or made a scene.
  He was a man now, and really hated the sentimental episodes to which his
  dear mother and even Micheline indulged in so generously. Poor little Nicolette,
  no doubt her life would be rather dull after this, as Micheline was not really
  strong enough for the violent exercise in which Nicolette revelled with all
  the ardour of her warm blood and healthy young body. But no doubt she would
  like the convent at Avignon, and the society of rich, elegant girls, for
  of a truth, as grandmama always said, her manners had of late become rather
  rough, under the tutelage of old Marga&iuml;&mdash;a mere servant&mdash;and
  of her father, who was no more than a peasant. The way she ran away from
  him, Bertrand, just now, without saying a proper &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; argued
  a great want of knowledge on her part of the amenities of social life. And
  when he said to her: &ldquo;Good-bye, Nicolette, do not forget me!&rdquo; she
  should have answered....</p>
  <p>Ah, bah! What mattered? It was all over now, thank the Lord, the good-byes
  and the weepings and the admonitions. The book of life lay open at last before
  him. To-morrow he would shake the dust of old Provence from his feet. To-morrow
  he would begin to read. Paris! Rixende! Wealth! The great big world. Oh,
  God! how weary he was of penury and of restraint!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Honour Of The Name</b></h2>
  <p>Bertrand came home for his Easter holidays after he had passed out of St.
  Cyr and received his commission in the King&rsquo;s bodyguard: an honour
  which he owed as much to his name as to Madame de Mont-Pahon&rsquo;s wealth
  and influence. He was only granted two weeks&rsquo; vacation because political
  conditions in Paris were in a greatly disturbed state just then, owing to
  the King&rsquo;s arbitrary and reactionary policy, which caused almost as
  much seething discontent as that which precipitated the Revolution nigh on
  forty years ago. Louis XVIII in very truth was so unpopular at this time,
  and the assassination of his nephew, the Duc de Berry, two years previously,
  had so preyed upon his mind that he never stirred out of his ch&acirc;teau
  de Versailles save under a powerful escort of his trusted bodyguard.</p>
  <p>It was therefore a matter of great importance for Bertrand&rsquo;s future
  career that he should not be too long absent from duty, which at any moment
  might put him in the way of earning distinction for himself, and the personal
  attention of the King.</p>
  <p>As it happened, when he did come home during the spring of that year 1822,
  Nicolette was detained in the convent school at Avignon because she had measles.
  A very prosy affair, which caused poor little Micheline many a tear.</p>
  <p>She had been so anxious that her dear little friend should see how handsome
  Bertrand had grown, and how splendid he looked in his beautiful blue uniform
  all lavishly trimmed with gold lace, and the k&eacute;pi with the tuft of
  white feathers in front, which gave him such a martial appearance.</p>
  <p>In truth, Micheline was so proud of her brother that she would have liked
  to take him round the whole neighbourhood and show him to all those who had
  known him as a reserved and rather puny lad. She would above all things have
  loved to take him across to the mas and let Jaume Deydier and Marga&iuml; see
  him, for then surely they would write and tell Nicolette about him. Bertrand
  acquiesced quite humouredly in the idea that she should thus take him on
  a grand tour to be inspected, and plans were formed to go over to Apt, and
  see M. le Cur&eacute; there, and Gastinel Barnadou, the mayor of the commune,
  who lived at La Bastide, and whose son Ameyric was considered the handsomest
  lad of the country-side, and the bravest and most skilful too. All the girls
  were in love with him because he could run faster, jump higher, and throw
  the bar and the disc farther than any man between the Caulon and the Durance,
  but Micheline knew that as soon as Huguette or Madeleine or Rigaude set eyes
  on her Bertrand they would never look on any other man again. And Bertrand
  smiled and listened to Micheline&rsquo;s plans, and promised that he would
  go with her to Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s or to Apt, or whithersoever she chose
  to take him. But the Easter holidays came and went: Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce
  came over from Manosque to celebrate Mass in the chapel of the ch&acirc;teau,
  then he went away again. And after Easter the weather turned cold and wet.
  It was raining nearly every day, and for one reason or another it was difficult
  to go over to the mas, and the expedition to Apt was an impossibility because
  there was no suitable vehicle in the coach-house of the ch&acirc;teau, and
  it was impossible to borrow Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s barouche until one had
  paid him a formal visit.</p>
  <p>And so the time went by and the day was at hand when Bertrand had to return
  to Versailles. Instead of going in comfort in Deydier&rsquo;s barouche as
  far as Pertuis, he went with Jasmin in the cart, behind the old horse that
  had done work in and about the ch&acirc;teau for more years than Bertrand
  could remember. The smart officer of the King&rsquo;s bodyguard sat beside
  the old man-of-all-work, on a wooden plank, with his feet planted on the
  box that contained his gorgeous uniforms, and his one thought while the old
  horse trotted leisurely along the rough mountain roads, was how good it would
  be to be back at Versailles. Visions of the brilliantly lighted salons floated
  tantalisingly before his gaze, of the King and the Queen, and M. le Comte
  d&rsquo;Artois, and all the beautiful ladies of the Court, the supper and
  card parties, the Opera and the rides in the Bois. And amidst all these visions
  there was one more tantalising, more alluring than the rest: the vision of
  his still unknown cousin Rixende. She was coming from the fashionable convent
  in Paris, where she had been finishing her education, in order to spend the
  next summer holidays with her great-aunt, Mme. de Mont-Pahon. In his mind
  he could see her as the real counterpart of the picture which he had loved
  ever since he was a boy. Rixende of the gentian-blue eyes and fair curly
  locks! His Lady of the Laurels. Rixende&mdash;the heiress to the Mont-Pahons&rsquo; millions&mdash;who,
  with her wealth, her influence and her beauty, would help to restore the
  glories of the family of Ventadour, which to his mind was still the finest
  family in France. With her money he would restore the old feudal ch&acirc;teau
  in Provence, of which, despite its loneliness and dilapidated appearance,
  he was still inordinately proud.</p>
  <p>Once more the halls and corridors would resound with laughter and merry-making,
  once more would gallant courtiers whisper words of love in fair ladies&rsquo; ears!
  He and lovely Rixende would restore the Courts of Love that had been the
  glory of old Provence in medi&aelig;val days; they would be patrons of the
  Arts, and attract to this fair corner of France all that was greatest among
  the wits, sweetest among musicians, most famous in the world of letters.
  Ah! they were lovely visions that accompanied Bertrand on his lonely drive
  through the mountain passes of his boyhood&rsquo;s home. For as long as he
  could, he gazed behind him on the ruined towers of the old ch&acirc;teau,
  grimly silhouetted against the afternoon sky. Then, when a sharp turn of
  the road hid the old owl&rsquo;s nest from view, he looked before him, where
  life beckoned to him full of promises and of coming joys, and where through
  a haze of fluffy, cream-coloured clouds, he seemed to see blue-eyed Rixende
  holding out to him a golden cornucopia from which fell a constant stream
  of roses, each holding a bag full of gold concealed in its breast.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>It was owing to the war with Spain, and the many conspiracies of the Carbonari
  that Bertrand was unable for the next three years to obtain a sufficient
  extension of leave to visit his old home. He was now a full lieutenant in
  the King&rsquo;s bodyguard, and Mme. de Mont-Pahon wrote with keen enthusiasm
  about his appearance and his character, both of which had earned her appreciation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>It is the dream of my declining days</i>,&rdquo; she wrote to
  her sister, the old Comtesse de Ventadour, &ldquo;<i>that Bertrand and Rixende
  should be united. Both these children are very dear to me: kinship and affection
  binds me equally to both. I am old now, and sick, but my most earnest prayer
  to God is to see them happy ere I close my eyes in their last long sleep.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In another letter she wrote:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Bertrand has won my regard as well as my affection. In this last
   affair at Belfort, whither the King&rsquo;s bodyguard was sent to quell
   the conspiracy of those abominable Carbonari, his bravery as well as his
   shrewdness were liberally commented on. I only wish he would make more
   headway in his courtship of Rixende. Of course the child is young, and
   does not understand how serious a thing life is: but Bertrand also is too
   serious at times, at others he seems to reserve his enthusiasm for the
   card-table or the pleasure of the chase. For his sake, as well as for that
   of Rixende, I would not like this marriage, on which I have set my heart,
   to be delayed too long.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later on she became even more urgent:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>The doctors tell me I have not long to live. Ah, well! my dear,
   I have had my time, let the two children whom I love have theirs. My fortune
   will suffice for a brilliant life for them, I make no doubt: but it must
   remain in its entirety. I will not have Bertrand squander it at cards or
   in pearl-necklaces for the ladies of the Opera. Therefore hurry on the
   marriage on your side, my good Margarita, and I will do my best on mine.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old Comtesse, with her sister&rsquo;s last letter in her hand, hurried
  to her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, Marcelle,&rdquo; she said resolutely, after a hurried and
  unsympathetic inquiry as to the younger woman&rsquo;s health: &ldquo;You
  see how it is. Everything depends on Bertrand. Sybille de Mont-Pahon means
  to divide her wealth between him and Rixende, but he will lose all if he
  does not exert himself. Oh! if I had been a man!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and
  looked down with an obvious glance of contempt on the two invalids, mother
  and daughter, the two puny props of the tottering house of Ventadour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand can but lead an honourable life,&rdquo; the mother argued
  wearily. &ldquo;He is an honourable man, but you could not expect him at
  his age to toady to an old woman for the mere sake of her wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who talks of toadying?&rdquo; the old woman exclaimed, with an irritable
  note in her harsh voice. &ldquo;You are really stupid, Marcelle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Over five years had gone by since first Bertrand went away from the
  old home in Provence, driven as far as Pertuis in Deydier&rsquo;s barouche,
  his pockets empty, and his heart full of longing for that great world into
  which he was just entering. Five years and more, and now he was more than
  a man; he was the head of the house of Ventadour, one of the most renowned
  families in France, who had helped to make history, and whose lineage could
  be traced back to the days of Charlemagne, even though, now&mdash;in the
  nineteenth century&mdash;they owned but a few m&egrave;tres of barren land
  around an ancient and dilapidated ch&acirc;teau.</p>
  <p>Not even grandmama disputed Bertrand&rsquo;s right at this hour to make
  use of the Book of Reason as he thought best, and she had promised him over
  and over again of late, by written word, that when next he came to Ventadour,
  she would give him the key of the chest that contained the family archives.
  To a Proven&ccedil;al, the key to the Book of Reason is a symbol of his own
  status as head of the house, and to Bertrand it meant all that and more,
  because his pride in his family and lineage, and even in the old barrack
  which he called home was the dominating factor in all his actions, and because
  he felt that there could be nothing in his family history that was not worthy
  and honourable. There had been secrets kept from him while he was a child,
  secrets in connection with his father, and with his great-uncle, Raymond
  de Ventadour, but Bertrand was willing to admit that there might have been
  a reason for this, one that was good enough to determine the actions of grandmama,
  who was usually to be trusted in all affairs that concerned the honour of
  the family.</p>
  <p>But somehow things did not occur just as Bertrand had expected. His arrival
  at the ch&acirc;teau was a great event, of course, and from the first he
  felt that he was no longer being treated as a boy, and that even his grandmother
  spoke to him of family affairs in tones of loving submission which went straight
  to his heart, and gave him that consciousness of importance for which he
  had been longing ever since he had left childhood&rsquo;s days behind him.
  But close on a fortnight went by before at last, in deference to his urgent
  demand, she gave him the key of the chest that contained the family archives.
  It was a great moment for Bertrand. He would not touch the chest while anyone
  was in the room; his first delving into those priceless treasures should
  have no witness save the unseen spirit that animated him. With an indulgent
  shrug of her aristocratic shoulders, grandmama left him to himself, and Bertrand
  spent a delicious five minutes, first in turning the key in the old-fashioned
  lock of the chest, then lifting out the book, and turning over its time-stained
  pages.</p>
  <p>He was on the lookout for records that would throw some light upon the life
  and adventures of his uncle Raymond de Ventadour, whose name was never mentioned
  by grandmama, save with a sneer. Bertrand was quite sure that if the Book
  of Reason had been kept as it should, he would learn something that would
  clear up the mystery that hung over that name. He was above all anxious to
  find out something definite about his own father&rsquo;s death, without having
  recourse to the cruel task of interrogating his mother.</p>
  <p>But though the chest contained a number of births, baptismal, marriage and
  death certificates, and the book a few records of the political events of
  the past fifty years, there was nothing there that would throw any light
  upon the secrets that Bertrand long to fathom. Nothing about Raymond de Ventadour,
  save his baptismal certificate and a brief record that he fought under General
  Moreau in Germany, and subsequently in Egypt. What happened to him after
  that, where he went, when he came back&mdash;if he came back at all&mdash;and
  when he died, was not chronicled in this book wherein every passing event,
  however futile, if it was in any way connected with the Ventadours had been
  recorded for the past five hundred years. In the same way there was but little
  said about Bertrand&rsquo;s father, there was his marriage certificate to
  Marcelle de Cercomans, and that of his death the year of Micheline&rsquo;s
  birth. But that was all. A few trinkets lay at the bottom of the chest, among
  these a seal-ring with the arms of the Ventadours engraved thereon, and their
  quaint device, &ldquo;<i>moun amour e moun noum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand loved the device; for his love and for his name, he would in very
  truth have sacrificed life itself. He took up the ring and slipped it on
  his finger; then he continued to turn over the pages of the old book, still
  hoping to extract from it that knowledge he so longed to possess.</p>
  <p>Half an hour later a soft foot-tread behind him roused him from his meditations,
  and two loving arms were creeping round his neck:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you ready, Bertrand?&rdquo; Micheline asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ready for what?&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You said you would come over to the mas with me this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand frowned, and then with obvious moodiness, he picked up the family
  chronicle, and went to lock it up in the big dower-chest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are coming, Bertrand, are you not?&rdquo; Micheline insisted
  with a little catch in her throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to-day, Micheline,&rdquo; he replied after awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cry came with such a note of reproach that the frown deepened on his
  forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandmama has such a violent objection to my going,&rdquo; he said,
  somewhat shamefacedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;at your age&mdash;&rdquo; Micheline broke in
  more bitterly than she had ever spoken to her brother in her life; &ldquo;you
  are going to allow, grandmama, an old woman, to dictate to you as to where
  you should go, and where not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand at this taunt aimed at his dignity had blushed to the roots of
  his hair, and a look of obstinacy suddenly hardened his face, making it seem
  quite set and old.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no question,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;of anybody dictating
  to me: it is a question of etiquette and of usage. It was Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s
  duty in the first instance to pay his respects to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not a question of etiquette or of usage, Bertrand,&rdquo; the
  girl retorted hotly, &ldquo;but of Nicolette our friend and playmate. I do
  not know what keeps Jaume Deydier from setting foot inside the ch&acirc;teau,
  but God knows that he owes us nothing, so why should he come? We on the other
  hand owe him countless kindnesses and boundless generosity, which we can
  never repay save by kindliness and courtesy. Why! when you were first at
  St. Cyr&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Micheline!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The word rang out hard and trenchant, as the old Comtesse sailed into the
  room. Micheline at once held her tongue, cowed as she always was in the presence
  of her autocratic grandmother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the discussion about?&rdquo; grandmama asked coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My going to the mas,&rdquo; Bertrand replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To pay your respects to Jaume Deydier?&rdquo; she asked, with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To see Nicolette,&rdquo; Micheline broke in boldly. &ldquo;Bertrand&rsquo;s
  oldest friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite a nice child,&rdquo; the old Comtesse owned with ironical graciousness. &ldquo;She
  is at liberty to come and see Bertrand when she likes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is too proud&mdash;&rdquo; Micheline hazarded, then broke
  down suddenly in her speech, because grandmama had raised her lorgnette,
  and was staring at her so disconcertingly that Micheline felt tears of mortification
  rising to her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; grandmama said with that biting sarcasm which hurt so
  terribly, and which she knew so well how to throw into her voice. &ldquo;So
  Mademoiselle Deydier is proud, is she? Too proud to pay her respects to the
  Comtesse de Ventadour. Ah, well! let her stay at home then. It is not for
  a Ventadour to hold out a hand of reconciliation to one of the Deydiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reconciliation, grandmama?&rdquo; Bertrand broke in quickly. &ldquo;Has
  there been a quarrel then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment it seemed to Bertrand&rsquo;s keenly searching eyes as if the
  old Comtesse&rsquo;s usually magnificent composure was slightly ruffled.
  Certain it is that a delicate flush rose to her withered cheeks, and her
  retort did not come with that trenchant rapidity to which she had accustomed
  her family and her household. However, the hesitation&mdash;if hesitation
  there was&mdash;was only momentary: an instant later she had shrugged her
  shoulders, elevated her eyebrows with her own inimitably grandiose air, and
  riposted coolly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quarrel? My dear Bertrand? Surely you are joking. How could there
  be a quarrel between us and the&mdash;er&mdash;Deydiers? The old man chooses
  to hold himself aloof from the ch&acirc;teau: but that is right and proper,
  and no doubt he knows his place. We cannot have those sort of people frequenting
  our house in terms of friendship&mdash;especially if your cousin Rixende
  should pay us a visit one of these days. Once an intimacy is set up, it is
  very difficult to break off again&mdash;and surely you would not wish that
  oil-dealer&rsquo;s child to meet your future wife on terms of equality?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rixende is not that yet,&rdquo; Bertrand rejoined almost involuntarily, &ldquo;and
  if she comes here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will have to come here,&rdquo; grandmama said in her most decided
  tone. &ldquo;Sybille de Mont-Pahon wishes it, and it is right and proper
  that Rixende should be brought here to pay her respects to me&mdash;and to
  your mother,&rdquo; she added as with an after-thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;But what,&rdquo; she asked, for he seemed to hesitate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rixende is so fastidious,&rdquo; Bertrand said moodily. &ldquo;She
  has been brought up in the greatest possible luxury. This old house with
  its faded furniture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This old house with its faded furniture,&rdquo; grandmama broke in
  icily, &ldquo;has for centuries been the home of the Comtes de Ventadour,
  a family whose ancestors claimed kinship with kings. Surely it is good enough
  to shelter the daughter of a&mdash;of a&mdash;what is their name?&mdash;a
  Peyron-Bompar! My good Bertrand, your objections are both futile and humiliating
  to us all. Thank God! we have not sunk so low, that we cannot entertain a
  Mademoiselle&mdash;er&mdash;Peyron-Bompar and her renegade father in a manner
  befitting our rank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grandmama had put on her grandest manner, and further argument was, of course,
  useless. Bertrand said nothing more, only stood by, frowning moodily. Micheline
  had succeeded in reaching the shelter of the window recess. From here she
  could still see Bertrand, could watch every play of emotion on his telltale
  face. She felt intensely sorry for him, and ashamed for him as well as for
  herself. But above all for him. He was a man, he should act as a man; whilst
  she was only a weak, misshapen, ugly creature with a boundless capacity for
  suffering, and no more courage than a cat. Even now she was conscious right
  through her pity for Bertrand which dominated every other feeling&mdash;of
  an intense sense of relief that the tattered curtain hung between her and
  grandmama, and concealed her from the irascible old lady&rsquo;s view.</p>
  <p>She tried to meet Bertrand&rsquo;s eyes: but he purposely evaded hers. As
  for him, he felt vaguely ashamed he knew not exactly of what. He dared not
  look at Micheline, fearing to read either reproach or pity in her gaze; either
  of which would have galled him. For the first time, too, in his life, he
  felt out of tune with the ideals of the old Comtesse, whom he revered as
  the embodiment of all the splendours of the Ventadours. Now his pride was
  up in arms against her for her assumption of control. Where was his vaunted
  manhood? Was he&mdash;the head of the house&mdash;to be dictated to by women?
  Already he was lashing himself up into a state of rebellion and of fury.
  Planning a sudden assertion of his own authority, when his grandmother&rsquo;s
  voice, hard and trenchant, acted like a cold douche upon his heated temper,
  and sobered him instantly.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;To revert to the subject of those Deydiers,&rdquo; she said
  coldly, &ldquo;my sister Mme. de Mont-Pahon has made it a point that all
  intimacy shall cease between you and them, before she would allow of Rixende&rsquo;s
  engagement to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Bertrand exclaimed almost involuntarily. &ldquo;In
  Heaven&rsquo;s name, why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could ask her,&rdquo; grandmama retorted quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mme. de Mont-Pahon must understand that I seek my own friends, how
  and where I choose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your great-aunt would probably retort that she will then seek her
  heir also where and how she chooses&mdash;as well as Rixende&rsquo;s future
  husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Bertrand in the excess of his shame and mortification buried his
  head in his hands, she went up to him, and placed her wrinkled aristocratic
  hand upon his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; she said almost gently, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
  childish, my dear Bertrand. Alas! when one is poor, one is always kissing
  the rod. All you want now is patience. Once Rixende is your wife, and my
  obstinate sister has left her millions to you both, and she and I have gone
  to join the great majority, you can please yourself in the matter of your
  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is so shameful to be poor,&rdquo; Bertrand murmured bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; the old woman assented dryly. &ldquo;That is the
  reason why I wish to drag you out of all this poverty and humiliation. But
  do not make the task too hard for me, Bertrand. I am old, and your mother
  is feeble. If I were to go you would soon drift down the road of destiny
  in the footsteps of your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your father like you was weak and vacillating. Sunk in the slough
  of debt, enmeshed in a network of obligations which he had not the moral
  strength to meet, he blew out his brains, when broke the dawn of the inevitable
  day of reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; Bertrand cried impulsively.</p>
  <p>He had jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>Clinging with one hand to the edge of the table, he faced the old Comtesse,
  his eyes gazing horror-struck upon that stern impassive face, on which scarce
  a tremor had passed while she delivered this merciless judgment on her own
  son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; the young man reiterated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true, Bertrand,&rdquo; the old woman rejoined quietly. &ldquo;The
  ring which you now wear, I myself took off his finger, after the pistol dropped
  from his lifeless hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was on the point of saying something more, when a long-drawn sigh, a
  moan, and an ominous thud, stayed the words upon her lips. Bertrand looked
  up at once, and the next moment darted across the room. There lay his mother,
  half crouching against the door frame to which she had clung when she felt
  herself swooning. Bertrand was down on his knees in an instant, and Micheline
  came as fast as she could to his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Micheline, help me!&rdquo; Bertrand whispered hurriedly. &ldquo;She
  is as light as a feather. I&rsquo;ll carry her to her room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The only one who had remained quite unmoved was the old Comtesse. When she
  heard the moan, and then the thud, she glanced coolly over her shoulder,
  and seeing her daughter-in-law, crouching helpless in the doorway, she only
  said dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good Marcelle, why make a fuss? The boy was bound to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already Bertrand had lifted the poor feeble body in his arms, and was
  carrying his mother along the corridor to her own room. Here he deposited
  her on the sofa, on which in truth she spent most of her days, and here she
  lay now with her head against the pillows, her face so pale and drawn that
  Bertrand felt a great wave of love and sympathy for her surging in his heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor little mother,&rdquo; he said tenderly, and knelt by her side,
  chafing her cold hands, and gazing anxiously into her face. She opened her
  eyes, and looked at him. She seemed not to know at first what had happened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand!&rdquo; she murmured, as if astonished to see him there.</p>
  <p>Her astonishment in itself was an involuntary reproach, so very little of
  his time did Bertrand spend with his sad-eyed, ailing mother. A sharp pang
  of remorse went right through him as he noted, for the first time, how very
  aged and worn she had become since last he had been at home. Tears now were
  pouring down her cheeks, and he put out his arms, with a vague longing to
  draw her aching head to his breast, and let her rest there, while he would
  comfort her. She saw the gesture, and the ghost of a smile lit up her pale,
  wan face, and in her eyes there came a pathetic look as of a dog asking to
  be forgiven. With a sudden strange impulse she seized his hand, and drew
  it up to her lips. He snatched it away ashamed and remorseful, but she recaptured
  it, and began stroking it gently, tenderly: and all the while her spare,
  narrow shoulders shook with spasms of uncontrolled sobbing, just like a child
  after it has had a big, big cry. Then suddenly the smile vanished from her
  face, the tender look from her eyes, and an expression of horror crept into
  them as they fastened themselves upon his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That ring, Bertrand,&rdquo; she cried hoarsely, &ldquo;take it off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s ring?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I want to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t wear it, my dear lamb,&rdquo; his mother entreated,
  and moaned piteously just as if she were in pain. &ldquo;Your grandmother
  took it off his dear, dead hand&mdash;oh, she is cruel&mdash;cruel&mdash;and
  without mercy ... she took it off after she&mdash;Oh, my boy! my boy!
  will you ever forgive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His one thought was just to comfort her. Awhile ago, when first his grandmother
  had told him, he had felt bitterly sore. His father dying a shameful death
  by his own hand! The shame of it was almost intolerable! And in the brief
  seconds that elapsed between the terrible revelation and the moment when
  he had to expend all his energies in looking after his mother, had held a
  veritable inferno of humiliation for him. As in a swift and sudden vision
  he saw flitting before him all sorts of little signs and indications that
  had puzzled him in the past, but of which he had ceased to think almost as
  soon as they had occurred, a look of embarrassment here, one of pity there,
  his grandmother&rsquo;s sneers, his mother&rsquo;s entreaties. He saw it
  all, all of a sudden. People who knew pitied him&mdash;or else they sneered.
  The bitterness of it had been awful. But now he forgot all that. With his
  mother lying there so crushed, so weak, so helpless, all that was noble and
  chivalrous in his nature gained the upper hand over his resentment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not for me to forgive, mother dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
  am not my father&rsquo;s judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was so kind and good,&rdquo; the poor soul went on with pathetic
  eagerness, &ldquo;so generous. He only borrowed in order to give to others.
  People were always sponging on him. He never could say no&mdash;to any one&mdash;and
  of course we had no money to spare, to give away....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand frowned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said quite quietly, &ldquo;he&mdash;my father&mdash;borrowed
  some? He&mdash;he had debts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Alas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he did not pay them before he&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour slowly shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; Bertrand asked, &ldquo;since then? since my father&mdash;died,
  have his debts been paid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We could not pay them,&rdquo; his mother replied in a tone of dull,
  aching hopelessness, &ldquo;we had no money. Your grandmother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandmama,&rdquo; he broke in, &ldquo;said though we were poor, we
  could yet afford to entertain our relatives as befitted our rank. How can
  that be if&mdash;if we are still in debt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your grandmother is quite right, my dear boy, quite right.&rdquo; Marcelle
  de Ventadour argued with pathetic eagerness; &ldquo;she knows best. We must
  do our utmost&mdash;we must all do our very utmost to bring about your marriage
  with Rixende de Peyron-Bompar. Your great-aunt has set her heart on it, she
  has&mdash;she has, I know, made it a condition&mdash;your grandmother knows
  about it&mdash;she and Mme. de Mont-Pahon have talked it over together&mdash;Mme.
  de Mont-Pahon will make you her legatee on condition that you marry Rixende.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two Bertrand said nothing. He had jumped to his feet and
  stood at the foot of the couch, with head bent and a deep frown on his brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you had not told me that, mother,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love Rixende, and now it will seem as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As if what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As if I wooed her for the sake of Mme. de Mont-Pahon&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is foolishness, Bertrand,&rdquo; Mme. de Ventadour said, with
  more energy than was habitual to her. &ldquo;Let us suppose that I said nothing.
  And your grandmother may be wrong. Mme. de Mont-Pahon may only wish for the
  marriage because of her affection for you and Rixende.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wish it, too, mother, of course?&rdquo; Bertrand said.</p>
  <p>The mother drew a deep sigh of longing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wish it, my dear?&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Wish it? Why, it would
  turn the hell of my life into a real heaven!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even though,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;even though until that marriage
  is accomplished, we cannot hope to pay off any of my father&rsquo;s debts,
  even though for the next year, at least, we must go on spending more money
  and more money, borrow more and more, to keep me idling in Paris and to throw
  dust in the eyes of Mme. de Mont-Pahon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must do it, Bertrand,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;Your grandmother
  says that we have to think of our name, not of ourselves; that it is the
  future that counts, and not the present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you, mother, what is your idea about it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I, my dear? I? I count for so little&mdash;what does it matter
  what I think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It matters a lot to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour sighed again. For a moment it seemed as if she would
  make of her son a confidant of all her hopes, her secret longings, her spiritless
  repinings; as if she would tell him of what she thought and what she planned
  during those hours and days that she spent on her couch, listless and idle.
  But the habits of a life-time cannot be shaken off in a moment, even under
  the stress of great emotion, and Marcelle had been too long under the domination
  of her mother-in-law to venture on an independent train of thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear lamb,&rdquo; she said tenderly; &ldquo;I only pray for your
  happiness&mdash;and I feel that your grandmother knows best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand gave a quick, impatient little sigh.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What we have to do,&rdquo; his mother resumed more calmly after
  a while, &ldquo;is to try and wipe away the shame that clings around your
  father&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot do that unless we pay what we owe,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot do that, Bertrand,&rdquo; she rejoined earnestly. &ldquo;We
  have not the money. At the time of&mdash;of your father&rsquo;s death the
  creditors took everything from us that they could: we were left with nothing&mdash;nothing
  but this old owl&rsquo;s nest. It, too, had been heavily mortgaged, but&mdash;but
  a&mdash;but a kind friend paid off the mortgage, then allowed us to stay
  on here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A kind friend,&rdquo; Bertrand asked. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; his mother replied after an imperceptible
  moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;Your grandmother knows about it, she has
  always kept control of our money. We must leave it to her. She knows best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Bertrand relapsed into silence, she insisted more earnestly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do think that your grandmother knows best, do you not, Bertrand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said with an impatient sigh, and turned away.</p>
  <p>It was then that he caught sight of Micheline&mdash;Micheline who, as was
  her wont, had withdrawn silently into the nearest window recess, and had
  sat there, patient and watchful, until such time as it pleased some one to
  take notice of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Micheline,&rdquo; Bertrand said, &ldquo;have you been here all the
  time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the time,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; he remarked, and gazed out of the window
  to distant Luberon, behind whose highest peak the sunset had already lighted
  his crimson fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too late to go over to the mas this afternoon,&rdquo; he added decisively.</p>
  <p>A look of great joy lit up Micheline&rsquo;s peaky little face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you are coming, Bertrand,&rdquo; she cried impulsively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because it is late. But to-morrow
  we&rsquo;ll go together. I would like to&mdash;to thank Jaume Deydier for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; his mother broke in anxiously, &ldquo;there is
  nothing for which you need thank Jaume Deydier. Your grandmother would not
  wish it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Bertrand said emphatically, &ldquo;may dictate to
  me on a point of honour. I know where my duty lies. To-morrow I am going
  to the mas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour&rsquo;s pale face took on an expression of painful
  anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If she thought I had said anything,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>Bertrand bent down and kissed her tenderly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandmama shall know nothing,&rdquo; he said reassuringly; &ldquo;but
  for once I must act as I wish, not as she commands. As you said just now,
  mother dear, we must not think of ourselves, but of our name, and we must
  try to wipe away the shame that clings round my father&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to say this quietly, with as little bitterness as possible, but
  in the end his voice broke, and he ran quickly out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  The Despatch</b></h2>
  <p>Micheline was happy once more. For a little while&mdash;oh! a very little
  while&mdash;this afternoon her idol had tottered on the pedestal upon which
  she had placed him. The brother whom she worshipped, admired, looked up to,
  with all the ardour and enthusiasm of her reserved nature, was perhaps not
  quite so perfect as her affection had painted him. He seemed almost as if
  he were proud and ungrateful, too proud to renew those delicious ties of
  childish friendship which she, Micheline, looked on as almost sacred.</p>
  <p>But Bertrand did not know that it was in truth Jaume Deydier who, during
  those trying years at St. Cyr, had generously paid the debts which the young
  cadet had thoughtlessly contracted&mdash;dragged as he had been into a vortex
  of fashionable life where every one of his comrades was richer than he. Bertrand,
  driven to distraction by the pressure of monetary difficulties, had confessed
  to Micheline, and Micheline had quite naturally gone with the sad story to
  her bosom friend, Nicolette. She had wept, and Nicolette had wept, and the
  two girls fell into one another&rsquo;s arms and then thought and planned
  how best Bertrand could be got out of his difficulties without reference
  to grandmama. And lo! and behold, Bertrand presently received five thousand
  francs from his dear sister Micheline. They were, she darkly hinted, the
  proceeds of certain rigid economies which she had effected in the management
  of her pin money. Bertrand accepted both money and explanation without much
  compunction, but unfortunately through his own indiscretion, grandmama got
  to hear of his debts and of the five thousand francs. It was, of course,
  impossible to deceive grandmama for long. Within half an hour the true secret
  of Bertrand&rsquo;s benefactor was wrung out of the unwilling Micheline.</p>
  <p>That a young Comte de Ventadour should make debts whilst he was at St. Cyr
  was a perfectly proper and natural state of things; avarice or thrift would
  have been a far greater crime in the eyes of the old Comtesse, than the borrowing
  of a few thousands from bourgeois tradesmen who could well afford it, without
  much knowledge as to how those thousands would be repaid. Therefore she never
  thought of blaming Bertrand. On the other hand, she was very severe with
  Micheline, not so much for having aroused Nicolette&rsquo;s sympathy on behalf
  of Bertrand, as for continuing this friendship with the people at the mas,
  which she&mdash;grandmama&mdash;thought degrading. And there the matter ended.</p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier was passing rich&mdash;was the old Comtesse&rsquo;s argument&mdash;he
  and his forbears had enriched themselves at the expense of their feudal lords,
  grabbing their lands whenever opportunity arose. No doubt the present owner
  of those splendid estates which once had belonged to the Comtes de Ventadour,
  felt some compunction in knowing that the present scion of that ancient race
  was in financial difficulties, and no doubt, too, that his compunction led
  to a tardy liberality. It all was perfectly right and just. Margarita de
  Ventadour&rsquo;s own arguments completely eased her conscience. But she
  did not enlighten Bertrand. The boy was hot-headed, he might do something
  foolish and humiliating. The money must be accepted as a matter of course:
  grandmama outwardly must know nothing about it. Nor Bertrand.</p>
  <p>And so Bertrand was kept in the dark as to this and other matters which
  were far more important.</p>
  <p>Even to-day he had been told nothing: he had only guessed. A word from Micheline
  about St. Cyr, one from his mother about the kind friend who had saved the
  old ch&acirc;teau from the hands of the creditors had set his young mind
  speculating, but that was all.</p>
  <p>There was much of his grandmother&rsquo;s temperament in Bertrand; much
  of that racial pride of family and arrogance of caste, which not even the
  horrors of the Revolution had wholly eradicated. But underlying that pride
  and arrogance there were in Bertrand de Ventadour some fine aspirations and
  impulses of manhood and chivalry, such as the one which caused him to declare
  his intention of visiting Jaume Deydier immediately.</p>
  <p>Micheline was now quite happy: for a little while she had almost thought
  the beloved brother vain and ungrateful. Now her heart was already full of
  excuses for him. He was coming on the morrow with her to see Nicolette. It
  was perhaps a little late to-day. They had their dinner early at the mas,
  and it would not do to interrupt them all at their meal. But to-morrow she
  and Bertrand would go over in the morning, and spend a long, happy day in
  the dear old house, or in the garden under the shade of the wild vine just
  as they used to do in the past.</p>
  <p>The evening was a glorious one. It seemed as if summer, in these her declining
  days, was donning her most gorgeous garb to dazzle the eyes of mortals, ere
  she sank, dying into the arms of autumn. One or two early frosts had touched
  the leaves of the mountain ash with gold and the hips and haws on the wild
  rose-bushes were of a dazzling crimson. And so good to eat!</p>
  <p>Micheline who was quite happy now, was picking them in big baskets full
  to take over to Marga&iuml;, who made such delicious preserves from them.
  Overhead the starlings were making a deafening noise; the olives were plentiful
  this year and very nearly ripe, and a flock of these chattering birds had
  descended upon the woods around the ch&acirc;teau and were eating their fill.
  The evening was drawing in rapidly, in this land where twilight is always
  short. Luberon frowning and majestic had long since hidden the glory of the
  setting sun, and way out to the east the moon, looking no more substantial
  than a small round fluffy cloud, gave promise of a wonderful night. Looking
  straight across the valley Micheline could glimpse the whitewashed walls
  of the old mas gleaming, rose-tinted by the afterglow, above the terraced
  gradients, and through the curtains of dwarf olive trees. She knew that at
  a certain window into which a climbing crimson rose peeped in, blossom-laden,
  Nicolette would be sitting at this hour, gazing across the valley to the
  towers of the old ch&acirc;teau where she had spent so many happy days in
  the past. It almost seemed to Micheline that despite the distance she could
  see, in a framework of tangled roses, Nicolette&rsquo;s brown curls turned
  to gold by the last kiss of the setting sun, and down in the garden the arbour
  draped in a mantle of disorderly vine, which flaunted its riotous colours,
  its purples and chromes and crimsons, in the midst of the cool grey-greens
  of stately pine and feathery mimosa. Anon, scared by the sudden sharp report
  of a distant gun, the host of starlings rose with strident cries and like
  a thin black cloud spread itself over the mountain-side, united and disintegrated
  and united again, then vanished up the valley. After which all was still.</p>
  <p>Micheline put down her basket and throwing out her frail, flat chest she
  breathed into her lungs the perfumed evening air, fragrant with the scent
  of lavender and wild thyme: and with a gesture of tenderness and longing,
  she spread out her arms, as if she would enfold in a huge embrace all that
  was beautiful and loving, and tender in this world that, hitherto, had held
  so few joys for her. And while she stood, thus silent and entranced, there
  descended upon the wide solitude around the perfect mysterious hush of evening,
  that hush which seems most absolute at this hour when the crackling, tiny
  twigs on dead branches shiver at touch of the breeze, and the hum of cockchafers
  fills the air with its drowsy buzz.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Micheline&rsquo;s attention was arrested by strange happenings
  on the road, way down below. A horseman had come in sight. When Micheline
  first caught sight of him, he was riding at full speed, but presently he
  checked his horse and looked about him, after which he deliberately turned
  up the rough road which led, winding up the mountain-side, to the gate of
  the ch&acirc;teau.</p>
  <p>The man was dressed in a bottle-green coat which had some gold lace about
  it; he wore drab breeches and his boots and coat were powdered with dust
  as if he had come a long way. Micheline also noted that he had a leather
  wallet slung by a strap around his shoulders. Anon a sharp turn in the road
  hid the horseman from view.</p>
  <p>The young girl was conscious of a pleasant thrill of expectation. Visitors
  at the old ch&acirc;teau were a rare occurrence, and the lonely rider was
  obviously coming here, as the rough road led nowhere else. Though she could
  no longer see him, she could hear the thud of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs drawing
  nearer every moment.</p>
  <p>The main entrance of the ch&acirc;teau was through a monumental door in
  the square tower, contiguous to the wing that held the habitable rooms. This
  tower and door being on the other side of the building from where Micheline
  was standing, she could not possibly hope to see what would happen, when
  presently the visitor would request admittance. This being a quite unendurable
  proposition, Micheline, forgetting the hips and haws, as well as her own
  dignity, hurried round the ch&acirc;teau and was just in time to see Jasmin
  shuffling across the court-yard and the rider drawing rein, and turning in
  the saddle in order to ask him a question with the air of a man who had never
  been accustomed to wait.</p>
  <p>Micheline caught the sound of her brother&rsquo;s name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Comte de Ventadour,&rdquo; the visitor was saying to Jasmin, &ldquo;lieutenant
  in the first company of His Majesty&rsquo;s bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is here, monsieur,&rdquo; Jasmin replied, &ldquo;but M. le Comte&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Comte de Ventadour,&rdquo; Micheline broke in eagerly, as the
  new-comer himself rapidly jumped out of the saddle, &ldquo;is within. Would
  you wish, monsieur, to speak with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man saluted in correct military style.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the bearer of an urgent despatch to
  M. le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All at once Micheline felt her excitement give way to prosaic anxiety. An
  urgent despatch? What could it mean?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give yourself the trouble to enter, monsieur,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>The big front door was always on the latch (there was nothing to tempt the
  foot-pad or the housebreaker in the ch&acirc;teau de Ventadour) and Micheline
  herself pushed it open. The mysterious visitor having carefully fastened
  his horse to the iron ring in the outside wall, followed the young girl into
  the vast, bare hall. She was beginning to feel a little frightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you be pleased to walk up, monsieur?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Jasmin
  will go and call M. le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By your leave, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; the messenger replied, &ldquo;I
  will wait here for M. le Comte&rsquo;s pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was nothing for it but to send Jasmin upstairs to go and tell Bertrand;
  and alas! there was no excuse for Micheline to wait and hear what the urgent
  despatch might be about. She certainly felt anxious, as such a thing had
  never occurred before. No one at the old owl&rsquo;s nest ever received urgent
  despatches from anywhere. Dragging her lame leg slowly across the hall, Micheline
  went, hoping against hope that Bertrand would be down soon before she had
  reached the top of the stairs, so that she could hear the visitor deliver
  his message. But Jasmin was slow, or Bertrand difficult to find. However
  slowly Micheline moved along, she was across the hall and up the stairs at
  one end of the gallery before Bertrand appeared at the other. Jasmin preceded
  him, carrying a candle. It was now quite dark, only through the tall oriel
  window at the top of the stairs the moon sent a pale, wan ray of light. Micheline
  could no longer see the mysterious messenger: the gloom had swallowed him
  up completely, but she could hear Bertrand&rsquo;s footsteps descending the
  stone stairs and Jasmin shuffling along in front of him. She could see the
  flicker of candlelight on the great bare walls, the forged iron banister,
  the tattered matting on the floor, which had long since replaced the magnificent
  Aubusson carpet of the past.</p>
  <p>The whole scene had become like a dream. Micheline leaning against the balustrade
  of the gallery, strained her ears to listen. She only caught snatches of
  what the man was saying because he spoke in whispers. Jasmin had put the
  candle down upon the table, and then had shuffled quietly away. At one time
  Micheline heard the rustle of paper, at another an exclamation from Bertrand.
  In the end Bertrand said formally:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where do you go after this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Straight back to Avignon, mon lieutenant,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;to
  report.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can say I will start in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service, mon lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A moment or two later Micheline heard the click of the man&rsquo;s spurs
  as he saluted and turned to go, then the ring of his footsteps upon the flagged
  floor: finally the opening and closing of the great entrance door, Bertrand
  calling to Jasmin, the clink of metal and creaking of leather, the champing
  of bit and clang of iron hoofs. The messenger had gone, and Bertrand was
  still lingering in the hall. Micheline craned her neck and saw him standing
  beside the heavy oak table. The light of the candle flickered about him,
  throwing a warm fantastic glow and weird distorting shadows upon his face,
  his hands, the paper which he held between his fingers, and in which he seemed
  wholly absorbed. After a few moments which appeared like an eternity to the
  watching girl, he folded the paper and slipped it into his pocket. Then he
  turned to cross the hall. Micheline met him at the top of the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Bertrand?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly. &ldquo;I am
  so anxious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not know she was there, and started when he heard her voice. But
  at once he took hold of her hand and patted it reassuringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be anxious about, little sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
  I shall have to leave here to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A message came through by the new aerial telegraph to Avignon. More
  troops have left for Spain. All leaves are cancelled. I have to rejoin my
  regiment at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you are not going to the
  war?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; he replied with a touch of bitterness. &ldquo;If
  the King&rsquo;s bodyguard was to be sent to the front it would mean that
  France was once more at her last gasp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no fear of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why should you say that you are afraid that you are not going
  to the war?&rdquo; Micheline asked, and her eyes, the great pathetic eyes
  of a hopeless cripple, fastened on the brother&rsquo;s face a look of yearning
  anxiety. The ghostly light of the moon came shyly peeping in through the
  tall, open window: it fell full upon his handsome young face, which wore
  a perturbed, spiritless look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, little sister,&rdquo; he said dejectedly, &ldquo;life does
  not hold such allurements for me, does it, that I should cling desperately
  to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can you say that, Bertrand?&rdquo; the girl retorted. &ldquo;You
  love Rixende, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With all my soul,&rdquo; he replied fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she loves you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; he said with a strange unaccountable sigh; &ldquo;I
  do firmly believe,&rdquo; he added slowly, &ldquo;that Rixende loves me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this he made no reply, and anon passed his hand across his forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right, Micheline, I have no right to talk as I do&mdash;to
  feel as I feel to-night&mdash;dispirited and discouraged. All the world smiles
  to me,&rdquo; he added with a sudden outburst of liveliness, which may perhaps
  not have rung quite true in the anxious sister&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;I love
  Rixende, Rixende loves me; I am going to inherit tante Sybille&rsquo;s millions,
  and dejection is a crime. So now let us go to mother and break the news of
  my departure to her. I shall have to leave early in the morning, little sister.
  We&rsquo;ll have to say good-bye to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And not say good-bye to Nicolette after all,&rdquo; Micheline murmured
  under her breath.</p>
  <p>But this Bertrand did not hear.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Spirit Of The Past</b></h2>
  <p>Mother wept, and grandmama was full of wise saws and grandiose speeches.
  So many gallant officers of the King&rsquo;s Army having gone to Spain, those
  of His Majesty&rsquo;s bodyguard would be all the more conspicuous at Court,
  all the more sought after in society.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And remember, Bertrand,&rdquo; was one of the last things she said
  to him that night, &ldquo;when you next come home, Rixende de Peyron-Bompar
  must pay us a visit too, with that atrocious father of hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, grandmama&mdash;&rdquo; Bertrand hazarded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush, boy! do not start on that humiliating subject again. What do
  you take me for? I tell you Rixende shall be entertained in a style that
  will not cause you to blush. Besides,&rdquo; she added with a shrug of her
  aristocratic shoulders, &ldquo;Sybille insists that Rixende shall see her
  future home before she will acquiesce in the formal <i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i>.
  So put a good face on it, my boy, and above all, trust to me. I tell you
  that Rixende&rsquo;s visit here will be a triumph for us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grandmama was so sure, so emphatic, above all so dominating, that Bertrand
  gratefully followed her lead. After all, he loved his ancestral home, despite
  its shortcomings. He was proud of it, too. Think of that old Peyron-Bompar,
  who did not even know who his grandfather was, being brought in contact with
  traditions that had their origin in Carlovingian times. That the tapestries
  on the walls were tattered and faded, the curtains bleached to a drab, colourless
  tone, the carpets in holes, the masonry tumbling to ruins, was but a glorious
  evidence of the antiquity of this historic ch&acirc;teau. Bertrand was proud
  of it. He longed to show it to Rixende, and to stand with her in the great
  ancestral hall, where hung the portraits of his glorious forbears. Rambaud
  de Ventadour, the friend of the Grand Monarque, Guilhem de Ventadour, the
  follower of St. Louis, and Rixende, surnamed Riande&mdash;because she was
  always laughing, and whose beauty had rivalled that of Montespan.</p>
  <p>Even to-night he paid a visit to those beloved portraits. He seemed to want
  to steep himself in tradition, and the grandeur and chivalry which was his
  richest inheritance. The great hall looked vast and silent in the gloom,
  like the graveyard of glorious dead. The darkness was mysterious, and filled
  him with a delicious awe: through the tall windows the moonlight came peeping
  in, spectral and wan, and Bertrand would have been neither surprised nor
  frightened if, lured by that weird light, the ghosts of his forbears were
  to step out of the lifeless canvases and march in solemn procession before
  him, bidding him remember that he was one of them, one of the imperishable
  race of the Ventadours, and that his chief aim in life must be to restore
  the name and family to their former glory.</p>
  <p>Grandmama was quite right when she said that the time had now come when
  the individual must cease to count, and everything be done for the restoration
  of the family to its former importance. He himself must be prepared to sacrifice
  his noblest impulses to the common cause. Thank God! his heart was not in
  conflict with his duty. He loved Rixende, the very woman whom it was his
  duty to marry, and this urgent call back to Versailles had been thrice welcome,
  since it would take him back to his beloved one&rsquo;s side, at least one
  month before he had hoped to return. A pang of remorse shot through his heart,
  however, when he thought of the mas: of Jaume Deydier, who had been a kind
  friend to his mother in the hour of her distress, and of Nicolette, the quaint,
  chubby child, who was wont to worship him so. Quite unaccountably his memory
  flew back to that late afternoon five years ago, when, troubled and perplexed,
  very much as he was now, he had suddenly thought of Nicolette, and felt a
  strange, indefinable yearning for her, just as he did now.</p>
  <p>And almost unconsciously he found himself presently wandering through the
  woods. The evening air was warm and fragrant and so clear, so clear in the
  moonlight that every tiny twig and delicate leaf of olive and mimosa cast
  a sharp, trenchant shadow as if carved with a knife.</p>
  <p>Poor little Nicolette! She had been a pretty child, and her admiration for
  him, Bertrand, had been one of the nicest traits in her character. He had
  not seen her since that moment, five years ago, when she stood leaning against
  the gate with the riotous vine as a background to her brown curls, and the
  lingering twilight defining her arms and the white shift which she wore.
  He supposed that she must have grown, and, in truth, she must have altered
  a good deal, during her stay at the convent school in Avignon. No doubt,
  too, her manners would have improved; she had been rather tomboyish and very
  childish in her ideas. Poor little Nicolette! No doubt she would feel hurt
  that he had not been over to the mas, but it had been difficult, very difficult;
  and he really meant to go on the morrow with Micheline, if this urgent despatch
  had not come for him to return to duty at once. Poor little Nicolette!</p>
  <p>Then all at once he saw her. Absorbed in thought he had wandered on and
  on without realising that he had gone so far. And now he found himself down
  in the Valley of the L&egrave;ze, picking his way on the rough stones left
  high and dry during the summer in the river bed. And there in front of him
  was the pool with the overhanging carob tree, and beside it stood Nicolette.
  He recognised her at once, even though the light of the moon only touched
  her head and neck and the white fichu which she wore about her shoulders.
  She seemed very different from the child whom he remembered, for she looked
  tall and slender, and her brown curls did not tumble all about her face as
  they were wont to do; some of them did still fall over her forehead and ears,
  and their delicate tendrils glistened like chestnuts in the mysterious light,
  but the others were hidden under the quaint head-dress, the small, round
  knob of muslin which she wore over the crown of her head like most Proven&ccedil;al
  maidens.</p>
  <p>Whether she had expected him or not, Bertrand could not say. At sight of
  him she gave a little cry of delight and ran forward to greet him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I knew that you would come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the olden days, she used, when she saw him, to run to him and throw her
  arms round his neck. She also would have said &ldquo;Tan-tan&rdquo; in the
  olden days. This time, however, she put out her hand, and it also seemed
  quite natural for Bertrand to stoop and kiss it, as if she were a lady. She,
  however, withdrew her hand very quickly, though not before he had perceived
  that it was very soft and very warm, and quivered in his grasp just like
  a little bird.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How funny to find you here, Nicolette,&rdquo; he said somewhat lamely. &ldquo;And
  how you have grown,&rdquo; he added.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Marga&iuml; thought you would
  say that when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was coming over with Micheline to-morrow,&rdquo; he broke in quickly. &ldquo;It
  was all arranged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her face lit up with a wonderful expression of relief and of joy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I knew&mdash;I knew&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand smiled, for she looked so happy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you know, Nicolette?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marga&iuml; said you would not come to see us, because you were too
  proud, now that you were an officer of the King&rsquo;s guard. Time went
  on, and even father said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you knew better, eh, little one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;that you would not turn your
  back on old friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He felt so ashamed of himself that he could not say anything for the moment.
  Indeed, he felt foolish, standing here beside this village girl with that
  silly peasant&rsquo;s head-dress on her head, who, nevertheless, had the
  power to make him feel mean and ungrateful. She seemed to be waiting for
  him to say something, but as he appeared moody and silent, she went on after
  a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marga&iuml; will have to bake a very large <i>brioche</i> to-morrow
  as a punishment for having doubted you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; he rejoined dejectedly, &ldquo;I cannot come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the next day&mdash;why! it will be Sunday, and father&rsquo;s
  birthday, we will....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shook his head. He dared not meet her eyes, those great hazel eyes of
  hers, which had golden lights in them just like a topaz. He knew that the
  expression of joy had gone out of them, and that the tears were beginning
  to gather. So he just put his hand in his pocket and drew out the letter
  which the soldier-messenger had brought from Avignon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was all arranged,&rdquo; he said haltingly, &ldquo;Micheline and
  I were coming over to-morrow. I wanted to see your father and&mdash;and thank
  him, and I longed to see you, Nicolette, and dear old Marga&iuml;&mdash;but
  a messenger came with this, a couple of hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held out the paper to her, but she did not take it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is very dark,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I could not read
  it. What does it say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That by order of His Majesty the King, Lieutenant Comte de Ventadour
  must return to duty at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Does that mean&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you must go away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Early to-morrow morning, alas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She said nothing more for the moment, and with a sigh he slipped the paper
  back into his pocket. The situation was uncomfortable, and Bertrand felt
  vaguely irritated. His nerves were on edge. Everything around him was so
  still that the sudden flutter of a bird in the branches of the olive tree
  gave him an uneasy start. Only the murmur of the L&egrave;ze on its narrow
  rocky bed broke the silence of the valley, and far away the cooing of a wood-pigeon
  settling down to rest. Bertrand would have liked to say something, but the
  words choked him before they were uttered. He would have liked to speak lightly
  of the days of long ago, of Paul et Virginie, and their desert island. But
  he could not. Everything around him seemed to reproach him for his apathy
  and his indifference; the carob tree, and the boulder from the top of which
  he used to fish, the crest of the old olive tree with the hollow trunk that
  was Paul et Virginie&rsquo;s island home, the voice of the wood-pigeon, and
  the soughing of the night breeze through the delicate branches of the pines.
  And above all, the scent of rosemary, of wild thyme and sweet marjoram that
  filled the air, gave him a sense of something irretrievable, of something
  that he, with a callous hand, was wilfully sweeping away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Bertrand, that you cannot come to the mas,&rdquo; Nicolette
  said after a moment or two, which to Bertrand seemed like an hour, &ldquo;but
  duty is duty. We must hope for better luck next time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her quick, measured voice broke the spell that seemed to be holding him
  down. Bertrand drew a deep sigh of relief. What a comfort that she was so
  sensible, poor Nicolette!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You understand, don&rsquo;t you, Nicolette?&rdquo; he said lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Father will be sorry,
  but he, too, will understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Marga&iuml;?&rdquo; he asked lightly.</p>
  <p>She smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know what Marga&iuml; is, always
  grumbling and scolding. Age has not softened her temper, nor hardened her
  heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then they looked at one another. Bertrand murmured &ldquo;Good old Marga&iuml;!&rdquo; and
  laughed, and Nicolette laughed in response. She was quite gay now. Oh! she
  was undoubtedly changed! Five years ago she would have cried if she thought
  Bertrand was going away and she would not see him for a time. She would not
  have made a scene, but she would have cried. Now she scarcely seemed to mind.
  Bertrand had been a fool to worry as to what she would think or do. She began
  asking him questions quite naturally about his life at the Court, about the
  King and the Queen. She even asked about Mademoiselle de Peyron-Bompar, and
  vowed she must be even more beautiful than the lovely Lady of the Laurels.
  But Bertrand was in that lover-like state when the name of the loved one
  seems almost too sacred to be spoken by another&rsquo;s lips. So the subject
  of Rixende was soon dropped, and Nicolette chatted of other things.</p>
  <p>Bertrand felt that he was losing control over his nerves. He felt an ever-growing
  strange irritation against Nicolette. In this elusive moonlight she seemed
  less and less like the girl he had known, the podgy little tom-boy who used
  to run after him crying for &ldquo;Tan-tan&rdquo;; less of a woman and more
  of a sprite, a dweller of these woods, whose home was in the hollow trunks
  of olive trees, and who bathed at dawn in the mountain stream, and wound
  sprigs of mimosa in her hair. Anon, when she laughingly taunted him about
  his good fortunes with the lovely ladies of Versailles, he ordered her sharply
  to be silent.</p>
  <p>At one time he tried to speak to her about their island, their wonderful
  life of make-believe: he tried to lead her back to the carob tree and to
  recapture with her for an instant the spirit of the past. But she seemed
  to have forgotten all about the island, and deliberately turned to walk away
  from it, back along the stony shore of the L&egrave;ze, never once glancing
  behind her, even when he laughingly declared that a ship had appeared upon
  the horizon, and they must hoist up the signal to draw her lookout man&rsquo;s
  attention to their desert island.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Bertrand did not walk with her as far as the mas. Nicolette herself declared
  that it was too late; father would be abed, and Marga&iuml; was sure to be
  cross. So they parted down on the road, Bertrand declaring that he would
  stand there and watch until he knew that she was safely within.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How foolish of you, Bertrand,&rdquo; she said gaily. &ldquo;Why should
  you watch? I am often out much later than this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But not with me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what must I do to reassure you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Put a light in your bedroom window. I would see it from here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she assented with a careless shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;Good
  night, Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Nicolette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took her hand and drew her to him. He wanted to kiss her just as he used
  to do in the past, but with a funny little cry she evaded him, and before
  he could detain her, she had darted up the slope, and was bounding upwards
  from gradient to gradient like a young antelope on the mountain-side.</p>
  <p>Bertrand stood quite still watching the glint of her white cap and her fichu
  between the olive trees. She seemed indeed a sprite: he could not see her
  feet, but her movements were so swift that he was sure they could not touch
  the ground, but that she was floating upwards on the bosom of a cloud. The
  little white cap from afar looked like a tiny light on the crown of her head
  and the ends of her fichu trailed behind her like wings. Soon she was gone.
  He could no longer see her. The slope was steep and the scrub was dense.
  It had enfolded her and hidden her as the wood hides its nymphs, and the
  voice of the mountain stream mocked him because his eyes were not keen enough
  to see. Overhead the stars with myriads of eyes could watch her progress
  up the heights, whilst he remained below and could no longer see. But the
  air remained fragrant with the odour of dried lavender and sun-kissed herbs,
  and from the woods around there came in sweet, lulling waves, wafted to his
  nostrils, the scent of rosemary which is for remembrance.</p>
  <p>Bertrand waited awhile. The moon veiled her radiance behind a mantle of
  gossamer clouds, which she had tinged with lemon-gold, the sharp, trenchant
  shadows of glistening lights gave place to a uniform tone of silvery-grey.
  The trees sighed and bowed their crests under a sudden gust of wind, which
  came soughing down the valley, and all at once the air grew chill as if under
  a breath from an ice-cold mouth. Bertrand shivered a little and buttoned
  his coat. He thought that Nicolette must have reached the mas by now. Perhaps
  Marga&iuml; was keeping her talking downstairs, or she had forgotten to put
  her light in her bedroom window.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the trees had grown of late and were obstructing the view, or perhaps
  he had made a mistake and from where he stood the windows of the mas could
  not be seen. It was so long, so very long ago since he had been here, he
  had really forgotten his bearings.</p>
  <p>And with a shrug of the shoulders he turned to walk away.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>But over at the mas Nicolette had thrown her arms around old Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s
  shoulders:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou wert wrong, Marga&iuml;,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;thou wert
  wrong. He meant to come. He wished to come. He had decided to come to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ta, ta, ta,&rdquo; Marga&iuml; broke in crossly, &ldquo;what is all
  that nonsense about now? And why those glistening eyes, I would like to know.
  Who is it that had decided to come to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tan-tan, of course!&rdquo; Nicolette cried, and clapped her hands
  together, and her dark eyes glistened, glistened with an expression that
  of a surety the old woman could not have defined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! go away with your Tan-tans,&rdquo; Marga&iuml; retorted gruffly. &ldquo;You
  know you must not say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say M. le Comte then, an thou wilt,&rdquo; the girl retorted,
  for her joy was not to be marred by any grumblings or wet blankets. &ldquo;But
  he was coming here, all the same, whatever thou mayest choose to call him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Was he, indeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman was not to be mollified quite so easily, and, all the while
  that she watched the milk which she had put on the stove to boil for the
  child, she went on muttering to herself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why doth he not come? Why not, if he meant to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has been sent for, Marga&iuml;,&rdquo; Nicolette said with a great
  air of importance, &ldquo;by the King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As if the King would trouble to send for Tan-tan!&rdquo; old Marga&iuml; riposted
  with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>Nicolette stood before Marga&iuml;, drew her round by the arm, forcing her
  to look her straight in the eyes, then she put up her finger and spoke with
  a solemn earnestness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King has sent for M. le Comte de Ventadour, Marga&iuml;. Do not
  dare to contradict this, because it would be disrespectful to an officer
  of His Majesty&rsquo;s bodyguard. And the proof of what I say, is that Tan-tan
  has to start early to-morrow morning for Versailles. If the King had not
  sent for him he would have come here to see us in the afternoon, and all
  that thou didst say, Marga&iuml;, about his being proud and ungrateful is
  not true, not true,&rdquo; she reiterated, stamping her foot resolutely upon
  the ground, then proceeding to give Marga&iuml; first a good shake, then
  a kiss, and finally a hug. &ldquo;Say now, Marga&iuml;, say at once that
  it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There now the milk is boiling over,&rdquo; was Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s
  only comment upon the child&rsquo;s peroration, as she succeeded in freeing
  herself from Nicolette&rsquo;s clinging arms: after which she devoted her
  attention to the milk.</p>
  <p>And Nicolette ran up to her room, and put her lighted candle in the window.
  She was humming to herself all the while:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Janeto gardo si moutoun<br>
  En fasent soun bas de coutoun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But presently the song died down in her throat, she threw herself down on
  her narrow, little bed, and burying her face in the pillow she burst into
  tears.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Orange-Blossom</b></h2>
  <p>And now it is spring once again: a glorious May-day with the sky of an intense
  blue, and every invisible atom in the translucent air quivering in the heat
  of the noon-day sun. All around the country-side the harvesting of orange-blossom
  has begun, and the whole atmosphere is filled with such fragrance that the
  workers who carry the great baskets filled to the brim with ambrosial petals
  feel the intoxicating perfume rising to their heads like wine.</p>
  <p>At the mas they are harvesting the big grove to-day, the one that lies down
  in the valley, close to the road-side. There are over five hundred trees,
  so laden with flowers that, even after heavy thinning down, there will be
  a huge crop of fruit at Christmas-time. Through the fragrant air, the fresh
  young voices of the gatherers resound, echoing against the distant hills,
  chattering, shouting, laughing, oh! laughing all the time, for they are boys
  and girls together and all are betrothed to one another in accordance to
  old Proven&ccedil;al traditions which decrees that lads and maidens be tokened
  from the time when they emerge out of childhood and the life of labour on
  a farm begins: so that Meon is best known as the betrothed of P&eacute;trone
  or Magdeleine as the fianc&eacute;e of Gaucelme.</p>
  <p>Large sheets are spread under the trees, and the boys, on ladders, pick
  the flowers and drop them lightly down. It requires a very gentle hand to
  be a good picker, because the delicate petals must on no account be bruised
  and all around the trees where the girls stand, holding up the sheet, the
  air is filled as with myriads of sweet-scented fluttering snowflakes.</p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier, in addition to his special process for the manufacture of
  olive oil, has a secret one for the extraction of neroli, a sweet oil obtained
  from orange-blossom, and for distilling orange-flower water, a specific famed
  throughout the world for the cure of those attacks of nerves to which great
  ladies are subject. Therefore, at the mas, the fragrant harvest is of great
  importance.</p>
  <p>And what a feast it is for the eye. Beneath the brilliant canopy above,
  a veritable riot of colour, an orgy of movement and of life! There stands
  Jaume Deydier himself in blouse and linen trousers, out from earliest dawn,
  tablets and pencil in hand, counting and checking the bags as they are carried
  from the grove to the road, where a row of carts is waiting to convey them
  to the distillery at Pertuis: the horses are gorgeously decked out with scarlet
  and blue ribbons plaited into their manes and tails, the bosses on their
  harness scintillating like gold in the sunshine: their drivers with bunches
  of lilac or lily-of-the-valley tied to their whips. Then the girls in red
  or pink or green kirtles, the tiny muslin caps on their heads embellished
  with a sprig of blue gentian or wild geranium that nestles against their
  curls or above the heavy plaits that hang like streamers down their backs;
  and the lads in grey or blue blouses, with gay kerchiefs tied loosely round
  their necks, and through it all from time to time a trenchant note of deep
  maroon or purple, a shawl, a kerchief, a piece of embroidery; or again &rsquo;tis
  M. le Cur&eacute;&rsquo;s soutane, a note of sober black, as he moves from
  group to group, admonishing, chaffing, bestowing blessings as he goes by,
  his well-worn soutane held high above his buckled shoes, his three-cornered
  hat pushed back above his streaming forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh! Mossou le Cur&eacute;!&rdquo; comes in a ringing shout from a
  chorus of young voices, &ldquo;this way, Mossou le Cur&eacute;, this way!
  bless this tree for us that it may yield the heaviest crop of the year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For there is a dole on every tree, according to the crop it yields to deft
  fingers, and M. le Cur&eacute; hurries along, raises his wrinkled hand and
  murmurs a quick blessing, whilst for a minute or two dark heads and fair
  are bent in silent reverence and lips murmur a short prayer, only to break
  the next moment into irresponsible laughter again.</p>
  <p>And in the midst of this merry throng Nicolette moves&mdash;the fairest,
  the merriest of all. She has pinned a white camellia into her cap: it nestles
  against her brown curls on the crown of her head, snow-white with just a
  splash or two of vivid crimson on the outer petals. Ameyric Barnadou is in
  close attendance upon her. He is the most desirable <i>parti</i> in the neighbourhood
  for he is the only son of the rich farmer over at La Bastide, who is also
  the mayor of the commune, and a well-set up, handsome lad with bold, dark
  eyes calculated to bring a quick blush to any damask cheek. Glances of admiration
  and approval were freely bestowed on the young couple: and more than one
  sigh of longing or regret followed them as they moved about amongst the trees,
  for Ameyric had eyes only for Nicolette.</p>
  <p>Nicolette had in truth grown into a very beautiful woman, with the rich
  beauty of the South, the sun-kissed brown hair, and mellow, dark hazel eyes,
  with a gleam in them beneath their lashes, as of a golden topaz. That she
  was habitually cool and distant with the lads of the country-side&mdash;some
  said that she was proud&mdash;made her all the more desirable to those who,
  like Ameyric, made easy conquests where they chose to woo. So far, certainly
  Nicolette had not been known to favour any one, and it was in vain that her
  girl friends teased her, calling her: Nicolette, no man&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>To-day with a background of light colour, with the May-day sun above her,
  and the scent of orange-blossom in his nostrils, Ameyric Barnadou felt that
  life would be for him a poor thing indeed if he could not share it with Nicolette.
  But though he found in his simple poetic soul, words of love that should
  have melted a heart of stone, exquisite Nicolette did no more than smile
  upon him with a gentle kind of pity, which was exasperating to his pride
  and fuel to his ardour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; Ameyric pleaded at one time when he had succeeded
  by dint of clever strategy in isolating her from the groups of noisy harvesters, &ldquo;if
  you only knew how good it is to love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was leaning up against a tree, and the leaves and branches cast trenchant,
  irregular shadows on her muslin kerchief and the creamy satin of her shoulders:
  she was twirling a piece of orange-blossom between her fingers and now and
  then she raised it to her cheeks, caressing it and inhaling its dewy fragrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Nicolette!&rdquo; the lad cried out with a touch
  of exasperation.</p>
  <p>She turned great, wondering eyes on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What am I doing, Ameyric,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that irritates
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Letting that flower kiss your cheek,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;when
  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Ameyric,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! poor Ameyric!&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;You must think that
  I am made of stone, Nicolette, or you would not tease me so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; she exclaimed, genuinely astonished: &ldquo;I tease you?
  How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Ameyric had not a great power of expressing himself. Just now he looked
  shy, awkward, and mumbled haltingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By&mdash;by being you&mdash;yourself&mdash;so lovely&mdash;so fresh&mdash;then
  kissing that flower. You must know that it makes me mad!&rdquo; he added
  almost roughly. He tried to capture her hand; but she succeeded in freeing
  it, and flung the twig away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Ameyric,&rdquo; she reiterated with a sigh.</p>
  <p>He had already darted after the flower and, kneeling, he picked it up and
  pressed it to his lips. She looked down on his eager, flushed face, and there
  crept a soft, almost motherly look in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you only knew,&rdquo; he said moodily, &ldquo;how it hurts!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just now you wished me to know how good it was to love,&rdquo; she
  riposted lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is just the trouble, Nicolette,&rdquo; the lad assented, and
  rose slowly to his feet; &ldquo;it is good but it also hurts; and when the
  loved one is unkind, or worse still, indifferent, then it is real hell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as she said nothing, but stood quite still, her little head thrown
  back, breathing in the delicious scented air, which had become almost oppressive
  in its fragrance, he exclaimed passionately:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you so, Nicolette!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put out his arms and drew her to him, longing to fasten his lips on that
  round white throat, which gleamed like rose-tinted marble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; he pleaded, because she had pushed him away quickly&mdash;almost
  roughly. &ldquo;Are you quite sure that you cannot bring yourself to love
  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; she replied firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you cannot go on like this,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;loving no
  one. It is not natural. Every girl has a lad. Look at them how happy they
  are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively she turned to look.</p>
  <p>In truth they were a happy crowd these children of Provence. It was the
  hour after <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and in groups of half a dozen or more,
  boys and girls, men and women squatted upon the ground under the orange trees,
  having polished off their bread and cheese, drunk their wine and revelled
  in the cakes which Marga&iuml; always baked expressly for the harvesters.
  There was an hour&rsquo;s rest before afternoon work began. Every girl was
  with her lad. Ameyric was quite right: there they were, unfettered in their
  na&iuml;ve love-making; the boys for the most part were lying full length
  on the ground, their hats over their eyes, tired out after the long morning&rsquo;s
  work: the girls squatted beside them, teasing, chaffing, laughing, yielding
  to a kiss when a kiss was demanded, on full red lips or blue-veined, half-closed
  lids.</p>
  <p>Anon, one or two of the men, skilled in music, picked up their galoubets
  whilst others slung their beribboned tambours round their shoulders. They
  began to beat time, softly at first, then a little louder, and the soft-toned
  galoubets intoned the tender melody of &ldquo;<i>Lou Roussignou</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
  Nightingale&rdquo;), one of the sweetest of the national songs of Provence.
  And one by one the fresh young voices of men and maids also rose in song,
  and soon the mountains gave echo to the sweet, sad tune, with its quaint
  burden and its haunting rhythm, and to the clapping of soft, moist hands,
  the droning of galoubets and murmur of tambours.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Whence come you, oh, fair maiden?<br>
  The nightingale that flies,<br>
  Your arm with basket laden,<br>
  The nightingale that flies, that flies,<br>
  Your arm with basket laden,<br>
  The nightingale that soon will fly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One young voice after another took up the refrain, and soon the sound rose
  and rose higher and ever higher, growing in magnitude and volume till every
  mountain crag and every crevasse on distant Luberon seemed to join in the
  chorus, and to throw back in numberless echoes the na&iuml;ve burden of the
  song that holds in its music the very heart and soul of this land of romance
  and of tears.</p>
  <p>Nicolette listened for awhile, standing still under the orange tree, with
  the sun playing upon her hair, drinking in the intoxicating perfume of orange-blossoms
  that lulled her mind to dreams of what could never, never be. But anon she,
  too, joined in the song, and as her voice had been trained by a celebrated
  music-master of Avignon, and was of a peculiarly pure and rich quality, it
  rose above the quaint, harsh tones that came from untutored throats, until
  one by one these became hushed, and boys and girls ceased to laugh and to
  chatter, and listened.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;What ails thee, maiden fair?<br>
  The nightingale that flies!<br>
  Whence all these tears and care?<br>
  The nightingale that flies, that flies!<br>
  Whence all these tear-drops rare?<br>
  The nightingale away will fly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>sang Nicolette, and the last high note, pure indeed as that of a bird, lingered
  on the perfumed air like a long-drawn-out sigh, then softly died away as
  if carried to the mountain heights on the wings of the nightingale that flies.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Lou roussignou che vol&agrave;&mdash;vol&agrave;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A hush had fallen on the merry throng: a happy hush wherein hands sought
  hands and curly head leaned on willing breast, and lips sought eyes and closed
  them with a kiss. Nicolette was standing under the big orange tree, her eyes
  fastened on the slopes of Luberon, where between olive trees and pines rose
  the dark cypress trees that marked the grounds of the old ch&acirc;teau.
  When she ceased to sing some of the lads shouted enthusiastically: &ldquo;Encore!
  Encore!&rdquo; and M. le Cur&eacute; clapped his hands, and said she must
  come over to Pertuis and sing at high Mass on the Feast of Pentecost. Jaume
  Deydier was at great pains to explain how highly the great music-teacher
  at Avignon thought of Nicolette&rsquo;s voice; but Ameyric in the meanwhile
  had swarmed up the big orange tree. It had not yet been picked and was laden
  with blossom. The fragrance from it was such that it was oppressive, and
  once Ameyric felt as if he would swoon and fall off the tree. But this feeling
  soon passed, and sitting astride upon a bough, he picked off all the blossoms,
  gathering them into his blouse. Then when his blouse was full, he held on
  to it with one hand, and with the other started pelting Nicolette with the
  flowers: he threw them down in huge handfuls one after the other, and Nicolette
  stood there and never moved; she just let the petals fall about her like
  snow, until Ameyric suddenly loosened the corner of his blouse, and down
  came the blossoms, buds, flowers, petals, leaves, twigs, and Nicolette had
  to bend her head lest these struck her in the face. She put up her arms and
  started to run, but Ameyric was down on the ground and after her within a
  second. And as he was the swiftest runner of the country-side, he soon overtook
  her and seized her hand, and went on running, dragging her after him: a lad
  jumped to his feet and seized her other hand and then dragged another girl
  after him. The next moment every one had joined in this merry race: young
  and old, grey heads and fair heads and bald heads, all holding hands and
  running, running, for this was the <i>Farandoulo</i>, and the whole band
  was dragged along by Ameyric, who was the leader and who had hold of Nicolette&rsquo;s
  hand. They ran and they ran, the long band that grew longer and longer every
  moment, as one after another every one joined in: the girls, the boys, the
  men, Jaume Deydier, Marga&iuml;, and even Mossou le Cur&eacute;. No one can
  refuse to join in the <i>Farandoulo</i>. In and out of the orange trees,
  round and round and up and down!&mdash;follow my leader!&mdash;and woe betide
  him or her who first gets breathless. The laughter, the shouts were deafening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep up, Magdeleine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt breaking my arm, Glayse!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take care, Mossou le Cur&eacute; will fall!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fall! No! and if he does we&rsquo;ll pick him up again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so the mad <i>Farandoulo</i> winds its way in the fragrant grove that
  borders the dusty road. And down that road coming from Luberon two riders&mdash;a
  man and a woman&mdash;draw rein, and hold their horses in, while they gaze
  toward the valley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, what in Heaven&rsquo;s name is happening over there?&rdquo; a
  high-pitched feminine voice asks somewhat querulously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should not wonder they were dancing a <i>Farandoulo</i>!&rdquo; the
  man replies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in the world is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The oldest custom in Provence. A national dance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dance, <i>bon Dieu</i>! I should call it a vulgar brawl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is quaint and original, Rixende. Come! It will amuse you to watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lady shrugs her pretty shoulders and the riders put their horses to
  a gentle trot. Bertrand&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon that serpentine band of humanity,
  still winding its merry way amidst the trees, have taken on an eager, excited
  glance. The Proven&ccedil;al blood in his veins leaps in face of this ancient
  custom of his native land. Rixende, smothering her ennui, rides silently
  by his side. Then suddenly one or two amongst that riotous throng have perceived
  the riders: the inborn shyness of the peasant before his seigneur seems to
  check the laughter on their lips, their shyness is communicated to others,
  and gradually one by one, they fall away; Mossou le Cur&eacute;, shamefaced,
  is the first to let go; he mops his streaming forehead and watches with some
  anxiety the approach of the strange lady in her gorgeous riding habit of
  crimson velvet, her fair curls half concealed beneath a coquettish <i>tricorne</i> adorned
  with a falling white plume.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; he mutters. &ldquo;I trust they
  did not perceive me. M. le Comte and this strange lady: what will they think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Jaume Deydier replies with a somewhat ironic laugh, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  not so many years ago that young Bertrand would have been proud to lead the <i>Farandoulo</i> himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the old cur&eacute; murmurs with a grave shake of his
  old head, &ldquo;but he has changed since then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Deydier assents dryly: &ldquo;he has changed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cur&eacute; would have said something more, but a loud, rather shrill,
  cry checks the words on his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing! Only that Ameyric, the leader of the <i>Farandoulo</i>, and Nicolette
  with him had been about the only ones who had not perceived the approach
  of the elegant riders. It is an understood thing that one by one the band
  of rioters becomes shorter and shorter, as some fall out, breathless after
  awhile, and Ameyric, who was half wild with excitement to-day, and Nicolette,
  whose senses were reeling in the excitement of this wild rush through perfume-laden
  space went on running, running, for the longer the <i>Farandoulo</i> can
  be kept up by the leaders the greater is the honour that awaits them in the
  end; and so they ran, these two, until their mad progress was suddenly arrested
  by a loud, shrill cry, followed less than a second later by another terrified
  one, and the pawing and clanging of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs upon the hard stony
  road. Ameyric was only just in time to drag Nicolette, with a violent jerk,
  away from the spot where she had fallen on her knees right under the hoofs
  of a scared and maddened animal. The beautiful rider in gorgeous velvet habit
  was vainly trying to pacify her horse, who, startled by a sudden clash of
  tambours, was boring and champing and threatening to rear. Rixende, not a
  very experienced rider, had further goaded him by her screams and by her
  nervous tugging at the bridle: she did indeed present a piteous spectacle&mdash;her
  elegant hat had slipped down from her head and hung by its ribbon round her
  neck, her hair had become disarranged and her pretty face looked crimson
  and hot, whilst her small hands, encased in richly embroidered gloves, clung
  desperately to the reins. The untoward incident, however, only lasted a few
  seconds. Already one of Deydier&rsquo;s men had seized the bridle of the
  fidgety animal and Bertrand, bending over in his saddle, succeeded not only
  in quieting the horse, but also in soothing his loved one&rsquo;s temper;
  he helped her to readjust her hat and to regain her seat, he rearranged the
  tumbled folds of her skirt, and saw to her stirrup leather and the comfort
  of her small, exquisitely shod feet.</p>
  <p>But Rixende would not allow herself to be coaxed back into good humour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These ignorant louts!&rdquo; she murmured fretfully, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  they know that their silly din will frighten a highly strung beast?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was an accident, Rixende,&rdquo; Bertrand protested: &ldquo;and
  here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;comes M. le Cur&eacute; to offer you an apology
  for his flock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>H&eacute;las</i>, mademoiselle,&rdquo; M. le Cur&eacute; said,
  with hands held up in genuine concern, as he hurried to greet M. le Comte
  and his fair companion, &ldquo;we must humbly beg your pardon for this unfortunate
  accident. In the heat and excitement of the dance, I fear me the boys and
  girls lost their heads a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lost their heads, M. le Cur&eacute;,&rdquo; Rixende retorted dryly. &ldquo;I
  might have lost my life by what you are pleased to call this unfortunate
  accident. Had my horse taken the bit between his teeth....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shrugged her pretty shoulders in order to express all the grim possibilities
  that her words had conjured up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Mademoiselle,&rdquo; le cur&eacute; protested benignly, &ldquo;with
  M. le Comte by your side, you were as safe as in your own boudoir; and every
  lad here knows how to stay a runaway horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; Mademoiselle rejoined with just a thought of resentment
  in her tone, &ldquo;methinks every one was too much occupied in attending
  to that wench yonder, to pay much heed to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment it seemed as if the old priest would say something more, but
  he certainly thought better of it and pressed his lips tightly together,
  as if to check the words which perhaps were best left unsaid. Indeed there
  appeared to be some truth in Rixende&rsquo;s complaint, for while she certainly
  was the object of Bertrand&rsquo;s tender solicitude, and the old cur&eacute; stood
  beside her to offer sympathy and apology for the potential accident, all
  the boys and girls, the men and women, were crowding around the group composed
  of Nicolette, Ameyric, Marga&iuml; and Jaume Deydier.</p>
  <p>Nicolette had not been hurt, thanks to Ameyric&rsquo;s promptitude, but
  she had been in serious danger from the fretful, maddened horse, whom his
  rider was powerless to check. She had fallen on her knees and was bruised
  and shaken, but already she was laughing quite gaily, and joking over her
  father&rsquo;s anxiety and Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s fussy ways. Marga&iuml; was
  preparing bandages for the bruised knee and a glass of orange-flower water
  for her darling&rsquo;s nerves, whilst rows of flushed and sympathising faces
  peered down anxiously upon the unwilling patient.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh! Marga&iuml;, let me be,&rdquo; Nicolette cried, and jumped to
  her feet, to show that she was in no way hurt. &ldquo;What a to-do, to be
  sure. One would think it was I who nearly fell from a horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; muttered Marga&iuml; crossly, &ldquo;who don&rsquo;t
  know how to sit a horse should not be allowed to ride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And rows of wise young heads nodded sagely in assent.</p>
  <p>Rixende, watching this little scene from the road, felt querulous and irritated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; she asked peremptorily, &ldquo;was that fool of a girl
  who threw herself between my horse&rsquo;s feet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was our little Nicolette,&rdquo; the cur&eacute; replied gently. &ldquo;The
  child was running and dancing, and Ameyric dragged her so fast in the <i>Farandoulo</i> that
  she lost her footing and fell. She might have been killed,&rdquo; the old
  man added gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fortunately I had my horse in hand,&rdquo; Rixende riposted dryly. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
  I who might have been killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this last doleful remark of hers Bertrand did not hear. He was at the
  moment engaged in fastening his horse&rsquo;s bridle to a convenient tree,
  for at sound of Nicolette&rsquo;s name he had jumped out of the saddle. Nicolette!
  Poor little Nicolette hurt! He must know, he must know at once. Just for
  the next few seconds he forgot Rixende, yes! forgot her! and sped across
  the road and through the orange-grove in the direction of that distant, agitated
  group, in the midst of which he feared to find poor little Nicolette mangled
  and bleeding.</p>
  <p>Rixende called peremptorily after him. She thought Bertrand indifferent
  to the danger which she had run, and indifference was a manlike condition
  which she could not tolerate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;Bertrand, come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he did not hear her, which further exasperated her nerves. She turned
  to the old cur&eacute; who was standing by rather uncomfortably, longing
  for an excuse to go and see how Nicolette was faring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Cur&eacute;,&rdquo; Rixende said tartly, &ldquo;I pray you
  tell M. le Comte that my nerves are on edge, and that I must return home
  immediately. If he&rsquo;ll not accompany me, then must I go alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service, mademoiselle,&rdquo; the old priest responded readily
  enough, and picked up his soutane ready to follow M. le Comte through the
  grove. For the moment he had disappeared, but a few seconds later the group
  of harvesters parted and disclosed Bertrand standing beside Nicolette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette!&rdquo; Bertrand had exclaimed as soon as he saw her. He
  felt immensely relieved to find that she was not hurt, but at sight of her
  he suddenly felt shy and awkward; he who was accustomed to meet the grandest
  and most beautiful ladies of the Court at Versailles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he went on with a nervous little laugh, &ldquo;how you
  have grown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolette looked a little pale, which was no wonder, seeing what a fright
  she had had: but at sight of Bertrand a deep glow ran right up her cheeks,
  and tinged even her round young throat down to her shoulders under the transparent
  fichu. The boys and girls who had been crowding round her fell back respectfully
  as M. le Comte approached, and even Ameyric stood aside, only Marga&iuml; and
  Jaume Deydier remained beside Nicolette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have grown!&rdquo; Bertrand reiterated somewhat foolishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think so, M. le Comte?&rdquo; Nicolette murmured shyly.</p>
  <p>The fact that she, too, appeared awkward had the effect of dissipating Bertrand&rsquo;s
  nervousness in the instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call me Bertrand at once,&rdquo; he cried gaily, &ldquo;you naughty
  child who would forget her playmate Bertrand, or Tan-tan if you wish, and
  give me a kiss at once, or I shall think that you have the habit of turning
  your back on your friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to snatch a kiss, but Nicolette evaded him with a laugh, and at
  that very moment Bertrand caught sight of Jaume Deydier, whom he greeted
  a little shamefacedly, but with hearty goodwill. After which it was the turn
  of Marga&iuml;, whom he kissed on both cheeks, despite her grumblings and
  mutterings, and of the boys and girls whom he had not seen for over five
  years. Amongst them Ameyric.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>, Ameyric!&rdquo; he cried jovially, and held out a
  cordial hand to the lad: &ldquo;are you going to beat me at the bar and
  the disc now that I am out of practice! <i>Mon Dieu</i>, what bouts we used
  to have, what? and how we hated one another in those days!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every one was delighted with M. le Comte. How handsome he was! How gay!
  Proud? Why, no one could be more genial, more kindly than he. He shook hands
  with all the men, kissed one or two of the prettiest girls and all the old
  women on both cheeks: even Marga&iuml; ceased to mutter uncomplimentary remarks
  about him, and even Jaume Deydier unbent. He admitted to those who stood
  near him that M. le Comte had changed immensely to his own advantage. And
  Nicolette leaned against the old orange tree, the doyen of the grove, feeling
  a little breathless. Her heart was beating furiously beneath her kerchief,
  because, no doubt, she had not yet rested from that wild <i>Farandoulo</i>.
  The glow had not left her cheeks, and had added a curious brilliance to her
  eyes. The mad dancing and running had disarranged her hair, and the brown
  curls tumbled about her face just as they used to do of old when she was
  still a child: in her small brown hands she twirled a piece of orange-blossom.</p>
  <p>At one moment Bertrand looked round, and their eyes met. In that glance
  the whole of his childhood seemed to be mirrored: the woods, the long, rafted
  corridors, the mad, glad pranks of boyhood, the climbs up the mountain-side,
  the races up the terraced gradients, the slaying of dragons and rescuing
  of captive maidens. And all at once he threw back his head and laughed, just
  laughed from the sheer joy of these memories of the past and delight in the
  present; joy at finding himself here, amidst the mountains of old Provence,
  whose summits and crags dissolved in the brilliant azure overhead, with the
  perfume of orange-blossom going to his head like wine.</p>
  <p>And because M. le Comte laughed, one by one the boys and girls joined in
  his merriment: they laughed and sang, no longer the sweet sad chaunt of the &ldquo;<i>Roussignou</i>,&rdquo; but
  rather the gay ditties of <i>La Farandoulo</i>.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;La Farandoulo? La faren<br>
  Lou cor gai la t&egrave;sto flourido<br>
  E la faren tant que voudren<br>
  En aio! En aio!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;It was, in truth, most unfortunate that it all happened so: for Rixende
  had watched the whole of the scene from the moment when she sent the old
  cur&eacute; peremptorily to order Bertrand to come back to her. But instead
  of delivering the message he seemed to have mixed himself up with all those
  noisy louts, and to have become a part of that group that stood gaping around
  the girl Nicolette. Rixende saw how Bertrand greeted the girl, how he was
  soon surrounded by a rowdy, chattering throng, she saw how he tried to kiss
  the girls, how he embraced the women, how happy he seemed amongst all these
  people: so happy, in fact, that he appeared wholly to have forgotten her,
  Rixende. And she was forced to wait till it was his good pleasure to remember
  her. No wonder that this spoilt child of fashionable Versailles lost her
  temper the while. Her horse was still restive, his boring tired her: she
  could not trot off by herself, chiefly because she would not have cared to
  ride alone in this strange and dour country where she was a complete stranger.
  True! it was selfish and thoughtless of Bertrand thus to forget her. He was
  only away from her side a few minutes&mdash;six at most&mdash;but these were
  magnified into half an hour, and she was really not altogether to blame for
  greeting him with black looks, when presently he came back to her, leading
  that stupid peasant wench by the hand, and speaking just as if nothing had
  happened, and he had done nothing that required forgiveness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is Nicolette Deydier, my Rixende,&rdquo; he said quite unconcernedly. &ldquo;Though
  she is so young, she is my oldest friend. I sincerely hope that you and she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Deydier and I,&rdquo; Rixende broke in tartly, &ldquo;can
  make acquaintance at a more propitious time. But I have been kept too long
  for conversation with strangers now. I pray you let us go hence, Bertrand;
  the heat, the sun, and all the noise have given me a headache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the first petulant words Nicolette had quietly withdrawn her hand from
  Bertrand&rsquo;s grasp. She stood by silent, deeply hurt by the other&rsquo;s
  rudeness, vaguely commiserating with Bertrand for the sorry figure which
  he was made to cut. He did his best to pacify his somewhat vixenish-tempered
  fianc&eacute;e, and in his efforts did certainly forget to make amends to
  Nicolette, and after a hasty, kindly pressure of her hand, he paid no further
  heed to her.</p>
  <p>Only when Rixende, with a vicious cut at her horse with her riding-crop,
  gave the signal for departure, did Bertrand send back a farewell smile to
  Nicolette. She stood there for a long, long while on the edge of the road;
  even while a cloud of white dust hid the two riders from her view, she gazed
  out in the direction where they had vanished.</p>
  <p>So this was the lovely Rixende, the woman whom Bertrand had loved even before
  he had set eyes on her: the lady of his dreams, whom he was going to nickname
  Riande, because she would be always laughing; and he would love her so much
  and so tenderly that she would never long for the gaieties of Paris and Versailles,
  but be content to live with him in his fair home of Provence, where the flower
  of the gentian in the spring and the dome of heaven above would seem but
  the mirrors of her blue eyes.</p>
  <p>With a tightening at her heart-strings, Nicolette thought of the dainty
  face with its delicate, porcelain-like skin puckered up with lines of petulance,
  the gentian-blue eyes with their hard, metallic glitter, and the tiny mouth
  with the thin red lips set into a pout. And she sighed, because she had also
  noticed at the same time that there was a look of discontent and weariness
  in Bertrand&rsquo;s face when he finally rode away at the bidding of his
  imperious queen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Holy Virgin, Mother of God,&rdquo; Nicolette murmured fervently
  under her breath, &ldquo;pray to our Lord that He may allow Bertrand to be
  happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next moment her father&rsquo;s voice from the distance roused her from
  her dreams:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette! Hey, Nicolette! Don&rsquo;t stand there dreaming, child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned and ran back to the grove; the day was still young, and the harvesters
  were at work already. But every one noticed that for the rest of the afternoon
  Mademoiselle Nicolette was more silent than was her wont.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Twilight</b></h2>
  <p>The second time that Nicolette saw the lovely Rixende she looked very different
  from the shrewish, nervous rider who forgot her manners and created such
  an unfavourable impression on the country-side a week ago.</p>
  <p>Nicolette, urged thereto by Micheline, had at last consented to come over
  to the ch&acirc;teau in order to be formally introduced to Bertrand&rsquo;s
  fianc&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>It was Whit-Sunday, and a glorious afternoon. When Nicolette arrived she
  found the entire family assembled on the terrace. A table, spread with a
  beautiful lace cloth, was laden with all kinds of delicacies, such as even
  Marga&iuml; over at the mas could not have known how to bake: <i>g&acirc;teaux</i> and <i>brioches</i>,
  and <i>babas</i>, and jars of cream and cups of chocolate. The old Comtesse
  sat at the head of the table, her white hair dressed high above her head
  in the stately mode of forty years ago, and embellished with a magnificent
  jewelled comb. Her dress was of rich, purple brocade, made after the fashion
  which prevailed before the Revolution, with hoops and panniers, and round
  her neck she wore a magnificent rope of pearls. There were rings on her fingers
  set with gems that sparkled in the sunlight as she raised the silver jug
  and poured some chocolate out into a delicate porcelain cup.</p>
  <p>Nicolette could scarce believe her eyes. There was such an air of splendour
  about old Madame to-day!</p>
  <p>Micheline, too, looked different. She had discarded the plain, drab stuff
  gown she always wore, and had on a prettily made, dainty muslin frock which
  made her look younger, less misshapen somehow than usual. Her mother alone
  appeared out of key in the highly coloured picture. Though she, too, had
  on a silk gown, it was of the same unrelieved black which she had never discarded
  since Nicolette could remember anything. But the chair in which she reclined
  was covered in rich brocade, and her poor, tired head rested upon gorgeously
  embroidered cushions. The centre of interest in this family group, however,
  was that delicate figure of loveliness that reclined in an elegant <i>berg&egrave;re</i> in
  the midst of a veritable cloud of muslin and lace, all adorned with ribbons
  less blue than her eyes. With a quick glance, even as she approached, Nicolette
  took in every detail of the dainty apparition: from the exquisite head with
  its wealth of golden curls, modishly dressed with a high tortoiseshell comb,
  down to the tiny feet in transparent silk stockings and sandal shoes that
  rested on a cushion of crimson velvet, on the corner of which Bertrand sat,
  or rather crouched, with arms folded and head raised to gaze unhindered on
  his beloved.</p>
  <p>Micheline was the first to catch sight of her friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; she cried, and struggled to her feet, &ldquo;come
  quick! We are waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She ran to Nicolette as fast as her poor lame leg would allow, and Nicolette,
  who a moment ago had been assailed with the terrible temptation to play the
  coward and to run away, away from this strange scene, was compelled to come
  forward to greet the older ladies by kissing their hands as was customary,
  and to mix with all these people who, she vaguely felt, were hostile to her.
  The Comtesse Marcelle had given her a friendly kiss. But she felt like an
  intruder, a dependent who is tolerated, without being very welcome in the
  family circle. All her pride rebelled against the feeling, even though she
  could not combat it. It was Bertrand who made her feel so shy. He had risen
  very slowly and very deliberately to his feet, and it was with a formal bow
  and affected manner that he approached Nicolette and took her hand, then
  formally presented her to his fianc&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Nicolette Deydier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our neighbour&rsquo;s
  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not say &ldquo;my oldest friend&rdquo; this time. And Mademoiselle
  de Peyron-Bompar tore herself away from the contemplation of a box of bonbons
  in order to gaze on Nicolette with languid interest. There was quite a measure
  of impertinence in the glance which she bestowed on the girl&rsquo;s plain
  muslin gown, on the priceless fichu of old Mechlin which she wore round her
  graceful shoulders and on the string of rare pearls around her neck. Nicolette
  felt tongue-tied and was furious with herself for her awkwardness; she, who
  was called little chatter-box by her father and by Marga&iuml;, could find
  nothing to say but &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; or &ldquo;No!&rdquo; or short, prim
  answers to Rixende&rsquo;s supercilious queries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was the harvesting of orange-blossom finished?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What ennui! The smell of the flowers is enough to give one
  the migraine. How long would it last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another week perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And does that noisy dance always accompany the harvesting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always when the boys and girls are merry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What ennui! the noise of those abominable tambourines could be heard
  as far as the ch&acirc;teau yesterday. One could not get one&rsquo;s afternoon
  siesta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a cup of chocolate, Nicolette!&rdquo; Micheline suggested by
  way of a diversion as the conversation threatened to drop altogether.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Micheline!&rdquo; Nicolette replied, &ldquo;I had
  some chocolate before I came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was all so awkward, and so very, very unreal. To Nicolette it seemed
  as if she were in a dream: the old Comtesse&rsquo;s jewelled comb, the brocade
  chair, the silver on the table, it <i>could</i> not be real. The old ch&acirc;teau
  of Ventadour was the home of old tradition, not of garish modernity, it lived
  in a rarefied old-world atmosphere that had rendered it very dear to Nicolette,
  and all this rich paraphernalia of good living and fine clothes threw a mantle
  of falsehood almost of vulgarity over the place.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Nicolette found nothing more to say, and Micheline looked hurt and
  puzzled that her friend did not enter into the spirit of this beautiful unreality.
  She appeared to be racking her brain for something to say: but no one helped
  her out. The old Comtesse had not opened her lips since Nicolette had come
  upon the scene. Bertrand was too busily engaged in devouring his beautiful
  fianc&eacute;e with his eyes to pay heed to any one else, and the lovely
  Rixende was even at this moment smothering a yawn behind her upraised fan.</p>
  <p>It was the Comtesse Marcelle, anxious and gentle, who relieved the tension:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Micheline,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you take Nicolette
  into the boudoir and show her&mdash;?&rdquo; Then she smiled and added
  with a pathetic little air of gaiety: &ldquo;you know what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This suggestion delighted Micheline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she cried excitedly. &ldquo;I was forgetting. Come,
  Nicolette, and I will show you something that will surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had assumed a mysterious mien and now led the way into the house. Nicolette
  followed her, ready to fall in with anything that would take her away from
  here. The two girls went across the terrace together, and the last words
  which struck Nicolette&rsquo;s ears before they went into the house came
  from Mademoiselle de Peyron-Bompar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wench is quite pretty,&rdquo; she was saying languidly, &ldquo;in
  a milkmaid fashion, of course. You never told me, Bertrand, that you had
  a rustic beauty in these parts. She represents your calf-love, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolette actually felt hot tears rising to her eyes, but she succeeded
  in swallowing them, whilst Micheline exclaimed with na&iuml;ve enthusiasm:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Rixende beautiful? How can you wonder, Nicolette, that
  Bertrand loves her so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fortunately Nicolette was not called upon to make a reply. She had followed
  Micheline through the tall French window in the drawing-room and in very
  truth she was entirely dumb with surprise. The room was transformed in a
  manner which she would not have thought possible. It is true that she had
  not been inside the ch&acirc;teau for many months, but even so, it seemed
  as if a fairy godmother had waved her magic wand and changed the faded curtains
  into gorgeous brocades, the tattered carpets into delicate Aubussons, the
  broken-down chairs with protruding stuffing into luxurious fauteuils, covered
  in elegant tapestries. There were flowers in cut-glass bowls, books laid
  negligently on the tables; an open escritoire displayed a silver-mounted
  inkstand, whilst like a crowning ornament to this beautifully furnished room,
  a spinet in inlaid rosewood case stood in the corner beside the farthest
  window, with a pile of music upon it.</p>
  <p>Micheline had come to a halt in the centre of the room watching with glee
  the look of utter surprise and bewilderment on her friend&rsquo;s face, and
  when Nicolette stood there, dumb, looking about her as she would on a dream
  picture, Micheline clapped her hands with joy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do sing something, then you will
  know that it is all real.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Nicolette sat down at the spinet and her fingers wandered for awhile
  idly over the keys. Surely it must all be a dream. A spook had gone by and
  transformed the dear old ch&acirc;teau into an ogre&rsquo;s palace: it had
  cast a spell over poor, trusting Micheline, and set up old Madame as a presiding
  genius over this new world which was so unlike, so pathetically unlike the
  old; whilst through this ogre&rsquo;s palace there flitted a naughty, mischief
  making sprite, with blue eyes and golden curls, a sprite all adorned with
  lace and ribbons and exquisite to behold, who held dainty, jewelled fingers
  right over Bertrand&rsquo;s eyes so that he could no longer see.</p>
  <p>Gradually the dream-mood took stronger and yet stronger hold of Nicolette&rsquo;s
  spirit: and she was hardly conscious of what her fingers were doing. Instinctively
  they had wandered and wandered over the keys, playing a few bars of one melody
  and then of another, the player&rsquo;s mind scarcely following them. But
  now they settled down to the one air that is always the dearest of all to
  every heart in Provence: &ldquo;lou Roussignou!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Lou Roussignou che vol&agrave;, vol&agrave;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolette&rsquo;s sweet young voice rose to the accompaniment of the soft-toned
  spinet. She sang, hardly knowing that she did so, certainly not noticing
  Micheline&rsquo;s rapt little face of admiration, or that the tall window
  was open and allowed the rasping voice of Rixende to penetrate so far.</p>
  <p>Micheline heard it, and tiptoed as far as the window. Rixende had jumped
  to her feet. She stood in the middle of the terrace, with all her laces and
  ribbons billowing around her and her hands held up to her ears:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! that stupid song!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that monotonous, silly
  refrain gets on my nerves. Bertrand, take me away where I cannot hear it,
  or I vow that I shall scream.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Micheline stepped out through the window, from a safe distance she gazed
  in utter bewilderment at Rixende whom she had hitherto admired so whole-heartedly
  and who at this moment looked like an angry little vixen. Bertrand, on the
  other hand, tried to make a joke of the whole thing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sooner you accustom your sweet ears to that song,&rdquo; he said
  with a laugh, &ldquo;the sooner will you become a true Queen of Provence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I have no desire to become a Queen of Provence,&rdquo; Rixende
  retorted dryly, &ldquo;I hate this dull, dreary country&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rixende!&rdquo; Bertrand protested, suddenly sobered by an utterance
  which appeared to him nothing short of blasphemy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh! what,&rdquo; she retorted tartly, &ldquo;you do not suppose,
  my dear Bertrand, that I find this place very entertaining? Or did you really
  see me with your mind&rsquo;s eye finding delectation in rushing round orange
  trees in the company of a lot of perspiring louts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bertrand replied gently, &ldquo;I can only picture you
  in my mind&rsquo;s eye as the exquisite fairy that you are. But I must confess
  that I also see you as the Queen ruling over these lands that are the birthright
  of our race.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very prettily said,&rdquo; Rixende riposted with a sarcastic curl
  of her red lips, &ldquo;you were always a master of florid diction, my dear.
  But let me assure you that I much prefer to queen it over a Paris <i>salon</i> than
  over a half-empty barrack like this old ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand threw a rapid, comprehensive glance over the old pile that held
  all his family pride, all the glorious traditions of his forbears. There
  was majesty even in its ruins: whole chapters of the history of France had
  been unfolded within its walls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I find the half-empty barrack beautiful,&rdquo; he murmured with
  a quick, sharp sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it is beautiful, Bertrand,&rdquo; Rixende rejoined, with
  that quick transition from petulance to coquetry which seemed one of her
  chief characteristics. &ldquo;It is beautiful to me, because it is dear
  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She clasped her two tiny hands around his arm and turned her gentian-blue
  eyes up to him. He looked down at the dainty face, rendered still more exquisite
  by the flush which still lingered on her cheeks. She looked so frail, so
  fairy-like, such a perfect embodiment of all that was most delicate, most
  appealing in womanhood; she was one of those women who have the secret of
  rousing every instinct of protection and chivalry in a man, and command love
  and devotion where a more self-reliant, more powerful personality fails even
  to attract. A look of infinite tenderness came into Bertrand&rsquo;s face
  as he gazed on the lovely upturned face, and into those blue eyes wherein
  a few tears were slowly gathering. He felt suddenly brutish and coarse beside
  this ethereal being, whose finger-tips he was not worthy to touch. He felt
  that there was nothing which he could do, no act of worship or of self-abnegation,
  that would in any way repay her marvellous condescension in stepping out
  of her kingdom amongst the clouds, in order to come down to his level.</p>
  <p>And she, quick to notice the varying moods expressed in his face, felt that
  she had gone yet another step in her entire conquest of him. She gave a little
  sigh of content, threw him one more ravishing look, then said lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us wander away together, Bertrand, shall we? We seem never to
  have any time all to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Bertrand, wholly subjugated, captured Rixende&rsquo;s little hand, and drawing
  it under his arm, led her away in the direction of the wood. Micheline continued
  to gaze after them, a puzzled frown between her brows. Neither her mother
  nor her grandmother had joined in the short sparring match between the two
  lovers, but Micheline, whom infirmity had rendered keenly observant, was
  quick to note the look of anxiety which her mother cast in the direction
  where Rixende&rsquo;s dainty gown was just disappearing among the trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That girl will never be happy here&mdash;&rdquo; she murmured
  as if to herself.</p>
  <p>Old Madame who still sat erect and stiff at the head of the table broke
  in sharply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once she is married to Bertrand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Rixende
  will have to realise that she represents a great name, and that her little
  bourgeois ideas of pleasure and pomp are sadly out of key in this place where
  her husband&rsquo;s ancestors have been the equal of kings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Comtesse Marcelle sighed drearily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, when she is married&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what,&rdquo; grandmama queried sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sometimes wonder if that marriage will make for Bertrand&rsquo;s
  happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand&rsquo;s happiness,&rdquo; the old Comtesse echoed with a
  harsh laugh, &ldquo;Hark at the sentimental schoolgirl! My dear Marcelle!
  to hear you talk, one would think you had not lived through twenty-five years
  of grinding poverty. In Heaven&rsquo;s name have you not yet realised that
  the only possible happiness for Bertrand lies in a brilliant marriage. We
  have plunged too deeply into the stream now, we cannot turn back, we must
  swim with the tide&mdash;or sink&mdash;there is no middle-way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; the younger woman replied meekly. &ldquo;Debts,
  more debts! more debts! O, my God!&rdquo; she moaned and buried her face
  in her hands; &ldquo;as if they had not wrought enough mischief already.
  More debts, and if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now you talk like a fool,&rdquo; the old Comtesse broke in tartly. &ldquo;Would
  you have had the girl come here and find that all your carpets were in rags,
  your cushions moth-eaten, the family silver turned to lead or brass? Would
  you have had her find the Comtesse de Ventadour in a patched and darned gown,
  waited on by a lad from the village in sabots and an unwashed shirt that
  reeked of manure? Yes,&rdquo; she went on in that firm, decisive tone against
  which no one at the ch&acirc;teau had ever dared to make a stand, &ldquo;yes,
  I did advise Bertrand to borrow a little more money, in order that his family
  should not be shamed before his fianc&eacute;e. But you may rest assured,
  my good Marcelle, that the usurers who lent him the money would not have
  done it were they not satisfied that he would in the very near future be
  able to meet all his liabilities. You live shut away from all the civilised
  world, but every one in Paris knows that M. le Comte de Ventadour is co-heir
  with his fianc&eacute;e, Mlle. de Peyron-Bompar, to the Mont-Pahon millions.
  Bertrand had no difficulty in raising the money, he will have none in repaying
  it, and Jaume Deydier is already regretting, I make no doubt, the avarice
  which prompted him to refuse to help his seigneurs in their short-lived difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Comtesse Marcelle uttered a cry, almost of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deydier!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;surely, Madame, you did not
  ask him to&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I asked him to lend me five thousand louis, until the marriage contract
  between Bertrand and Mlle. Peyron-Bompar was signed. I confess that I did
  him too much honour, for he refused. Bah! those louts!&rdquo; grandmama added
  with lofty scorn, &ldquo;they have no idea of honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Comtesse Marcelle said nothing more, only a deep flush rose to her wan
  cheeks, and to hide it from the scathing eyes of her motherin-law she buried
  her face in her hands. Micheline&rsquo;s heart was torn between the desire
  to run and comfort her mother and her fear of grandmama&rsquo;s wrath if
  she did so. Instinctively she looked behind her, and then gave a gasp. Nicolette
  was standing in the window embrasure, her hands clasped in front of her;
  Micheline could not conjecture how much she had heard of the conversation
  that had been carried on on the terrace this past quarter of an hour. The
  girl&rsquo;s face wore a strange expression of detachment as if her spirit
  were not here at all; her eyes seemed to be gazing inwardly, into her own
  soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; Micheline exclaimed.</p>
  <p>Nicolette started, as if in truth she were waking from a dream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was just thinking,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;that it is getting
  late; I must be going. Marga&iuml; will be anxious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stepped over the window sill on to the terrace, and threw her arms round
  Micheline who was obviously struggling with insistent tears. Then she went
  over to the table, where the two ladies were sitting. She dropped the respectful
  curtsy which usage demanded from young people when taking leave of their
  elders. The Comtesse Marcelle extended a friendly hand to her, which Nicolette
  kissed affectionately, but old Madame only nodded her head with stately aloofness:
  and Nicolette was thankful to escape from this atmosphere of artificiality
  and hostility which gave her such a cruel ache in her heart.</p>
  <p>Micheline offered to accompany her part of the way home, but in reality
  the girl longed to be alone, and she knew that Micheline would understand.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Nicolette wandered slowly down the dusty road. She had purposely avoided
  the pretty descent down the terraced gradients through the woods; somehow
  she felt as if they too must be changed, as if the malignant fairy had also
  waved a cruel wand over the shady olive trees, and the carob to which captive
  maidens, long since passed away, were wont to be tethered whilst gallant
  knights slew impossible dragons and tinged the grass with the monster&rsquo;s
  blood. Surely, surely, all that had changed too! Perhaps it had never been.
  Perhaps childhood had been a dream and the carob tree was as much a legend
  as the dragons and the fiery chargers of old. Nicolette had a big heart-ache,
  because she was young and because life had revealed itself to her whilst
  she was still a child, showed her all the beauty, the joy, the happiness
  that it could bestow if it would; it had drawn aside the curtain which separated
  earth from heaven, and then closed them again leaving her on the wrong side,
  all alone, shivering, pining, longing, not understanding why God could be
  so cruel when the sky was so blue, His world so fair, and she, Nicolette,
  possessed of an infinite capacity for love.</p>
  <p>Whilst she had sat at the spinet and sung &ldquo;lou Roussignou&rdquo; she
  had gazed abstractedly through the open window before her, and seen that
  exquisite being, all lace and ribbons and loveliness, wielding little poison-darts
  that she flung at Bertrand, hurting him horribly in his pride, in his love
  of the old home: and Nicolette, whose pretty head held a fair amount of shrewd
  common sense, marvelled what degree of happiness the future held for those
  two, who were so obviously unsuited to one another. Rixende de Peyron-Bompar,
  petulant, spoilt, pleasure-loving, and Tan-tan the slayer of dragons, the
  intrepid Paul of the Paul et Virginie days on the desert island. Rixende,
  the butterfly Queen of a Paris <i>salon</i>, and Bertrand, Comte de Ventadour,
  the descendant of troubadours, the idealist, the dreamer, the weak vessel
  filled to the brim with all that was most lovable, most reprehensible, most
  sensitive, most certainly doomed to suffer.</p>
  <p>If only she thought that he would be happy, Nicolette felt that she could
  go about with a lighter heart. She had a happy home: a father who idolised
  her: she loved this land where she was born, the old mas, the climbing rose,
  the vine arbour, the dark cypresses that stood sentinel beside the outbuildings
  of the mas. In time, perhaps, loving these things, she would forget that
  other, that greater love, that immeasurably greater love that now threatened
  to break her heart.</p>
  <p>How beautiful the world was! and how beautiful was Provence! the trees,
  the woods, Luberon and its frowning crags, the orange trees that sent their
  intoxicating odour through the air. Already the sun had hidden his splendour
  behind Luberon, and had lit that big crimson fire behind the mountain tops
  that had seemed the end of the world to Nicolette in the days of old. The
  silence of evening had fallen on these woods where bird-song was always scarce.
  Nicolette walked very slowly: she felt tired to-night, and she never liked
  a road when terraced gradients through rows of olive trees were so much more
  inviting. The road was a very much longer way to the mas than the woods.
  Nicolette paused, debating what she should do. The crimson fire behind Luberon
  had paled to rose and then to lemon-gold, and to right and left the sky was
  of a pale turquoise tint, with tiny clouds lingering above the stony peaks
  of Luberon, tiny, fluffy grey clouds edged with madder that slowly paled.</p>
  <p>The short twilight spread its grey mantle over the valley and the mountain-side;
  the tiny clouds were now of a uniform grey: grey were the crags and the boulders,
  the tree-tops and the roof of the distant mas. Only the dark cypresses stood
  out like long, inky blotches against that translucent grey. And from the
  valley there rose that intoxicating fragrance of the blossom-laden orange
  trees. Way down on the road below a cart rattled by, the harness jingling,
  the axles groaning, the driver, with a maiden beside him, singing a song
  of Provence. For a few minutes these sounds filled the air with their insistence
  on life, movement, toil, their testimony to the wheels of destiny that never
  cease to grind. Then all was still again, and the short twilight faded into
  evening.</p>
  <p>And as Nicolette deliberately turned from the road into the wood, a nightingale
  began to sing. The soft little trills went rolling and echoing through the
  woods like a call from heaven itself to partake of the joy, the beauty, the
  fulness of the earth and all its loveliness. And suddenly, as Nicolette worked
  her way down the terraced gradients, she spied, standing upon a grass-covered
  knoll, two forms interlaced: Bertrand had his arms around Rixende, his face
  was buried in the wealth of her golden curls, and she lay quite passive,
  upon his breast.</p>
  <p>Nicolette dared not move, for fear she should be seen, for fear, too, that
  she should break upon this, surely the happiest hour in Tan-tan&rsquo;s life.
  They paid no heed of what went on around them: Bertrand held his beloved
  in his arms with an embrace that was both passionate and yearning, whilst
  overhead the nightingale trilled its sweet, sad melody. Nicolette stood quite
  still, dry-eyed and numb. Awhile ago she had been sure that if only she could
  think that Tan-tan was happy, she could go through life with a lighter heart.
  Well! she had her wish! there was happiness, absolute, radiant happiness
  expressed in that embrace. Tan-tan was happy, and his loved one lay passive
  in his arms, whilst the song of the nightingale spoke unto his soul promises
  of greater happiness still. And Nicolette closed her eyes, because the picture
  before her seemed to sear her very heart-strings and wrench them out of her
  breast. She stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth, because a desperate
  cry of pain had risen to her throat. Then, turning suddenly, she ran and
  ran down the slope, away, away as far away as she could from that haunting
  picture of Tan-tan and his happiness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  Christmas Eve</b></h2>
  <p>It was a very rare thing indeed for discord to hold sway at the mas. Perfect
  harmony reigned habitually between Jaume Deydier, his daughter and the old
  servant who had loved and cared for her ever since Nicolette had been a tiny
  baby, laid in Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s loving arms by the hands of the dying mother.</p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier was, of course, master in his own house. In Provence, old
  traditions still prevail, and the principles of independence and equality
  bred by the Revolution had never penetrated into these mountain fastnesses,
  where primitive and patriarchal modes of life gave all the happiness and
  content that the women of the old country desired. That Nicolette had been
  indulged and petted both by her father and her old nurse, was only natural.
  The child was pretty, loving, lovable and motherless; the latter being the
  greater claim on her father&rsquo;s indulgence. As for Marga&iuml;, she was
  Nicolette&rsquo;s slave, even though she grumbled and scolded and imagined
  that she ruled the household and ordered the servants about at the mas, in
  exactly the same manner as old Madame ordered hers over at the ch&acirc;teau.</p>
  <p>From which it may be gathered that on the whole it was Nicolette who usually
  had her way in the house. But for the last two days she had been going about
  with a listless, dispirited air, whilst Jaume Deydier did nothing but frown,
  and Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s mutterings were as incessant as they were for the
  most part unintelligible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot understand you, Mossou Deydier,&rdquo; she said more than
  once to her master, &ldquo;one would think you wanted to be rid of the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Marga&iuml;,&rdquo; was Deydier&rsquo;s tart
  response. But Marga&iuml; was not to be silenced quite so readily. She had
  been fifty years in the service of the Deydiers, and had&mdash;as she oft
  and picturesquely put it&mdash;turned down Mossou Jaume&rsquo;s breeches
  many a time when he sneaked into her larder and stole the jam she had just
  boiled, or the honey she had recently gathered from the hives. Oh, no! she
  was not going to be silenced&mdash;not like that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the child loved him,&rdquo; she went on arguing, &ldquo;I would
  not say another word. But she has told you once and for all that she does
  not care for young Barnadou, and does not wish to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jaume Deydier rejoined with a shrug of his wide shoulders, &ldquo;girls
  always say that at first. She is not in love with any one else, I suppose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; Marga&iuml; exclaimed, so hastily that the wooden
  spoon wherewith she had been stirring the soup a moment ago fell out of her
  hand with a clatter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, now!&rdquo; she said tartly, &ldquo;you quite upset me with
  your silly talk. Nicolette in love? With whom, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; Deydier retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should she refuse Ameyric? He loves her. He would suit me perfectly
  as a son-in-law. What has the child got against him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you wait, Mossou Jaume?&rdquo; Marga&iuml; would
  argue. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you wait? Why, the child is not yet nineteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My wife was seventeen when I married her,&rdquo; Deydier retorted. &ldquo;And
  I would like to see Nicolette tokened before the f&ecirc;tes. I was affianced
  to my wife two days before No&euml;l, we had the <i>gros soup&eacute;</i> at
  her parents&rsquo; house on Christmas Eve, and walked together to midnight
  Mass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And two years later she was in her coffin,&rdquo; Marga&iuml; muttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has that to do with it? Thou&rsquo;rt a fool, Marga&iuml;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon
  Marga&iuml;, feeling that in truth her last remark had been neither logical
  nor kind, reverted to her original argument: &ldquo;One would think you wanted
  to be rid of the child, Mossou Jaume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the whole matter would be gone through all over again from the beginning,
  and Jaume Deydier would lose his temper and say harsh things which he regretted
  as soon as they had crossed his lips, and Marga&iuml; would continue to argue
  and to exasperate him, until, luckily, Nicolette would come into the room
  and perch on her father&rsquo;s knee, and smother further arguments by ruffling
  up his hair, or putting his necktie straight, or merely throwing her arms
  around his neck.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>This all occurred two days before Christmas. There had been a fall of snow
  way up in the mountains, and Luberon wore a white cap upon his crest. The
  mistral had come once or twice tearing down the valley, and in the living-rooms
  at the mas huge fires of olive and eucalyptus burned in the hearths. Marga&iuml; had
  been very busy preparing the food for the <i>gros soup&eacute;</i>, the traditional
  banquet of Christmas Eve in old Provence, and which Jaume Deydier offered
  every year to forty of his chief employ&eacute;s. Nicolette now was also
  versed in the baking and roasting of the <i>cal&egrave;nos</i>, the fruits
  and cakes which would be distributed to all the men employed at the farm
  and to their families: and even Marga&iuml; was forced to admit that the <i>Poumpo
  taillado</i>&mdash;the national cake, baked with sugar and oil&mdash;was
  never so good as when Nicolette mixed it herself.</p>
  <p>Of Ameyric Barnadou there was less and less talk as the festival drew nigh.
  Marga&iuml; and Nicolette were too busy to argue, and Jaume Deydier sat by
  his fireside in somewhat surly silence. He could not understand his own daughter. <i>Ah &ccedil;a!</i> what
  did the child want? What had she to say against young Barnadou? Every girl
  had to marry some time, then why not Nicolette?</p>
  <p>But he said nothing more for a day or two. His pet scheme that the <i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i> should
  be celebrated on Christmas Eve had been knocked on the head by Nicolette&rsquo;s
  obstinacy, but Jaume hoped a great deal from the banquet, the <i>calignaou</i>,
  and above all, from the midnight Mass. Nicolette was very gentle and very
  sentimental, and Ameyric so very passionately in love. The boy would be a
  fool if he could not make the festivals, the procession, the flowers, the
  candles, the incense to be his helpmates in his wooing.</p>
  <p>On Christmas Eve Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s guests were assembled in the hall
  where the banquet was also laid: the more important overseers and workpeople
  of his olive oil and orange-flower water factories were there, some with
  their wives and children.</p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier, in the beautiful bottle-green cloth coat which he had worn
  at his wedding, and which he wore once every year for the Christmas festival,
  his grey hair and his whiskers carefully brushed, his best paste buckles
  on his shoes, shook every one cordially by the hand; beside him Nicolette,
  in silk kirtle and lace fichu, smiled and chatted, proud to be the ch&acirc;telaine
  of this beautiful home, the queen of this little kingdom amongst the mountains,
  the beneficent fairy to whom the whole country-side looked if help or comfort
  or material assistance was required. Around her pressed the men and the women
  and the children who had come to the feast. There was old Tiberge, the doyen
  of the staff over at Pertuis, whose age had ceased to be recorded, it had
  become fabulous: there was Thibaut, the chief overseer, with his young wife
  who had her youngest born by the hand. There was Zacharie, the chief clerk,
  who was tokened to Violante, the daughter of Laugier the cashier. They were
  all a big family together: had seen one another grow up, marry, have children,
  and their children had known one another from their cradles. Jaume Deydier
  amongst them was like the head of the family, and no seigneur over at the
  ch&acirc;teau had ever been so conscious of his own dignity. As for Nicolette,
  she was just the little fairy whom they had seen growing from a lovely child
  into an exquisite woman, their Nicolette, of whom every girl was proud, and
  with whom every lad was in love.</p>
  <p>The noise in the hall soon became deafening. They are neither a cold nor
  a reserved race, these warm-hearted children of sunny Provence. They carry
  their hearts on their sleeves: they talk at the top of their voices, and
  when they laugh they shake the old rafters of their mountain homes with the
  noise. And Christmas Eve was the day of all days. They all loved the gifts
  of the <i>cal&egrave;nos</i>, the dried fruits and cakes which the <i>patron</i> distributed
  with a lavish hand, and which they took home to their bairns or to those
  less fortunate members of their families who were not partakers of Deydier&rsquo;s
  hospitality. But they adored the <i>Poumpo taillado</i>, the sweet, oily
  cake that no one baked better than demoiselle Nicolette. And the banquet
  would begin with <i>bouillabaisse</i> which was concocted by Marga&iuml; from
  an old recipe that came direct from Marseilles, and there would be turkeys
  and geese from Deydier&rsquo;s splendid farmyard, and salads and artichokes
  served with marrow fat. Already the men were smacking their lips; manners
  not being over-refined in Provence, where Nature alone dictates how a man
  shall behave, without reference to what his neighbours might think. There
  was a cheery fire, too, in the monumental hearth, and the shutters behind
  the windows being hermetically closed, the atmosphere presently became steaming
  and heady with the smell of good food and the aroma from the huge, long-necked
  bottles of good Roussillon wine.</p>
  <p>But every one there knew that, before they could sit down to table, the
  solemn rite of the <i>Calignaou</i> must be gone through. As soon as the
  huge clock that stood upon the mantelshelf had finished striking six, old
  Tiberge, whose first birthday was lost in the nebul&aelig; of time, stepped
  out from the little group that encircled him, and took tiny Savinien, the
  four-year-old son of the chief overseer, by the hand: December leading January,
  Winter coupled with Spring; Jaume Deydier put a full bumper of red wine in
  the little fellow&rsquo;s podgy hand: and together these two, the aged and
  the youngster, toddled with uncertain steps out of the room, followed by
  the entire party. They made their way to the entrance door of the house,
  on the threshold of which a huge log of olive wood had in the meanwhile been
  placed. Guided by his mother, little Savinien now poured some of the wine
  over the log, whilst, prompted by Nicolette, his baby lips lisped the traditional
  words:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Al&egrave;gre, Diou nous al&egrave;gre<br>
    Cachofu&eacute; ven, tout ben
    ven<br>
    Diou nous fagu&eacute; la graci de voir l&rsquo;an qu&eacute; ven<br>
    Se sian
    pas mai, siguen pas men.&rdquo; * </p>
  <p class="note">*Let us be merry! God make us merry! Hidden fires come, all good things
    come! May God give us grace to see the coming year. If there be not more
  of us, let there not be fewer.</p>
  <p>After which the bumper of wine was handed round and every one drank. Still
  guided by his mother, the child then took hold of one end of the Proven&ccedil;al
  Yule log, and the old man of the other, and together they marched back to
  the dining-hall and solemnly deposited the log in the hearth, where it promptly
  began to blaze.</p>
  <p>Thus by this quaint old custom did they celebrate the near advent of the
  coming year. The old man and the child, each a symbol&mdash;Tiberge of the
  past, little Savinien of the future, the fire of the Yule log the warmth
  of the sun. Every one clapped their hands, the noise became deafening, and
  Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s stentorian voice, crying: &ldquo;<i>A table, les amis!</i>&rdquo; could
  scarce be heard above the din. After that they all sat at the table and the
  business of the banquet began.</p>
  <p>Nicolette alone was silent, smiling, outwardly as merry as any of them;
  she sat at the head of her father&rsquo;s table, and went about her duties
  as mistress of the house with that strange sense of unreality that had haunted
  her this past year still weighing on her heart.</p>
  <p>In the years of her childhood&mdash;the years that were gone&mdash;Tan-tan
  and Micheline were always allowed to come and spend Christmas Eve at the
  mas. Even grandmama, dour, haughty grandmama, realised the necessity of allowing
  children to be gay and happy on what is essentially the children&rsquo;s
  festival. So Tan-tan and Micheline used to come, and for several years it
  was Tan-tan who used to pour the wine over the log, and he was so proud because
  he knew the prescribed ditty by heart, and never had to be prompted. He spoke
  them with such an air, that she, Nicolette, who was little more than a baby
  then, would gaze on him wide-eyed with admiration. And one year there had
  been a great commotion, because old M&eacute;tastase, who was said to be
  one hundred years old, and whose hands trembled like the leaves of the old
  aspen tree down by the L&egrave;ze, had dropped the log right in the middle
  of the floor, and the women had screamed, and even the men were scared, as
  it was supposed to be an evil omen: but Tan-tan was not afraid. He just stood
  there, and as calm as a young god commanded M&eacute;tastase to pick up the
  log again, and when it was at last safely deposited upon the hearth, he had
  glanced round at the assembled company and remarked coolly: &ldquo;It is
  not more difficult than that!&rdquo; whereupon every one had laughed, and
  the incident was forgotten.</p>
  <p>Then another time&mdash;</p>
  <p>But what was the good of thinking about all that? They were gone, those
  dear, good times. Tan-tan was no more. He was M. le Comte de Ventadour, affianced
  to a beautiful girl whom he loved so passionately, that at even when he held
  her in his arms, the nightingale came out of his retreat amidst the branches
  of mimosa trees and sang a love song as an accompaniment to the murmur of
  her kisses.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Soon after eleven o&rsquo;clock the whole party set out to walk to Manosque
  for the midnight Mass at the little church there. Laughing, joking, singing,
  the merry troup wound its way along the road that leads up to the village
  perched upon the mountain-side, girls and boys with their arms around each
  other, older men and women soberly bringing up the rear. Overhead the canopy
  of the sky of a luminous indigo was studded with stars, and way away in the
  east the waning moon, cool and mysterious, shed its honey-coloured lustre
  over mountain peaks and valley, picked out the winding road with its fairy-light,
  till it gleamed lemon-golden like a ribbon against the leafy slopes, and
  threw fantastic shadows in the way of the lively throng. Some of them sang
  as they went along, for your Proven&ccedil;al has the temperament of the
  South in its highest degree, and when he is happy he bursts into song. And
  to-night the pale moon was golden, the blue of the sky like a sheet of sapphire
  and myriads of stars proclaimed the reign of beauty and of poesy: the night
  air was mild, with just a touch in it of snow-cooled breeze that came from
  over snow-capped Luberon: it was heavy with the fragrance of pines and eucalyptus
  and rosemary which goes to the head like wine. So men and maids, as they
  walked, held one another close, and their lips met in the pauses of their
  song.</p>
  <p>But Nicolette walked with her girl-friends, those who were not yet tokened.
  She was as merry as any of them, she chatted and she laughed, but she did
  not join in the song. To-night of all nights was one of remembrance of past
  festivals when she was a baby and her father carried her to midnight Mass,
  with Tan-tan trotting manfully by his side: sometimes it would be very cold,
  the mistral would be blowing across the valley and Marga&iuml; would wind
  a thick red scarf around her head and throat. And once, only once&mdash;it
  snowed, and Tan-tan would stop at the road side and gather up the snow and
  throw it at the passers-by.</p>
  <p>Memory was insistent. Nicolette would have liked to smother it in thoughts
  of the present, in vague hopes of the future, but every turn of the road,
  every tree, and every boulder, even the shadows that lengthened and diminished
  at her feet as she walked, were arrayed against forgetfulness.</p>
  <p>The little church at Manosque (crude in architecture, tawdry in decoration,
  ugly if measured by the canons of art and good taste) is never really unlovely.
  On days of great festivals it was even beautiful, filled as it was to overflowing
  with picturesque people, whose loving hands had helped to adorn the sacred
  edifice with all that nature yielded for the purpose: branches of grey-leaved
  eucalyptus and tender twigs of lavender, great leafy masses of stiff carob
  and feathery mimosa and delicate branches of red or saffron flowered grevillea,
  all tied with gaudy ribbons around the whitewashed pillars or nestling in
  huge, untidy bouquets around the painted effigy of the Virgin. In one corner
  of the little church, the traditional cr&ecirc;che had been erected: the
  manger against a background of leaves and stones, with the figures of Mary,
  and the Sacred Infant, of St. Joseph and the Kings. All very na&iuml;ve and
  very crude, but tender and lovable, and romantic as are the people of this
  land of sunshine and poesy.</p>
  <p>For midnight Mass, the little building was certainly too small to hold all
  the worshippers, so they overflowed into the porch, the organ-loft and the
  vestry; and those who found no place inside, remained standing in the road
  listening to the singing and the bells. The women in their gaudy shawls,
  orange, green, blue, magenta, looked like a parterre of riotous coloured
  flowers in the body of the church, while the men in their best clothes were
  squeezed against the walls or jammed into the corners, taking up as little
  of the room as they could.</p>
  <p>Nicolette knelt beside her father. On entering the church she had seen Ameyric,
  who obviously had been in wait for her and offered her the Holy water as
  she entered. His eyes had devoured her, and despite his sense of reverence
  and the solemnity of the occasion, his hand had closed over her fingers when
  she took the Holy water from him. When Father Fournier began saying Mass,
  Nicolette bowed her head between her hands and prayed with all her heart
  and soul that Ameyric might find another girl who would be worthy of him
  and return his love. She prayed too, and prayed earnestly that Bertrand might
  continue to be happy with his beloved and that he should never know a moment&rsquo;s
  disappointment or repining. Nicolette had been taught by Father Fournier
  that it was part of a Christian girl&rsquo;s duty to love every one, even
  her enemies, and to pray for them earnestly, for le Bon Dieu would surely
  know if prayers were not sincere. So Nicolette forced herself to think kindly
  of Rixende, to remember her only as she had last seen her that evening in
  May, when she lay quite placid in Bertrand&rsquo;s arms, with her head upon
  his breast and with the nightingale trilling away for dear life over her
  head.</p>
  <p>So persistently did Nicolette think of this picture that she succeeded in
  persuading herself that the thought made her happy, and then she realised
  that her face was wet with tears.</p>
  <p>Father Fournier preached a sermon all about humility and obedience and the
  example set by the Divine Master, and Nicolette wondered if it was not perhaps
  her duty to do as her father wished and to marry Ameyric Barnadou? Oh! it
  was difficult, very difficult, and Nicolette thought how much more simple
  it would be if le Bon Dieu was in the habit of telling people exactly what
  He wished them to do. The feeling of unreality once more came over her. She
  sat with eyes closed while Father Fournier went on talking, talking, and
  the air grew hotter, more heavy every moment with the fumes of the incense,
  the burning candles, the agitated breath of hundreds of entranced village
  folk. The noise, the smell, the rising clouds of incense all became blurred
  to her eyes, her ears, her nostrils: only the past remained quite real, as
  she had lived it before the awful, awful day when Tan-tan went out of her
  life, the past with its dragons, and distressful maidens, and woods redolent
  with rosemary and groves of citron-blossoms, the past as she had lived it
  with Tan-tan and Micheline, those happy Christmases of old.</p>
  <p>Tan-tan, who was a wilful, fidgety boy, was always good when he came to
  midnight Mass. Nicolette with eyes closed and Father Fournier&rsquo;s voice
  droning in her ears, could see him now sitting quite, quite still with Micheline
  on one side of him, and her, Nicolette, on the other. And they, the three
  children, sat agape while the offertory procession wound its way through
  the crowded church. She felt that she was a baby again, and that her tiny
  feet could not touch the ground, and her wee hands kept reaching out to touch
  Tan-tan&rsquo;s sleeve or his knee. Ah, that beautiful, that exciting procession!
  The children craned their little necks to see above the heads of the crowd,
  and Jaume Deydier would take his little girl in his arms and set her to stand
  upon his knee, so that she might see everything; Micheline would stand up
  with Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s arm around her to keep her steady, but Tan-tan&rsquo;s
  pride would have a long struggle with his curiosity. He would remain seated
  just like a grown man and pretend that he could see quite well; and this
  pretence he would keep up for a long while, although Nicolette would exclaim
  from time to time in that loud hoarse whisper peculiar to children:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tan-tan, stand on your chair! It is lovely!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then at last Tan-tan would give in and stand up on his chair, after which
  Nicolette felt that she could set to and enjoy the procession too. First
  the band of musicians with beribboned tambours, bagpipes and clarinets: then
  a group of young men, goatherds from Luberon or Vaucluse, carrying huge baskets
  of fruits and live pigeons: after which a miniature cart entirely covered
  with leafy branches of olive and cypress with lighted candles set all along
  its sides, and drawn by a lamb, whose snow-white fleece was adorned with
  tiny bunches of coloured ribbons; behind this cart a group of girls wearing
  the <i>Garbalin</i>, a tall conical head-dress adorned with tiny russet apples
  and miniature oranges: finally a band of singers, singing the Christmas hymns.</p>
  <p>The children would get so excited at sight of the lamb and the little cart,
  that their elders had much ado to keep them from clapping their hands or
  shouting with glee, which would have been most unseemly in the sacred building.</p>
  <p>Then, when the procession was over, they would scramble back into their
  seats and endure the rest of the Mass as best they could. Nicolette saw it
  all through the smoke of incense, the flaring candles and the thick, heady
  air. That was reality! not the dreary present with Tan-tan gone out of Nicolette&rsquo;s
  life, and a beautiful stranger with golden hair and gentian-blue eyes shouting
  petulantly at him or feigning love which she was too selfish to feel. That
  surely could not be reality: the Bon Dieu was too good to treat Tan-tan so.</p>
  <p>And as if to make the past more real still, the sound of fife and bagpipe
  and tambour struck suddenly upon Nicolette&rsquo;s ear. She looked up and
  there was the procession just starting to go round the church, the baskets
  with the live pigeons, the little cart, the white lamb with its fleece all
  tied up with ribbons: the same procession which Nicolette had watched from
  the point of vantage of her father&rsquo;s knee sixteen years ago, and had
  watched every year since&mdash;at first by Tan-tan&rsquo;s side, then with
  him gone, and the whole world a dreary blank to her.</p>
  <p>Was this then what life really meant? The same things over and over again,
  year after year, till one grew old, till one grew not to care? Did life mean
  loneliness and watching the happiness of others, while one&rsquo;s own heart
  was so full that it nearly broke? Then, if that was the case, why not do
  as father wished and marry Ameyric?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  The Turning Point</b></h2>
  <p>The first inkling that Nicolette had of the happenings at the ch&acirc;teau
  was on Christmas Day itself after High Mass. When she came out of church
  with her father some of the people had already got hold of the news: those
  who had arrived late had heard of it as they came along, and with that agitation
  which comes into even, monotonous lives whenever the unexpected occurs, groups
  of village folk stood about outside the church, and instead of the usual
  chaff and banter, every one talked only of the one thing: the events at the
  ch&acirc;teau.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? You have not heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A death in the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin, who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old Comtesse? She is very old!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Comtesse Marcelle? She is always sick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Nicolette, vaguely frightened, questioned those who seemed to know
  best. <i>Mais, voil&agrave;!</i> no one knew anything definite, although
  one or two averred that they had seen a man on horseback go up to the ch&acirc;teau,
  soon after dawn. This detail did not calm Nicolette&rsquo;s fears. On the
  contrary. If the sad news had come from a distance ... from Paris, for example....
  Oh! it was unthinkable! But already she had made up her mind. After midday
  dinner she would go and see Micheline. It was but a short walk to the ch&acirc;teau,
  and surely father could spare her for an hour or two.</p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier was obdurate at first. What had Nicolette to do with the ch&acirc;teau?
  Their affairs were no concern of hers. He himself never set foot inside that
  old owl&rsquo;s nest, and he had hoped that by now Nicolette had had enough
  of those proud, ungrateful folk. If they had trouble at the mas, would some
  one from the ch&acirc;teau come over to see what was amiss? But Nicolette
  held on to her idea. If Micheline was in trouble she would have no one to
  comfort her. Even father could not object to her friendship with Micheline,
  dear, misshapen, gentle Micheline!&mdash;and then there was the Comtesse
  Marcelle! If the old Comtesse spoke to either of them at all, it would only
  be to say unkind things! Oh! it was terrible to think of those three women
  at the ch&acirc;teau, faced with trouble, and with no one to speak to but
  one another. And until recently&mdash;the last two years, in fact&mdash;Nicolette
  had always gone over to the ch&acirc;teau on Christmas afternoon to offer
  Christmas greetings and <i>cal&egrave;nos</i> from the mas, in the shape
  of oranges, lemons, tangerines, and a beautiful <i>Poumpo taillado</i>, baked
  by herself. And now when Micheline was perhaps in trouble, and she, Nicolette,
  pining to know what the trouble was oh! father could not be so cruel as to
  stop her going.</p>
  <p>No doubt Deydier would have remained obdurate, but just at that moment he
  happened to catch sight of Ameyric. The lad was standing close by, an eager
  expression on his face, and&mdash;if such an imputation could be laid at
  the door of so sober a man as Jaume Deydier&mdash;one might almost say that
  an imp of mischief seized hold of him and whispered advice which he was prompt
  to take.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, boy!&rdquo; he called over to Ameyric; &ldquo;what do you say?
  Will you call for Nicolette after dinner, and walk with her to the ch&acirc;teau?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Aye! and escort her back,&rdquo; Ameyric replied eagerly, &ldquo;if
  Mademoiselle Deydier will allow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which the father gave the required permission, mightily satisfied
  with his own diplomacy. He had always believed in Christmas festivals for
  bringing lads and maidens together, and he himself had been tokened on Christmas
  Eve.</p>
  <p>Ameyric shook him warmly by the hand: &ldquo;Thank you, Mossou Deydier,&rdquo; he
  murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, boy,&rdquo; Deydier retorted in a whisper, &ldquo;it should
  be to-day with you, or I fear me it will be never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Whenever she thought over the sequence of events which had their beginning
  on that Christmas morning, Nicolette always looked upon that climb up to
  the ch&acirc;teau as a blank. She could not even have told you if it was
  cold or warm. She wore her beautiful orange-coloured shawl with the embroidery
  and deep fringe, and she had on shoes that were thoroughly comfortable for
  the long tramp up the road. She knew that Ameyric helped her to carry the
  baskets that contained the fruits and cakes; she also knew that at times
  he talked a great deal, and that at others there were long silences between
  them. She knew that she was very, very sorry for Ameyric, because love that
  is not reciprocated is the most cruel pain that can befall any man. She also
  tried to remember what Father Fournier had said in his sermon at midnight
  Mass, and her own firm resolution not to hate her enemies, and to submit
  her selfish will to the wishes of her father.</p>
  <p>Now and again friends overtook them and walked with them a little way, or
  others coming from Pertuis met them and exchanged greetings.</p>
  <p>The roads between the villages round about here are always busy at Christmas
  time with people coming and going to and fro, from church, or one another&rsquo;s
  houses, and Ameyric, who grumbled when a chattering crowd came to disturb
  his <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Nicolette, had to own that,
  but for the roads being so busy, he would not perhaps have been allowed to
  walk at this hour with Nicolette.</p>
  <p>And people who saw them that afternoon spread the news abroad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ameyric Barnadou,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;will be tokened before
  the New Year to Nicolette Deydier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce was just leaving the ch&acirc;teau when Nicolette
  arrived there with Ameyric. Jasmin was at the door, and the old priest said
  something to him, and then put on his hat. Ameyric was waiting in the court-yard,
  and Nicolette, with a basket on each arm, had gone up to the main entrance
  door alone. She curtsied to the priest, who nodded to her in an absent-minded
  manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very sad, very sad,&rdquo; he murmured abstractedly, &ldquo;but only
  to be expected.&rdquo; Then he seemed to become aware of Nicolette&rsquo;s
  identity, and added kindly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have come to see Mademoiselle Micheline, my child? Ah! a very
  sad Christmas for them all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But somehow Nicolette felt that these were conventional words, and that
  if there had been real sorrow at the ch&acirc;teau, Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce
  would have looked more sympathetic. Somewhat reassured already, Nicolette
  waited till the old priest had gone across the court-yard, then she slipped
  in through the great door and spoke to Jasmin:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is it, Jasmin?&rdquo; she asked excitedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame de Mont-Pahon,&rdquo; the old man replied, and Nicolette was
  conscious of an immense feeling of relief. She had not realised herself until
  this moment how desperately anxious she had been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She died, it seems, the night before last, in Paris,&rdquo; Jasmin
  went on glibly, &ldquo;but how the news came here early this morning, I do
  not pretend to know, Mam&rsquo;zelle Nicolette,&rdquo; he added in an awed
  whisper, &ldquo;it must be through the devil&rsquo;s agency.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jasmin had never even tried to fathom the mysteries of the new aerial telegraph
  which of late had been extended as far as Avignon, and which brought news
  from Paris quicker than a man could ride from Pertuis. The devil, in truth,
  had something to do with that, and Jasmin very much hoped that Father Sim&eacute;on-Luce
  had taken the opportunity of exorcising those powers of darkness whilst he
  ate his Christmas dinner with the family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I see Mademoiselle Micheline?&rdquo; Nicolette broke in impatiently
  on the old man&rsquo;s mutterings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, mam&rsquo;zelle! Mademoiselle Micheline must be somewhere
  about the house. But mam&rsquo;zelle must excuse me&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;are
  busy in the kitchen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, go, Jasmin! I&rsquo;ll find my way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was now late in the afternoon, and twilight was drawing rapidly in; while
  Jasmin shuffled off in one direction Nicolette made her way through the vestibule.
  It was very dark, for candles were terribly dear these days, but Nicolette
  knew every flagstone, every piece of furniture in the familiar old place,
  and she made her way cautiously toward the great hall, where hung the portraits.
  A buzz of conversation came from there. Then and only then did Nicolette
  realise what a foolish thing she had done. How would she dare thrust herself
  in the midst of the family circle at a moment like this? She had taken to
  living of late so much in the past that she had not realised how unwelcome
  she was at the ch&acirc;teau: but now she remembered: she remembered the
  last time she had been here, and how the old Comtesse had not even spoken
  to her, whilst Bertrand&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e had made cutting remarks about
  her. She looked down ruefully on her baskets, feeling that her cakes would
  no more be appreciated than herself. A furious desire seized her to turn
  back and to run away: but she would leave the <i>cal&egrave;nos</i> with
  Jasmin, for she would be ashamed to own to her father what a coward she had
  been. Already she had made a movement to go, when a name spoken over there
  in the portrait gallery fell on her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively Nicolette paused: there was magic in the name: she could not
  go whilst its echo lingered in the old hall.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It need make no difference to Bertrand&rsquo;s plans,&rdquo; the
  old Comtesse was saying in that hard, decisive tone which seemed to dispose
  of the destinies of her whole family.</p>
  <p>Hers was the only voice that penetrated as far as the vestibule where Nicolette
  had remained standing; the soft, wearied tones of the Comtesse Marcelle,
  and the uncertain ones of Micheline did not reach the listener&rsquo;s ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Perhaps not for the New Year,&rdquo; the old Comtesse said presently
  in response to a remark from one of the others; &ldquo;but soon, you may
  be sure. The will will be read directly after the funeral, and there is no
  reason why Bertrand should not be here a week later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again there was a pause, during which all that Nicolette heard was a weary
  sigh. Then Madame&rsquo;s harsh voice was raised again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a fool, my good Marcelle! What should go wrong, I should
  like to know?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then once more a pause and presently a loud, hard laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardi! but I should not have credited you with such a talent for
  raising bogeys, my dear. Have I not told you, over and over again, that I
  had Sybille de Mont-Pahon&rsquo;s definite promise that the two young people
  shall be co-heirs of her fortune? Instead of lamenting there, you should
  rejoice. Sybille has died most opportunely, for now Bertrand can pay his
  debts even before his marriage, and the young couple can make a start without
  a cloud upon the horizon of their lives!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this point Nicolette felt that she had no right to listen further. She
  deposited her two baskets upon the table in the vestibule, and tiptoed back
  to the door. Even as she did so she heard old Madame&rsquo;s unpleasant voice
  raised once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should thank me on your knees,&rdquo; she said tartly, &ldquo;for
  all I have done. Debts, you call them? and dare to upbraid me for having
  contracted them? Let me tell you this: Rixende de Peyron-Bompar would never
  have tolerated this old barrack at all, had she seen it as it was. The stuffs
  which I bought, the carpets, the liveries for those loutish servants were
  so much capital invested to secure the Mont-Pahon millions. What did they
  amount to? Five thousand louis at most! and we have secured five millions
  and Bertrand&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Nicolette, as she finally ran out of the house, heard a murmur, like
  a sigh of longing:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God grant it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she was not quite sure whether the sound came from the old picture hall,
  or was just the echo of the wish that had risen from her heart.</p>
  <p>Outside she met Ameyric, and he escorted her home. He spoke again of his
  love, and she was no longer impatient to hear him talk. She was intensely
  sorry for him. If he had the same pain in his heart that she had, then he
  was immensely to be pitied: and if it lay in her power to make one man happy,
  then surely it was her duty to do so.</p>
  <p>But she would make no definite promise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us wait until the spring,&rdquo; she said, in answer to an earnest
  appeal from him for a quick decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orange-blossom time?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>And with this half-promise he had perforce to be satisfied.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  Woman To Woman</b></h2>
  <p>It was fourteen days after the New Year. Snow had fallen, and the mistral
  had blown for forty-eight hours unmercifully down the valley. News from Paris
  had been scanty, but such as they were, they were reassuring. A courier had
  come over all the way from Paris on New Year&rsquo;s eve, with a letter from
  Bertrand, giving a few details of the proposed arrangements for Madame de
  Mont-Pahon&rsquo;s funeral, which was to take place on the feast of the Holy
  Innocents. The letter had been written on the day following her death, which
  had come as a great shock to everybody, even though she had been constantly
  ailing of late. Directly after the funeral, he, Bertrand, would set off for
  home in the company of M. de Peyron-Bompar, Rixende&rsquo;s father, who desired
  to talk over the new arrangements that would have to be made for his daughter&rsquo;s
  marriage. The wedding would of course have to be postponed for a few months,
  but there was no reason why it should not take place before the end of the
  summer, and as Rixende no longer had a home now in Paris, the ceremonies
  could well taken place in Bertrand&rsquo;s old home.</p>
  <p>This last suggestion sent old Madame into a veritable frenzy of management.
  The marriage of the last of the de Ventadours should be solemnised with a
  splendour worthy of the most noble traditions of his house. Closeted all
  day with P&eacute;rone, her confidential maid, the old Comtesse planned and
  arranged: day after day couriers arrived from Avignon, from Lyons and from
  Marseilles, with samples and designs and suggestions for decorations, for
  banquets, for entertainments on a brilliant scale.</p>
  <p>A whole fortnight went by in this whirl, old Madame having apparently eschewed
  all idea of mourning for her dead sister. There were consultations with Father
  Sim&eacute;on-Luce too, the Bishop of Avignon must come over to perform the
  religious ceremony in the private chapel of the ch&acirc;teau: fresh altar-frontals
  and vestments must be ordered at Arles for the great occasion.</p>
  <p>Old Madame&rsquo;s mood was electrical: Micheline quickly succumbed to it.
  She was young, and despite her physical infirmities, she was woman enough
  to thrill at thoughts of a wedding, of pretty clothes, bridal bouquets and
  banquets. And she loved Rixende! the dainty fairy-like creature who, according
  to grandmama&rsquo;s unerring judgment, would resuscitate all the past splendours
  of the old ch&acirc;teau and make it resound once more with song and laughter.</p>
  <p>Even the Comtesse Marcelle was not wholly proof against the atmosphere of
  excitement. Meetings were held in her room, and more than once she actually
  gave her opinion on the future choice of a dress for Micheline, or of a special
  dish for the wedding banquet.</p>
  <p>Bertrand was expected three days after the New Year. Grandmama had decided
  that if he and M. de Peyron-Bompar started on the 29th, the day after the
  funeral, and they were not delayed anywhere owing to the weather conditions,
  they need not be longer than five days on the way. Whereupon she set to,
  and ordered Jasmin to recruit a few lads from La Bastide or Manosque, and
  to clean out the coach-house and the stables, and to lay in a provision of
  straw and forage, as M. le Comte de Ventadour would be arriving in a few
  days in his cal&egrave;che with four horses and postilions.</p>
  <p>Nor were her spirits affected by Bertrand&rsquo;s non-arrival. The weather
  accounted for everything. The roads were blocked. If there had been a fall
  of snow here in the south, there must have been positive avalanches up in
  the north. And while the Comtesse Marcelle with her usual want of spirit
  began to droop once more after those few days of factitious well-being, old
  Madame&rsquo;s energies went on increasing, her activities never abated.
  She found in Micheline a willing, eager help, and a pale semblance of sympathy
  sprang up between the young cripple and the stately old grandmother over
  their feverish plans for Bertrand&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
  <p>The tenth day after the New Year, the Comtesse Marcelle once more took to
  her couch. She had a serious fainting fit in the morning brought on by excitement
  when a carriage was heard to rattle along the road. When the sound died away
  and she realised that the carriage had not brought Bertrand, she slid down
  to the floor like a poor bundle of rags and was subsequently found, lying
  unconscious on the doorstep of her own room, where she had been standing
  waiting to clasp Bertrand in her arms.</p>
  <p>Grandmama scolded her, tried to revive her spirits by discussing the decorations
  of Rixende&rsquo;s proposed boudoir, but Marcelle had sunk back into her
  habitual listlessness and grandmama&rsquo;s grandiloquent plans only seemed
  to exacerbate her nerves. She fell from one fainting fit into another, the
  presence of P&eacute;rone was hateful to her, Micheline was willing but clumsy.
  The next day found her in a state of fever, wide-eyed, her cheeks of an ashen
  colour, her thin hands perpetually twitching, and a look of pathetic expectancy
  in her sunken, wearied face. In the end, though grandmama protested and brought
  forth the whole artillery of her sarcasm to bear against the project, Micheline
  walked over to the mas and begged Nicolette to come over and help her look
  after mother, who once or twice, when she moaned with the pain in her head,
  had expressed the desire to have the girl beside her. Of course Jaume Deydier
  protested, but as usual Nicolette had her way, and the next day found her
  installed as sick-nurse in the room of the Comtesse Marcelle. She only went
  home to sleep. It was decided that if the next two days saw no real improvement
  in the patient&rsquo;s condition, a messenger should be sent over to Pertuis
  to fetch a physician. For the moment she certainly appeared more calm, and
  seemed content that Nicolette should wait on her.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;But on the fourteenth day, even old Madame appeared to be restless.
  All day she kept repeating to any one who happened to be nigh&mdash;to Micheline,
  to P&eacute;rone, to Jasmin&mdash;that the weather was accountable for Bertrand&rsquo;s
  delay, that he and M. de Peyron-Bompar would surely be here before nightfall,
  and that, whatever else happened, supper must be kept ready for the two travellers
  and it must be good and hot.</p>
  <p>It was then four o&rsquo;clock. The <i>volets</i> all along the fa&ccedil;ade
  of the ch&acirc;teau had been closed, and the curtains closed in all the
  rooms. The old Comtesse, impatient at her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s wan, reproachful
  looks, and irritated by Nicolette&rsquo;s presence in the invalid&rsquo;s
  room, had avoided it all day and kept to her own apartments, where P&eacute;rone,
  obsequious and sympathetic, was always ready to listen to her latest schemes
  and plans. Later on in the afternoon Micheline had been summoned to take
  coffee in grandmama&rsquo;s room, and as mother seemed inclined to sleep
  and Nicolette had promised not to go away till Micheline returned, the latter
  went readily enough. The question of Micheline&rsquo;s own dress for the
  wedding was to be the subject of debate, and Micheline, having kissed her
  mother, and made Nicolette swear to come and tell her the moment the dear
  patient woke, ran over to grandmama&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>Nicolette rearranged the pillows round Marcelle&rsquo;s aching head, then
  she sat down by the table, and took up her needlework. After awhile it certainly
  seemed as if the invalid slept. The house was very still. In the hearth a
  log of olive wood crackled cheerfully. Suddenly Nicolette looked up from
  her work. She encountered Marcelle de Ventadour&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon her.
  They looked large, dark, eager. Nicolette felt that her own heart was beating
  furiously, and a wave of heat rushed to her cheeks. She had heard a sound,
  coming from the court-yard below&mdash;a commotion&mdash;the tramp of a horse&rsquo;s
  hoofs on the flagstones&mdash;she was sure of that&mdash;then the clanking
  of metal&mdash;a shout&mdash;Bertrand&rsquo;s voice&mdash;no doubt of that&mdash;</p>
  <p>Marcelle had raised herself on her couch: a world of expectancy in her eyes.
  Nicolette threw down her work, and in an instant was out of the room and
  running along the gallery to the top of the stairs. Here she paused for a
  moment, paralysed with excitement: the next she heard the clang of the bolts
  being pulled open, the rattling of the chain, and Jasmin&rsquo;s cry of astonishment:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;M. le Comte!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the space of two seconds Nicolette hesitated between her longing to
  run down the stairs so as to be first to wish Tan-tan a happy New Year, and
  the wish to go back to the Comtesse Marcelle and see that the happy shock
  did not bring on an attack of fainting. The latter impulse prevailed. She
  turned and ran back along the gallery. But Marcelle de Ventadour had forestalled
  her. She stood on the threshold of her room, under the lintel. She had a
  candle in her hand and seemed hardly able to stand. In the flickering light,
  her features looked pinched and her face haggard: her hair was dishevelled
  and her eyes seemed preternaturally large. Nicolette ran to her, and was
  just in time to clasp the tottering form in her strong, steady arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all right, madame,&rdquo; she cried excitedly, her eyes full
  with tears of joy, &ldquo;all right, it is Bertrand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand,&rdquo; the mother murmured feebly, and then reiterated,
  babbling like a child: &ldquo;It is all right, it is Bertrand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand came slowly across the vestibule, then more slowly still up the
  stairs. The two women could not see him for the moment: they just heard his
  slow and heavy footstep coming nearer and nearer. The well of the staircase
  was in gloom, only lit by an oil lamp that hung high up from the ceiling,
  and after a moment or two Bertrand came round the bend of the stairs and
  they saw the top of his head sunk between his shoulders. His shadow projected
  by the flickering lamp-light looked grotesque against the wall, all hunched-up,
  like that of an old man.</p>
  <p>Nicolette murmured: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run and tell Micheline and Mme. la
  Comtesse!&rdquo; but suddenly Marcelle drew her back, back into the room.
  The girl felt scared: all her pleasure in Bertrand&rsquo;s coming had vanished.
  Somehow she wished that she had not seen him&mdash;that it was all a dream
  and that Bertrand was not really there. Marcelle had put the candle down
  on the table in the centre of the room. Her face looked very white, but her
  hands were quite steady; she turned up the lamp and blew out the candle and
  set it on one side, then she drew a chair close to the hearth, but she herself
  remained standing, only steadied herself with both her hands against the
  chair, and stared at the open doorway. All the while Nicolette knew that
  she must not run out and meet Bertrand, that she must not call to him to
  hurry. His mother wished that he should come into her room, and tell her&mdash;tell
  her what? Nicolette did not know.</p>
  <p>Now Bertrand was coming along the corridor. He paused one moment at the
  door: then he came in. He was in riding breeches and boots, and the collar
  of his coat was turned up to his ears: he held his riding whip in his gloved
  hand, but he had thrown down his hat, and his hair appeared moist and dishevelled.
  On the smooth blue cloth of his coat, myriads of tiny drops of moisture glistened
  like so many diamonds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is snowing a little,&rdquo; were the first words that he said. &ldquo;I
  am sorry I am so wet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand,&rdquo; the mother cried in an agony of entreaty, &ldquo;what
  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stood quite still for a moment or two, and looked at her as if he thought
  her crazy for asking such a question. Then he came farther into the room,
  threw his whip down on the table and pulled off his gloves: but still he
  said nothing. His mother and Nicolette watched him; but Marcelle did not
  ask again. She just waited. Presently he sat down on the chair by the hearth,
  rested his elbows on his knees and held his hands to the blaze. Nicolette
  from where she stood could only see his face in profile: it looked cold and
  pinched and his eyes stared into the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all over, mother,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour went up to her son, and put her thin hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mme. de Mont-Pahon,&rdquo; he went on in a perfectly quiet, matter-of-fact
  tone of voice, &ldquo;has left the whole of her fortune to her great-niece
  Rixende absolutely. Two hours after the reading of the will, M. de Peyron-Bompar
  came to me and told me in no measured language that having heard in what
  a slough of debt I and my family were wallowing, he would not allow his daughter&rsquo;s
  fortune to be dissipated in vain efforts to drag us out of that mire. He
  ended by declaring that all idea of my marrying Rixende must at once be given
  up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here his voice shook a little, and with a quick, impatient gesture he passed
  his hand across his brows. Marcelle de Ventadour said nothing for the moment.
  Her hand was still on his shoulder. Nicolette, who watched her closely, saw
  not the faintest sign of physical weakness in her quiet, silent attitude.
  Then as Bertrand was silent too, she asked after awhile:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you speak to Rixende?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did I speak to Rixende?&rdquo; he retorted, and a hard, unnatural
  laugh broke from his parched, choking throat. &ldquo;My God! until I spoke
  with her I had no idea how much humiliation a man could endure, and survive
  the shame of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He buried his face in his hands and a great sob shook his bent shoulders.
  Marcelle de Ventadour stared wide-eyed into the fire, and Nicolette, watching
  Tan-tan&rsquo;s grief, felt that Mother Earth could not hold greater misery
  for any child of hers than that which she endured at this moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rixende did not love you, Bertrand,&rdquo; the mother murmured dully, &ldquo;she
  never loved you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She must have hated me,&rdquo; Bertrand rejoined quietly, &ldquo;and
  now she despises me too. You should have heard her laugh, mother, when I
  spoke to her of our life here together in the old ch&acirc;teau&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice broke. Of course he could not bear to speak of it: and Nicolette
  had to stand by, seemingly indifferent, whilst she saw great tears force
  themselves into his eyes. She longed to put her arms round him, to draw his
  head against her cheek, to smooth his hair and kiss the tears away. Her heart
  was full with words of comfort, of hope, of love which, if only she dared,
  she would have given half her life to utter. But she was the stranger, the
  intruder even, at this hour. Except for the fact that she was genuinely afraid
  Marcelle de Ventadour might collapse at any moment, she would have slipped
  away unseen. Marcelle for the moment seemed to find in her son&rsquo;s grief,
  a measure of strength such as she had not known whilst she was happy. She
  had led such an isolated, self-centred life that she was too shy now to be
  demonstrative, and it was pathetic to watch the effort which she made to
  try and speak the words of comfort which obviously hovered on her lips; but
  nevertheless she stood by him, with her hand on his shoulder, and something
  of the magnetism of her love for him must have touched his senses, for presently
  he seized hold of her hand and pressed it against his lips.</p>
  <p>The clock above the hearth ticked loudly with a nerve-racking monotony.
  The minutes sped on while Bertrand and his mother stared into the fire, both
  their minds a blank&mdash;grief having erased every other thought from their
  brain. Nicolette hardly dared to move. So far it seemed that Bertrand had
  remained entirely unaware of her presence, and in her heart she prayed that
  he might not see her, lest he felt his humiliation and his misery more completely
  if he thought that she had witnessed it.</p>
  <p>After awhile the Comtesse Marcelle said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must be hungry, Bertrand, we&rsquo;ll let grandmama know you&rsquo;re
  here. She has ordered supper to be ready for you, as soon as you came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand appeared to wake as if out of a dream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you speak, mother?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must be hungry, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes!&rdquo; he murmured vaguely. &ldquo;Perhaps I am. It
  was a long ride from Pertuis&mdash;the roads are bad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandmama has ordered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But quickly Bertrand seized his mother&rsquo;s hands again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  tell grandmama yet,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;I&mdash;I could not&mdash;not
  yet....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you must be hungry, dear,&rdquo; the mother insisted, &ldquo;and
  grandmama will have to know,&rdquo; she added gently. &ldquo;And there is
  Micheline!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I am a fool&mdash;but&mdash; Let
  us wait a little, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again he kissed his mother&rsquo;s hands, but he never once looked up into
  her face. Once when the light from the lamp struck full upon him, Nicolette
  saw how much older he had grown, and that there was a look in his eyes as
  if he was looking into the future, and saw something there that was tragic
  and inevitable!</p>
  <p>That look frightened her. But what could she do? Some one ought to be warned
  and Bertrand should not be allowed to remain alone&mdash;not for one moment.
  Did the mother realise this? Was this the reason why she remained standing
  beside him with her hand on his shoulder, as if to warn him or to protect?</p>
  <p>Five minutes went by, perhaps ten! For Nicolette it was an eternity. Then
  suddenly grandmama&rsquo;s voice was heard from way down the gallery, obviously
  speaking to Jasmin:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why was I not told at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which there was a pause, and then footsteps along the corridor: Micheline&rsquo;s
  halting dot and carry one, grandmama&rsquo;s stately gait.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bertrand said and jumped to his feet. &ldquo;You
  tell her, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, my dear,&rdquo; Marcelle rejoined soothingly, quite gently
  as if she were speaking to a sick child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me get away somewhere,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;where she can&rsquo;t
  see me&mdash;not just yet&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;It was Nicolette who ran to the door which gave on Marcelle&rsquo;s
  bedroom, and threw it open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, my dear,&rdquo; Marcelle said, and taking Bertrand&rsquo;s
  hand she led him towards the door. &ldquo;Nicolette is quite right&mdash;go
  into my bedroom&mdash;I&rsquo;ll explain to grandmama.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette?&rdquo; Bertrand murmured and turned his eyes on her, as
  if suddenly made aware of her presence. A dark flush spread all over his
  face. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know she was here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two women exchanged glances. They understood one another. It meant looking
  after Bertrand, and, if possible, keeping old Madame from him for a little
  while.</p>
  <p>Bertrand followed Nicolette into his mother&rsquo;s room. He did not speak
  to her again, but sank into a chair as if he were mortally tired. She went
  to a cupboard where a few provisions were always kept for Marcelle de Ventadour,
  in case she required them in the night: a bottle of wine and some cake. Nicolette
  put these on the table with a glass and poured out the wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drink it, Bertrand,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;it will please your
  mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later she went back to the boudoir. Old Madame was standing in the middle
  of the room, and as Nicolette entered she was saying tartly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why was I not told?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was just on the point of sending Nicolette to you, Madame&mdash;&rdquo; Marcelle
  de Ventadour said timidly. Her voice was shaking, her face flushed and she
  wandered about the room, restlessly fingering the draperies. Whereupon the
  old Comtesse raised her lorgnette and stared at Nicolette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;Mademoiselle Deydier has not yet
  gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was just going, Madame,&rdquo; the younger woman rejoined, &ldquo;when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you have not yet seen Bertrand?&rdquo; grandmama broke in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Marcelle replied, stammering and flushing, &ldquo;that
  is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;No, ... that is, ...&rsquo;?&rdquo; old
  Madame retorted sharply. &ldquo;Ah &ccedil;a, my good Marcelle, what is
  all this mystery? Where is my grandson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was here a moment ago, he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where is M. de Peyron-Bompar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did not come. He is in Paris&mdash;that is&mdash;I think so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Peyron-Bompar not here? But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly she paused: and Nicolette who watched her, saw that the last vestige
  of colour left her cheeks. Her eyelids fluttered for a moment or two, and
  her eyes narrowed, narrowed till they were mere slits. The Comtesse Marcelle
  stood by the table, steadying herself against it with her hand: but that
  hand was shaking visibly. Old Madame walked slowly, deliberately across the
  room until she came to within two steps of her daughter-in-law: then she
  said very quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has happened to Bertrand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour gave a forced little laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, nothing, Madame,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What should have happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a fool, Marcelle,&rdquo; grandmama went on with slow deliberation. &ldquo;Your
  face and your hands have betrayed you. Tell me what has happened to Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Marcelle replied, &ldquo;nothing!&rdquo; But her
  voice broke in a sob, she sank into a chair and hid her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t tell me, I will think the worst,&rdquo; old Madame
  continued quietly. &ldquo;Jasmin has seen him. He is in the house. But he
  dare not face me. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Marcelle was at the end of her tether. Now she could do no more than
  moan and cry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;His marriage with Rixende de Peyron-Bompar is broken off. Speak,&rdquo; the
  old woman added, and with her claw-like hand seized her daughter-in-law by
  the shoulder, &ldquo;fool, can&rsquo;t you speak? <i>Nom de Dieu</i>, I&rsquo;ll
  have to know presently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her grip was so strong that involuntarily, Marcelle gave a cry of pain.
  This was more than Nicolette could stand: even her timidity gave way before
  her instinct of protection, of standing up for this poor, tortured, weak
  woman whom she loved because she was the mother of Tan-tan and suffered now
  almost as much as he did. She ran to Marcelle and put her arms round her,
  shielding her against further attack from the masterful, old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mme. la Comtesse is overwrought,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;or
  she would have said at once what has happened. M. le Comte has come home
  alone. Mme. de Mont-Pahon has left the whole of her fortune to Mlle. Rixende
  absolutely, and so she, and M. de Peyron-Bompar have broken off the marriage,
  and,&rdquo; she added boldly, &ldquo;we are all thanking God that he has
  saved M. le Comte from those awful harpies!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Madame had listened in perfect silence while Nicolette spoke: and indeed
  the girl herself could not help but pay a quick and grudging tribute of admiration
  to this old woman, who faithful to the traditions of her aristocratic forbears,
  received this staggering blow without flinching and without betraying for
  one instant what she felt. There was absolute silence in the room after that:
  only the clock continued its dreary and monotonous ticking. The Comtesse
  Marcelle lay back on her couch with eyes closed and a look almost of relief
  on her wan face, now that the dread moment had come and gone. Micheline had,
  as usual, taken refuge in the window embrasure and Nicolette knelt beside
  Marcelle, softly chafing her hands. Grandmama was still standing beside the
  table, lorgnette in hand, erect and unmoved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand,&rdquo; she said after awhile, &ldquo;is in there, I suppose.&rdquo; And
  with her lorgnette she pointed to the bedroom door, which Nicolette had carefully
  closed when she entered, drawing the heavy porti&egrave;re before it, so
  as to prevent the sound of voices from penetrating through. Nicolette hoped
  that Bertrand had heard nothing of what had gone on in the boudoir, and now
  when grandmama pointed toward the door, she instinctively rose to her feet
  as if making ready to stand between this irascible old woman and the grief-stricken
  man. But old Madame only shrugged her shoulders and looked down with unconcealed
  contempt on her daughter-in-law.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ought to have guessed,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;What a fool
  you are, my good Marcelle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she paused a moment and added slowly as if what she wished to say caused
  her a painful effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose Bertrand said nothing about money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour opened her eyes and murmured vaguely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardi!&rdquo; grandmama retorted impatiently, &ldquo;the question
  of money will loom largely in this affair presently, I imagine. There are
  Bertrand&rsquo;s debts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again she shrugged her shoulders with an air of indifference, as if that
  matter was unworthy of her consideration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose that his creditors, when they heard that the marriage was
  broken off, flocked around him like vultures.&mdash;Did he not speak of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly Marcelle raised herself from her couch. Her eyes circled with deep
  purple rims looked large and glowing, as they remained fixed upon her mother-in-law.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said tonelessly, &ldquo;Bertrand is too broken-hearted
  at present to think of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will have to mend his heart then,&rdquo; grandmama rejoined dryly, &ldquo;those
  sharks will be after him soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marcelle threw back her head, and for a moment looked almost defiant:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The debts which he contracted, he did at your bidding, Madame,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he did, my good Marcelle,&rdquo; old Madame retorted coldly, &ldquo;but
  the creditors will want paying all the same. If the marriage had come about,
  this would have been easy enough, as I told you at the time. Bertrand was
  a fool not to have known how to win that jade&rsquo;s affections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A cry of indignation rose to the mother&rsquo;s throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo; Madame riposted unmoved. &ldquo;Young men have before
  now succeeded in gaining a woman&rsquo;s love, even when she sat on a mountain
  of money-bags and he had not even one to fasten to his saddle-bow. It should
  have been easier for Bertrand with his physique and his accomplishments to
  win a woman&rsquo;s love than it will be for him to pay his debts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You know very well,&rdquo; Marcelle cried, &ldquo;that he cannot
  do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is why we shall have to think of something,&rdquo; grandmama
  retorted, and at that moment went deliberately towards the door. Her hand
  was already on the porti&egrave;re and Nicolette stood by undecided what
  she should do, when suddenly Marcelle sprang forward more like a wild animal,
  defending its young, than an ailing, timid woman: she interposed her slim,
  shrunken form between the door and the old woman, and whispered hoarsely,
  but commandingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want with Bertrand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Madame, taken aback, raised her aristocratic eyebrows: she looked her
  daughter-in-law ironically up and down, then, as was her wont, she shrugged
  her shoulders and tried to push her aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear Marcelle,&rdquo; she said icily, &ldquo;have you taken leave
  of your senses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Marcelle replied, in a voice which she was endeavouring
  to keep steady. &ldquo;I only want to know what you are going to say to Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will depend on what he tells me,&rdquo; grandmama went on coldly. &ldquo;You
  do not suppose, I presume, that the future can be discussed without my having
  a say in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; the younger woman rejoined, &ldquo;seeing that
  the present is entirely of your making.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I pray you let me go to Bertrand. I wish to speak with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call him. And you shall speak with him in my presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now she spoke quite firmly: her face was very pale and her eyes certainly
  had a wild look in them. With a mechanical gesture she pushed the unruly
  strands of her hair from her moist forehead. Old Madame gazed at her for
  a moment or two in silence, then she broke into harsh, ironical laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ah &ccedil;a, ma mie!</i>&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Will you tell
  me, I pray, what is the exact meaning of this melodramatic scene?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have already told you,&rdquo; Marcelle replied more calmly, &ldquo;if
  you wish to speak with Bertrand, we&rsquo;ll call him, and you shall speak
  with him here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand and I understand one another. We prefer to talk together,
  when we are alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The matter that concerns him concerns us all equally. You may speak
  with him if you wish&mdash;but only in my presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, <i>nom de Dieu</i>!&rdquo; old Madame exclaimed, &ldquo;will
  you tell me by what right you propose to stand between me and my grandson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the right which you gave me, Madame,&rdquo; Marcelle replied with
  slow deliberation, &ldquo;when you stood between your son and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marcelle!&rdquo; the old woman cried, and her harsh voice for the
  first time had in it a quiver of latent passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The evil which you wrought that night,&rdquo; Marcelle went on slowly, &ldquo;shall
  not find its echo now. I was really a fool then. Such monsters as you had
  never been within my ken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, you idiot!&rdquo; old Madame broke in, throwing into her
  tone and into her attitude all the authority which she knew so well how to
  exert. But Marcelle would not be silenced. She was just one of those weak,
  down-trodden creatures who, when roused, are as formidable in their wrath
  as they are obstinate in their purpose. She spoke now as if for the past
  twenty years she had been longing for this relief and the words tumbled out
  of her mouth like an avalanche falls down the side of a mountain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An idiot!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Yes, you are right there,
  Madame! A dolt and a fool! but, thank God, sufficiently sane to-night to
  prevent your staining your hands with my son&rsquo;s blood, as you did with
  that of his father. Had I not been a fool, should I not have guessed your
  purpose that night?&mdash;then, too, you wished to speak with your son alone&mdash;then
  too you wished to discuss the future after you had dragged him down with
  you into a morass of debts and obligations which he could not meet. To satisfy
  your lust for pomp, and for show, you made him spend and borrow, and then
  when the day of reckoning came&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Marcelle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When the day of reckoning came,&rdquo; Marcelle reiterated coldly, &ldquo;you,
  his mother, placed before him the only alternative that your damnable pride
  would allow&mdash;a pistol which you, yourself, put into his hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son preferred death to dishonour,&rdquo; old Madame put in boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At his mother&rsquo;s command,&rdquo; the other retorted. &ldquo;Oh!
  you thought I did not know, you thought I did not guess. But&mdash;you remember&mdash;it
  was midsummer&mdash;the window was open&mdash;I was down in the garden&mdash;I
  heard your voice: &lsquo;My son, there is only one way open for a de Ventadour!&rsquo; I
  ran into the house, I ran up the stairs&mdash;you remember?&mdash;I was on
  the threshold when rang the pistol shot which at your bidding had ended his
  dear life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I did then is between me and my conscience&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Marcelle replied, &ldquo;but for what you do now,
  you will answer to me. I suffered once&mdash;I will not suffer again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again with that same wild gesture she pushed her hair away from her forehead.
  Nicolette thought that she was on the point of swooning, but her excitement
  gave her strength: she pulled herself together, drew the porti&egrave;re
  aside, opened the door, and went through into the other room.</p>
  <p>Grandmama appeared for a moment undecided: that her pride had received a
  severe shaking, there could be no doubt: for once she had been routed in
  a wordy combat with the woman whom she affected to despise. But she was too
  arrogant, too dictatorial to argue, where she had failed to command. Perhaps
  she knew that her influence over Bertrand would not be diminished by his
  mother&rsquo;s interference. She was not ashamed of that dark page in the
  past history: her notions of honour, and of what was due to the family name
  were not likely to be modified by the ravings of a sick imbecile. She was
  fond of Bertrand and proud of him, but if the cataclysm which she dreaded
  did eventually come about, she would still far sooner see him dead than dishonoured.
  A debtor&rsquo;s prison was no longer an impossibility for a de Ventadour;
  the principles of equality born of that infamous Revolution, and fostered
  by that abominable Corsican upstart had not been altogether eliminated from
  the laws of France with the restoration of her Bourbon kings. Everything
  nowadays was possible, even, it seems, the revolt of weak members of a family
  against its acknowledged head.</p>
  <p>Marcelle had gone through into the next room without caring whether her
  mother-in-law followed her or not. Just as she entered she was heard to call
  her son&rsquo;s name, tenderly, and as if in astonishment. Old Madame then
  took a step forward and peeped through the door. Then she threw back her
  head and laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What an anti-climax, eh, my good Marcelle,&rdquo; she said with cool
  sarcasm. &ldquo;See what a fool you were to make such a scene. While you
  spouted heroics at me about pistols and suicide, the boy was comfortably
  asleep. When he wakes,&rdquo; she added lightly, &ldquo;send him to me, and
  you may chaperon him if you like. I do not see a tragedy in this sleeping
  prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With that she went: and Nicolette ran into the next room. The Comtesse Marcelle
  was on the verge of a collapse. Nicolette contrived to undress her and put
  her to bed. Bertrand did not stir. He had drunk a couple of glasses of wine
  and eaten some of the cake, then apparently his head had fallen forward over
  his arms, and leaning right across the table he had fallen asleep. The sound
  of voices had not roused him. He was so tired, so tired! Nicolette, while
  she looked after Marcelle, was longing to undo Bertrand&rsquo;s heavy boots,
  and place a cushion for his head, and make him lean back in his chair. This
  was such an uncomfortable, lonely house, lonely for every one except old
  Madame, who had P&eacute;rone to look after her. Marcelle and poor little
  Micheline looked after themselves, and Bertrand only had old Jasmin. During
  Mlle. de Peyron-Bompar&rsquo;s visit last May, some extra servants had been
  got in to make a show. They had been put into smart liveries for the time
  being, but had since gone away again. It was all a very dreary homecoming
  for Tan-tan, and Nicolette, who longed to look after his creature comforts,
  was forced to go away before she could do anything for him.</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour kissed and thanked her. She assured her that she felt
  well and strong. P&eacute;rone, though dour and repellent, would come and
  see to her presently, and Micheline slept in a room close by. Between them
  they would look after Bertrand when he woke from this long sleep. The supper
  ordered for two was still there. Jasmin would see to it that Bertrand had
  all that he wanted.</p>
  <p>A little reassured, Nicolette went away at last, promising to come again
  the next day. Micheline accompanied her as far as the main door: the girl
  had said absolutely nothing during the long and painful scene which had put
  before her so grim a picture of the past: she was so self-centred, so reserved,
  that not even to Nicolette did she reveal what she had felt: only she clung
  more closely than even before to the friend whom she loved: and when the
  two girls finally said &ldquo;good night&rdquo; to one another they remained
  for a long time clasped in one another&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand will be all right now,&rdquo; Nicolette whispered in the
  end, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think old Madame will want to see him, and he is
  so tired that he will not even think. But do not leave him too much alone,
  Micheline. Promise!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Micheline promised.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Grey Dawn</b></h2>
  <p>Strange that it should all have happened in the grey dawn of a cold winter&rsquo;s
  morning. Nicolette, when she came home afterwards and thought it all out,
  marvelled whether the grey sky, the muffled cadence of the trees, the mysterious
  pallidity of the woods were a portent of the future. And yet if it had to
  be done all over again, she would not have acted differently, and minute
  by minute, hour by hour, it seemed as if destiny had guided her&mdash;or
  God&rsquo;s hand, perhaps! Oh, surely it was God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>She rose early because she had passed a restless, miserable night, also
  her head ached and she longed for fresh air. It was still dark, but Marga&iuml; was
  astir, and a bright fire was blazing in the kitchen when Nicolette came down.
  She was not hungry, but to please Marga&iuml; she drank some warm milk and
  ate the home-made bread, and when the cold morning light first peeped in
  through the open window, she set out for a walk.</p>
  <p>She went down the terraced gradients into the valley, and turned to wander
  up the river bank, keeping her shawl closely wrapped around her shoulders,
  as it was very cold. The L&egrave;ze, swelled by the early winter&rsquo;s
  rains, tossed and tumbled in its bed with fretful turbulence. The snow lay
  deep in untidy little heaps in all sorts of unexpected nooks and crannies,
  but the smooth surfaces of the boulders were shiny with dewy frost and the
  blades of the rough grass were heavy with moisture.</p>
  <p>The air was very still, and slowly the silvery dawn crept up behind the
  canopy of clouds, and transformed it into a neutral tinted veil that hung
  loosely over the irregular heights of Luberon and concealed the light that
  lay beyond. One by one the terraced slopes emerged from the pall of night,
  and the moist blades of grass turned to strings of tiny diamonds. A pallid
  argent hue lay over mountain and valley, and every leaf of every tree became
  a looking-glass that mirrored the colourless opalescence of the sky.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>When Nicolette started out for this early morning walk she had no thought
  of meeting Bertrand. Indeed she had no thought of anything beyond a desire
  to be alone, and to still the restlessness which had kept her awake all night.
  Anon she reached the pool and the great boulder that marked the boundary
  of Paul et Virginie&rsquo;s island, and she came to a halt beside the carob
  tree on the spot hallowed by all the cherished memories of the past.</p>
  <p>And suddenly she saw Bertrand.</p>
  <p>He too had wandered along the valley by the bank of the stream, and Nicolette
  felt that it was her intense longing for him that had brought him hither
  to this land of yore.</p>
  <p>How it all came about she could not have told you. Bertrand looked as if
  he had not slept: his eyes were ringed with purple, he was hatless, and his
  hair clung dishevelled and moist against his forehead. Nicolette led the
  way to the old olive tree, and there they stood together for awhile, and
  she made him tell her all about himself. At first it seemed as if it hurt
  him to speak at all, but gradually his reserve appeared to fall away from
  him: he talked more and more freely! he spoke of his love for Rixende, how
  it had sprung into being at first sight of her: he spoke of the growth of
  his love through days of ardour and nights of longing, when, blind to all
  save the beauty of her, he would have laid down his life to hold her in his
  arms. He also spoke of that awful day of humiliation and of misery when he
  dragged himself on his knees at her feet like an abject beggar imploring
  one crumb of pity, and saw his love spurned, his ideal shattered, and his
  father&rsquo;s shame flung into his face like a soiled rag.</p>
  <p>What he had been unable to say to his mother he appeared to speak of with
  real relief to Nicolette. He seemed like a man groaning under a heavy load,
  who is gradually being eased of his burden. He owned that for hours after
  that terrible day he had been a prey to black despair: it was only the thought
  of his father&rsquo;s disgrace and of his mother&rsquo;s grief that kept
  him from the contemplation of suicide. But his career was ended: soon those
  harpies, who were counting on his wealthy marriage to exact their pound of
  flesh from him, would fall on him like a cloud of locusts, and to the sorrow
  in his heart would be added the dishonour of his name. His happiness had
  fled on the wings of disappointment and disillusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Rixende whom I loved,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;never existed. She
  was just a creation of my own brain, born of a dream. The woman who jeered
  at me because I loved her and had nothing to offer her but my love, was a
  stranger whom I had never known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was it at that precise moment that the thought took shape in her mind, or
  had it always been there? Always? When she used to run after him and thrust
  her baby hand into his palm? Or when she gazed up-stream, pretending that
  the L&egrave;ze was the limitless ocean, on which never a ship appeared to
  take her and Tan-tan away from their island of bliss? All the dreams of her
  girlhood came floating, like pale, ghostlike visions, before Nicolette&rsquo;s
  mind; dreams when she wandered hand in hand with Tan-tan up the valley and
  the birds around her sang a chorus: &ldquo;He loves thee, passionately!&rdquo; Dreams
  when he was gay and happy, and they would laugh together and sing till the
  mountain peaks gave echo to their joy! Dreams when, wearied or sad, he would
  pillow his head on her breast, and allow her to stroke his hair, and to whisper
  soft words of comfort, or sing to him his favourite songs.</p>
  <p>Those dream visions had long since receded into forgetfulness, dispelled
  by the masterful hand of a beautiful woman with gentian-blue eyes and a heart
  of stone. Was this the hour to recall them from never-never land? to let
  them float once more before her mind? and was this the hour to lend an ear
  to the sweet insidious voice that whispered: &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; even
  on this cold winter&rsquo;s morning, when a pall of grey monotone lay over
  earth and sky, when the winter wind soughed drearily through the trees, and
  every bird-song was stilled?</p>
  <p>Is there a close time for love? Perhaps. But there is none for that sweet
  and gentle pity which is the handmaid of the compelling Master of the Universe.
  The sky might be grey, the flowers dead and the birds still, but Nicolette&rsquo;s
  heart whispered to her that Tan-tan was in pain; he had been hurt in his
  love, in his pride, in that which he held dearer than everything in life:
  the honour of his name. And she, Nicolette, had it in her power to shield
  him, his honour and his pride, whilst in her heart there was such an infinity
  of love, that the wounds which he had endured would be healed by its magical
  power.</p>
  <p>How it came about she knew not. He had spoken and he was tired: shame and
  sorrow had brought tears to his eyes. Then all of a sudden she put out her
  arms and drew his head down upon her breast. Like a mother crooning over
  her sick baby, she soothed and comforted him: and words of love poured out
  from her heart as nectar from an hallowed vessel, and in her eyes there glowed
  a light of such perfect love and such sublime surrender, that he, dazed at
  first, not understanding, could but listen in silence, and let this marvellous
  ray of hope slowly filtrate through the darkness of his despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; he cried the moment he could realise what it was
  she was saying, &ldquo;do you really love me enough to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she quickly put her hand over his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask me no question, Tan-tan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have always
  loved you, neither more nor less&mdash;just loved you always&mdash;and now
  that you are in trouble and really need me, how can you ask if I love you
  enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your father will never permit it, Nicolette,&rdquo; he said soberly
  after a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will permit it,&rdquo; she rejoined simply, &ldquo;because now
  I should die if anything were to part us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only I could be worthy of your love, little one,&rdquo; he murmured
  ruefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, my dear,&rdquo; she whispered in reply. &ldquo;In love no one
  is either worthy or unworthy. If you love me, then you have given me such
  a priceless treasure that I should not even envy the angels up in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I love you, sweetheart!&rdquo; he sighed, and a sharp pang of
  remorse shot through his heart.</p>
  <p>But she was content even with this semblance of love. Never of late, in
  her happiest dreams, had she thought it possible that she and Tan-tan would
  ever really belong to one another. Oh! she had no illusions as to the present:
  the image of that blue-eyed little fiend had not been wholly eradicated from
  his heart, but so long as she had him she would love him so much, so much,
  that in time he would forget everything save her who made him happy.</p>
  <p>They talked for awhile of the future: she would not see that in his heart
  he was ashamed&mdash;ashamed of her generosity and of his own weakness for
  accepting it. But she had found the right words, and he had been in such
  black despair that this glorious future which she held out before him was
  like a vision of paradise, and he was young and human, and did not turn his
  back on his own happiness. Then, as time was getting on, they remembered
  that there was a world besides themselves: a world to which they would now
  have to return and which they would have to face. It was no use restarting
  a game of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pretend!&rdquo; on their desert island. A ship
  had come in sight on the limitless ocean, and they must make ready to go
  back.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Hand in hand they wandered down the valley. It was just like one of
  those pictures of which Nicolette had dreamed. She and Tan-tan alone together,
  the L&egrave;ze murmuring at their feet, the soughing of the trees making
  sweet melody as they walked. Way up in the sky a thin shaft of brilliant
  light had rent the opalescent veil and tinged the heights of Luberon with
  gold. The warm sun of Provence would have its way. It tore at that drab grey
  veil, tore and tore, until the rent grew wider and the firmament over which
  he reigned was translucent and blue. The leaves on the trees mirrored the
  azure of the sky, the mountain stream gurgled and whispered with a sound
  like human laughter, and from a leafy grove of winter oak a pair of pigeons
  rose and flew away over the valley, and disappeared in the nebulous ether
  beyond.</p>

  <p>There was the natural longing to keep one&rsquo;s happiness to oneself just
  for a little while, and Nicolette decided that it would be better for Bertrand
  to wait awhile before coming over to the mas, until she herself had had an
  opportunity of speaking with her father. For the moment she felt that she
  was walking on clouds, and that it would be difficult to descend to earth
  sufficiently to deceive both father and Marga&iuml;. Nor did she deceive
  either of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter with the child?&rdquo; Jaume Deydier said after
  midday dinner, when Nicolette ran out of the room singing and laughing in
  response to nothing at all.</p>
  <p>And Marga&iuml; shrugged her shoulders. She could not think. Deydier suggested
  that perhaps Ameyric.... Eh, what? Girls did not know their own hearts until
  a man came along and opened the little gate with his golden key. Marga&iuml; shrugged
  her shoulders again: this time out of contempt for a man&rsquo;s mentality.
  It was not Ameyric of a surety who had the power to make Nicolette sing and
  laugh as she had not done for many a month, or to bring that glow into her
  cheeks and the golden light into her eyes. No, no, it was not Ameyric!</p>
  <p>Then as the afternoon wore on and the shades of evening came creeping round
  the corners of the cosy room, Jaume Deydier sat in his chair beside the hearth
  in which great, hard olive logs blazed cheerfully. He was in a soft and gentle
  mood. And Nicolette told him all that had happened ... to Bertrand and to
  her.</p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier heard the story of Mme. de Mont-Pahon&rsquo;s will, and of
  Rixende&rsquo;s cruelty, with a certain grim satisfaction. He was sorry for
  the Comtesse Marcelle&mdash;very sorry&mdash;but the blow would fall most
  heavily on old Madame, and for once she would see all her schemes tumbling
  about her ears like a house of cards.</p>
  <p>Then Nicolette knelt down beside him and told him everything. Her walk this
  morning, her meeting with Bertrand: her avowal of love and offer of marriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It came from me, father dear,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;Bertrand
  would never have dared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Deydier had not put in one word while his daughter spoke. He did not
  even look at her, only stared into the fire. When she had finished he said
  quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, little one, all that you can do is to forget all about this
  morning&rsquo;s walk and what has passed between you and M. le Comte de Ventadour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Understand me, my dear once and for all,&rdquo; Deydier went on quite
  unmoved; &ldquo;never with my consent will you marry one of that brood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolette was silent for a moment or two. She had expected opposition, of
  course. She knew her father and his dearly-loved scheme that she should marry
  young Barnadou: she also knew that deep down in his heart there was a bitter
  grudge against old Madame. What this grudge was she did not know, but she
  had complete faith in her father&rsquo;s love, and in any case she would
  be fighting for her happiness. So she put her arms around him and leaned
  her head against his shoulder, in that cajoling manner which she had always
  found irresistible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you are speaking about my happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said with a dull sigh of weariness, &ldquo;I
  am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of my life, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette,&rdquo; the father cried, with a world of anxiety, of reproach,
  of horror in his tone.</p>
  <p>But Nicolette knelt straight before him now, sitting on her heels, her hands
  clasped before her, her eyes fixed quite determinedly on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love Bertrand, father,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;and he loves
  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He loves me,&rdquo; Nicolette reiterated with firm conviction. &ldquo;A
  woman is never mistaken over that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A woman perhaps, my dear,&rdquo; the father retorted gently, and
  passed a hand that shook a little over her hair: &ldquo;but you are such
  a child, my little Nicolette. You have never been away from our mountains
  and our skies, where God&rsquo;s world is pure and simple. What do you know
  of evil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no evil in Bertrand&rsquo;s love for me,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! there is evil in all the de Ventadours. They are all tainted
  with the mania for show and for wealth. And now that they are bankrupt in
  pocket as well as in honour, they hope to regild their stained escutcheon
  with your money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is false!&rdquo; Nicolette broke in vehemently, &ldquo;no one
  at the ch&acirc;teau knows that Bertrand and I love one another. A few hours
  ago he did not know that I cared for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A few hours ago he knew that his father&rsquo;s fate was at his door.
  He is up to his eyes in debt; nothing can save even the roof over his head;
  his mother, his sister and that old harpy his grandmother have nothing ahead
  of them but beggary. Then suddenly you come to him with sweet words prompted
  by your dear kind heart, and that man, tottering on the brink of an awful
  precipice, sees a prop that will save him from stumbling headlong down. The
  Deydier money, he says to himself, why not indeed? True I shall have to stoop
  and marry the daughter of a vulgar peasant, but I can&rsquo;t have the money
  without the wife, and so I&rsquo;ll take her, and when I have got her, I
  can return to my fine friends in Paris, to the Court of Versailles and all
  the gaieties, and she poor fool can stay at home and nurse my mother or attend
  to the whims of old Madame; and if she frets and repines and eats out her
  heart with loneliness down at my old owl&rsquo;s nest in Provence, well then
  I shall be rid of her all the sooner....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Nicolette cried with sudden passionate intensity which
  she made no attempt to check. &ldquo;What wrong has Bertrand done to you
  that you should be willing to sacrifice my happiness to your revenge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A harsh laugh came from Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s choking throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Revenge?&rdquo; he exclaimed. And then again: &ldquo;Revenge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, revenge!&rdquo; Nicolette went on with glowing eyes and flaming
  cheeks. &ldquo;Oh, I know! I know! There is a dark page somewhere in our
  family history connected with the ch&acirc;teau, and because of that&mdash;because
  of that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice broke in a sob. She was crouching beside the hearth at her father&rsquo;s
  feet, and for a moment he looked down at her as if entirely taken aback by
  her passionate protest. Life had always gone on so smoothly at the mas, that
  Jaume Deydier had until now never realised that the motherless baby whom
  he had carried about in his arms had become a woman with a heart, and a mind
  and passions of her own. It had never struck him that his daughter&mdash;little
  Nicolette with the bright eyes and the merry laugh, the child that toddled
  after him, obedient and loving&mdash;would one day wish to frame her destiny
  apart from him, apart from her old home.</p>
  <p>A child! A child! He had always thought of her as a child&mdash;then as
  a growing girl who would marry Ameyric Barnadou one day, and in due course
  present her husband with a fine boy or two and perhaps a baby girl that would
  be the grandfather&rsquo;s joy!</p>
  <p>But this girl!&mdash;this woman with the flaming eyes in which glowed passion,
  reproach, an indomitable will; this woman whose voice, whose glance expressed
  the lust of a fight for her love and her happiness!&mdash;was this his Nicolette?</p>
  <p>Ah! here was a problem, the like of which had never confronted Jaume Deydier&rsquo;s
  even existence before now. How he would deal with it he did not yet know.
  He was a silent man and not fond of talking, and, after her passionate outburst,
  Nicolette, too, had lapsed into silence. She still crouched beside her father&rsquo;s
  chair, squatting on her heels, and gazing into the fire. Deydier stroked
  her soft brown hair with a tender hand. He loved the child more than anything
  in the whole world. To her happiness he would have sacrificed everything
  including his life, but in his own mind he was absolutely convinced that
  Bertrand de Ventadour had only sought her for her money, and that nothing
  but sorrow would come of this unequal marriage&mdash;if the marriage was
  allowed to take place, which, please God, it never would whilst he, Deydier,
  was alive.... But as he himself was a man whose mind worked with great deliberation,
  he thought that time and quietude would act more potently than words on Nicolette&rsquo;s
  present mood. He was quite sure that at any rate nothing would be gained
  at this moment by further talk. She was too overwrought, too recently under
  the influence of Bertrand to listen to reason now. Time would show. Time
  would tell. Time and Nicolette&rsquo;s own sound sense and pride. So Deydier
  sat on in his arm-chair, and said nothing, and presently he asked his girl
  to get him his pipe, which she did. She lighted it for him, and as she stood
  there so close to him with the lighted tinder in her hand, he saw that her
  eyes were dry, and that the glow had died out of her cheeks. He pulled at
  his pipe in a moody, abstracted way, and fell to meditating&mdash;as he so
  often did&mdash;on the past. There was a tragedy in his life connected with
  those Ventadours. He had never spoken of it to any one since the day of his
  marriage, not even to old Marga&iuml;, who knew all about it, and he had
  sworn to himself at one time that he would never tell Nicolette.</p>
  <p>But now&mdash;</p>
  <p>So deeply had he sunk in meditation that he did not notice that Nicolette
  presently went out of the room.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Marga&iuml; brought in the lamp an hour later.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not want to disturb you,&rdquo; she said as she set it on the
  table, &ldquo;but it is getting late now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she went on after awhile, seeing that Deydier made no
  comment, that his pipe had gone out, and that he was staring moodily into
  the fire. Even now he gave her no reply, although she rattled the silver
  on the sideboard so as to attract his attention. Finally, she knelt down
  in front of the hearth and made a terrific clatter with the fire-irons. Even
  then, Jaume Deydier only said: &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has the child told you anything?&rdquo; Marga&iuml; went on tartly.
  She had never been kept out of family councils before and had spent the last
  hour in anticipation of being called into the parlour.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Why, what should she tell me?&rdquo; Deydier retorted with
  exasperating slowness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tiens!</i> that she is in love with Bertrand de Ventadour, and
  wants to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deydier gave a startled jump as if a pistol shot had rung in his ear, and
  his pipe fell with a clatter to the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette in love with Bertrand,&rdquo; he cried with well-feigned
  astonishment. &ldquo;Whoever told thee such nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; the old woman replied dryly. &ldquo;I guessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Deydier relapsed into moody silence, she added irritably:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it, Mossou Deydier. The child told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; he replied gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That never while I live would she marry a de Ventadour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; was the only comment made on this by Marga&iuml;. And
  after awhile she added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where is the child now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; Deydier replied, &ldquo;that she was in the kitchen
  with thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not seen her these two hours past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is not in her room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, maybe, she is in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe. It is a fine night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There the matter dropped for the moment. It was not an unusual thing for
  Nicolette to run out into the garden at all hours of the day or evening,
  and to stay out late, and Deydier was not surprised that the child should
  have wished to be let in peace for awhile. Marga&iuml; went back to her kitchen
  to see about supper, and Deydier lighted a second pipe: a very unusual thing
  for him to do. At seven o&rsquo;clock Marga&iuml; put her head in through
  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The child is not in yet,&rdquo; she said laconically, &ldquo;and
  she is not in the garden. I have been round to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst call for her, Marga&iuml;?&rdquo; Deydier asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I called once or twice. Then I stood at the gate thinking I
  would see her go up the road. She should be in by now. It has started to
  rain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deydier jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Raining,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and the child out at this hour?
  Why didst not come sooner, Marga&iuml;, and tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is often out later than this,&rdquo; was Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s
  reply. &ldquo;But she usually comes in when it rains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Did she take a cloak with her when she went?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has her shawl. Maybe,&rdquo; the old woman added after a slight
  pause, &ldquo;she went to meet him somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this suggestion Deydier made no reply, but it seemed to Marga&iuml; that
  he muttered an oath between his teeth, which was a very unusual thing for
  Mossou Jaume to do. Without saying another word, however, he stalked out
  of the parlour, and presently Marga&iuml; heard his heavy footstep crossing
  the corridor and the vestibule, then the opening and the closing of the front
  door.</p>
  <p>She shook her head dolefully while she began to lay the cloth for supper.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier had thrown his coat across his shoulders, thrust his cap on
  his head and picked up a stout stick and a storm lanthorn, then he went down
  into the valley. It was raining now, a cold, unpleasant rain mixed with snow,
  and the <i>tramontane</i> blew mercilessly from way over Vaucluse. Deydier
  muttered a real oath this time, and turned up the road in the direction of
  the ch&acirc;teau. It was very dark and the rain beat all around his shoulders:
  but when he thought of Bertrand de Ventadour, he gripped his stick more tightly,
  and he ceased to be conscious of the wet or the cold.</p>
  <p>He had reached the sharp bend in the road where the stony bridle-path, springing
  at a right angle, led up to the gates of the ch&acirc;teau, and he was on
  the point of turning up the path when he heard his name called close behind
  him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Mossou Deydier! Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned and found himself face to face with P&eacute;rone, old Madame&rsquo;s
  confidential maid&mdash;a person whom he could not abide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going up to the ch&acirc;teau, Mossou Deydier?&rdquo; the
  woman went on with an ugly note of obsequiousness in her harsh voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Deydier replied curtly, and would have gone on, on his
  way, but P&eacute;rone suddenly took hold of him by the coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mossou Deydier,&rdquo; she said pitiably, &ldquo;it would be only
  kind to a poor old woman, if you would let her walk with you. It is so lonely
  and so dark. I have come all the way from Manosque. I waited there for awhile,
  thinking the rain would give over. It was quite fine when I left home directly
  after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Deydier let her talk on. He could not bear the woman, but he was man enough
  not to let her struggle on in the dark behind him, whilst he had his lanthorn
  to guide his own footsteps up the uneven road; and so they walked on side
  by side for a minute or two, until P&eacute;rone said suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope Mademoiselle Nicolette has reached home by now. I told her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You saw Mademoiselle Nicolette?&rdquo; Deydier broke in harshly, &ldquo;where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just above La Bastide, Mossou Deydier,&rdquo; the woman replied. &ldquo;You
  know where she and Mossou le Comte used to fish when they were children.
  It was raining hard already and I told her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Deydier was in no mood to listen further. Without any ceremony, or word
  of excuse, he turned on his heel and strode rapidly down the road, swinging
  his lanthorn and gripping his stick, leaving P&eacute;rone to go or come,
  or stand still as she pleased.</p>
  <p>Moodiness and wrath had suddenly given place to a sickening feeling of anxiety.
  The rain beat straight into his face as he turned his steps up the valley,
  keeping close to the river bank, but he did not feel either the wind or the
  rain: in the dim circle of light which the lanthorn threw before him he seemed
  to see his little Nicolette, grief-stricken, distraught, beside that pool
  that would murmur insidious, poisoned words, promises of peace and forgetfulness.
  And at sight of this spectral vision a cry like that of a wounded beast came
  from the father&rsquo;s overburdened heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not again, my God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;not again! I could
  not bear it! Faith in Thee would go, and I should blaspheme!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>He saw her just as he had pictured her, crouching against the large boulder
  that sheltered her somewhat against the wind and rain. Just above her head
  the heavy branches of an old carob tree swayed under the breath of the <i>tramontane</i>:
  at her feet the waters of the L&egrave;ze, widening at this point into a
  pool, lapped the edge of her skirt and of the shawl which had slipped from
  her shoulders.</p>
  <p>She was not entirely conscious, and the wet on her cheeks did not wholly
  come from the rain. Jaume Deydier was a big, strong man, he was also a silent
  one. After one exclamation of heart-broken grief and of horror, he had gathered
  his little girl in his arms, wrapped his own coat round her, and, holding
  on to the lanthorn at the same time, he set out for home.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Man To Man</b></h2>
  <p>Jaume Deydier did not say anything to Nicolette that evening. After he had
  deposited her on her bed and handed her over to Marga&iuml; he knew that
  the child would be well and safe. Sleep and Marga&iuml;&rsquo;s household
  remedies would help the child&rsquo;s robust constitution to put up a good
  fight.</p>
  <p>And Nicolette lay all the evening, and half the night, wide-eyed and silent
  between the sheets; quite quiescent and obedient whenever Marga&iuml; brought
  her something warm to drink. But she would not eat, and when early the next
  morning Marga&iuml; brought her some warm milk, she looked as if she had
  not slept. She had a little fever during the night, but by the morning this
  had gone, only her face looked white and pinched, and her eyes looked preternaturally
  large with great dark rings around them.</p>
  <p>Later on in the morning her father came and stood for a second or two silently
  beside her bed. Her eyes were closed when he came, but presently, as if drawn
  by the magnetism of his tender gaze, the heavy lids slowly opened, and she
  looked at him. She looked so pale and so small in the big bed, and there
  was such a look of sorrow around her drooping mouth, that Deydier&rsquo;s
  heart ached almost to the point of breaking, and great tears gathered in
  his eyes and rolled slowly down his rough cheeks.</p>
  <p>The child drew a long sigh of tenderness, almost of pity, and put out her
  arms. He gathered her to his breast, pillowing the dear head against his
  heart, while he could scarcely control the heavy sobs that shook his powerful
  shoulders, or stay the tears that wetted her curls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Nicolette!&rdquo; he murmured somewhat incoherently. &ldquo;My
  little Nicolette, thou&rsquo;lt not do it, my little girl, not that&mdash;not
  that&mdash;I could not bear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he laid her down again upon the pillows, and kissed away the tears
  upon her cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she murmured, and fondled his hand which she had captured, &ldquo;you
  must try and forgive me, I was stupid and thoughtless. I ought to have explained
  better. But I was unhappy, very unhappy. Then I don&rsquo;t know how it all
  happened&mdash;I did not look where I was going, I suppose&mdash;and I stumbled
  and fell&mdash;it was stupid of me,&rdquo; she reiterated with loving humility; &ldquo;but
  I forgot the time, the weather&mdash;everything&mdash;I was so unhappy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So unhappy that you forgot your poor old father,&rdquo; he said,
  trying to smile, &ldquo;whose only treasure you are in this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; she replied earnestly. &ldquo;I did not forget you.
  On the contrary, I thought and thought about you, and wondered how you could
  be so unkind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave a quick, weary sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t speak about that now, my child,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;all
  you have to do is to get well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am well, dear,&rdquo; she rejoined, and as he tried to withdraw
  his hand she grasped it closer and held it tightly against her bosom:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When Bertrand comes,&rdquo; she entreated, &ldquo;will you see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he only shook his head, whereupon she let go his hand and turned her
  face away. And he went dejectedly out of the room.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Bertrand came over to the mas in the early part of the forenoon. Vague hints
  dropped by P&eacute;rone had already alarmed him, and he spent a miserable
  evening and a sleepless night marvelling what had happened.</p>
  <p>As soon as he returned from the marvellous walk which had changed the whole
  course of his existence, he had told his mother and Micheline first, then
  grandmama, what had happened. Marcelle de Ventadour, who, during the past
  four and twenty hours had been in a state of prostration, due partly to sorrow
  and anxiety for her son, and partly to the reaction following on excitement,
  felt very much like one who has been at death&rsquo;s door and finds himself
  unaccountably alive again. She was fond of Nicolette in a gentle, unemotional
  way: she knew that Deydier was very rich and his daughter his sole heiress,
  and she had none of those violent caste prejudices which swayed old Madame&rsquo;s
  entire life; moreover, she had never been able to endure Rixende&rsquo;s
  petulant tempers and supercilious ways. All these facts conduced to make
  her contented, almost happy, in this new turn of events.</p>
  <p>Not so old Madame! Bertrand&rsquo;s news at first appeared to her unworthy
  of consideration: the boy, she argued, partly to herself, partly to him,
  had been inveigled at a moment when he was too weak and too wretched to defend
  himself, by a designing minx who had a coronet and a fine social position
  in her mind&rsquo;s eye. The matter was not worth talking about. It just
  would not be: that was all. When she found that not only did Bertrand mean
  to go through with this preposterous marriage, but that he defended Nicolette
  and sang her praises with passionate warmth, she fell from contempt into
  amazement and thence into wrath.</p>
  <p>It should not be! It was preposterous! Impossible! A Comte de Ventadour
  marry the descendant of a lacquey! the daughter of a peasant! It should not
  be! not whilst she was alive. Thank God, she still had a few influential
  friends in Paris, she would petition the King to forbid the marriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would not dare&mdash;&rdquo; Bertrand protested vehemently.</p>
  <p>But old Madame only laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dare?&rdquo; she said tartly. &ldquo;Of course I should dare. I have
  dared more than that before now, let me tell you, in order to save the honour
  of the Ventadours. That marriage can <i>not</i> be,&rdquo; she went on determinedly, &ldquo;and
  if you are too foolish or too blind to perceive the disgrace of such a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>,
  then I will apply to the King. And you know as well as I do that His Majesty
  has before now intervened on the side of the family when such questions have
  been on the tapis, and that no officer of the King&rsquo;s bodyguard may
  marry without the consent of his sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This Bertrand knew. That archaic law was one of those petty tyrannies in
  which the heart of a Bourbon delighted, and was one of the first in connection
  with his army that Louis XVIII replaced upon the statute book of his reconquered
  country.</p>
  <p>Bertrand tried to argue with old Madame, and sharp words flew between these
  two, who usually were so entirely at one in their thoughts and their ideals.
  But he felt that he had been like a drowning man, and the loving, gentle
  hand that had been held out to him at the hour of his greatest peril had
  become very dear. Perhaps it would be too much to say that Bertrand loved
  Nicolette now as passionately as he had loved Rixende in the past, or that
  the image of one woman had wholly obliterated that of the other: but he was
  immensely grateful to her, and whenever his memory dwelt on the thought of
  that sweet, trusting young body clinging to him, of those soft, delicate
  hands fondling his hair, of that crooning voice murmuring sweet words of
  love and surrender, he felt a warmth within his heart, a longing for Nicolette,
  different, yes! sweeter than anything he had experienced for Rixende.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When you find yourself face to face with the alternative of giving
  up your career or that peasant wench, you&rsquo;ll not hesitate, I presume;
  you, a Comte de Ventadour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These were old Madame&rsquo;s parting words, when, wearied with an argument
  that tended nowhere, Bertrand finally kissed her hand and bade her good night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; she added more gently, &ldquo;confess that you
  have been weak and foolish. You loved Rixende de Peyron-Bompar until a week
  ago. You cannot have fallen out of love and in again in so short a time.
  Have no fear, my dear Bertrand, an officer in the King&rsquo;s bodyguard,
  a young man as accomplished as yourself and with a name like yours, has never
  yet failed to make a brilliant marriage. There are as good fish in the sea
  as ever come out of it. A little patience, and I&rsquo;ll warrant that within
  three months you&rsquo;ll be thanking Heaven on your knees that Rixende de
  Peyron-Bompar was such a fool, for you will be leading to the altar a far
  richer heiress than she.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Bertrand now was too tired to say more. He just kissed his grandmother&rsquo;s
  hand, and with a sigh and a weary smile, said enigmatically:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he went out of the room.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Jaume Deydier met Bertrand de Ventadour on the threshold of the mas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enter, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>Bertrand followed him into the parlour, and took the chair that Deydier
  offered him beside the hearth. He inquired anxiously after Nicolette, and
  the old man told him briefly all that had happened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it were best, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; he concluded abruptly, &ldquo;if
  you went back to Paris after this. It is not fair to the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not fair to Nicolette!&rdquo; Bertrand exclaimed. &ldquo;Then she
  has told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, she told me,&rdquo; he rejoined coldly, &ldquo;that you and
  your family have thought of a way of paying your debts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An angry flush rose to Bertrand&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;Monsieur Deydier!&rdquo; he
  protested, and jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh! what?&rdquo; the father retorted loudly. &ldquo;What else had
  you in mind, when, fresh from the smart which one woman dealt you, you sought
  another whose wealth would satisfy the creditors who were snapping like dogs
  at your heels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear that this is false! I love Nicolette&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! you loved Rixende a week ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love Nicolette,&rdquo; he reiterated firmly, &ldquo;and she loves
  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette is a child who has mistaken pity for love, as many wenches
  do. You were her friend, her playmate; she saw you floundering in a morass
  of debt and disgrace, and instinctively she put out her hand to save you.
  She will get over that love. I&rsquo;ll see to it that she forgets you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will be able to do that, Monsieur Deydier,&rdquo; Bertrand
  put in more quietly. &ldquo;Nicolette is as true as steel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity you did not find that out sooner, before you ran after that
  vixen who has thrown you over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better men than I have gone blindly past their happiness. Not many
  have had the luck to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too late, M. le Comte,&rdquo; Deydier riposted coldly. &ldquo;I told
  Nicolette yesterday that never, with my consent, will she be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will kill her, Monsieur Deydier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Not I. She is proud and soon she will understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We love one another, Nicolette will understand nothing save that
  I love her. You may forbid the marriage,&rdquo; Bertrand went on vehemently, &ldquo;but
  you cannot forbid Nicolette to love me. We love one another; we&rsquo;ll
  belong to one another, whatever you may do or say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever Madame, your grandmother, may say?&rdquo; retorted Deydier
  with a sneer. Then as Bertrand made no reply to that taunt, he added more
  kindly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, my dear Bertrand, look on the affair as a man. I have known
  you ever since you were in your cradle: would I speak to you like this if
  I had not the happiness of my child to defend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand drew a quick, impatient sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is where you are wrong, Monsieur Deydier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Nicolette&rsquo;s
  happiness is bound up in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As your mother&rsquo;s was bound up in your father, what?&rdquo; Deydier
  retorted hotly. &ldquo;She too was a loving, trusting girl once: she too
  was rich; and when her fortune was sunk into the bottomless morass of family
  debts, your father went out of the world leaving her to starve or not according
  as her friends were generous or her creditors rapacious. Look at her now,
  M. le Comte, and tell me if any father could find it in his heart to see
  his child go the way of the Comtesse Marcelle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are hard, Monsieur Deydier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would find me harder still if you brought Nicolette to unhappiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You never thought of her until your creditors were at your heels
  and you saw no other way before you to satisfy them, save a rich marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;False is it?&rdquo; Deydier riposted roughly, &ldquo;How else do
  you hope to satisfy your creditors, M. le Comte de Ventadour? If you married
  Nicolette without a dowry how would you satisfy them? How would you live?
  how would you support your wife and your coming family?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These may be sordid questions, ugly to face beside the fine sounding
  assertions and protestations of selfless love. But I am not an aristocrat.
  I am a peasant and speak as I think. And I ask you this one more question,
  M. le Comte: in exchange for all the love, the security, the wealth, which
  a marriage with my daughter would bring you, what have <i>you</i> to offer
  her? An ancient name? It is tarnished. A ch&acirc;teau? &rsquo;Tis in ruins.
  Position? &rsquo;Tis one of shame. Nay! M. le Comte go and offer these treasures
  elsewhere. My daughter is too good for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are both cruel and hard, Monsieur Deydier,&rdquo; Bertrand protested,
  with a cry of indignation that came straight from the heart. &ldquo;On my
  honour the thought of Nicolette&rsquo;s fortune never once entered my mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this Deydier made no reply. A look of determination, stronger even than
  before, made his face look hard and almost repellent. He pressed his lips
  tightly together, his eyes narrowed till they appeared like mere slits beneath
  his bushy brows; he buried his hands in the pockets of his breeches and paced
  up and down the room, seeming with each step to strengthen his resolve. Then
  he came to a sudden halt in front of Bertrand, the hardness partly vanished
  from his face, and he placed a hand, the touch of which was not altogether
  unkind, on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose, my dear Bertrand,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;suppose
  I were to take you at your word. On your honour you have assured me that
  Nicolette&rsquo;s fortune never once entered your head. Very well! Go back
  now and tell Madame your grandmother that you love my daughter, that your
  life&rsquo;s happiness is bound up in hers and hers in yours, but that I
  am not in a position to give her a dowry. I am reputed rich, but I have no
  capital to dispose of and I have certain engagements which I must fulfil
  before I can afford the luxury of paying your debts. I may give Nicolette
  a few hundred louis a year, pin money, but that is all. One moment, I pray
  you,&rdquo; Deydier added, seeing that hot words of protest had already
  risen to Bertrand&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;I am not giving you a supposition.
  I am telling you a fact. If you love Nicolette sufficiently to lead a life
  of usefulness and simplicity with her, here in her old home, you shall have
  her. Let old Madame come and ask me for my daughter&rsquo;s hand, on your
  behalf, you shall have her: but my money, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a long while after that there was silence between the two men. Jaume
  Deydier had once more resumed his fateful pacing up and down the room. There
  was a grim, set smile upon his face, but every time his eyes rested on Bertrand,
  a sullen fire seemed to blaze within them.</p>
  <p>A pall of despair had descended once more on Bertrand, all the darker, all
  the more suffocating for the brief ray of hope that lightened it yesterday.
  In his heart, he knew that the old man was right. When he had set out this
  morning to speak with Deydier, he had done so under the firm belief that
  Nicolette&rsquo;s fortune expressed in so many words by her father would
  soon dispel grandmama&rsquo;s objection to her lowly birth. He hoped that
  he would return from that interview bringing with him such dazzling financial
  prospects that old Madame herself would urge and approve of the marriage.
  Like all those who are very young, he was so convinced of the justice and
  importance of his cause, that it never entered his mind that his advocacy
  of it would result in failure.</p>
  <p>Failure and humiliation!</p>
  <p>He, a Comte de Ventadour, had asked for the hand of a peasant wench and
  it had been refused. Only now did he realise quite how low his family had
  sunk, that in the eyes of this descendant of lacqueys, his name was worth
  less than nothing.</p>
  <p>Failure, humiliation and sorrow! Sorrow because the briefest searching of
  his heart had at once revealed the fact that he was <i>not</i> prepared to
  take Nicolette without her fortune, that he was certainly <i>not</i> prepared
  to give up his career in order to live the life of usefulness at the mas,
  which Jaume Deydier dangled before him. Oh! he had no illusion on these points.
  Yesterday when old Madame threatened him with an appeal to the King, there
  was still the hope that in view of such hopeless financial difficulties as
  beset him, His Majesty might consent to a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i> with
  the wealthy daughter of a worthy manufacturer of Provence. But what Deydier
  demanded to-day meant that he would have to resign his commission and become
  an unpaid overseer on a farm, that he would have to renounce his career,
  his friends, every prospect of ever rising again to the position which his
  family had once occupied.</p>
  <p>Poor little Nicolette! He loved her, yes! but not enough for that. To renounce
  anything for her sake had not formed a part of his affection. And love without
  sacrifice&mdash;what is it but the pale, sickly ghost of the exacting Master
  of us all?</p>
  <p>Poor little Nicolette! he sighed, and right through the silence of the dull
  winter&rsquo;s morning there came, faintly echoing, another sigh which was
  just like a sob.</p>
  <p>Both the men swung round simultaneously and gazed upon the doorway. Nicolette
  stood there under the lintel. Unable to lie still in bed, while her life&rsquo;s
  happiness was held in the balance, she had dressed herself and softly crept
  downstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette!&rdquo; Bertrand exclaimed. And at sight of her all the
  tenderness of past years, the ideal love of Paul for Virginie surged up in
  his heart like a great wave of warmth and of pity. &ldquo;When did you come
  down?&rdquo; She came forward into the room, treading softly like a little
  mouse, her face pale and her lips slightly quivering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A moment or two ago,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you heard&mdash;&rdquo; he asked involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I heard your silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand raised his two hands and hid his face in them. Never in his life
  had he felt so ashamed. Deydier went to his daughter&rsquo;s side: he wanted
  to take her in his arms, to comfort her for this humiliation, which he had
  been the means of putting upon her, but she turned away from her father and
  came near to Bertrand. She seized both his wrists with her tiny hands, and
  dragged them away from his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at me, Bertrand,&rdquo; she said gently. And when his eyes,
  shamed and passionately imploring met hers, she went on quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Bertrand, when yesterday, on our dear island, I confessed
  to you that I had loved you&mdash;all my life&mdash;I did it without any
  thought, any hope that you loved me in return&mdash;You could not love me
  yet&mdash;I myself should despise you if you could so easily forget one love
  for another&mdash;but I did it with the firm belief that in time you would
  learn to love me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette!&rdquo; Bertrand cried, and her sweetsounding name was
  choked in a sob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, my dear,&rdquo; she continued firmly. &ldquo;Nothing that
  has passed between my father and you can alter that belief&mdash;I love you
  and I shall love you all my life&mdash;I know that it is foolish to suppose
  that your family would come here and humbly beg me to be your wife&mdash;it
  would also be mad folly to ask you to give up your career in order to bury
  yourself here out of the world with me. That is not my idea of love: that
  was not in my thoughts yesterday when I confessed my love to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time it was her father who protested, but she paid no heed to him.
  She was standing beside Bertrand and she was pleading for her love.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Nay, father dear,&rdquo; she said resolutely, &ldquo;you have
  had your say. Now you must let me have mine. Listen, Tan-tan, what I confessed
  to you yesterday, that I still confess now. I have loved you always. I love
  you still. If you will take me now from whatever motive, I am content, for
  I know that in time you will love me too. Until then I can wait. But if father
  makes it impossible for you to take me, then we will part, but without bitterness,
  for I shall understand. And father will understand, too, that without you,
  I cannot live. I have lain against your breast, my dear, your lips have clung
  to mine; if they tear me away from you, they will tear my heart out of my
  body now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At one time while she spoke her voice had broken, but in the end it was
  quite steady, only the tears ran steadily down her cheeks. Bertrand looked
  at her with a sort of hungry longing. He could not speak. Any word would
  have choked him. What he felt was intense humiliation, and, towards her,
  worship. When she had finished and still stood there before him, with hands
  clasped and the great tears rolling down her cheeks, he sank slowly on his
  knees. He seized both her little hands and pressed them against his aching
  forehead, his eyes, his lips: then with a passionate sob that he tried vainly
  to suppress, he went quickly out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Father And Daughter</b></h2>
  <p>For a few seconds after Bertrand had gone, Nicolette remained standing where
  she was, quite still, dry-eyed now, and with lips set; she seemed for the
  moment not to have realised that he was no longer there. Then presently,
  when his footsteps ceased to resound through the house, when the front door
  fell to with a bang, and the gate gave a creak as it turned on its hinges,
  she seemed to return to consciousness, the consciousness of absolute silence.
  Not a sound now broke the stillness of the house. Jaume Deydier had sunk
  into a chair and was staring unseeing, into the fire; Marga&iuml; and the
  serving wenches were far away in the kitchen. Only the old clock ticked on
  with dreary monotony, and the flame from the hard olive wood burned with
  a dull sound like a long-drawn-out sigh.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly Nicolette turned and ran towards the door. But her father
  was too quick for her: he jumped to his feet and stood between her and the
  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Nicolette?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that to you?&rdquo; she retorted defiantly.</p>
  <p>Just like some dumb animal that has received a death blow Deydier uttered
  a hoarse cry; he staggered up against the door, and had to cling to it as
  if he were about to fall. For a second or two he stared at her almost doubting
  his own sanity. This then was his little Nicolette, the baby girl who had
  lain in his arms, whose first toddling steps he had guided, for whom he had
  lain awake o&rsquo; nights, schemed, worked, lived? The motherless child
  who had never missed a mother because he had been everything to her, had
  done twice as much for her as any mother could have done? This, his little
  Nicolette who stabbed at his heart with that sublime selfishness of love
  that rides rough-shod over every obstacle, every affection, every duty, and
  in order to gain its own heaven, hurls every other fond heart into hell?</p>
  <p>Deydier was no longer a young man. He had married late in life, and strenuous
  work had hastened one or two of the unpleasant symptoms of old age. The last
  two days had brought with them such a surfeit of emotions, such agonising
  sensations, that this final sorrow seemed beyond his physical powers of endurance.
  Clinging to the door, he felt himself turning giddy and faint; once or twice
  he drew his arm across and across his forehead on which stood beads of cold
  perspiration. Then a shadow passed before his eyes, the walls of the room
  appeared to be closing in around him, hemming him in. Everything became dark,
  black as night; he put out his arms, and the next moment would have measured
  his length on the floor. It all occurred in less than two seconds. At his
  first cry all the obstinacy, the defiance in Nicolette&rsquo;s heart, melted
  in face of her father&rsquo;s grief&mdash;her father whom she loved better
  than anything in the world. When he staggered forward she caught him. She
  was as strong as a young sapling, and fear and love gave her additional strength.
  A chair was close by, she was able to drag him into it, to prop him up against
  the cushions, to fondle him until she saw his dear eyes open, and fasten
  themselves hungrily upon her. She would then have broken down completely,
  great sobs were choking her, but she would not cry, not now when he was ill
  and weak, and it was her privilege to minister to him. She found a glass
  and a bottle of old cognac, and made him swallow that.</p>
  <p>But when he had drunk the cognac, and had obviously recovered, when he drew
  her forcibly on his knee crying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My little Nicolette, my dear, dear little Nicolette,&rdquo; and pressed
  her head against his breast, till she could hardly breathe, when she felt
  hot, heavy tears falling against her forehead, then she could not hold back
  those sobs any longer, and just lay on his breast, crying, crying, while
  he soothed her with his big, fond hand, murmuring with infinite tenderness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, there, my little Nicolette! Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
  cry&mdash;I ought to have told you before. You were a grown girl, and I did
  not realise it&mdash;or I should have told you before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Told me what, father?&rdquo; she contrived to whisper through her
  sobs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would have understood,&rdquo; he went on gently. &ldquo;It was
  wrong of me to think that you would just obey your old father, without understanding.
  Love is a giant,&rdquo; he added with a sigh, &ldquo;he cannot be coerced,
  I ought to have known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment, and stared out straight before him. Nicolette slid out
  of his arms on to the floor; her hand was resting on his knee, and she laid
  her cheek against it. He drew a deep breath, and then went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your mother was just like you, my dear, I loved her with as great
  a love as man ever gave to a woman. But she did not care for me&mdash;not
  then.&mdash;Did she ever care, I wonder&mdash;God alone knows that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sighed again, and Nicolette not daring to speak, feeling that she stood
  upon the threshold of a secret orchard, that time and death had rendered
  sacred, waited in silence until he should continue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just like you, my dear,&rdquo; Deydier resumed slowly after awhile, &ldquo;she
  had given her heart to one of those Ventadours. Ah! I don&rsquo;t say that
  he was unworthy. God forbid! Like young Bertrand he was handsome and gallant,
  full I dare say of enthusiasm and idealism. And she&mdash;! Ah, my
  dear, if you had only known her! She was like a flower! like an exquisite,
  delicate snowdrop, with hair fairer than yours, and large grey eyes that
  conquered a man&rsquo;s heart with one look. All the lads of our country-side
  were in love with her. Margaridette was her name, but they all called her
  Ridette; as for me I was already a middle-aged man when that precious bud
  opened into a perfect blossom. I was rich, and I worshipped her, but I had
  nothing else to offer. She used to smile when I spoke to her of my love,
  and softly murmur, sighing: &lsquo;Poor Jaume.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But somehow I never gave up hope, I felt that love, as strong as
  mine, must conquer in the end. How this would come about I had not troubled
  to think, I was not likely to become younger or handsomer as time went on,
  was I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more he paused; memories were crowding around him fast. His eyes stared
  into the smouldering embers of the hearth, seeing visions of past things
  that had long ceased to be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then one evening, my dear, something was revealed to me. Shall I
  ever forget that night, soft as a dream, warm as a downy bed; and spring
  was in the air&mdash;spring that sent the blood coursing through one&rsquo;s
  veins, and beating against one&rsquo;s temples with a delicious sense of
  longing and of languor. It was Candlemas, and I had been to church at Pertuis
  where Monseigneur the Bishop of Aix had celebrated Mass. I remember I had
  walked over with Marga&iuml; because she had never seen a real bishop celebrating.
  We had some beautiful tall green candles which I had bought in Marseilles,
  they were nearly two metres high, and very thick, and of course these were
  blessed by Monseigneur. The air was so marvellously still, and we both walked
  so carefully with our candles, that their lights never went out the whole
  of the way back from Pertuis. Your grandmother was alive then, and my cousin
  Violante was staying at the mas with her two children, so when Marga&iuml; and
  I arrived home with our beautiful green candles alight, my mother started
  the round of the house with them, and we all after her, Violante, the children,
  Marga&iuml; and the servants, and she marked every door and every window
  of the mas with a cross, as is traditional in our beautiful country, so as
  to preserve us all against God&rsquo;s thunder and lightning. And still the
  candles were burning; neither the draught nor the rush up and down the stairs
  had blown out the lights. And they were so tall and thick, that I stuck them
  up on spikes which I had got ready for the purpose, and they went on burning
  all through dinner and the whole of the long afternoon. And Marga&iuml; would
  have it that candles blessed by a bishop were more potent as harbingers of
  good fortune than those on which only the hand of a <i>cur&eacute;</i> had
  lain. So when the sun had gone down, and the air was full of the scent of
  spring, of young earth, and growing grass and budding flowers, I took one
  of the candles and went down into the valley. I wanted to give it to Margaridette
  so that all the blessings of God of which that burning candle was the symbol,
  should descend upon her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went down into the valley, and walked on the shores of the L&egrave;ze.
  The candle burned clear and bright, the flame hardly flickered for the air
  was so still. Then suddenly I spied, coming towards me, two young forms that
  seemed as one, so closely did they cling to one another. Young Raymond de
  Ventadour, it was, and he had his arm around your dear mother&rsquo;s waist,
  and her pretty head rested against his shoulder. They did not see me, for
  they were so completely absorbed in one another; and I remained quite still,
  crouching behind a carob tree, lest I should disturb them in their happiness.
  But when they had gone by I saw that a breath of wind, or perhaps the lips
  of an angel, had blown my candle out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, after that,&rdquo; Deydier went on in a firmer and
  more even voice, &ldquo;I was convinced in my mind that all was well with
  Margaridette. True, Raymond de Ventadour belonged to an ancient and aristocratic
  race, but the Revolution was recent then, and we all held on to those ideals
  of equality and fraternity for which we had suffered so terribly. Margaridette&rsquo;s
  father had been a ship-builder in Marseilles; he had retired at the outbreak
  of the Revolution and bought a house and a little piece of land on the other
  side of La Bastide. We all looked upon him as something of an &ldquo;<i>aristo</i>,&rdquo; and
  to me it seemed the most natural thing in the world that the two young people,
  being in love with one another, should eventually get married, especially
  as Raymond de Ventadour was a younger son. But though I was a middle-aged
  man, turned forty then, I had it seems not sufficient experience of life
  to realise to what depths of infamy man or woman can sink, when their ruling
  passion is at stake. I had not yet learned to know Madame la Comtesse Margarita
  de Ventadour, the Italian mother of Bertrand&rsquo;s father, and of young
  Raymond.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know her, my dear, but have you eyes sharp enough to probe the
  abyss of cruelty that lies in that woman&rsquo;s soul? Her arrogance, her
  pride of race, her worship of grandeur have made her a fiend&mdash;no longer
  human&mdash;just a monster of falsehood and of malice. Well do I remember
  the day when first the news reached my ears that young M. Raymond was affianced
  to Mademoiselle Marcelle de Cercamons. There,&rdquo; he added quickly, and
  for the first time turning his gaze on the girl kneeling at his feet, &ldquo;your
  dear hand is trembling on mine. You have begun to guess something of the
  awful tragedy which wrecked two young lives at the bidding of that cruel
  vixen. Yes, that was the news that was all over the villages that summer.
  M. Raymond was marrying Mademoiselle Marcelle de Cercamons. He was fighting
  under General Moreau in Germany, but he was coming home early in the autumn
  to get married. There was no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind about it, as the
  news was originally brought by P&eacute;rone, Mme. la Comtesse&rsquo;s own
  confidential maid. She spoke&mdash;to Marga&iuml; amongst others&mdash;about
  the preparations for the wedding, the beauty of Marcelle de Cercamons, the
  love M. Raymond had for his beautiful fianc&eacute;e. The lady was passing
  rich, and the wedding would take place at her ancestral home in Normandy;
  all this that spawn of Satan, the woman P&eacute;rone, told everyone with
  a wealth of detail that deceived us all. Then one day she descended like
  a hideous black crow on Margaridette with a letter purporting to be from
  M. Raymond, in which he demanded that the poor child should return him the
  ring that he had given her in token of his faith. The next day the Comtesse
  left the ch&acirc;teau, accompanied by P&eacute;rone. She was going to Normandy
  for the wedding of her son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was all false?&rdquo; Nicolette murmured under her breath, awed
  by this tale of a tragedy that she felt was also the story of her destiny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All false, my dear,&rdquo; Deydier replied, and the fire of a fierce
  resentment glowed in his deep-set eyes. &ldquo;It was M. le Comte de Ventadour,
  Madame&rsquo;s eldest son, who was marrying Mademoiselle de Cercamons. He,
  too, was away. He was in Paris, leading the life of dissipation which one
  has learned to associate with his family. M. Raymond was in Germany fighting
  under Moreau, and writing letters full of glowing ardour to his beloved.
  But mark the fulness of that woman&rsquo;s infamy. Before her son left for
  the war, he had confessed to his mother his love for Margaridette, and the
  Comtesse, whose cruelty is only equalled by her cunning, appeared to acquiesce
  in this idyll, nay! to bestow on it her motherly blessing. And do you know
  why she did that, my dear? So as to gain the two young people&rsquo;s confidence
  and cause them to send all their letters to one another through her hands.
  How should a boy mistrust his own mother? especially after she has blessed
  him and his love; and Raymond was little more than a boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Comtesse withheld all his letters from Margaridette, and
  all Margaridette&rsquo;s letters from him. After awhile, Margaridette thought
  herself forgotten, and when the news came that her lover had been false to
  her, and was about to wed another, how could she help but believe it?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From such depths of falsehood to the mere forging of a letter and
  a signature asking for the return of the ring, was but a step in this path
  of iniquity. Poor Margaridette fell into the execrable trap laid for her
  by those cunning hands, she fell into it like a bird, and in it received
  her death wound. It was the day of the wedding at Cercamons in Normandy&mdash;P&eacute;rone,
  you see, had not spared us a single detail&mdash;and I, vaguely agitated,
  vaguely terrified of something I could not define, could not rest at home.
  All morning, all afternoon, I tried to kill that agitation by hard work,
  but the evening came and my very blood was on fire. I felt stifled in the
  house. My mother, I could see, was anxious about me; her kind eyes fell sadly
  on me from time to time, while she sat knitting in this very chair by the
  hearth. It was late autumn, and the day had been grey and mild, but for some
  hours past heavy clouds had gathered over Luberon and spread themselves above
  the valley. Toward eight o&rsquo;clock the rain came down; soon it turned
  into a downpour. The water beat against the shutters, the cypress trees by
  the gate bowed and sighed under the wind. Presently I noticed that my mother
  had, as was her wont, fallen asleep over her knitting. I seized the opportunity
  and stole out of the room, and out of the house. Something seemed to be driving
  me along, just as it did last night, my dear, when I found that you had gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His rough hand closed on Nicolette&rsquo;s, and he lifted her back upon
  his knees, and put his arms round her with an almost savage gesture of possession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went down into the valley,&rdquo; he went on sombrely, &ldquo;and
  along the river bank. The rain beat into my face, and all around me the olive
  and the carob trees were moaning and groaning under the lash of the wind.
  I had a storm lanthorn with me&mdash;for in truth I do believe that God Himself
  sent me out into the valley that night&mdash;and this, I swung before me
  as I walked through the darkness and the gale. Something drew me on. Something!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And there, where the mountain stream widens into a shallow
  pool, and where a great carob tree overshadows the waters, I saw Margaridette
  crouching beside a boulder, just as I saw you, my little girl, last night.
  Her hair was wet like yours was, her shawl had slipped from her shoulders
  and was soaked in the stream; her dear arms were thrown over the wet stone,
  and her face was buried in her hands. I gathered her up in my arms. I wrapped
  my coat around her shoulders, and I carried her to the mas, just as I carried
  you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He said no more, and with his arms still held tightly around his child,
  he once more stared into the fire. And Nicolette lay in his arms, quite still,
  quite still. Presently he spoke again, but she scarcely heard him now: only
  a few phrases spoken with more passionate intensity than the rest reached
  her dulled senses: &ldquo;She acquiesced&mdash;just like a child who was
  too sick to argue&mdash;her father urged it because he thought that Margaridette&rsquo;s
  name had been unpleasantly coupled with that of M. Raymond&mdash;and then
  he liked me, and I was rich&mdash;and so we were married&mdash;and I loved
  my Margaridette so ardently that in time, I think, she cared for me a little,
  too&mdash;Then you were born, my Nicolette&mdash;and she died&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Nicolette felt as if her very soul were numb within her; her heart
  felt as if it were dead.</p>
  <p>So then this was the end? Oh! she no longer had any illusions, no longer
  any hope. What could she do in face of THIS? Her father&rsquo;s grief! that
  awful tragedy which he had recalled had as effectually killed every hope
  as not even death could have done.</p>
  <p>This, then, was the end? Tan-tan would in very truth go out of her life
  after this. She could never see him again. Never. She could never hope to
  make him understand how utterly, utterly impossible it would be for her to
  deal her father another blow. It would be a death blow! And dealt by her?
  No, it could not, could not be. Vaguely she asked&mdash;thinking of Bertrand&mdash;what
  ultimately became of Raymond de Ventadour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He came back from the wars,&rdquo; Deydier explained, &ldquo;three
  months after I had laid your mother in her grave. We, in the meanwhile, had
  heard of the cruel deceit practised upon her by old Madame, we had seen M.
  le Comte de Ventadour bring home his bride: and it is the fondest tribute
  that I can offer to my Margaridette&rsquo;s undying memory, that never once
  did she make me feel that I had won her through that woman&rsquo;s infamous
  trick. Raymond de Ventadour had naturally been led to believe that Margaridette
  had been false to him: when he came home his first visit was to me. I think
  he meant to kill me. Never have I seen a man in such a passion of despair.
  But, standing in the room where she died and where you were born, I told
  him the whole truth just as I knew it: and I don&rsquo;t know which of us
  two suffered the most at that hour: he or I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo; Nicolette murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He went away. Some said that he fought in Egypt, and there was killed
  in action. But no one ever knew: not even his mother. All we did know was
  that Raymond de Ventadour never came back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He never came back!</p>
  <p>And Nicolette, lying in her father&rsquo;s arms, took to envying her mother
  who rested so peacefully in the little churchyard way up at La Bastide. As
  for her, even her life was not her own. It belonged to this grief-stricken
  man who held her so closely in his arms that she knew she could never go.
  It belonged to him, and would have to go on, and on, in dreary, or cheerful
  monotony, while the snows on Luberon melted year after year, and, year after
  year, the wild thyme and rosemary came into bloom, and the flowers on the
  orange trees blossomed and withered again.</p>
  <p>Year after year!</p>
  <p>And Bertrand would never come back!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Old Madame</b></h2>
  <p>When old Madame heard from Bertrand that he had asked Nicolette Deydier
  to be his wife, and that Jaume had rejected his suit with contempt, she was
  hotly indignant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The insolence of that rabble passes belief!&rdquo; she said, and
  refused even to discuss the subject with Bertrand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not suppose, I imagine,&rdquo; she went on haughtily, &ldquo;that
  I should go curtsying to that lout and humbly beg for his wench&rsquo;s hand
  in marriage for my grandson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But her pride, though it had received many a blow these last few days, was
  not altogether laid in the dust. It was not even humbled. To the Comtesse
  Marcelle she said with the utmost confidence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were always a coward and a fool, my dear: and imbued with the
  Christian spirit of holding out your left cheek when your right one had been
  smitten. But you surely know me well enough to understand that I am not going
  to do the same in our present difficulty. Fate has dealt us an unpleasant
  blow, I admit, through the hand of that vixen, my sister Sybille. You notice
  that I have refrained from having Masses said for the repose of her soul,
  and if the <i>bon Dieu</i> thinks as I do on the subject, Sybille is having
  a very uncomfortable time in Purgatory just now. Be that as it may, her spirit
  shall not have the satisfaction of seeing how hard her body could hit, and
  in a very few days&mdash;two weeks at most&mdash;you will see how little
  I have bent to adverse fate, and how quickly I have turned the tide of our
  misfortune into one of prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She would say no more just then, only hinted vaguely at Court influence,
  which she was neither too old nor too poor to wield. The difficulty was to
  extract a promise from Bertrand not to do anything rash, until certain letters
  which she expected from Paris should arrive. Bertrand, indeed, was in such
  a state of misery that he felt very like a wounded animal that only desires
  to hide itself away in some hole and corner, there to bleed to death in peace.
  When Jaume Deydier had delivered his inflexible ultimatum to him, and he
  had realised that the exquisite Paradise which Nicolette&rsquo;s love and
  self-sacrifice had revealed was indeed closed against him for ever, something
  in him had seemed to snap: it was his pride, his joy in life, his self-confidence.
  He had felt so poor, beside her, so poor in spirit, in love, in selflessness,
  that humiliation had descended on him like a pall, which had in it something
  of the embrace, the inevitable embrace of death.</p>
  <p>He had gone home like a sleepwalker, and had felt like a sleepwalker ever
  since: neither his sister&rsquo;s sympathy, nor old Madame&rsquo;s taunts
  and arrogance affected him in the least. The cords of life were so attenuated
  that he felt they would snap at any moment. This was his only consolation:
  a broken spirit, which might lead to the breaking of the cords of life. Without
  Nicolette what was life worth now?</p>
  <p>Love had come, but it had come too late. Too late he had come to understand
  that whilst he gazed, intoxicated and dazzled, upon a showy, artificial flower,
  an exquisite and fragrant bud had bloomed all the while close to his hand.
  Like so many young creatures on this earth, he believed that God had especially
  created him for love and happiness, that the Almighty Hand had for the time
  being so ordained the world and society that love and happiness would inevitably
  fall to his lot. Nevertheless, when those two priceless blessings were actually
  within his reach, he had thoughtlessly and wantonly turned away from them
  and rushed after a mirage which had proved as cruel as it was elusive.</p>
  <p>And now it was too late!</p>
  <p>Like a wanderer on the face of the earth, he would henceforth be for ever
  seeking that which he had lost.</p>
  <p>Only one thing held him now: held him to his home in old Provence, to the
  old owl&rsquo;s nest and the ruined walls of his ancestral ch&acirc;teau:
  that was his mother. The Comtesse Marcelle, broken down in health and spirit,
  had such a weak hold on life that Bertrand felt that at any rate here was
  one little thing in the world that he could do to earn a semblance of peace
  and content for his soul. He could stay beside his mother and comfort her
  with his presence. He could allay the fears which she had for him and which
  seemed to drain the very fountain of life in her. So he remained beside her,
  spending his days beside her couch, reading to her, reassuring her as to
  his own state of mind. And when he went about the room, or turned toward
  the door, her anxious eyes would follow his every movement, as if at the
  back of her mind there was always the awful fear that the terrible tragedy
  which had darkened her life once and made of her the heart-broken widow that
  she was, would be re-enacted again, and she be left in uttermost loneliness
  and despair.</p>
  <p>His mother, of course!</p>
  <p>But as for Nicolette, and all that Nicolette stood for now: love, happiness,
  peace, content, it was too late!</p>
  <p>Much, much too late!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>He never argued with old Madame about her schemes and plans. He was much
  too tired to argue, and all his time belonged to his mother. She had so little
  time of her own left, whilst he had a kind of grotesque consciousness that
  grandmama would go on and on in this world, planning, scheming, writing letters,
  and making debts.</p>
  <p>Oh! those awful debts! But for them Bertrand would have looked forward with
  perfect content to following his mother, when she went to her rest.</p>
  <p>But there were the debts and the disgrace!</p>
  <p>The last of the de Ventadours seeking in death a refuge from shame, and
  leaving an everlasting blot upon his name! The debts and the disgrace!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;He did once try to speak of it to old Madame, but she only laughed.</p>
  <p>The debts would be paid&mdash;in full&mdash;in full! As for the disgrace,
  how dare Bertrand mention such a word in connection with the de Ventadours.
  And Bertrand did not dare speak of his father just then. Besides, what had
  been the use?</p>
  <p>The debts and the disgrace; and the shame! That awful day in the magnificent
  apartment in Paris, when he knelt to Rixende and begged her, begged her not
  to throw him over! That awful, awful day! And her laugh! It would ring in
  his ears until the crack of doom. When he told her he could not live without
  her, she laughed: when he vaguely hinted at a bullet through his head, she
  had warned him not to make a mess on the carpet. Oh! the shame of that! And
  old Madame did not seem to understand! The word &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; or &ldquo;shame&rdquo; was
  not to be used in connection with the de Ventadours, and when he, Bertrand,
  thought of that day in Paris, and of the debts, and&mdash;and other things,
  he ground his teeth, and could have beaten his head against the wall in an
  agony of shame.</p>
  <p>How right Jaume Deydier had been! How right! What was he, Comte de Ventadour,
  but a defaulting debtor, a ne&rsquo;er-do-well, sunk into a quagmire of improbity
  and beating the air with upstretched hands till they grasped a safety-pole
  held out to him by the weak, trusting arms of a young girl?</p>
  <p>How right Jaume Deydier had been to turn on him and confound him with his
  final act of cowardice. What had he to offer? Debts, a name disgraced, a
  heart spurned by another! How right, how right! But, God in heaven, the shame
  of it!</p>
  <p>And grandmama would not understand. Deydier would give his ears, she said,
  to have a Comte de Ventadour for a son-in-law: he only demurred, made difficulties
  and demands in order to dictate his own terms with regard to Nicolette&rsquo;s
  dowry. That was old Madame&rsquo;s explanation of the scene which had well-nigh
  killed Bertrand with shame. Pretence, she declared, mere pretence on Deydier&rsquo;s
  part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep away from the mas, my son,&rdquo; she said coolly to Bertrand
  one day, &ldquo;keep away from it for a week, and we&rsquo;ll have Deydier
  sending his wench to the ch&acirc;teau on some pretext or another, just to
  throw her in your way again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, thank God,&rdquo; she added a moment or two later, &ldquo;that
  we have not yet sunk so low as to be driven into bestowing the name of Ventadour
  on a peasant wench for the sake of her money-bags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not yet sunk so low? Ye gods! Could man sink lower than he, Bertrand, had
  sunk? Could man feel more shamed than he had done when Nicolette stood beside
  him and said: &ldquo;Take me, take all! I&rsquo;ll not even ask for love
  in return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>There was no question that the Comtesse Marcelle was sinking. Vitality in
  her was at its lowest ebb. Bertrand hardly ever left her side. Her only joy
  appeared to be in his presence, and that of Micheline. When her two children
  were near her she always seemed to revive a little, and when Bertrand made
  pathetic efforts to entertain her by telling her tales of gay life in Paris,
  she even tried to smile.</p>
  <p>Old Madame spared her the infliction of her presence. She never entered
  the sick room; and P&eacute;rone only came two or three times a day to do
  what was necessary for the invalid.</p>
  <p>Then one day a mounted courier arrived from Avignon. He brought a letter
  for old Madame.</p>
  <p>It was in the late afternoon. The old owl&rsquo;s nest was wrapped in gloom,
  for though the Aubussons and the tapestries, the silver and the spinet had
  been bought with borrowed money or else on credit, the funds had run low,
  and candles and oil were very dear.</p>
  <p>Marcelle de Ventadour lay on her couch with her children beside her, and
  only the flickering fire-light to illumine the room. Bertrand for the first
  time had broached the magic word &ldquo;America.&rdquo; Many had gone to
  that far-off land of late, and made fortunes there. Why should not he tempt
  destiny too? He had sworn to his mother that he would never again think of
  suicide. The word &ldquo;America&rdquo; had made her tremble, but it was
  not so terrible as death.</p>
  <p>And on this dull winter&rsquo;s afternoon, with the fire-light making quaint,
  fantastic patterns on the whitewashed ceiling, they had for the first time
  talked seriously of America.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But promise me, Bertrand,&rdquo; mother had entreated, &ldquo;that
  you will not think of it, until I&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Micheline had said nothing: she had not even wondered what would become
  of her, when mother had gone and Bertrand sailed for America.</p>
  <p>They all heard the noise attendant on the arrival of the courier: the tramping
  of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs in the court-yard, the rattle of chains, the banging
  of doors, and old Madame&rsquo;s voice harsh and excited. Then her quick
  step along the corridor, the rustle of her gown. Instinctively the three
  of them drew closer to one another&mdash;like trapped animals when the enemy
  is nigh.</p>
  <p>Old Madame came in with arms outstretched, and an open letter in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come to my arms, Bertrand,&rdquo; she said, with a dramatic gesture. &ldquo;The
  last of the Ventadours can look every man in the face now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was striving to hide her excitement, her obvious relief behind a theatrical
  and showy attitude. She went up to the little group around the invalid&rsquo;s
  couch, and stood over them like a masterful, presiding deity. And all the
  while she flourished the letter which she held.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A light, Bertrand, for mercy&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she went on impatiently. &ldquo;Name
  of a name, all our lives are transformed by this letter! Did I not tell you
  all along that I would turn the tide of our misfortune into one of prosperity?
  Well! I&rsquo;ve done it. I&rsquo;ve done it more completely, more wonderfully
  than I ever dared to hope! And you all sit here like automatons whilst the
  entire current of our destiny has been diverted to golden channels!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She talked rather wildly, somewhat incoherently; altogether she appeared
  different to her usual haughty, unimpassioned self. Bertrand rose obediently
  and lit the lamp, and placed a chair for old Madame beside the table.</p>
  <p>She sat down and without another word to the others, she became absorbed
  in rereading the letter, the paper made a slight crackling sound while she
  read, as her hands were trembling a little. The Comtesse Marcelle, silent
  as usual, kept her eyes fixed on the stately figure of the family autocrat
  with the pathetic gaze of an unloved dog seeking to propitiate an irascible
  master. Micheline clung to her mother&rsquo;s hand, silent and subdued by
  this atmosphere of unreality which grandmama&rsquo;s theatrical gestures
  and speech had evoked. Bertrand alone appeared disinterested. He stood beside
  the hearth and stared moodily into the fire as if the whole affair, whatever
  it was, did not concern him.</p>
  <p>Grandmama read the letter through twice from beginning to end. Then she
  folded it up carefully, laid it on the table, and clasped her hands over
  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no mistake,&rdquo; she said more quietly, &ldquo;no ambiguity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at them all as if expecting to be questioned. The news was so
  wonderful! She was bubbling over with it, and they sat there like automatons!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand,&rdquo; she half implored, half commanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, grandmama,&rdquo; he responded dully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You say nothing,&rdquo; she urged with a febrile beating together
  of her hands, &ldquo;you ask no questions. And this letter&mdash;<i>mon Dieu</i>,
  this letter&mdash;it means life to you&mdash;to us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it from the King, Madame?&rdquo; the Comtesse Marcelle asked,
  still with that look on her face of a poor dog trying to propitiate his master.
  She was so afraid that grandmama would become angry if Bertrand remained
  silent&mdash;and there were the habits of a life-time&mdash;the fear of grandmama
  if she should become angry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The letter is from M. le Marquis de Montaudon,&rdquo; old Madame
  condescended to explain. &ldquo;He writes to me in answer to an appeal which
  I made to him on behalf of Bertrand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand tried to rouse himself from his apathy. The habits of a life-time
  ruled him too&mdash;the respect always accorded grandmama when she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Montaudon,&rdquo; he said, speaking with an effort, &ldquo;is
  treasurer to the King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And a valued friend of His Majesty,&rdquo; old Madame rejoined. &ldquo;You
  must have met him in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; Bertrand replied. &ldquo;De Montaudon is a real
  misanthrope where society is concerned. He leads the life of a hermit wrapped
  up in bank-notes, so &rsquo;tis said, and juggling all day with figures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A brilliant man,&rdquo; grandmama assented. &ldquo;He has saved the
  financial situation of France and of his King. He is a man who deals in millions,
  and thinks in millions as others do in dozens. He and I were great friends
  once,&rdquo; she went on with a quick, impatient sigh, &ldquo;many, many
  years ago&mdash;in the happy days before the Revolution&mdash;my husband
  took me up to Paris one year when I was sick with nostalgia and ennui, and
  he feared that I would die of both complaints in this old owl&rsquo;s nest.
  Then it was that I met de Montaudon&mdash;le beau Montaudon as he was called&mdash;and
  he fell in love with me. He had the blood of the South in his veins, for
  his mother was a Sicilian, and he loved me as only children of the South
  can love&mdash;ardently, immutably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s jealousy, then the turmoil of the Revolution,
  and finally Montaudon&rsquo;s emigration to England, whence he only returned
  six years ago, kept us apart all this while. A whole life-time lies between
  the miseries of to-day and those happy, golden days in Paris. Since then
  my life has been one ceaseless, tireless struggle to rebuild the fortunes
  of this family to which I had been fool enough to link my destiny. Forty
  years I have worked and toiled and fought&mdash;beaten again and again&mdash;struck
  down by Fate and the cowardice of those who should have been my fellow-workers
  and my support&mdash;but vanquished never&mdash;I have fought and struggled&mdash;and
  had I died during the struggle I should have died fighting and unconquered.
  Forty years!&rdquo; she went on with ever-growing excitement, whilst with
  a characteristic gesture of determination and energy she beat upon the letter
  before her with her fists, &ldquo;but I have won at last! Montaudon has
  not forgotten. His letter here is in answer to mine. I asked him for the
  sake of old times to extend his patronage to my grandson, to befriend him,
  to help him in his career! And see his reply!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took up the letter once more, unfolded it, smoothed it out with loving,
  quivering hands. She put up her lorgnette to read: obviously her eyes were
  dim, filled with tears of excitement and of joy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This is how he begins,&rdquo; she began slowly, striving in
  vain to steady her voice.</p>
  <p>Beautiful and Unforgettable Friend,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Send your grandson to me! I
      will provide for him, because he belongs to you, and because in his eyes
      I shall mayhap find a look which will help me to recapture a memory or
      so out of the past. Send the boy without delay. I really need a help in
      my work, and there is a young and beautiful lady who is very dear to me;
      for whom I would gladly find a well-born and handsome husband. Your grandson
      appears to be the very man for that attractive office: thus he will have
      a brilliant career before him as my prot&eacute;g&eacute; and
   an exquisitely sentimental one as the husband of one of the loveliest women
   in this city where beautiful women abound. See! how right you were to make
   appeal to my memory. I never forget....</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was no more than one half of the letter, but old Madame read no more.
  She glanced round in triumph on the three faces that were turned so eagerly
  towards her. But nobody spoke. Marcelle was silent, but her eyes were glowing
  as if new life had been infused into her blood. Micheline was silent because,
  young as she was, she had had in life such vast experience of golden schemes
  that had always gone agley! and Bertrand was silent because his very soul
  was in travail with hope and fear, with anxiety and a wild, mad, bewildering
  excitement which almost choked him.</p>
  <p>Grandmama talked on for awhile: she planned and she arranged and gazed into
  a future so golden that she and Marcelle and Micheline were dazzled by it
  all. Bertrand alone remained obstinately silent: neither old Madame&rsquo;s
  impatience, nor his mother&rsquo;s joy dragged him out of his moodiness.
  In vain did grandmama expatiate on M. de Montaudon&rsquo;s wealth and influence,
  or on the array of beautiful and rich heiresses whose amorous advances to
  Bertrand would make the faithless Rixende green with envy, in vain did his
  mother murmur with pathetic entreaty:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you not happy, Bertrand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He remained absorbed, buried in thoughts, thoughts that he was for the moment
  wholly incapable of co-ordinating. It seemed to him as if hundreds of thousands
  of voices were shrieking in his ear: hundreds of thousands that were high-pitched
  and harsh like the voice of old Madame; they shrieked and they screamed,
  and they roared, and the words that they uttered all came in a jumble, incoherent
  and deafening: a medley of words through which he only distinguished a few
  from time to time:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Treasurer to the King!&rdquo; some of the voices shrieked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All debts paid in full&mdash;in full!&rdquo; others screamed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wealth&mdash;an heiress&mdash;a brilliant marriage&mdash;Rixende&mdash;envy&mdash;hatred&mdash;chance&mdash;career&mdash;money&mdash;money&mdash;money&mdash;wealth&mdash;a
  rich heiress&mdash;money&mdash;money&mdash;no debts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They shrieked and they shrieked, and he could no longer hear grandmama&rsquo;s
  arguments, nor his mother&rsquo;s gentle appeal. They shrieked so loudly
  that his head buzzed and his temples throbbed: because all the while he was
  straining every nerve to listen to something which was inaudible, which was
  drowned in that awful uproar.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>After awhile the noise was stilled. Old Madame ceased to speak. The Comtesse
  Marcelle, wearied out by so much excitement, lay back with eyes closed against
  the pillows. Micheline was bathing her forehead with vinegar. Bertrand woke
  as from a dream. He gazed about him like a sleepwalker brought back to consciousness,
  and found old Madame&rsquo;s slightly mocking gaze fixed upon him. She shrugged
  her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are bewildered, my dear,&rdquo; she said not unkindly. &ldquo;I
  am not surprised. It will take you some time to realise the extent of your
  good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She carefully folded the letter up again, and patted it with both her hands
  like a precious, precious treasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a future, Bertrand,&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;What
  a future! In my wildest dreams I had never hoped for this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him quizzically, then smiled again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were I in your shoes, my dear, I should be equally bewildered. Take
  my advice and go quietly to your room and think it all over. To-morrow we
  will plan the immediate future. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, to-morrow!&rdquo; Bertrand assented mechanically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to start for Paris very soon,&rdquo; she went on earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very soon,&rdquo; Bertrand assented again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! think over it, my dear,&rdquo; old Madame concluded; she rose
  and made for the door; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say good night now, Marcelle,&rdquo; she
  said coolly. &ldquo;I am tired too, and will sup in my room, then go early
  to bed. Come and kiss me, Micheline!&rdquo; she added.</p>
  <p>The girl obeyed; old Madame&rsquo;s hand was now on the handle of the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you too dazed,&rdquo; she said with a not unkind touch of irony
  and turning to Bertrand, &ldquo;to bid me good night, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He came across to her, took her hand and kissed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night, grandmama,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>Smiling she held up the letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The casket,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that holds the golden treasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put out his hand for it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I have it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment she seemed to hesitate, then shrugged her shoulders:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she said, and placed the letter in his hand: but
  before her hold on it relaxed, she added seriously: &ldquo;You will be discreet,
  Bertrand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean you will not read more than the first page and a half, up
  to the words: &lsquo;I never forget&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Up to the words &lsquo;I never forget&rsquo;,&rdquo; Bertrand
  assented. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took the letter and thrust it into the pocket of his coat. Old Madame
  with a final nod to him and the others sailed out of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother is tired,&rdquo; Micheline said, as soon as grandmama had
  gone, &ldquo;let us leave the talking until to-morrow; shall we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bertrand agreed. He appeared much relieved at the suggestion, kissed his
  mother and sister and finally went away.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Voices</b></h2>
  <p>The shrieking voices were all stilled, but there were murmurings and whisperings
  in Bertrand&rsquo;s ears all the while that he made his way down into the
  valley. He had no definite purpose in his mind, only just wandered down the
  mountain-side, in and out of the groves of olive trees and mimosa, past the
  carob tree beside which when a boy he was wont to tilt at dragons, whilst
  wee, podgy Nicolette would wait patiently, stiff and sore and uncomplaining,
  until he was ready to release her. The whole drama of his life seemed to
  be set on this mountain-side beside the carob tree: his hot-headedness, his
  selfishness, his impulsive striving after impossible ideals, beside Nicolette&rsquo;s
  gentle abnegation and her sublime surrender.</p>
  <p>After the cold of the early days of the year, the air had become sweet and
  balmy: already there was a feeling of spring in the warm, gentle breeze that
  came wafted from the south and softly stirred the delicate tendrils of grevillea
  and mimosa. In the branches of carob and olive the new sap was slowly rising,
  whilst the mossy carpet beneath the wanderer&rsquo;s feet was full of young
  life and baby shoots that exhaled a perfume of vitality and of young, eager
  growth. From the valley below there rose a pungent scent of wild thyme and
  basilisk, and from afar there came wafted on the gently stirring wings of
  night the fragrance of early citron-blossom. Overhead the canopy of the sky
  was of an intense, deep indigo: on it the multitude of tiny stars appeared
  completely detached, like millions of infinitesimal balls, never still ...
  winking, blinking, alive&mdash;a thousand hued and infinitely radiant. When
  Bertrand emerged into the open, the crescent moon, mysterious and pale, was
  slowly rising above the ruined battlements of the old ch&acirc;teau. A moment
  later and the whole landscape gleamed as if tinged with silver. A living,
  immense radiance shimmering like an endless sheet of myriads upon myriads
  of paillettes, against which trenchant and detached, as if thrown upon that
  glowing background, by the vigorous brush of a master craftsman, rose the
  multi-coloured tiled roofs of the mas, the sombre splashes of slender cypress
  trees, or the bright golden balls of oranges nestling in the dark, shiny
  foliage.</p>
  <p>And the wanderer stood and gazed upon this perfect picture which was his
  home: old Provence the land of his ancestors, of the troubadours, of the
  courts of love, of romance and poesy: the fragrant, exquisite, warm land
  of the south; and out of all this beauty, this radiance, this life, there
  rose in his heart a wild, mad longing that seemed almost to deprive him of
  his senses. Voices rose out of the valley, came down from the mountain-side,
  voices gentle and sweet were all around him, and the words that they murmured
  and whispered all became merged into one&mdash;just one magic word, a name
  that was the very essence, the inbeing of his longing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolette!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>He arrived at the mas, just after they had finished supper. Jaume Deydier
  was sitting silent and moody, as he always was now, beside the fire. Nicolette
  was helping Marga&iuml; to put the house in order for the night. The front
  door was still on the latch and Bertrand walked straight into the living-room.
  At sight of him Deydier rose frowning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Comte,&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;But Bertrand went boldly up to him. He placed one hand on the old
  man&rsquo;s shoulder, and with the other drew the letter out of his pocket&mdash;the
  letter which had been written by M. de Montaudon who was Treasurer to the
  King.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur Deydier,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;a fortnight ago,
  when I had the presumption to suppose that you would consent to my marriage
  with your daughter, you very justly taunted me in that I had nothing whatever
  to offer her save a tarnished name and a multiplicity of debts. You spoke
  harshly that day, Monsieur Deydier&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear Bertrand,&rdquo; the old man put in kindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me have my say, Monsieur Deydier,&rdquo; Bertrand went on speaking
  very rapidly, &ldquo;for in truth the words are choking me. No doubt you
  think me an impudent puppy for daring to come to you again. But circumstances
  are different now&mdash;very, very different. I no longer come before you
  empty-handed, I come to you to-day holding here, in my hand, a brilliant
  career, a dazzling future. Those two things are mine&mdash;a free gift to
  me from one who believes in me, who means me well. They are mine, Monsieur
  Deydier,&rdquo; and Bertrand&rsquo;s voice broke on a note of pathetic entreaty, &ldquo;and
  I have come to you to-night just to lay them without the slightest compunction
  or regret at the feet of Nicolette. Let her come to me,&rdquo; he entreated. &ldquo;I
  want neither money, nor luxury, nor rank. I only want her and her love. My
  career, my future prospects I just offer her in exchange for the right to
  live here with you at the mas, to be your son, your servant, your devoted
  worker, to do with and order about just as you please! Read this letter,
  Monsieur Deydier, you will see that I am not lying&mdash;Everything
  I have&mdash;everything I hope for&mdash;family&mdash;friends&mdash;I want
  nothing&mdash;if only you will give me Nicolette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now his voice broke completely. He sank into a chair and hid his face in
  his hand, for his eyes were filled with tears.</p>
  <p>Silently Jaume took the letter from him, and silently he read it. When he
  had finished reading, he gave the letter back to Bertrand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have your mother to consider, M. le Comte,&rdquo; was the first
  thing he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s hold on life is so slender, Monsieur Deydier,&rdquo; Bertrand
  replied. &ldquo;When she is gone nothing will hold me to the ch&acirc;teau,
  for Micheline loves me and would be happy if she were anywhere with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And do you really mean all that you said just now?&rdquo; the
  old man rejoined earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask yourself, Monsieur Deydier,&rdquo; Bertrand replied simply. &ldquo;Do
  you think that I was lying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Deydier said firmly, and placed an affectionate hand on
  the other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;But there is old Madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the sake of a past sin,&rdquo; Bertrand retorted, &ldquo;or a
  time-worn revenge, would you wreck Nicolette&rsquo;s happiness? She loves
  me. She will never be happy without me. Old Madame shall never come between
  us. She will remain at the ch&acirc;teau, or go as she pleases, but she shall
  never cross my life&rsquo;s path again. &rsquo;Tis with me now, and with
  me alone that you need deal, Monsieur Deydier. By giving up all that M. de
  Montaudon has offered me, I break definitely with the past, and &rsquo;tis
  to Nicolette that I look for the future, to Nicolette and this old place
  which I love: and if you no longer think me mean and unworthy....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words died upon his lips. He had spoken dully, quietly, with intent
  gaze fixed upon the flickering fire. But now, suddenly two warm, clinging
  arms were around his neck, a soft, silky mass of brown curls was against
  his cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right, Tan-tan,&rdquo; a fairy voice murmured in his ear, &ldquo;I
  will never be happy without you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next moment he was down on his knees, pressing his face against two
  sweet-smelling palms, that were soft and fragrant like a mass of orange-blossom.</p>
  <p>And Jaume Deydier tiptoed silently out of the room.</p>
