<p>How often have I been asked by readers&mdash;young and
old&mdash;&ldquo;do tell me how the <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> came
to be written. How did you think of him?&rdquo; And a good many
would add (men for the most part): &ldquo;You are Hungarian born,
aren&rsquo;t you? Nothing English about you?&rdquo; To the first
the answer was, &ldquo;Yes! of Hungarian parents and grand-parents
and countless generations of Hungarians&rdquo;; and to the second:
&ldquo;No, nothing; except my love which is <i>all</i>
English.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; my kind interlocutor would add,
&ldquo;how comes it that you, a pure-blooded Hungarian as you say,
have such a wonderful understanding of the British character and
have created such a perfect representation of an English
gentleman?&rdquo; Which tribute to my Scarlet Pimpernel always
pleases me more than any other, however appreciative. For that was
what I aimed at when I first conceived him: a perfect presentation
of an English gentleman.</p>

<p>At fifteen years of age, when first my parents settled down in
London (temporarily as they thought) I had never been in England,
never had an English friend or English governess, or English
tuition of any sort or kind. I did not speak one word of English.
Then how did it all come about? Neo-Victorians and Neo-Georgians
will put it down to destiny; others to predestination. I, in my
humble way, put it down to the Will of God. And looking back on my
long life and its many changes I can trace the links of my chain of
life that began on the great plains of Hungary, continued through
the heart of London, and find me now at this hour of writing this
book in Monte Carlo jotting down all that I can remember of those
links which led me one by one to the conception of my first
literary work. If any one of those links had not been, if any turn
of event in my life had been different, I would probably have ended
my days in the country of my birth and known nothing of the
happiness which comes from love, from the affection of friends
(such as one meets in England) and from success in the work to
which I devoted so many years of my life.</p>

<p>In Gotha&rsquo;s <i>Freiherrliches Taschenbuch</i>&mdash;the
continental counterpart of our Debrett&mdash;the ancestry of the
Orczy family is traced back to the entry of Arp&aacute;d and his
knights into Hungary nearly two hundred years before the Norman
Conquest.</p>

<p>Ah well! such is destiny: such was the Will of God! If this had
not happened . . . or that . . . if my father had not been
half-ruined by the agrarian troubles of the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s and
the great Viennese financial crisis that followed . . . if he and
my mother had not then decided to go to Brussels for a time while
my sister and I were still babies, then to Paris when I grew to
school age, and finally to London to complete my education after
the death of my sister . . . if he had lived a few years longer,
when he intended to return to his own country and to end his days
in the old home . . . if I had had any talent for the musical
career to which in his heart he had already devoted me . . . if . .
. if . . . if . . . well, if all those things had not happened
<i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> would not have been written.</p>

<p>Links in the chain of life.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>When I was a child in the last quarter of the nineteenth
century, poor, misguided Hungary of to-day was living her last
years of prosperity as an independent proud country, equal partner
with one of the great empires of Europe. I am not going to enter
into any dissertation on the history of Hungary. It would, for one
thing, take too long and not be very interesting to those who have
never known the country in its brilliant declining years. But it
was brilliant then, when there were no wars or rumours of war, none
at any rate that reached the ears of those splendid feudal lords
ensconced in their opulent ch&acirc;teaux, medi&aelig;val still in
their magnificence, their hospitality; their contemptuous disregard
of every innovation that threatened the even tenor of their
lives&mdash;new-fangled rubbish, or inventions of the devil did
they dub that abominable railway which cut through <i>their</i>
estate, <i>their</i> forests, <i>their</i> fields; bolshevism they
would have called it had the word been coined then, or communism
which was the catchword of politicians and had no meaning that any
sensible man could discern.</p>

<p>I had two dear old aunts who lived an almost conventual life
together in Kolozsv&aacute;r, the capital of Transylvania, integral
eastern portion of Hungary which has become the battledore and
shuttlecock between herself and Roumania ever since the
ill-considered treaty of Trianon in 1919. Their beautiful old home
was opposite the cathedral, and on the open place in front of the
great medi&aelig;val edifice the first motor-cars made their
appearance in the first year of the twentieth century, and there
halted and were parked. My dear old aunts thereafter pulled down
the blinds and closed the shutters of the windows which gave on the
Place, for they would not at any price of light or air look on
those <i>inventions diaboliques.</i></p>

<p>Already the railway&mdash;which twenty-five years before had
linked Kolozsv&aacute;r with Budapest&mdash;had been looked upon by
the two nice old ladies as an invention of the devil. On the vary
rare occasions when they journeyed to Budapest they did so as they
had done in their youth&mdash;in their carriage drawn by six horses
with postilions and relays. It took five days and five halts in
often primitive, and always uncomfortable inns to accomplish the
journey; eighteen hours (at first) to do it by rail, but no matter.
There was no pandering to the devil and his works even at the cost
of almost unbearable fatigue as old age slowly overtook these
devotees of old-time customs.</p>

<p>But this is by the way. I only quote the fact in order to give a
picture of the state of mind that prevailed among the upper classes
in Hungary at the time I opened my baby eyes to the world.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>My earliest recollections go back to a marvellous day in
mid-July-my sister Madeleine&rsquo;s fifth birthday. She was the
elder of us two girls and her birthday was always an occasion for
one of those days of merrymaking and boundless hospitality peculiar
to country life in Hungary. My father and mother lived in
Tarna-&Ouml;rs then, a large agricultural property on the River
Tarna&mdash;owned and farmed by my grandfather as it had been by
many generations before him&mdash;and there were we two girls
born.</p>

<p>The house was of the type so often found on the <i>puszta</i>
(the plains of Hungary) two stories above the ground, rambling,
square and huge, with four fa&ccedil;ades at right angles to one
another. The main block contained the reception rooms and the
apartments of the numerous family, together with numberless
corridors, halls, and staircases; another had thirty-six guest
rooms, and a loggia where one sat on hot summer afternoons looking
out over the garden and the park, and beyond these to the village
with its little medi&aelig;val church and tower; another consisted
of the riding school, gymnasium and swimming bath, whilst kitchens,
offices and servant&rsquo;s quarters completed the square. The
whole structure was as commodious and as ugly as you like.</p>

<p>In the centre of the square there was a garden planted with
standard rose trees and clipped acacias, in the middle of which a
fat stone Cupid spouted water out of its pursed mouth. I remember
that Cupid so well, he and a life-size stone image of Attila, King
of the Huns (why Attila I have often wondered since) standing
defiant and warlike in a niche on the main staircase, are the two
items of ornamentation that have dwelt persistently in my
memory.</p>

<p>Tarna-&Ouml;rs was not the family seat, and there had been no
house there until my grandfather built one in the early days of the
nineteenth century. He was a younger son, had served in the army
until he was chosen to accompany the Austrian archduchess,
Marie-Louise, as her chamberlain when she went to France to marry
the Emperor Napoleon. On his return he bethought himself of getting
married, and desirous of having a home of his own&mdash;his elder
brother being installed in the ancestral ch&acirc;teau&mdash;he
took over the property of Tarna-&Ouml;rs and built thereon this
huge, ugly house, not only in order to accommodate the large family
which he fondly hoped for, but also to indulge his taste for that
extravagant and large-hearted hospitality for which the Hungarian
landowners will always remain famous even in these days of poverty
and democratic government.</p>

<p>And oh! that hospitality! Relations, friends, all of them were
welcome, with their families, their servants, their horses and
carriages. There was room for all and to spare. There was no
question of invitations, they just came&mdash;knowing the days when
they would be welcomed with feasting and dancing and <i>tsigane</i>
(gipsy) music all day and half through the night.</p>

<p>The 22nd of July was one of those days: there were several
others throughout the year, but this one was the most important,
not only because my sister was the eldest grandchild but also
because the weather at this time of year was always beautiful, the
heat always intense, so that there was every excuse for doing
nothing all day but sip iced drinks and loll on easy chairs in the
loggia. We two little girls were prinked out in our best frocks and
did not enjoy ourselves half as much as when we had on our old
pinafores and could scramble up the old acacia trees without fear
of a scolding for spoiling our frocks. Indeed we did not really
look forward to the 22nd of July in spite of the fact that every
carriage-load of visitors brought toys and bonbons for the birthday
child.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Visitors began to drop in the day before, but the first to
arrive were the <i>tsiganes</i> with their musical instruments.
They came from the neighbouring town of Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s, as the
village band was not considered good enough for the great occasion,
and usually turned up at about five o&rsquo;clock ready to begin to
play as soon as some of the company had gathered in the loggia (we
called it the verandah) and had sat down to iced coffee, hot rolls
and lovely butter, and finishing off with huge slices of watermelon
cooled in ice&mdash;yellow, pink, red, and white glistening like
coloured snow encased in their shiny emerald-green
carcases&mdash;with early peaches and nectarines and pomegranates
swimming in maraschino.</p>

<p>And the gipsy band played unceasingly one gay
<i>cs&agrave;rd&agrave;s</i> (the Hungarian national dance) after
another, intermingled with one or other of those beautiful old
Hungarian songs which great musicians like Liszt, Brahms, and Hubay
did not disdain to pass off as their own compositions.</p>

<p>What happened during the remainder of that first afternoon we
children knew nothing about. We were whisked off to bed at our
usual time and, looking back on those merry days in the light of
further experience, I imagine that all the grown-ups as well as the
children spent a quiet night in the comfortable beds of
Tarna-&Ouml;rs in preparation for the next day&rsquo;s orgy of
pleasure. Nor do I remember much of the actual great day. It seemed
to have been spent for the most part in the dining-room, the
verandah, or the garden in eating and perpetual chattering to the
accompaniment of <i>tsigane</i> music until the end of the day,
when dancing began and went on until far into the morning when all
of us children were getting out of bed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone did anything during the day
except chatter and eat. They didn&rsquo;t drink much&mdash;drinking
to excess is not a Hungarian vice&mdash;they just ate and ate and
laughed and chatted. Breakfast was at any convenient hour, coffee
and hot rolls and butter served in the bedrooms. At eleven
o&rsquo;clock everyone drank Tokay and munched biscuits until one
o&rsquo;clock, when luncheon was served and went on until three
o&rsquo;clock. Coffee and liqueurs took up the time until five
o&rsquo;clock, when it was the turn of ices, cakes, fruit, and I
know not what. And always to the accompaniment of gipsy music. When
those <i>tsiganes</i> slept I know not. They certainly played with
hardly any interruption, only two or three very small intervals for
meals, and with never-failing energy for hours on end.</p>

<p>That is all the recollection I have of my sister&rsquo;s fourth
birthday. As far as I know it was no different from many other days
of equal conviviality. It was in the following year that the
festivities of the 22nd of July were brought to a close by an
appalling tragedy which has never faded from my mind from that day
to this.</p>

<p>Was it not the first link in the chain of my life? I leave my
readers to judge.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2" id="Chapter2"></a>Chapter
2</b>
</h2>

<p>My father had now in his turn taken over&mdash;in accordance
with family custom&mdash;another agricultural property which was
handed over to him by his father. He and my mother were probably
tired of living with the old people, with the brothers and sisters
and the rest of the family in Tarna-&Ouml;rs. Anyway, I vaguely
remember a journey by carriage and then the ferry across the River
Theisz, carriage, horses, and all. The Theisz is one of the four
great rivers of Hungary and Tisza-Ab&aacute;d is close by. The
house is still there to this day, but I don&rsquo;t remember it
very well, we only lived there three years and I never saw it again
after we left it. The tragedy of that memorable 22nd of July was so
appalling that I don&rsquo;t wonder my parents turned their back on
it and never wished to see it again.</p>

<p>The whole of that terrible tragedy was simply a question of
machinery <i>versus</i> the labourers: the same motive, the same
pig-headedness on the one side and misunderstanding on the other,
that brought about the many troubles all over the industrial world
at that time. In this case it was the world of agricultural science
and the peasants. My father was very keen on farming. In the
intervals of certain diplomatic missions entrusted to him by the
Austro-Hungarian Government he had studied farming in Germany and
in France. Tisza-Ab&aacute;d was situated in the heart of one of
the finest corn-growing districts in Europe, and here agricultural
science was not only in its infancy, it had in fact never been
born.</p>

<p>Such things as machinery for harvesting, threshing, or grinding
had never been heard of. Everything was done by hand and everybody,
owner as well as peasant, was perfectly satisfied with things as
they were. My father, unfortunately for him, had progressive
ideals; he dreamed of turning Tisza-Ab&aacute;d into a model farm
on the lines of those he had seen in Germany and France. I take it
he was also obstinate; that he did not listen to warnings, either
from friends, or from those of the peasantry who were better
educated than most and had remained loyal to him.</p>

<p>Anyway, he began operations by building a steam-mill, and
importing agricultural machinery from Germany. The peasants
grumbled, held indignation meetings in the village inn, sent
deputations to my father demanding that this work of the devil
should cease; for, they argued, if the corn was not going to be cut
and garnered and threshed and ground by their hands, who but the
devil had the power to do it&mdash;surely not God, who if He had
wanted iron and steel things to do this work He would have created
them without the help of goodness knows what hellish objects from
Germany, and without that tall chimney which obviously was only
destined to send the smoke from the fires of hell up into the pure
air of the sky.</p>

<p>They talked, humbly and respectfully at first as to their
overlord, then more and more firmly and peremptorily. My father
listened to them, with entire sympathy and understanding. He argued
with them, explained the matter to them as clearly and as patiently
as he could: assured them that never, while he lived&mdash;and his
children after him&mdash;would any man born and living on his
estate suffer penury from unemployment. He talked and the men
listened, but they were not convinced. Superstition&mdash;which is
one of the besetting sins of the ignorant&mdash;had them in its
grip. They were frightened, they knew not of what.</p>

<p>Anyway, another deputation composed of all the elders of the
village went to interview the parish priest on the all-engrossing
subject. They went to beg him to say a special mass for the keeping
away of the devil and to bless buckets full of holy water wherewith
to douse the entire building with its tall chimney, which only the
devil could make use of by filling it with smoke.</p>

<p>It was just the same old story that agitated the industrial
centres all over Europe. England was one of the chief sufferers and
so was Northern France. I was just a child, and of all that
happened previous to that fateful 22nd of July I knew, of course,
nothing until I was old enough to understand. But I do know what
happened on the day itself.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It began most gloriously. The weather was perfect. The corn was
ripe. Harvesting was about to begin, that over-busy, over-happy
time for all those who love their country and their land as my
father did so whole-heartedly, and we two little girls were just
old enough to enjoy the festivities attendant on <i>the</i>
birthday festivities as great and lively at Tisza-Ab&aacute;d as
they had been at Tarna-&Ouml;rs. This particular year they were
going to be merrier than they had ever been before.</p>

<p>A grand project had been set on foot by my mother, who had a
perfect genius for making everybody, young and old, masters and
servants happy. The idea was to have a great masquerade. Everyone
was to dress up in some fantastic guise: the women were to don male
attire, and the men to wear bodices and petticoats. For this
purpose old chests were ransacked for clothes and apparel which had
lain mouldering therein for the past century probably. I imagine
that a good many of these were moth-eaten. Well! what did that
matter so long as they could be worn at all and helped to increase
the fun? I know that for weeks before the event a regular army of
women from the village sat in a huge workroom plying needle and
thread and scissors to mend and fix up all sorts of costumes,
sufficiently at any rate to make them wearable on that one
wonderful occasion.</p>

<p>The <i>tsiganes</i> came, as was customary, in the afternoon, of
the 21st. They were a band of super <i>tsiganes</i> attached to
Tisza-Ab&aacute;d, who had for the past three years been trained
and taught and encouraged in the way they should go by my father,
who was, besides his other great qualities, an accomplished
musician. After they had settled down to play, friends began to
arrive. They came as they always did&mdash;in their carriages drawn
by spanking Hungarian horses: light carriages these were, that skim
over the sandy roads of the <i>puszia</i>&mdash;really not unlike
the &lsquo;victorias&rsquo; of our mothers&rsquo; days in Hyde
Park, but always with four horses in the traces (sometimes five,
Hungarian fashion three leaders, two wheelers), the harness either
black or red with long streamers and silver bosses. So gay, so
romantic, so medi&aelig;val. No wonder that full-throated cheers
followed them whenever they galloped through a village. No wonder
that Tisza-Ab&aacute;d echoed those cheers from one end of the
village to the other.</p>

<p>The events of the next twenty-four hours form something of a
jumble in my mind. All that I can disentangle from that jumble of
impressions in first the feeling that the day was all too short, I
wanted it to go on and on and on, and at the same time I wanted the
hour to come quickly when all the guests would retire in order to
don the fantastic costumes which had been laid out ready for them
in their respective rooms. A second impression of which I remember
being conscious at the time was the joy that my own birthday was
not very far off, 23rd September in fact, and that all this
loveliness, the games, the presents, the mad merry-making would in
two months&rsquo; time begin again.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And so the evening came. Silence reigned in the ch&acirc;teau
while the guests were busy dressing up&mdash;comparative silence
that is, because now and again it was broken by shrieks of laughter
issuing from one of the guest rooms and by one or other of the
uncles or cousins or friends breaking out into stentorian song. We
two little girls were dressed in old-fashioned pages&rsquo;
costumes of scarlet satin, with small scarlet skull caps to confine
our rebellious curls, satin knee-breeches and buckled shoes. We
were delighted with ourselves. They had been made to our measure by
Julie Dubois&mdash;how well I remember her name when I have
forgotten so many others&mdash;our French nursery governess.</p>

<p>I can distinctly recall even now some of the motley throng that
gathered in the reception rooms before supper was announced: the
girls and young matrons in men&rsquo;s clothes which, for the most
part became them very well, for they knew how to make the best of
themselves, and the men in what articles of feminine attire they
had contrived to array themselves in.</p>

<p>My mother&mdash;always beautiful, always elegant and
sedate&mdash;wore my father&rsquo;s national court dress: a blue
watered-silk frock coat with jewelled clasps, black velvet cloak
with scarlet lining, sable collar and jewelled buttons over her
left shoulder, grey silk, Hungarian breeches, great curved sword
with jeweled hilt, belt, and sheath. She looked perfectly
lovely&mdash;she was, indeed, a noted beauty, even in this land
where so many women are beautiful&mdash;with a cap set rakishly on
her dark hair, its long heron&rsquo;s feather held with a jewelled
clasp. There surely never has been a more fascinating Hungarian
aristocrat dressed ready for a Court function in Budapest or
Vienna. The reason why I am able to describe the costume she wore
that evening all those years ago is because I have a portrait of my
father painted by a Hungarian artist and wearing that self-same
Court dress.</p>

<p>Others, of course, I don&rsquo;t remember so accurately, only
one or two ludicrous visions float before my mind now and then even
to this day. The very noble and very pompous Count
V.&mdash;Lord-Lieutenant of the county&mdash;who had dragged out of
the welter of all sorts and kinds of feminine apparel some white
tarlatan skirts such as were worn by Taglioni and her pupils in the
days when ballet-dancing was a fine art (and, if you please, by the
Russian ballet-dancers of to-day now that this art has come into
its own again). On Count V.&rsquo;s none too slender figure the
pink bodice laced up at the back, and his socks and own dancing
shoes peeping out below the tarlatan skirts, looked supremely
comic.</p>

<p>And I also remember an Orczy cousin of mine, a handsome young
captain of hussars dressed as a Hungarian peasant maiden, with row
upon row of coloured beads, such as these maidens love to wear,
adorning his manly chest, and a <i>p&aacute;rta</i> (the national
head-dress) which refused to keep in its proper place. He had
managed to collect a number of cotton skirts and tied them on round
his waist one over the other in the orthodox style, but he had not
the art of swinging these as he walked, which the Hungarian peasant
girls do to perfection in order to display their kaleidoscope of
colours.</p>

<p>My father and two or three of the older men were the only ones
who wore no fancy costume on that never-to-be-forgotten occasion,
but everybody else did, and the servants the same: they, too, had
been pressed into following the topsy-turvy rule of the evening,
and anything more funny than old Jank&oacute;, the grey-haired
butler, in a scarlet bodice and pink petticoat, solemnly pouring
out the wine, or standing behind my mother&rsquo;s chair without
the suspicion of a smile beneath his huge white moustache could not
very well be imagined.</p>

<p>The supper was boisterous and merry, and the <i>tsiganes</i> had
to work hard to make themselves heard above the din in the great
open hall, the clatter of dishes, the outbursts of laughter, and
the constant chattering of the gay company. We two little girls and
all the children had the time of our lives, and the very thought of
getting sleepy and having to go to bed was anathema to our childish
souls. After supper, dancing began as was customary with the
<i>cs&agrave;rd&agrave;s</i>, the Hungarian national dance, some of
the finest tunes of which have been immortalized by Brahms (though
it was not he who invented them).</p>

<p>The <i>tsiganes</i> knew how to alternate the dreamy
<i>lass&uacute;</i> (slow movement) with the maddest, liveliest
parts of the dance. <i>&rdquo;H&uacute;zd r&aacute;,
czig&aacute;ny!&rdquo;</i> (play on <i>tsiganes</i>) was called out
to them by the dancers as if to add more strength to their arms.
Sometimes they could hardly play for laughing when the
&lsquo;ladies&rsquo; became entangled in their unaccustomed
petticoats, and were compelled to cling none to gracefully to their
dainty cavaliers.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>In the midst of all this boisterous gaiety only a few could have
noticed that the old butler had slipped into the room and, going up
to my father, whispered something in his ear, nor seen my father
rise immediately and follow Jank&oacute; out of the room. Now,
funnily enough, I do remember that little incident because,
beginning to feel tired I had ceased dancing and had drawn close to
where my father was sitting, and had squatted on the floor with my
head resting against his knee. His rising so suddenly sent the
sleepiness out of my eyes. And after that I only remember things in
a confused dream-like manner. I remember that Madeleine and I and
the other children were picked up and taken incontinently up to
bed; we two were undressed and made ready to say our evening prayer
as we always did, kneeling by the side of mother; but this evening
was different.</p>

<p>Everything was done in a hurry, and mother did not come for
prayers, as she always did whether there was &lsquo;company&rsquo;
or not, and Julie Dubois murmured our usual little prayers at such
a rate that we were scarcely able to follow. (Funny that such
trivial incidents as this one should dwell so persistently in my
mind, but it certainly has done throughout my long life.) Hastily
she tucked us up in bed, told us to go to sleep and forgot to put a
match to the <i>veilleuse</i>, the night-light which was always
kept going in our nursery. Julie slept in the room next to ours and
the communicating door was always left wide open To-night our
nursery was darker than usual because there was no
<i>veilleuse</i>, only a narrow shaft of light from the lamp in
Julie&rsquo;s room came through the open door and lay over the
floor leaving the rest of the room in darkness. But we were not
afraid of the dark. I am not sure that I for one did not like
it.</p>

<p>To-night, however, we neither of us got to sleep. We called once
or twice to Julie but she did not answer. As a rule this part of
the house was always very quiet. The nursery was a long way from
the reception rooms, on another floor but to-night there seemed to
be a perpetual hum going on from every part of the house. Nothing
definite, no individual sound, just a perpetual buzzing like the
approach of lots and lots of horses and carriages coming nearer and
nearer and yet not like that either. Just noise. At first we
thought&mdash;at least I did&mdash;that it came from the dancing on
the floor below, the <i>tsigane</i> music and so on.</p>

<p>I longed for Julie to answer when we called. After a time I
noticed that a red glow shone through the slats of the shutters,
because my bed was opposite the window and I could see the red
streaks through the slats. I called to Madeleine and she got out of
bed; then I got out, too, and together we went and stood by the
window looking at the red glow through the shutters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be the sunset can it?&rdquo; I suggested;
and Madeleine shook her head and whispered: &ldquo;Sh . . . sh . .
. sh . . . listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I listened. I heard Julie&rsquo;s voice at last. She was
murmuring &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; and again &ldquo;<i>Mon
Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; at frequent intervals. Ilona, our
nursery-maid, was with her, talking. Julie did not speak Hungarian
but she had been a long time with us, so she understood when the
servants spoke to her. And Ilona was saying now: &ldquo;It is all
burning, burning, all the fields, the corn, the maize, the oats,
everything&rdquo;; and Julie murmured: &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu, ayez
piti&eacute; de nous!&rdquo;</i> Then Ilona went on talking, she
said: &ldquo;The stables you know, Mademoiselle, the cowsheds, the
farm buildings, all that, they are trying to save the poor animals,
who are so frightened, the poor cows, the horses, the pigs, the
geese. . . . Oh! it is dreadful! . . . Those wicked peasants . . .
they should have thought of the innocent animals . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Julie kept on murmuring: &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu, ayez
piti&eacute;!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>That is about all that I actually remember of that terrible
night. I was only three years old at the time and of course I did
not understand. It was only years afterwards, and then only very
gradually, that papa and mama revealed to us the terrible tragedy
in all its details. I gave a full description of it such as I
gathered it from them in my book, <i>A Son of the People</i>. In
the book all the characters are imaginary; it is only the actual
tragedy such as it occurred at Tisza-Ab&aacute;d that I tried to
describe, not as I imagined it, for it was all too real, but as I
saw it in my mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>I understand that the steam-mill, with its tall
chimney&mdash;the cause of all the trouble&mdash;still stands on
the banks of the Theiss, and is in full working order. It was
reconstructed after the fire which destroyed acres upon acres of
rich corn land, but failed to do the building irreparable damage.
But many a time, and even to this day, have I seen in imagination
the awesome scene which marked the close of our life in
Tisza-Ab&aacute;d.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter

</h2>

<p>After that came a different life altogether, because I never
lived in the country again until after I was married. We were
always in town: Budapest first, then Brussels, then Paris for a
little while, and finally London. I don&rsquo;t remember the
preparations that were made for our departure from
Tisza-Ab&aacute;d, but I do remember how terribly sad papa and mama
nearly always looked after that awful night in July. They tried to
smile, poor darlings, when they thought we were looking at them;
but somehow even I, child as I was, realized that there was no joy
in their hearts. The destruction of the crops at Tisza-Ab&aacute;d,
complete though it was, did not necessarily mean black ruin, though
it went some way towards it, but I imagine that it hardened
papa&rsquo;s heart against the country which he loved and against
the people to whom he had shown nothing but kindness and good
will.</p>

<p>He often told me afterwards that the tragedy wrought a very
great change in him morally, but that it conferred one inestimable
boon upon him, one for which he thanked God with all his heart. It
turned his whole mind back to music which, deep down in his soul,
he had always loved passionately. As a boy in the days of
Tarna-&Ouml;rs his tutor, a learned professor from the University
of Weimar, was devoted to music and gave the boy his first lessons
in that sublime and divine art. After his death my father did three
years&rsquo; study at Weimar University, and there he continued to
study music so earnestly that at sixteen ears of age he was
familiar with the works of all the great masters: he had taught
himself composition, counterpoint, and orchestration. He always
played the piano divinely: his touch on the piano, as well as on
the harp and the organ, had in it a quality which I for one have
never heard equalled.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was in Weimar that the first seeds were sown of my
father&rsquo;s friendship with Franz Liszt, then at the apogee of
his glorious career, a friendship which endured throughout the life
of the great master and influenced not only my father&rsquo;s
destiny but strangely enough mine also. It was he who induced my
father to accept the position of <i>Intendant</i> (Supreme
Administrator) of the National Theatres in Budapest&mdash;a Court
appointment which as so often happens in cases of this sort (and I
venture to say in most countries where special appointments are
dependent on Court or Government patronage) had hitherto been
assigned to gentlemen highly distinguished no doubt in their
military or administrative careers, but who knew about as much of
music as &lsquo;the cock that crows in the morn&rsquo; or of
dramatic art as &lsquo;the maiden all forlorn&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I have often been told, years afterwards when I began to
understand things, that my father was &lsquo;very difficult&rsquo;.
I can quite believe it. Music, through a divine and
highly-elevating art, is a hard task-mistress. She plays havoc more
often than not with the artist&rsquo;s nerves and with his
temperament, makes him over-sensitive to pin-pricks. And my dear
father, I know, suffered terribly from pin-pricks. The position of
&lsquo;Intendant of the National Theatres&rsquo; was a coveted one.
There was a clique who felt they had a prescriptive right to
nominate, if not actually to appoint, a successor to the outgoing
official</p>

<p>There were certain privileges attached to it and if one did not
worry too much as to the artistic qualities of opera or drama, and
was content to give the public the old things that had become the
stock-in-trade of the National Theatres, things went on pretty
smoothly. But in this, as in everything else that was progressive
and cultural, the Hungarian &lsquo;man in the street&rsquo; hated
any kind of innovation. His father had applauded <i>Trovatore,
Barbi&egrave;re, La Fille de Madame Angot</i> and what not, and
these were quite good enough for him. He didn&rsquo;t want to know
anything of that German humbug called Wagner and his entirely
tuneless and noisy opera <i>Lohengrin</i>.</p>

<p>S&aacute;ndor &Uuml;rk&eacute;ny, the old <i>chef
d&rsquo;orchestre</i>, who had conducted the orchestra of the
National Theatres for umpteen years was not going to worry himself
studying any new scores with brass instruments galore, some of
which he had never even heard of. He had a great many friends. He
was popular. A cabal formed itself around him against what was
loudly termed a revolution in the administration of the
country&rsquo;s most cherished institution. He tendered his
resignation as <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestre</i>, thinking, no doubt,
that this would create a regular uproar against the
&lsquo;aristocratic musician&rsquo; (meaning my father) who had
foreign ideas and foreign sympathies altogether at variance with
Hungarian traditions.</p>

<p>The resignation did not create the desired uproar but it let
loose a number of pin-pricks, attacks in the Press, discontent
among the upholders of the old r&eacute;gime, among the old actors
and singers who should have been pensioned off long ago, but had
carried on simply because they had acted and sung on the stage of
the National Theatre to the delight of the past generation.</p>

<p>My father felt the pin-pricks keenly, but he was an obstinate
man, and as in the case of the discontented peasants in
Tisza-Ab&aacute;d he did not realize that the tide of discontent in
the reactionary elements of the city was rising against him. As he
had striven to make Tisza-Ab&aacute;d a model farm, so he strove
now to make the Budapest Opera take its rank&mdash;during his
administration&mdash;among the great musical institutions of
Europe.</p>

<p>He accepted old &Uuml;rk&eacute;ny&rsquo;s resignation with
ill-concealed pleasure, and called Hans Richter over from Bavaria
to take his place. The latter was then conducting an insignificant
orchestra somewhere in Bavaria. My father had somehow got to know
of him and as soon as troubles with old &Uuml;rk&eacute;ny began he
went over there, heard that greatest of all conductors at work and
soon induced him to come to Budapest; where, by the way, the
project of building an opera house worthy of the noblest musical
traditions was already being seriously considered. And that was the
beginning of Hans Richter&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>Under my father&rsquo;s patronage his fame spread beyond the
confines of Budapest, and when my father in the end&mdash;tired of
squabbles and pin-pricks and attacks in the Press&mdash;resigned
his position as Intendant of the National Theatres, Vienna took
Richter on; from thence he went to Bayreuth and was acclaimed all
over Europe as the greatest <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestre</i> it had
ever known. And he certainly was that.</p>

<p>England acclaimed him as warmly as any of these ever did. He was
received everywhere with the greatest kindness and hospitality.
Manchester vied with London to shower honours and munificence upon
him. And all this he repaid with the basest ingratitude. His German
blood asserted itself to the full when at the outbreak of the
1914-1918 war he set himself to work to vilify England and
everything English in articles and letters published in the German
Press. It would be impossible to imagine conduct more sordid and
more vile on the part of an man who dared to abrogate to himself
the noble name of &lsquo;artist&rsquo;. We all remember that
unspeakable anti-English manifesto which was issued by the German
<i>intelligentsia</i>, by authors, artists, poets, and musicians at
the outbreak of the 1914 war. Hans Richter&mdash;whom England had
loaded with kindnesses&mdash;put his name to that.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But all this will seem irrelevant to those dear kind readers who
do me the honour of wanting to hear about my doings and my destiny.
I have only spoken of them because our stay in Budapest for the
three years when my father was engaged in what should have been the
most welcome activity in public and social life and alas! proved to
be so nerve-racking for him, was one of the most important links in
the chain of my life. The great and ever mysterious
&lsquo;if&rsquo; comes into play there, for had those activities
been congenial from a mental as well as from a social point of
view, he would no doubt have continued them, and we should never
have left Budapest and Tarna-&Ouml;rs, and never have come to
England . . . and, <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> would never have
been written.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4" id="Chapter4"></a>Chapter

</h2>

<p>Throughout these troublous times, Franz Liszt&mdash;&lsquo;the
Abb&eacute; Liszt&rsquo; as he then was&mdash;remained the staunch
friend and supporter of my father. He had a great and genuine
admiration for his musical gifts. There was never any humbug about
old Liszt, and when he declared that F&eacute;lix Orczy was the
finest amateur musician in Europe he meant what he said, and was
the first to proclaim that through my father was not what was known
as a <i>brilliant executant</i>, he &lsquo;made the piano
sing&rsquo; in a way that he for one had never heard equalled.</p>

<p>I think the grand old man tried his best to persuade my father
to accept the brilliant offer made to him at this time by the
Khedive to take over the direction of the Opera in Cairo, and help
make of that city as great a musical centre as Budapest had become
under his directorate. The offer must have been very tempting, and
funnily enough I vaguely remember Madeleine and I poring over our
geography books when we heard the word &lsquo;Cairo&rsquo; spoken
by our parents as a likely future abode. But my dear mother was
dead against the project. We two little girls were growing up and
our education was becoming one of the first considerations in her
mind.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, my father&rsquo;s definite refusal with
grateful thanks to His Highness the Khedive was yet another link in
the chain which bound little Emmuska Orczy to her future
home&mdash;England.</p>

<p>After Budapest&mdash;and always with a view to our
future&mdash;my parents took us to Brussels where we commenced our
education in the convent school of The Visitation. We were only a
very little while in Brussels. My beloved sister died there at the
age of twelve. My father idolized her and her death did, in a way,
break his heart. He had suffered greatly through the tragedy in
Tisza-Ab&aacute;d, and the three years of struggle against covert
enmity in Budapest, but nothing in the way of misfortune struck so
deeply at his heart than the death of dear little Madeleine. I was
just old enough, too, to realize my own loss to the full. Though I
was younger by two years than she was, we had always loved each
other devotedly.</p>

<p>The one year of schooling that we did together in Brussels was
made happy for me by the fact that the kind nuns allowed us to be
always together both for work and play. My school reports in those
days always spoke of me as being <i>trop dominante avec ses
compagnes</i>. I suppose I was of a domineering disposition. I
always wanted to be, and in my own opinion always was right in any
dispute or argument that occurred amongst us schoolgirls. In fact
my character did not develop on very lovable lines, I am sure, and
it needed all of Madeleine&rsquo;s gentle influence, and often her
interposition between my ill-temper and the wrath of the other
girls, to patch up many a quarrel which would have brought severe
punishment on my obstinate and passionate head.</p>

<p>I was therefore, and entirely by my own fault, decidedly
unpopular: but everyone loved Madeleine. I adored her; but even the
kind nuns who most deplored my <i>mauvais caract&egrave;re</i>,
admitted that I never tried to dominate her. She was getting more
and more delicate at this time and did not care to join in the
games in the big convent garden, and I was only too happy to stay
with her in the recreation room, content to be with her and to
chatter away on all sorts of fantastic subjects. We invented a kind
of game together, a thrilling drama which we enacted, of a lovely
princess held in bondage by a wicked ogre and of a daring prince
who made various attempts to rescue her. Madeleine was, of course
the princess whose name was Rose, and I was the Prince Horace.</p>

<p>The tower in which the lovely lady was imprisoned was built of
school forms and desks flanked by numerous chairs. These obstacles
had to be surmounted by the dauntless prince without knocking any
of them over, for if he brought down as much as a chair out of
place he had failed in his attempt and oft-times had been
grievously wounded and lay unconscious for at least three minutes
(that is to say, three weeks by our computation). As soon as he had
recovered from his swoon he made another daring attempt, scaling
crags and chasms of rocks and storming the grim citadel of benches,
forms and desks. And ha! The joy of the rescued princess! The pride
of the dauntless prince as he clasped the loved one in his
arms.</p>

<p>And this same thrilling drama was enacted whenever the kind nuns
allowed us to drag the desks and chairs about for our
<i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne.</i> Probably they knew what I, of course,
did not, that my dear Madeleine had not many more weeks to live and
indulged her in the little entertainment which I had invented for
her pleasure.</p>

<p>I only mention this trivial episode because I cannot help
thinking that in a childish, obscure way my imagination was already
then at work on doughty deeds of valour, on noble heroes,
dare-devil adventurers and on hapless victims of cruel persecutions
which found expression many years later in the creation of <i>The
Scarlet Pimpernel</i>.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>While we were in the Visitation we spent two of our long
holidays in Tarna-&Ouml;rs. I must say that I did not like them at
all. Somehow I felt that we were not popular with the rest of the
family. My grandfather was a martyr to gout and we saw little of
him; all the others, aunts, uncles, cousins had become very
Germanized. Grandmother was Viennese by birth; her only daughter
had married an Austrian General; the cousins jabbered away in
German, and my darling Madeleine and I hated talking German. The
one uncle whom we liked was Master of the Horse to the Empress
Elisabeth and lived in Vienna; two other uncles were in the army
where German was obligatory.</p>

<p>Grandmother never allowed Hungarian to be spoken in her
presence, and we two little girls took refuge against all this
Germanization by chattering away in French with Mama and between
ourselves, and always Hungarian with papa when we were alone with
him. Grandmother it seems disapproved of our foreign education as
she called it. She thought us too free in our ways, not
sufficiently lady-like&mdash;I was, of course, the chief offender.
We were very frightened of her, and as we were invariably reproved
at table when we chatted in French, mostly in whispers, we got into
the way of sitting silent during the long meals. But it was worse
when the meal was over and the &lsquo;grown-ups&rsquo; adjourned to
another room for coffee. Oh! how I dreaded the half-hour that
ensued. We were the youngest of the family and had our two little
chairs by the side of grandmother and were told, very kindly I must
say, to sit down.</p>

<p>Then came the awful moment. All the ladies-aunts and cousins and
friends who were staying in the house brought out their crochet or
their embroidery frames. I brought out my tatting&mdash;I have
always loved tatting&mdash;and Madeleine her knitting. The
grown-ups drank their after-dinner coffee, talked a little, and
presently silence fell on the assembled company presumably because
no one had anything particular to say. And suddenly grandmother
would fix her steely eyes upon me and command: &ldquo;Emma&rdquo;
(she disdained to call me Emmuska, which is the Hungarian
equivalent of that very ugly name and actually means &lsquo;little
Emma&rsquo;), &ldquo;Emma, <i>faits la conversation</i>&rdquo;
(make conversation), and this command she always issued in
French&mdash;I never knew why&mdash;because she detested French
almost as much as she did Hungarian. But I ask you whether an order
to make conversation would not always be the surest means of drying
up the flood of your eloquence and muddle up your thoughts however
active they may have been just before.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that it dried me up and jumbled my thoughts, for
in my shy, stupid way, I simply couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to
say, and you can, I am sure, picture to yourself the feelings of a
schoolgirl or even of anyone older faced with such a command. I
know that it positively froze me and the effort that I made to
entertain the company (who, by the way, were none too kindly
disposed towards me) sufficiently to raise a smile or a glimmer of
interest must be counted as one of the most heroic achievements of
my life.</p>

<p>I wish I could remember some of the rubbish I talked on those
occasions: but I do know that in consequence of these efforts I was
never able in after life, nor can I to this day &lsquo;make
conversation&rsquo; or indulge in what is known as small talk, an
art in which so many of my friends young and old excel, unless I am
among friends who are interested in me and who will keep the ball
of &lsquo;conversation&rsquo; rolling along happily.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was soon after the second long holiday which we spent in
Hungary that my beloved sister died. This was the first sorrow that
came into my young life. How little did I guess that her death was
yet another link in the chain of my life, the link that brought me
more insistently than any other to what God had decreed would be my
real, my spiritual, birthplace . . . England.</p>

<p>My father who worshipped her, and who was absent in Hungary at
the time at the death-bed of his father, was entirely broken by
grief at this additional sorrow. He had been telegraphed for when
Madeleine was dying and arrived in Brussels just in time to see her
laid to rest there. He became a changed man after that. Though he
was not much more than forty at the time his hair turned
snow-white, and he became the most silent man I have ever met. Not
morose, just silent with a kind of gentle, brooding sadness in his
deep-set blue eyes.</p>

<p>Indeed, sorrow had become the portion of both my parents at this
time. My mother lost both her father and her mother and also a
sister of whom she was very fond, and I imagine that both she and
my father felt that this overwhelming atmosphere of sorrow was none
too healthy for a growing girl as I then was. They were obliged to
go to Hungary on business of succession and so forth, and an aunt
who had a daughter of her own about my age and who was very fond of
me undertook to look after me while my parents were away. She was
an aunt <i>&agrave; la mode de Bretagne&mdash;</i>not really an
aunt, but distantly related in the way that in Hungary all families
are in some way or other linked together.</p>

<p>Anyway, I fully reciprocated her affection for me. She took me
along with her daughter to Paris to give us the educational polish
which I daresay was necessary, because the dear little nuns of the
Visitation in Brussels were more noted for their piety than for the
erudition. Our minds were principally fed on ecclesiastical
history, not imparted to us out of printed books but out of
copy-books, manuscripts in fact which were copied and re-copied by
all of us pupils by way of recreation every Saturday afternoon. We
were also grounded in the history of France out of books entirely
devoted to the glory of that Catholic country.</p>

<p>In addition to these two histories we had the usual lessons in
geography and arithmetic, and several hours during each week were
devoted to sewing and (for which I am heartily grateful) to what
was called <i>style &eacute;pistolaire, i.e.</i> writing letters to
imaginary correspondents on various matters suggested by the
teacher, such as a description of an afternoon&rsquo;s holiday at
Ostende (I suppose most children at school in Brussels had been to
Ostende) or an account of how we spent our recreation hour when the
weather was too bad for play in the garden. Anyway, in the
Visitation the subject of these letters was limited to our childish
intelligence. Nevertheless, I feel that it was good training in its
way, more especially as there were always extra marks for good
handwriting and for quickness in the task, all of which certainly
stood me in good stead in later life.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>At the Convent School in Paris our studies were certainly on a
higher plane than in Brussels, but not much. We learned our
<i>Histoire de l&rsquo;Eglise</i> and our <i>Histoire de France</i>
out of printed books. I am ashamed to say that I do not remember
the names of the authors, but I enjoyed my <i>Histoire de
France</i> even though it was not <i>Michelet&rsquo;s</i>. I think
I liked hearing about the wickednesses of England, especially with
reference to Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, of whom it was always boldly
asserted that she was condemned at the stake by the English whilst
no reference was made to the French bishops who also sat in
judgement over her. (Strangely enough this great fallacy still
dwells in the minds of the great majority of French people, and not
only in that of the uneducated.) I also enjoyed the abuse hurled at
our Henry VIII. His name was anathema both in <i>Histoire
Ecl&eacute;siastique</i> and in the <i>Histoire de France.</i></p>

<p>Here, too, we had the usual lessons in geography and arithmetic,
and to these kind nuns am I also indebted for their teaching of
<i>style &eacute;pistolaire</i>, the writing of letters to
imaginary correspondents, but now these letters were no longer very
simple, they were by way of being adapted to our developing
intelligence.</p>

<p>All the same I have often felt that the effort and the
discipline of attempting to write those letters have stood me in
the very good stead. I have always treasured a letter from my dear
friend, W. J. Locke, that charming stylist. I had asked him to do
something which he didn&rsquo;t want to do&mdash;give a lecture or
something of the sort&mdash;he was never fond of publicity. I
apparently wrote again and finally he consented, beginning his
letter with: &ldquo;You cunning writer of persuasive
epistles.&rdquo; I certainly have more often than not got what I
wanted by writing a &lsquo;persuasive epistle&rsquo; than by
lengthy interviews. And this I owe, I am sure, to those lessons in
<i>style &eacute;pistolaire</i> taught me by the artless and
na&iuml;ve teachers in the Convents of Brussels and Paris.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I was eight years old when my sister died, and just on fifteen
when my parents took the great and, for me, most momentous steps on
which, unknown then by me, the whole course of my life depended:
the decision to settle down in London for a time. As a matter of
fact I am rather vague as to why, or exactly when, they made that
decision. The intervening years of my girlhood were, as far as I
was concerned, uneventful, and there were no indications whatever
in my mind during that time of any tendency towards imaginative or
in fact any special kind of talent. Nor do I remember much of the
journey to England, except that my first experience of a sea-voyage
was a very unpleasant one.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing to do when one arrives in a foreign
country is to learn its language. Both my parents spoke English
after a fashion, enough at any rate to make themselves understood
by shop people or servants. But I knew not a word. After
consultation with the Austro-Hungarian Consul in London&mdash;who
was an old friend&mdash;it was decided that I should first be sent
to a small day school where I could pick up the first rudiments of
the language. There was one close to where we were living which was
kept by a German professor and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Pretorius,
and thither did I tramp with a maid in attendance, backwards and
forwards four times a day for six months. At the end of that time I
had a good working knowledge of English&mdash;good enough anyhow to
pass First Class the College of Preceptors examination with special
prize for foreign languages.</p>

<p>All that part of my life is very uninteresting, and I am not
tempted to talk about it. But there are one or two incidents
connected with that small day school kept by a German professor and
his wife on which I have often looked back with amusement. The
day&rsquo;s work always began with the singing, in chorus, of
German songs, some sentimental, others patriotic. Frau Pretorius
was at the piano and we sang: <i>Die Wacht am Rhein</i> and
<i>Andreas Hofer</i> and <i>Heil dir im Siegez Kranz</i> and so on.
Now, why? The school was, according to the prospectus, &lsquo;for
daughters of gentlemen only&rsquo;, and I was the only foreigner
among some twenty or thirty English young ladies. I suppose that
these English young ladies told their parents about the singing in
chorus of German patriotic songs, and that the parents did not mind
their joining in this. But I imagine that the German professor and
his wife knew what they were about when they made us sing <i>Die
Wacht am Rhein</i> as far back as 1887. Was it already propaganda?
I wonder? A foretaste of Dr. Goebbels? Quiet, insidious propaganda?
Perhaps. We certainly never sang &ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo;.
And we had lectures on German history from the days of Barbarossa
to the glorious victories of 1870-71 in the way that in Brussels
and Paris we had lectures on French history. I wonder if there are
any foreign schools on the continent where there are lectures on
English history.</p>

<p>One other amusing incident in connection with that funny little
school was that there was a kindergarten attached to it. Little
children ranging in age from four to six attended there. Among
these were two dear little dark-haired Jewish boys. They were Henry
and Landon Russel, and at the yearly school concert these two would
play four-handed pieces on the piano. I remember them in their
brown velvet suits, red stockings and laced-up boots, so earnest,
so sure of themselves, and so very, very good at the piano. Both
these little boys were well-known in later life in the musical
world, more especially the younger one Landon, who became the
famous composer and conductor of the Albert Hall Orchestra, Sir
Landon Ronald.</p>

</h2>

<p>&ldquo;She shall have music wherever she goes,&rdquo; says the
old rhyme. This I certainly did have, which makes me look upon the
first years we spent in England as my &lsquo;musical life&rsquo;.
Not that I was what is commonly called musical (the French have a
better word, <i>musicienne</i>). I was not <i>musicienne</i>,
though very fond of music as most people are&mdash;whether
intelligent or uneducated&mdash;but I had no aptitude for
it&mdash;to my real sorrow, for my want of musical enthusiasm
grieved my father I know. But I could not help it. Enthusiasm comes
naturally and from within, it cannot be commanded; and though it
was real joy to sit in the twilight and listen to my dear father
playing Schumann (his favourite composer) or Liszt, I must confess
that concerts rather bored me&mdash;classical concerts
especially.</p>

<p>My father tried very hard to develop what little talent I had,
and to train my voice, but I had no talent (so-called) and a very
poor ear for singing or the violin&mdash;which really is rather
queer because I have always been an exceptionally good linguist,
and before I reached my teens could already jabber in three
languages without the slightest trace of a foreign accent&mdash;and
this proves that the ear may be one of the factors, but not the
only one, of linguistic ability.</p>

<p>But this is by the way.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I really have no definite idea as to why my parents decided to
settle in London. They never intended to make a long stay, and they
often talked with each other as to what they would do and how they
would order their life when (not if) they finally returned to
Hungary. But they never did settle down in Hungary again. They
learned to love England&mdash;my father especially&mdash;just as I
did. He died in London, and was buried in Brussels by the side of
his little Madeleine whom he loved so dearly. But again I am
anticipating.</p>

<p>At the time that my parents went to London, intending to remain
there perhaps two or three years, I did not know one word of
English. There had never been an English governess in our house,
nor&mdash;what was very unusual in Hungary then&mdash;an English
groom in the stables of Tarna-&Ouml;rs or Tisza-Ab&aacute;d. My
mother&rsquo;s father, Count Wass, had been a great friend of the
Hungarian patriot, Louis Kossuth (who dreamed to be to Hungary what
Garibaldi had been to Italy: her champion and her liberator from
Austrian yoke.)</p>

<p>When Kossuth and his loyal army were crushed through the
intervention of the Russian army on the Austrian side, Kossuth was
obliged to flee the country, which he did on a British warship
placed at his disposal by his English admirers. Count Wass went
with him and together the two of them made their way to America
where they were welcomed with open arms. This was in 1848. Louis
Kossuth went round the States on a lecturing tour, while my
grandfather went to California in search of gold. Whether he found
it or not I know not; all I know is that he did not stay there
long, nor did he die a millionaire. He learned to speak English
fluently, and I suppose taught his wife and children to do the same
if not fluently, at any rate intelligibly.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Anyway, here we were in London, come from the wilds of Hungary,
from the banks of the Theisz to those of old Father Thames,
strangers in a strange land, but soon possessed of that inestimable
boon so quickly acquired by strangers in dear, hospitable
England&mdash;kind and loving friends. Already in Brussels the
foundation had been laid of one of those wonderful friendships of
which&mdash;as in the case of the Abb&eacute; Liszt&mdash;my
father&rsquo;s personality seemed to possess the secret. Old Mr.
Critchett, the surgeon, known throughout the scientific world as
the inventor of the operation for cataract was our first and most
devoted English friend. He had a daughter Amy whom he idolized. She
was married to a charming man of the name of Boursot, who was half
French. She was a most accomplished amateur musician and this no
doubt was the link that brought about the long, lasting friendship
between her parents and mine, and I imagine that it was probably
the influence of those dear friends that finally induced my parents
to settle in England for a prolonged stay. Indeed it was in London
that my father found full scope for the exercise and enjoyment of
his beloved art. Here, there were no pin-pricks or spiteful
criticisms to exacerbate the nerves of a sensitive artist. Dr.
Critchett and his daughter had a great number of musical friends
and soon the strangers from Hungary were made happy in the intimate
musical circles of London.</p>

<p>I daresay that these circles were not so &lsquo;highbrow&rsquo;
as those of Munich or Vienna, and continental sarcasm was always
levelled, then as now&mdash;at the obtuseness and Gothicism of the
English public; nevertheless, every artist who had made a name for
himself on the Continent of Europe did not feel that he had
attained the height of his ambition until he had earned the
approbation of the much maligned English public. Thus it was that
in the &rsquo;80&rsquo;s and the &rsquo;90&rsquo;s all the greatest
musicians of Europe were heard in London.</p>

<p>There were magnificent concerts in St. James&rsquo;s Hall (since
demolished), the new Philharmonic Concerts under the direction of
Dr. Wylde and Wilhelm Ganz, the orchestral concerts of Mme.
Viard-Louis under the leadership of Mr. Weist-Hill, the Saturday
concerts at the Crystal Palace conducted by Auguste Manns. Here,
too, the Handel festivals, where the magnificent organ and
perfectly trained chorus of three thousand singers soon became
world-renowned.</p>

<p>Then there were the ballad concerts where singers such as Sims
Reeves, Edward Lloyd, Antoinette Sterling, Signor Foli and
others&mdash;second to none&mdash;were constantly heard;
instrumental concerts, recitals of piano and violin when Norman
Neruda, Sarasate, Joachim, in fact all the great artistes of Europe
were heard. Paderewski, when still a young man and not yet
world-famous, gave two recitals in St. James&rsquo;s Hall because
one proved insufficient to accommodate his countless admirers. The
enthusiasm with which he was greeted and applauded was an event to
be remembered. When he had finished playing the audience rose as
one mass and swarmed up the platform, men as well as women, in the
hope of shaking him by the hand.</p>

<p>Edouard Grieg&mdash;such an enchanting
personality&mdash;conducted his Peer Gynt suite in St.
James&rsquo;s Hall. This was a remarkable occasion for those of us
who were present, because the composer&rsquo;s parents, simple old
Norwegians assisted at the performance. When they entered the hall
they received such an ovation that the very roof shook under the
terrific volume of sound. They looked so modest, so
unsophisticated, just children of Nature. They sat in the seats to
which they had been shown with respectful ceremonial, and there
they remained with their old hands clasped together and their eyes
fixed on their illustrious son. They could only see his back while
he was conducting, but when presently he bowed repeatedly in
response to the thunderous applause that came from all over the
house, we all noticed that the dear old couple wiped their
eyes&mdash;which were filled with tears of joy and of pride and
that the son&rsquo;s acknowledgment of the great honour that was
being done him was first and foremost directed towards them.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>All this goes to prove that London was artistically at least on
a level, as far as appreciation of genius was concerned, with great
musical centres like Munich and Vienna. My father, of course,
revelled in it all. This was an atmosphere in which he could
breathe and live the life which he loved; the life of an artist who
is understood and appreciated. Several of his works were performed
at these notable orchestral institutions, and he was always
honoured by the request from the <i>Chefs d&rsquo;orchestre</i>
that he should wield the bat&ocirc;n when his own compositions were
played. These were invariably received with whole-hearted applause
by the public and highly lauded by the Press, more especially the
overture, ballet, and other extracts from his Hungarian opera
<i>The Renegade</i>, which was subsequently produced at Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre under the Mapleson management.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the question of opera, and here I am bound to
admit that the taste of the English public, or I should say its
appreciation of this great expression of musical thought, was
decidedly on a lower level than that of the public in the important
capitals of Europe. Opera in London, in the final quarter of the
last century, still meant almost exclusively Italian opera with a
few French ones of established reputation thrown in; and after a
time <i>Lohengrin</i> and <i>Tannhauser</i>, introduced through the
influence of Hans Richter and the glamour of Bayreuth then at the
apogee of its appeal to the musical and fashionable world. But
opera in London was essentially a fashionable affair&mdash;like
Ascot and Goodwood. Its season was of short duration. Leaders of
fashion and <i>bon ton</i> led the way, and it was &lsquo;the
thing&rsquo; to display one&rsquo;s diamonds and Paris gowns in the
stalls and boxes before &lsquo;going on&rsquo; to some other
equally fashionable function.</p>

<p>Lady de Grey, as she was then, an acknowledged Queen of Beauty,
had hers on the grand tier facing the Royal box where the Prince
and Princess of Wales often graced the performance with their
presence. The Duchess of Montrose often &lsquo;looked in&rsquo;; so
did the beautiful Duchess of Manchester, and Lady Randolph
Churchill, whose beautiful black hair was always so much admired
and so exquisitely dressed. And among the less exalted personages
was Mrs. Sam Lewis with her pretty sister, that charming composer,
Hope Temple. Kind Mrs. Sam Lewis! The wife of the great lawyer
whose kindness and generosity to musicians who had not yet reached
fame and fortune was one of the most beautiful traits in her
generous nature. As a matter of fact, fashionable Jewry of London
was the main supporter of the opera; without it the season would
have been even shorter than it was and certainly less profitable to
the management.</p>

<p>Covent Garden was under the management of Ernest Gye, whose wife
was that lovely singer, Madame Albani, whose exquisite
&lsquo;Elsa&rsquo; helped to make <i>Lohengrin</i> popular on its
first presentation in London. As a matter of fact the trouble with
that fashionable clique which patronized the opera was that it
mistrusted its own taste. Give it an established
success&mdash;success in Vienna, Munich, or Paris&mdash;it would
take that opera to its heart and applaud it and patronize it with
whole-hearted enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Even so that enthusiasm hung fire sometimes, as in the case of
Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, which was received coolly by public
and Press and played to half-empty houses in consequence until
Messrs. Chappell&mdash;who had purchased the score at what was then
a very large sum of money&mdash;pushed the opera to success by dint
of clever publicity and advertising. Neither <i>Lohengrin</i> nor
<i>Tannhauser</i> were what would be called to-day an outstanding
success until after the fashionable throng had learned that the
King of Bavaria was madly in love (in the strict sense of the
words) with the works of Richard Wagner. It seemed then to shake
itself out of its intellectual lethargy, went to Bayreuth,
entertained Hans Richter at its parties, and went to his Wagner
concerts in St. James&rsquo;s Hall; acclaimed &lsquo;The Ride of
the Walkyries&rsquo; as the greatest orchestral composition of
their generation and demanded that the bridal march in
<i>Lohengrin</i> be substituted in future to the Mendelssohn
wedding march at fashionable weddings.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>This mistrust of its own taste in the matter of art&mdash;I
cannot call it anything else&mdash;was applied equally to the
singers of the same period. The <i>beau monde</i> had not yet
recovered from its exuberant admiration of Mario and Grisi who had
come to England with an international reputation. Mario to them was
just the god of music. No other singer could ever come, in their
estimation, within measurable distance of his charm, of his divine
voice, his superb acting, in fact, of his appeal to the ears and
hearts of his admirers. As for Grisi, she was just everything that
was perfect; and when Mario married Grisi and these two favourites
were heard together in <i>Rigoletto, Barbi&egrave;re, Traviata,</i>
or <i>Sonnambula</i> the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of musical exaltation
was reached.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible for those of our generation to
estimate the worth of those two artistes or of any executant of the
past for that matter. Their arts dies with them. Immortality is the
prerogative of the composer, the creator of the work interpreted by
the artistes. The art of Mario and Grisi may have reached the
height of perfection claimed for them by their own generation. It
is not for us to say. Certain it is that several years of endeavour
on the part of operatic managers went by and vast sums of money
were sacrificed before the rapture of a public mourning for its
idols was transferred to the great singers of the next generation.
This was accomplished by easy stages <i>via</i> Jenny Lind, Patti,
Christine Nilsson, and Albani, until the brothers de Reszke and
Melba were presently carried by public favour up to the same
pinnacles of fame and appreciation that had been the lot of Mario
and Grisi.</p>

<p>This pinnacle, by the way, was never reached by such fine
artistes as Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd. They were contemporaries
of the new favourites, but never quite reached the same height of
popularity. For one thing they never sang in opera. The public only
saw them on the concert platform or in their own drawing-rooms in
tailored clothes and white gloves. They had not the glamour
attached to rose-coloured or blue tights, padded trunk hose, and
rapier at the side. Moreover, they were both English and it was the
fashion to depreciate everything in art that was English. A form of
insularity I suppose which was more rampant in our parents&rsquo;
days than it is now. Antoinette Stirling, the finest contralto that
ever was, never attained the popularity enjoyed by Giulia Ravoli.
Even to-day. . . . Ah, well! I had perhaps better not say what I
think on that score.</p>

<p>So much for Covent Garden.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The second opera house, Her Majesty&rsquo;s (now His
Majesty&rsquo;s), was under the management of Mr. Mapleson, whose
genial personality and musical enthusiasm were greater than his
managerial flair. He did not pander as his rival did in Covent
Garden to the autocratic demands of a decorative audience. He
himself was satiated with the Trovatores and Barbi&egrave;res and
Lucias with the trills of eminent <i>divas</i> like Patti and Jenny
Lind, and persuaded himself that the public was as sick of the old
Italian operas as he was himself. He turned his attention to works
which had won approbation in the musical centres of Europe, even if
this approbation had not gone to the length of established
successes. But in this laudable endeavour he was not altogether
successful from a financial point of view.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="page032a" id="page032a"></a><br>

</p>

<p>He put up Boito&rsquo;s <i>Mefistofele</i> with Christine
Nilsson in the double r&ocirc;le of Marguerite and Helen of Troy:
also Rossini&rsquo;s last Italian opera, <i>Semiramide</i>, with
the same illustrious <i>diva</i> as the Babylonian queen. He
mounted Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Fidelio,</i> which had never been
heard in its entirety in England before or (I believe) since, and
Wagner&rsquo;s early work, <i>Rienza</i>, in England before with
&lsquo;new scenery, dress, and appointments&rsquo;. The public went
to the <i>premi&egrave;res</i>, listened politely, applauded
languidly, but failed to attend further performances of these works
until it was satisfied that they had attained European fame.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of this it is rather amusing to turn over
one&rsquo;s files for cuttings from old newspapers. I have a
cutting from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which graphically
illustrates what I have said. Speaking of Mr. Mapleson&rsquo;s
announcement for his forthcoming opera season, the great daily
said:</p>

<p class="note">&nbsp;Last year Mr. Mapleson announced the names of
three operas and bound himself to produce two of them. This year he
definitely promises one only, but as Rossini&rsquo;s
<i>Semiramide</i> is quite familiar the obligation will not excite
a great amount of enthusiasm even though it implies Madame
Christine Nilsson&rsquo;s assumption of the title-r&ocirc;le for
the first time. <i>Mefistofele</i>, we are told, will be &lsquo;a
comparative novelty&rsquo;, and the remark is quite true. The
prospectus then goes on to say: &lsquo;also a new grand opera in
three acts entitled <i>Il Rinnegato</i>, music by Baron
F&eacute;lix Orczy.&rsquo; Obscurity envelopes the precise
significance here of the word &lsquo;also&rsquo;. It follows the
assertion that <i>Mefistofele</i> will be &lsquo;a comparative
novelty&rsquo;, but this remark cannot apply to <i>Il
Rinnegato</i>, which has never been heard among us. The prospect of
the Baron&rsquo;s opera is therefore a vague one and we must wait
for the course of events to define it, cheered by the thought that
as <i>Il Rinnegato</i> was announced last year with no
&lsquo;cast&rsquo;, and is now reannounced in connection with the
name of Madame Gerster, one step forward has been taken. Looking at
the prospectus generally, from the absence of novelty, both as
regards operas and artistes, is very striking. From the repertoire
of the house, however, it is easy to select old works <i>that make
new ones superfluous.</i> Here are a few of them: <i>Il
Barbi&egrave;re, Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Faust, Fidelio,
Il Flauto Magica, Lohengrin, Oberon,</i> and <i>Aida.</i></p>

<p>Not very encouraging for the manager striving to give the public
something new that will please it, and do not the final sentences
of this summary bear out the truth of what I have endeavoured to
say about the taste of the fashionable public? &lsquo;From the
repertoire of the house, however it is easy to select old works
<i>that make new ones superfluous</i>!&rdquo;<br>

<p align="center"><img src="2000341h-images/page033.jpg" alt=""
width="548" height="750">
</p>

<p>Anyway, Mr. Mapleson was true to his prospectus and duly
produced my father&rsquo;s Hungarian opera <i>Il Rinnegato</i>,
dedicated to H. M. the Queen of the Belgians, herself a Hungarian
princess. Everything Hungarian happened to be the rage in London
just then, principally gipsy music, of which more anon, and the
audience received the work with loud applause. It even deigned to
fill the house at two more performances. But it brought no money to
the box office and Mapleson had, in any event, decided to give up
management for good. He was, and remained&mdash;even after this
failure&mdash;a genuine friend of my father&rsquo;s and in his
<i>Memoirs</i> published a year or two later, he spoke most warmly
of him and with unstinted admiration of the originality and
splendid orchestrations of <i>Il Rinnegato.</i></p>

<p>His son, Henry, was the husband of that beautiful woman and
charming singer, Marie Roze. It had been her great wish to sing in
<i>Il Rinnegato</i>, but the soprano part was too high and too
florid for her lovely soft mezzo-soprano voice. It was finally sung
by Emma Juch, a young American singer with a high flexible soprano
like that of Marie Van Zandt. That veteran of choreographic art,
Kati Lanner, directed the ballet, as she had done for several
seasons at Her Majesty&rsquo;s. She was a dear old lady and put her
very heart and soul into the production, not only because she was
Hungarian but also because she had worked at one time under my
father&rsquo;s directorate in the National Opera of Budapest. She
knew better than anyone how a Hungarian
<i>cs&agrave;rd&agrave;s</i> should be danced. The
<i>premi&egrave;re danseuse</i> was Madame Malvina Cavalazzi, the
wife of Charles Mapleson, the manager&rsquo;s second son.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>There were one or two incidents&mdash;one of which might have
ended in tragedy&mdash;which occurred during the rehearsals and
production of <i>Il Rinnegato</i>. The principal r&ocirc;le in the
opera was the baritone, and was sung by a fine Italian singer,
Signor Galassi. My father conducted his opera in person. There was
also a part for tenor voice and this was entrusted to Signor
Ravelli. From the first this otherwise accomplished singer objected
strongly to certain passages in the score when the baritone was
more prominent on the stage than he was. Such an unheard-of thing,
argued Signor Ravelli. The tenor must&mdash;absolutely must, he
declared&mdash;always hold the stage and the baritone take second
place whatever the dramatic situation might be. It had always been
so ever since Italy had given the lead in opera to the whole of
Europe.</p>

<p>When in the last act the tenor named Elem&eacute;r is actually
killed by the baritone Barnabas on the steps of the metropolitan
church of Budapest, Signor Ravelli flatly refused to die on those
steps which were at the back of the stage and insisted on a marble
seat being placed in a prominent position close to the footlights
where he could be seen by everyone in the audience to expire
gracefully and comfortably. Even then he greatly objected that the
composer had omitted to give him a special aria to sing with his
dying breath, as in <i>Trovatore</i> and all other really great
operas.</p>

<p>However, the marble seat being conceded, there was further
trouble, further vandalism with regard to the rights and privileges
of a tenor in grand opera. This was a question of boots. Yes,
boots! Hungarian national costume, gorgeous and picturesque as it
was, demanded among other articles of attire . . . <i>boots</i>.
Now, argued Signor Ravelli, in grand opera no tenor had ever been
known to wear other than slashed square-toed satin shoes. In vain
was it pointed out to him that in this last act Elem&eacute;r was
returning from the battle-field against the Turks and that slashed
satin shoes would be a hopeless anachronism seeing that he was
supposed to have been riding, let alone the fact that those same
shoes never formed a part of Hungarian national costume. Signor
Ravelli remained obdurate. It was beneath the dignity of a tenor to
appear in boots. This sounds incredible I know, but it is true
nevertheless.</p>

<p>I remember the controversy about the boots to this day: and in
connection with it I am tempted to recall Hans von B&uuml;low, the
great German <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestre</i>, second to none, not
even to Richter, who said on one occasion when in exasperation
after a difference of opinion with a Wagnerian tenor, Schott:
&ldquo;Bah! a tenor is not a man; a tenor is a disease!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus did Elem&eacute;r the Hungarian hero die at the hand of
Barnabas the Renegade, on a marble seat in the centre of the stage,
wearing rose-coloured slashed shoes such as were befitting the
majesty of an Italian tenor. I must admit, however, that I doubt if
more than a dozen among the audience noticed the anachronism in
costume or scenic effect.</p>

<p>The other incident&mdash;which unlike the question of marble
seats and satin shoes might have ended in a terrible
tragedy&mdash;occurred during the second performance of <i>Il
Rinnegato.</i> There was a snow scene in the third act, snow being
represented by cotton wool rather lavishly scattered over trees and
protruding masonry. How it all happened I know not. My mother and I
with a couple of friends were in a grand-tier box facing the
stage&mdash;Mr. Mapleson was with us and Dr. Hueffer the musical
critic of <i>The Times</i>&mdash;when suddenly there was a blaze: a
piece of cotton wool had caught fire. One of the performers had to
come out of a house with a lighted candle in her hand. There was a
sudden draught and the nearest bit of cotton wool blazed up. Almost
immediately afterwards one heard from some part of the house the
ominous word &lsquo;Fire&rsquo;, and the word was repeated, first
here and there, first in the gallery, then in the lower tiers;
&lsquo;Fire . . . Fire . . .&rsquo; and one heard the tramping of
feet accompanying that awful, terrifying word. . . .</p>

<p>I cannot imagine anything more appalling than those words which
first spoken in a whisper grew in a few seconds into a dull
cry.</p>

<p>Panic! That most terrible of all catastrophes was threatening;
though it was not yet there, it threatened. But in an instant a
couple of scene-shifters had run out and trampled under foot the
blazing bit of cotton wool even before the greater portion of the
audience had realized the terrible danger that was ahead. My mother
and I kept our eyes fixed on my father who stood in the midst of
the orchestra, with bat&ocirc;n raised, entirely unmoved. I
don&rsquo;t remember what my feelings were with regard to any
possible cataclysm. I only thought of my father and that since he
was so motionless and calm nothing serious could happen. And
nothing did. The audience soon realized that all danger was past. A
few I think had made their way out of the house down the stone
steps which led from the gallery into the street, but in the stalls
and boxes and in the third tier balcony men stood up and clapped
their hands to reassure the rest of the audience that all was
well.</p>

<p>Mr. Mapleson in his <i>Memoirs</i> gives a spirited account of
the whole incident. In it he declares that it was my father&rsquo;s
coolness in face of the danger which was chiefly instrumental in
averting the panic. It kept the members of the orchestra in their
place, their hands on their instruments ready to follow on. As a
matter of fact quite a large section of the audience never knew
that anything so awful and so threatening had occurred. But it
seems strange that already twice in my life I had been on the
threshold of a gigantic cataclysm caused by fire, first at
Tisza-Ab&aacute;d, and then in Her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre,
London.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>There is one element in music which I think cannot be denied,
and it is this: music is the most absorbing of all the arts. It
absorbs the mind of the artist, whether creator or executant, to
the exclusion of every other consideration outside his own
immediate necessities or desires. It is essentially a selfish art
more so than any other&mdash;with perhaps the exception of the
dramatic&mdash;simply because it depends for the success of its
presentation on the outside public. And the public being capricious
and influenced by the fashion of the moment will only acclaim one
artiste or composer to the detriment of others. Hence a musician,
artiste, or composer, must look to himself to attain pre-eminence,
and can only do so by thrusting his own merits forward constantly
into the public eye. He must first and foremost think of his own
worth, his own success or failure. To help another to attain the
pinnacle of fame to which he aspires might lead to neglect of his
own worth. Hence what for want of a better term I will call the
selfishness of the musician.</p>

<p>The same also applies to dramatic art, of which more anon. I was
only thinking of music for the moment. In my close association with
musicians&mdash;the great as well as the lesser&mdash;I have only
come across two exceptions to this generalization; but these two
exceptions are as brilliant as the stars. I am thinking, firstly,
of Franz Liszt, who spent years of his life and used every
influence he possessed to further the success of every musician
whom he thought worthy. It was entirely due to his indefatigable
exertions, his indomitable courage and belief in the greatness of
Richard Wagner that the latter&rsquo;s works, after repeated
failures and disappointments, came at last to be appreciated at
their true value.</p>

<p>Secondly, here in England we had that universal favourite and
delightful personality Sir Arthur Sullivan. His kindness and
consideration to young and old musicians was beyond what mere words
can express, and there are many to this day who owe what success
and fortune they attained to the help he so generously tendered
them.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Liszt&rsquo;s two visits to this country were a great joy to us.
He stayed, I believe, on both occasions with his friend Walter
Bache, a fine accomplished musician and charming personality. But
the dear old man spent many a long day with us in our house in
Wimpole Street and in the afternoon, tired as he must often have
been with social and artistic duties, he would sit at the piano and
let his lovely slender fingers bring forth heaven-born melodies
from the keys. Besides our three selves there would only be two, or
perhaps three, devotees privileged to listen to him on those
occasions. He would play Schumann, Schubert, and his own
compositions.</p>

<p>I say it again&mdash;I am not in any sense of the word musical,
that Liszt&rsquo;s playing of Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Kinderscenen</i>
remains for me unforgettable. He never played any of his
<i>bravura</i> compositions but always simple things which left one
dreaming and with tears in one&rsquo;s eyes. When he had finished
he would turn to us all who sat enthralled around him and say in
his exquisitely modulated voice: &ldquo;Now you must hear my
beloved pupil (meaning my father) play one of his own compositions.
He makes the piano sing.&rdquo; He was always very sweet to me, a
rather dull and stupid schoolgirl, and called me <i>ma
po&eacute;sie,</i> saying that young girls were the poetry of life;
and when he had lunch or dinner with us and I was privileged to
take him down to the dining-room, he said, resting his beautiful
hand on my arm: <i>&rdquo;Vous-&ecirc;tes mon soutien
spirituellement et physiquement.&rdquo;</i> (You are my physical
and mental support.)</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>What a lot there is in a hand as an indication of artistic or
otherwise temperament. In contrast to Liszt&rsquo;s slender hands
with the long, pointed fingers and almond-shaped nails, I recall
the hand of Anton Rubinstein. A great admirer of his had a cast of
it in plaster. How different it was. He was undoubtedly a very
great artist and powerful personality, with a reverberating voice
and dominating presence. He was gruff in his speech and
contemptuous of fine manners and elegant diction. He certainly did
not make the piano sing&mdash;not to my humble taste anyhow, but he
certainly made it vibrate and with those powerful spatulate fingers
of his he could evoke from the piano sounds as sonorous as a full
orchestra. His execution was of course superb, and with the
exception of List the Incomparable he was certainly the finest
pianist of his generation. His appeal to the great public was more
universal even than that of Paderewski. He never came to our house
but he played at the house of a friend at whose musical &lsquo;at
homes&rsquo; I was allowed once or twice to attend under the
&aelig;gis of my father.</p>

<p>I specially remember one of these occasions being at the moment
that we entered the music room Rubinstein was standing by the
piano, talking to a group of his admirers, and I heard his deep
gruff voice saying in German: <i>&rdquo;Ich bin ein Jude&rdquo;</i>
(I am a Jew). He proclaimed it in a note almost of triumph and I,
an unsophisticated Hungarian, remembering that over in Hungary to
proclaim oneself a Jew would be equal to admitting that one
belonged to an altogether inferior race, wondered how any great
artist could so far humiliate himself as to make such an
admission.</p>

<p>Since then what a number of Jews I have known and admired for
their intellect, their artistic perceptions, their high moral
character and really Christian charity!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Very charming and fascinating was Charles Gounod, who came to
London after his <i>Faust</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> had at
long last become real and popular successes. Clever, energetic Mrs.
Weldon had a great deal to do with pushing the success home, ably
seconded of course by Messrs. Chappel, the publishers of the music.
I remember his being asked on one occasion when he sat at the piano
and allowed his fingers to wander idly over the keys (he was never
a brilliant pianist): &ldquo;Oh! Monsieur Gounod,&rdquo; cooed a
fair admirer, &ldquo;do tell me how your composing is going on?
What do you think of those lovely melodies which Madame Nilsson
sings so divinely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was one of those na&iuml;ve questions which are apt to be so
irritating to artists who are often at a loss to answer in a way
that would not sound either imbecile or pedantic. But Charles
Gounod, being one hundred per cent a Frenchman, was never at a loss
for a pretty speech. He just turned his fine eyes on the charmer
and said: &ldquo;God, Madame, sends me down some of his angels and
they whisper sweet melodies in my ear.&rdquo; And this sounded
neither pedantic nor imbecile. It sounded so true. When one thought
of the exquisite melodies in <i>Faust</i> or <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>, one felt in very truth that his inspiration came from
the angels above.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I also recall another interesting and original
personality&mdash;Peter Benoit, the great Flemish composer who came
to London (as they all did) to conduct his <i>Rubens Cantata</i>
and his <i>Charlotte Corday</i> at two grand concerts given in his
honour in the Albert Hall. He certainly was an original. He stayed
with us in Wimpole Street and I am sure my kind, hospitable parents
must have been thankful in their hearts when his visit came to an
end. He was by birth a simple Flemish peasant and everyone honoured
him for that, but even in his own native Belgium he must have been
a very trying friend and guest. He was director of the great
Academy of Music and the Fine Arts in Antwerp and at times, to the
consternation of pupils and fellow professors, he would just
disappear&mdash;go off into the open country..</p>

<p>No one ever knew where he went to, but he would stay away days
and sometimes weeks, living no one knew how, apparently quite
oblivious of his duties at the Academy. It was supposed that his
parents lived somewhere in the hinterland and that he went to visit
them whenever the spirit of filial love moved him. And presently he
would return and take up his duties&mdash;his lectures on Fine Art
and &AElig;stheticism were, I believe, delightfully
interesting&mdash;just as if he had never been absent from his
post.</p>

<p>As to his stay with us in Wimpole Street, all I recollect about
it is that he only ate one meal a day&mdash;at five o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon&mdash;a terrific meal which must have tried our
domestic staff very sorely. I know it tried me, as I am sure my
dear mother must have been greatly troubled to concoct the right
menu and in sufficient quantity for our guest.</p>

<p>The morning and early part of the afternoon were devoted to
rehearsals in the Albert Hall, and during the interval&mdash;after
the copious dinner and bedtime which was quite early&mdash;Benoit
liked to sit on the sofa in the drawing-room with eyes closed,
listening to his own compositions played to him by Mme Boursot. He
made me sit beside him and put his arm round my shoulders and
murmured repeatedly: &ldquo;<i>J&rsquo;aime tant qu&rsquo;on me
joue ma musique&rdquo;</i> (I love to listen to my own music), and
I do believe that he loved his own compositions more than those of
any other master, and that to listen to them was the great joy of
his life.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6" id="Chapter6"></a>Chapter

<p>But I must not forget that there was also a lighter side to our
musical life in London: the social life there was, for Hungarians,
extremely pleasant. Count Aloysius Karolyi was Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador. He and his beautiful wife entertained lavishly in their
splendid house in Belgrave Square. They were both entirely
Hungarian by birth and tradition and great friends of my parents.
Their eldest daughter, Nandine, was of my own age and a very
charming friend to me. She subsequently married Count Berchtold,
who was Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs at the
outbreak of the 1914-1918 war and had unaccountably made himself
scarce at that critical moment.</p>

<p>Count Karolyi&rsquo;s predecessor had been old Count Beust, as
fanatically Austrian as Count Karolyi was Hungarian. Count Beust
had been one of the Members of the Congress held in Vienna in 1815
to decide the fate of Europe after the final downfall of Napoleon
Bonaparte.</p>

<p>The Prince and Princess of Wales often graced Countess
Karolyi&rsquo;s receptions with their presence. My father and
mother were always invited to these splendid gatherings and before
the death of my father, when once I was &lsquo;out&rsquo; and had
been presented to our own Empress Elisabeth, I was also
invited.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Often now through the mist of years I see floating before my
mind faces that were familiar there. Beautiful faces, interesting
faces. There was such an array of beauties in those days, such
beauties as have never graced London drawing-rooms since. It is
difficult to recall them all; they were quite dazzling: The duchess
of Leinster, the Countess of Warwick, two of the most beautiful
women I have ever seen, Mrs. Cornwallis West, the Marchioness of
Bath and her beautiful daughter, afterwards Countess Cromer, and so
many others.</p>

<p>An interesting personality was Maria, Marchioness of Ailesbury,
familiarly called &lsquo;Lady Aye&rsquo;, very thin and always very
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;e.</i> Count Bylandt, Netherlands
Minister, and his Russian wife&mdash;who were great friends of my
parents&mdash;were both very fond of music and gave many
musical-at-homes in their beautiful house in Grosvenor Gardens.</p>

<p>I stood quietly in the shadow of my beautiful mother for the
most part, gazing with awe and wonder at this brilliant assembly of
the flower of European aristocracy and diplomatic circles. Frankly
I did not enjoy the pageants. Sometimes I was even bored.</p>

<p>I suffered from what would now be called inferiority complex. To
myself I appeared as such an insignificant, mediocre personage
among so many clever and brilliant people with whom (to my
thinking) nobody could possibly dare to enter into conversation. I
was not pretty or dashing. I was dull, I was shy, and I
didn&rsquo;t feel that anyone who was clever and interesting would
take the trouble to entertain me or make themselves agreeable to
me. As a matter of fact the origin of the whole trouble&mdash;for
it was real trouble sometimes&mdash;went back to those awful
afternoons in Tarna-&Ouml;rs when under the command of my
autocratic grandmother and in the company of a lot of German
cousins, all sitting silent, disapproving, and plying their
crochet-hooks, I had been ordered to &lsquo;make
conversation&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And so I remained shy and dull through the whole of my girlhood.
I certainly, as a girl, was not a social success. My dear father
did his best to chaff me out of that frame of mind; and my mother,
so beautiful and very much admired, took me out with her as often
as she could so as to get me accustomed to Society and to going
about among friends of my own age and education, but I never got
over my dislike of crowded and showy functions.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;The only big function I really enjoyed (though why I did
more than another I cannot say: was when the Archduke Rudolf of
Austro-Hungary, only son and heir of the Emperor Francis Joseph,
paid a visit to Queen Victoria. The Hungarian colony in London took
the opportunity of organizing a grand reception in his honour at
which he graciously signified his intention to be present. This was
the era when Hungarian Gipsy music was all the rage in every
capital of Europe, and the finest of the gipsy bands headed by
Berkes was &lsquo;doing&rsquo; a season in London that year. So
they were engaged as a matter of course to play at this reception
and I&mdash;poor, shy, little atom&mdash;had the honour of dancing
the national <i>cs&agrave;rd&agrave;s</i> with His Imperial and
Royal Highness.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I am quite certain in my own mind that
&lsquo;shyness&rsquo; is only a manifestation of
self-consciousness. We would never suffer from it, any of us, if we
did not think of ourselves and of the impression which we are
making on others.</p>

<p>Certain it is that when on that unforgettable occasion I was the
cynosure of all eyes I did not feel the least bit shy. The Archduke
danced the <i>cs&agrave;rd&agrave;s</i> as no other non-Hungarian
has ever danced it to my knowledge, and that in the mazes of the
quick movement, twirling and twisting with his hands on my waist
and mine on his shoulder and in the languorous steps of the
<i>lass&uacute;</i> I was conscious of nothing except the pleasure
of the music and of the dancing. And my exalted partner was so
handsome, so gracious, and so simple that when he conducted me back
to my mother&rsquo;s side he kissed my hand and thanked me for the
pleasure I had given him.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to
the throne of the Hapsburgs, was never partial to Hungary and the
Hungarians, and in moments of conflict between them and the Slav
elements of the empire, his sympathies invariably inclined towards
the latter. It was during the following year that the terrible
tragedy of Mayerling occurred which has remained, and always will
remain, one of the mysteries of history. Quantities of paper and
pints of ink have been wasted on so-called authentic elucidations
of the mystery that surrounded the death of the young Archduke and
Marie Vetsera. Not one of these elucidations is the true one.</p>

<p>A guard of honour composed of six members of the highest
Austro-Hungarian aristocracy stood sentry around the bier whereon
reposed the mortal remains of the heir to the great Empire. These
six were relieved every twelve hours by six others of equal rank,
and the duties of these twelve gentlemen were carried on during the
whole of the slow progress from Mayerling to Vienna until the heir
to the throne was laid to his final rest in the vault of the
Capuchin Friars in that city. They alone hold the key to the
mystery: they and the Duke Philip of Coburg Koh&aacute;ry, who was
at Mayerling at the time of the tragedy, husband of Princess Louise
of Belgium, whose sister, Stephanie, was the wife of the Archduke
Rudolf.</p>

<p>Many of those who formed the guard of honour are dead now: they
were middle-aged men at the time. One of them was a first cousin of
my father&rsquo;s and came to London with his son to see us. He
often talked to my father about the appalling tragedy, and declared
that he had embodied it in all its details in memoirs which were
not to be published until fifty years after his death. He died in
1907! . . .</p>

<p>Marie Vetsera I knew in the way that everybody knew everybody
else in Budapest those days, but never well. She was older than I
was for one thing, and her ways and speech were not approved of by
the mamas of we younger ones. She was beautiful in a quasi-oriental
way: dark hair, large dark eyes, full red lips (one didn&rsquo;t
use lipsticks yet), and an oval face. In these days of fashionable
emaciation her figure would have been called coarse. She certainly
had a prominent bust which was very much admired then (flat-chested
girls stuffed cotton-wool pads inside their corsets).</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;The tragedy of Mayerling was a shattering blow to the old
Emperor Francis Joseph and the beautiful Empress Elisabeth. Lovely
as she was, she had been unhappy in Austria from the first. Her
Imperial husband was possessed of a huge heart which embraced many
ladies who, though they could not rival the Empress in beauty, more
than overshadowed her somewhat limited intelligence by their
amusing conversation and vivacious small talk. She certainly was
one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, but there was
always a look of sadness in her lovely eyes. The great joy of her
life was the hunting season in Ireland. As long as her health and
her age allowed it she went every year. My father&rsquo;s brother,
who was her Master of the Horse, often accompanied her. There are
many in England and Ireland to this day who, I am sure, remember
her as one of the finest horsewomen and a keen follower of hounds
whom they knew in their hunting days.</p>

<p>She used to stay at Claridge&rsquo;s in London on her way to
Ireland. My cousin, Countess Marie Festetics, was her <i>dame
d&rsquo;honneur</i>, and I had the honour of being presented to the
Empress who said some very charming things to me about England and
the English, and also about the Hungarians who loved her and
whom&mdash;unlike her husband and her son&mdash;she understood and
admired. She was one of the very few non-Hungarians who spoke that
very difficult language perfectly and this endeared her specially
to her Hungarian entourage. Her end, and the hand of an assassin,
was as tragic as that of her son.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But to return to what I have called the lighter side of our
musical life in London.</p>

<p>Certainly the lightest and merriest of all was the
&lsquo;Hungarian Band&rsquo;, the gipsy music which at the end of
the nineteenth century had literally taken London by storm. Since
then the term &lsquo;Hungarian Band&rsquo; has been falsely used
and vulgarized. Any band of fiddlers who chose to call themselves
Hungarian and arrayed themselves in gaudy attire was dubbed
Hungarian band and obtained engagements to play in restaurants,
tea-shops, and night-clubs. But the fiddlers were not always
Hungarian and certainly never true gipsies. Many a time did my
father speak to their leader and discovered that they were German
or some sort of Slav, but not Hungarian. But when Berkes and his
true gipsies first visited the capitals of Europe they were a
revelation of something unusual, exotic, something wild and yet
soothing. They were an inspiration and an incentive.</p>

<p>Berkes, as soon as he arrived in London, came to pay his
respects to my parents, and thereafter he and his men often came to
play for us of an evening, and if any Hungarian friends were
visiting London at the time they would come and spend the evening
with us and listen to the <i>tsiganes</i> in an atmosphere that was
more in keeping with their music than the fashionable &lsquo;at
homes&rsquo; or restaurants. What amused us very much was the
social success of these fellows. In Hungary the gipsies have no
position whatever, not even with the peasants in the villages, let
alone with the middle and upper classes. They were just
<i>czig&aacute;ny</i> and their status was not unlike that of the
coloured races in the estimation of Americans. But in the European
capitals they were put on an equality with all the other artistes
who delighted the world with their music. They were received as
guests in the highest society, invited to dinner, f&ecirc;ted, and
acclaimed as Sarasate or Joachim or opera singers were
acclaimed.</p>

<p>In London, Berkes on his first visit was the lion of the season.
And he was not a little proud of his social success. It was an
exceptionally brilliant season. More than one European monarch and
hereditary prince happened to be on a visit to Queen Victoria: and
I remember Berkes, puffed up with pride, giving to my parents a
glowing account of a dinner-party at a ducal house at which he and
his band had been guests. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he declared with more
imagination than veracity, &ldquo;there we sat, one king, one
gipsy, one king, one gipsy, two queens two gipsies next to another
all round the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Not for worlds would I wish to say a single word of depreciation
on the subject of true gipsy musicians. Much has been written about
the origin of their music. It has even been ascribed to the ancient
Egyptians, and at one time dear old Liszt made himself very
unpopular in his native land by declaring that there was no such
thing as Hungarian music. It was neither more nor less than gipsy
(<i>i.e.</i> Romany) music. Certain it is that music is inborn in
the gipsy and it is well known that when a small Romany child is
born and begins to toddle the father stands before him holding in
his right hand a fiddle and in his left a piece of money. The child
puts out its little arms in the direction of one side or the other.
If to the right he will be a musician; if to the left he will be a
thief. The Hungarian peasant will tell you with a shrug that in all
probability he will be both. I am, of course, speaking of Hungarian
gipsies whom I knew in their own native land. I have never known
anything about other Romanies in England or elsewhere in
Europe.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that a gipsy musician is entirely
untutored. He is never taught to play. He plays his violin,
clarinet, and the <i>czimbalom</i> (his national instrument)
entirely by ear. The syncopated rhythm comes naturally to his
fingers. Their leader will be taught some new tune composed,
perhaps, by a cultivated musician who will hum it to him; after a
few bars the leader will take up the tune and play it, then turn to
his band and they will all fall in with as perfect an orchestration
as could possibly be devised. Berkes, Rig&oacute;, and R&aacute;cz
were the three finest gipsy leaders of exceptionally admirable
bands. But Berkes was always the most popular in London&mdash;as he
was in Budapest. His tone on the violin, whether he played
languorous songs or exciting dance music, was exquisitely pure.</p>

<p>There were several enthusiastic musicians&mdash;ladies, for the
most part&mdash;who offered him large sums of money for his violin,
which they believed was a Gubernatis or a Stradivarious at their
best so perfect was its tone, and Berkes without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation would assent to the bargain, hand over the violin and
receive the money. And the same incident would occur again a few
days afterwards when he was playing on another violin bought
surreptitiously at Hill&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>London remained faithful to Berkes for two or three years. I,
for one, lost sight of him and his fashionable career after the
death of my dear father in 1892. Neither R&aacute;cz nor
Rig&oacute; came to London. The former was a great favourite in
Paris, and the latter in Brussels&mdash;where a very great lady
fell madly in love with him. He was exceptionally handsome in a
gipsy way and so inflamed the passion of the lady that when he had
completed his engagements and returned to his home in Hungary she
ran away with him.</p>

<p>This story sounds sordid enough; but one cannot help thinking,
with a shudder, of the awful disappointment which awaited this
high-born lady when she realized the sordidness of the surroundings
into which her insane passion had thrown her. The vulgar crowd with
whom she was forced to associate, the brutality and iron hand of
the old woman who was the mother of her chosen lord, the countless
humiliations to which she was subjected must have been unspeakable
torture to the poor woman&rsquo;s soul and mind. I don&rsquo;t know
what happened to the poor thing in the end, but I do believe that
she was able to get away after a time and to return to her home in
Belguim.</p>

</h2>

<p>Ever since I was &lsquo;grown-up&rsquo; I had a great love of
the theatre, and happily my mother was very fond of it too, and as
my father did not really care about it she always took me with her.
We went very often, especially during those many months when there
was no opera either at Covent Garden or Her Majesty&rsquo;s. We
went to many first nights, and never missed a production at the
Lyceum or the old Princess&rsquo; Theatre in Oxford Street. Those
were my two favourites. For these pleasures we were chiefly
indebted to our kind old friend, George Critchett. His younger son
was a well-known member of the theatrical profession, and he
himself had many patients among the theatrical folk whom he always
attended without there being any question of fees.</p>

<p>Thus he had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to every theatre in London.
A box was always placed at his disposal for first nights, or
whenever he wished to go, and as neither his wife who was an
invalid, nor his daughter whose tastes ran entirely on serious
music cared for the theatre, my mother and I benefited by his
kindness.</p>

<p>Looking back on those pleasant evenings one realizes, however,
that there was not much on the English stage during the last
quarter of the nineteenth century to stimulate, let alone to
improve, one&rsquo;s taste in the art of the theatre. With the
exception of the Lyceum, where under the management of Mrs. Bateman
and subsequently that of Henry Irving, Shakespeare and a few poetic
dramas were presented, one had very little wherewith to satisfy
one&rsquo;s craving for intellectual pleasure, for something that
would make one think.</p>

<p>The era of the great Samuel Phelps and of Fechter was past and
all one had, with the above exception, was either blatant melodrama
or else French farce adapted to the demands of a nicely-behaved
modest English audience. I didn&rsquo;t care. I liked it all. I
liked the evenings at the theatre far more than the gorgeous
parties and receptions&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t have to talk and make
myself agreeable. I could just sit quietly gaze and
<i>think.</i></p>

<p>The poetic dramas of W. G. Wills appealed to me. <i>Charles
I</i> (oh! how I cried over the final &lsquo;Remember&rsquo;,
spoken in Irving&rsquo;s beautifully modulated voice); his
adaptation of <i>Faust</i> with Irving as an unapproachable Mefisto
(who else could have looked the part as he did? tall, lean,
sinister); and <i>Vanderdecken</i>, with Irving looking handsome
and romantic in a large picture hat; and then giving us, by way of
a contrast, Digby Grant in the <i>Two Roses</i>. All these plays
which would be thought so very <i>vieux jeu</i> now will always
dwell in one&rsquo;s memory. I know they do so in mine.</p>

<p>And presently lovely Ellen Terry came along to charm us as
Irving&rsquo;s leading lady and brought to us, along with her
adorable self, those beautiful performances of <i>The Merchant of
Venice,</i> of <i>Much Ado about Nothing,</i> of <i>Macbeth</i> (to
name only a few of those unforgettable evenings). Not much to
complain of you will say in the matter of dramatic art. But man
cannot feed on caviar alone, nor his intellectual aspirations on
Shakespeare and W. G. Wills. Not that my aspirations were very
intellectual. The theatre was a pleasure for me, not an education.
Being still very young I liked to think of myself as a dramatic
critic, just for my own edification.</p>

<p>Not even to my indulgent mother would I have imparted my
criticisms on any play we had seen together or those we had wept
over and laughed at in the right places. But when I saw a play
which did not altogether please me, I used to turn the main
situation (usually the third act) over and over in my mind and
think out how it should have been dealt with in the last act. What
cheek!!! Fortunately I had the good sense to keep these incursions
into dramatic criticism to myself.</p>

<p>On the whole I must admit that I was not passionately in love
with the theatre. Not then. Not ever. Not even when . . . but that
is another story which I will tell at full length later on. For the
time being I had no idea that our friendship with Mr. And Mrs.
George Critchett and their connection with the theatrical world was
yet another link in that long chain which drew me originally out of
the country of my birth, then through my musical life in London,
through my short artistic career to the conception of <i>The
Scarlet Pimpernel</i>.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Almost as great a joy for me as the theatre were the evening
receptions given by Mr. And Mrs. Critchett in their delightful
house in Harley Street. Here one met and rubbed shoulders with most
of the stars that shone in the dramatic and musical firmament. Some
of these only twinkled then, their brilliance came later on. I was
never quite so shy here as I was in the big official
<i>soir&eacute;es</i> in Belgravia and Mayfair. The atmosphere was
more to my liking and I had many a quiet talk with some of the
clever men and women who were kind enough to take notice of the
insignificant flapper. My snobbishness (aren&rsquo;t we all?) took
the form of admiration not for beauty or wealth or great historic
names, but for the men and women whom I met here who had attained
recognition by their talent, and I was quite happy to be standing
by, lost in amazement at seeing people of such outstanding merit in
every walk of life gathered together and conversing and joking one
with the other as if they were mere ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>To my mind they were anything but that. Indeed it seemed to me
that these celebrities had about them an air that lifted them high
above all men and women I had ever seen. I simply worshipped merit
that had attained renown. I am not sure that this snobbishness was
not based on envy, a vague longing to attain fame somehow or other.
The question that agitated my mind was: how was this to be done? I
had no idea then, only vague senseless dreams. All I knew for
certain was that it was not going to be musical.</p>

<p>So much has been written and such delightful memoirs published
on and about the dramatic world and its outstanding personalities
that there is nothing new that I can relate on that interesting
subject. Nor did I know those distinguished people intimately
enough to throw fresh light on their private or professional
lives&mdash;anecdotes, stories, witticisms&mdash;that have not
already been told and retold by such charming writers as
&lsquo;Carados&rsquo; (Mr. Chance Newton of the <i>Referee</i>),
George R. Sims, and many others, but I did enjoy seeing them all,
laughing and joking together, away from &lsquo;make-up&rsquo; and
far from the footlights.</p>

<p>And just as through the mists of bygone years I see floating
before my mind faces young and beautiful, personalities which were
world-renowned, shoulders that bore the burden of historic
names&mdash;all spirit now for the most part&mdash;so I often see
when I gaze into the dying embers of the fire, forms and faces that
enchanted my unsophisticated inner self.</p>

<p>I remember seeing William Terriss as Romeo at the Lyceum with
lovely Adelaide Nielson as Juliet. The scenery was as it always had
been at the Lyceum, most beautiful and quite accurate in its
representation of an old Italian garden in the balcony scene.
Indeed, one might have fancied oneself in Verona, with the lovely
Italian midnight sky as a background to trees and shrubs and the
prettiest clipped bay trees in small round tubs all over the place.
And both Juliet and Romeo held us spell-bound. We all loved a
&lsquo;love-scene&rsquo; in those days, even when it was
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, and here was that beautiful Juliet up on her
balcony and William Terriss&rsquo; mellifluous voice delighting our
ears, telling us to &ldquo;See how she leans her cheek upon her
hand&rdquo; which Miss Nielson did most gracefully. And he went on
more mellifluously (such a good word and so expressive) than
before:</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Oh that I were a glove upon her hand<br>
That I might touch that cheek!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When a voice from one of the &lsquo;gods&rsquo; up in the
gallery, overcome by emotion, put in encouragingly (and not
mellifluously):</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try one o&rsquo; them tubs, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would not have missed that moment for anything in the world.
Nothing happened. Dead silence. No one laughed. We all of us a prey
to emotion so great that we did not heed what went on around us. I
was one of the few Philistines who came down to earth with
sufficient speed to utter an agitated &ldquo;Hush-sh-sh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same sort of incident did occur often enough in those days
when &lsquo;the gods&rsquo; were the good old &lsquo;gods&rsquo;
who, unlike the intelligentsia (?) who patronize the gallery
to-day, went to the theatre to have a bit of fun and somehow
managed to find it even in classical tragedies. Nor were they
backward in expressing their own pleasure or disappointment. They
were not banded together &lsquo;to boo or not to boo&rsquo; at the
dictate of an addle-pated and malevolent clique. If they enjoyed a
play they cheered it, if they did not they &lsquo;boo-ed&rsquo; and
that was all there was to it. Their comments, often expressed at
the wrong moment, were always to the point, but they were
invariably addressed to a favourite, a popular favourite among whom
William Terriss was an easy first. And these comments were a kind
of freemasonic slogan between them.</p>

<p>There was, for instance, a memorable evening when my beloved
Wilson Barrett gave what I (alas! not the critics) considered a
sublime presentment of <i>Hamlet</i> at the Princess&rsquo; with
all the effects of lighting, scenery, and appurtenances which he
understood so well. The first scene was, as usual, enacted in
breathless silence while the ghost glided, mysterious and
spirit-like across the stage and Bernardo whispered in awe-struck
tone: &ldquo;Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio,&rdquo; a
voice from the gallery suddenly struck a blow at our pent-up
emotions with a deep-toned and reverberating challenge:
&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo&rsquo;s the bloke?&rdquo; W. B. was admittedly the
kindest and most patient of men, with a keen sense of humour. It
seems he did not utter as much as a small d&mdash;, through his
forbearance must have been sorely tried by the titters not only in
the audience but among the company waiting in the wings. All that
he said, with a quiet smile was: &ldquo;One of the penalties of
popularity. Mark it, Horatio.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="2000341h-images/page048.jpg" alt="" width="476" height=

<p>Such tributes to popularity could easily be dispensed with by
such artistes as Irving or Wilson Barrett, not to mention other
great ones (in their own estimation) like Edwin Booth or Richard
Mansfield but to such favourites as William Terriss and Charles
Warner they were a source of ever recurring delight. In such
thrilling dramas as <i>Green Bushes, The Streets of London</i>, and
so many others, the persecuted and virtuous heroine was always
deprived of her &lsquo;marriage lines&rsquo; by the villain.</p>

<p>She invariably had a baby whom for reasons best known to the
producer she always took out with her when she wandered out in the
snow. Never did she take it out when the weather was fine. And it
was invariably in the snow that the hero came face to face with the
villain and very foolishly demanded of him the return of her
&lsquo;marriage lines&rsquo; which, if produced, would then and
there have brought felicity and peace to the heroine and with it
the happy, if premature, ending of the play. But the villain
defiantly refused to part with that important document&mdash;which,
by the way, we all knew was in his pocket&mdash;and the wordy
warfare between him and the hero took on excited proportions when
good advice to the latter came from &lsquo;the gods&rsquo; above:
&ldquo;Search &rsquo;im Bill.&rdquo; (The very last thing any hero
of melodrama would have thought of doing.)</p>

<p>Good advice from above was also given to Charles Warner in that
more up-to-date and less blatant form of melodrama: <i>Drink,</i>
adapted from Emile Zola&rsquo;s great book
<i>L&rsquo;Assommoir.</i> When Coupeau first feels the pangs of
D.T.&rsquo;s (which was really a fine piece of acting by Warner),
and he duly writhed in the agony that preceded his death scene, the
kind adviser in the gallery called cheerfully down to him, &ldquo;
&rsquo;Ave one more, Charlie; it&rsquo;ll do ye good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Once again I am tempted to refer to my special hero,
Wilson Barnett, in terms of genuine appreciation, for it was he who
brought good sound melodrama to the Princess&rsquo; with such plays
as <i>The Silver King, The Lights o&rsquo; London,</i> and <i>The
Romany Rye.</i> Though these were still somewhat of the childishly
thrilling kind, they were nevertheless sound in construction, and
coincidences bore a less irrational part in the not too
unbelievable plot. I, as a self-appointed dramatic critic had very
little fault to find with the big situation in the third act or
with the unravelling of the dramatic knot in the fourth.</p>

<p>By the time I had met my erstwhile idol at the Critchetts and
had fallen somewhat to earth from my idealism of W. B. owing to his
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> shirt and various natural
deficiencies, he had produced <i>Claudian</i> and <i>Junius</i>,
had fallen from the heights of fortune down to the financial
collapse and bitter disappointment, then soared up again to
prosperity and palmy days through the outstanding success of a play
written by himself, <i>The Sign of the Cross.</i> And now I saw him
at the Critchetts, chatting with Miss Eastlake and cracking jokes
with R. C. Carton, or W. G. Pinero, a sight which left me dreaming
(as I certainly did sleeping and waking) about some intangible
future when I too would be gazed on as a celebrity with awe by
some, with admiration by all. But alas! these dreams seemed so
foolish and so very, very idle.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we never had any actual friends among the
theatrical folk. I think my dear father&rsquo;s experience of that
world in Budapest made him restive whenever my mother threw out
vague hints of wishing to know some of that interesting fraternity
at closer quarters. George Critchett was often wanting to bring
some of his favoured friends to our receptions in Wimpole Street;
his son, who had offended against family traditions by adopting the
stage as his career (a thing which was simply &lsquo;not
done&rsquo; in those days in the higher ranks of the professional
classes), was of course an exception.</p>

<p>Funnily enough he was a very poor actor then but soon blossomed
into one of the most distinguished dramatists of that period, side
by side with his friend, A. W. Pinero, who also after starting in
life as a very poor actor, gave the English world of dramatic art
such masterpieces as <i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, Letty, The Gay
Lord Quex,</i> and so many others.</p>

<p>When I said that we had no actual friends among the theatrical
world, I was decidedly wrong, for we did have a delightful and
charming friend Henry Irving (not Sir Henry then). As a matter of
fact I rate&mdash;as indeed we all do&mdash;the term
&lsquo;friend&rsquo; very highly as an attribute seldom met with,
but one that must be fully appreciated when we find it in those
whom we have the privilege to know. Henry Irving, that great and
kindest of men, was introduced to my parents on a memorable
occasion at the musical &lsquo;at home&rsquo; given by Lady
Burdett-Coutts.</p>

<p>Somehow or other he and my father took a fancy to one another. I
think each <i>felt</i> in the other the soul of an artist, and the
glamour which at this time hung around everything Hungarian may
also have been a contributory factor that brought two such original
personalities together. Be that as it may, we soon had the pleasure
of entertaining Henry Irving in our house at luncheon one day and
after that he came again and again and often invited my parents to
supper in his rooms in Stratton Street. He always referred
facetiously to them as the &lsquo;B. B&rsquo;s&rsquo;, <i>i.e.</i>
&lsquo;the bold Baron and the beautiful Baroness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He and my father had many an interesting argument on the subject
of theatrical management and the eccentricities of public taste;
which of course was a debatable point between them, seeing that an
English theatre run just as much on commercial as artistic lines by
the most popular actor-manager of the day was a very different
proposition to a Hungarian National Institution of drama and music
under State control and smothered in red tape, such as my father
directed.</p>

<p>One, for me, very happy incident occurred at this time. I had
begun my artistic career (of which more anon) and I received a
request from the Director of the National Museum of Dramatic Art of
Budapest to paint a portrait of &lsquo;the great English actor,
Henry Irving&rsquo;. And &lsquo;the great English actor&rsquo; who
was the kindest of men actually gave up some of his valuable time
to me, and gave me several sittings for a portrait of him as the
Vicar of Wakefield. I saw it fairly recently in Budapest. It is
jolly bad as a work of art, but is a good likeness. Irving&rsquo;s
face was so wonderfully full of character that any moderately
intelligent art student could not fail to get a likeness; nor once
seen could it ever be forgotten. His whole personality was
arresting. A man who could so rise above every physical disability
such as Nature in one of her incomprehensible moods had put upon
him, wore on him the very stamp of genius.</p>

Artistic Career</b>
</h1>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8" id="Chapter8"></a>Chapter
8</b>
</h2>

<p>Unlike the nine lives popularly attributed to the feline species
and which run, we suppose consecutively, mine, rather fewer in
number it is true, ran concurrently. The periods of my childhood
and my girlhood were coincident with my social and my musical life,
with my glimpses of the theatrical world and with my short, not
very remarkable, artistic career, but every one of these periods
was a stepping-stone towards the destiny which the Will of God had
from the beginning of my life mapped out for me. I suppose that it
is very arrogant to say that, even to think that God bothered about
me to the extent of desiring me to conceive the <i>Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> but, believe me, I say it in all humility.</p>

<p>I have so often been asked the question: &ldquo;But how did you
come to <i>think</i> of the <i>Scarlet Pimpernel?&rdquo;</i> And my
answer has always been: &ldquo;It was God&rsquo;s Will that I
should.&rdquo; And to you moderns, who perhaps do not believe as I
do, I will say: &ldquo;In the chain of my life there were so many
links, all of which tended towards bringing me to the fulfilment of
my destiny.&rdquo; And nothing can be quite so wonderful as the
workings of a man&rsquo;s or a woman&rsquo;s destiny. Mine
certainly evolved in a spasmodic way.</p>

<p>I came from a country where in that generation at any rate (I
don&rsquo;t know what things are like now over there) girls were
not allowed to go anywhere unchaperoned, and my dear father was not
yet under the influence of progressive England; what he called
female emancipation was anathema him. So it was not a bit of any
use my eating out my heart in all sorts of vain longings and dreams
of glory and fame to be attained, goodness alone knew how.</p>

<p>The only career in which I could have got encouragement and even
help from him would have been the musical profession. If I had had
the slightest talent, if I had had a voice&mdash;or an ear&mdash;he
would have given me such training as seldom falls to the lot of
budding genius. But it was not to be. I had absolutely no talent,
nor that passionate love for an art which was the breath of life to
my father, whom I loved more than anyone else in the world.</p>

<p>And there was dear, dear old Liszt with his kind eyes and his
soft voice, calling me &ldquo;<i>Ma po&eacute;sie</i>&rdquo; and
patting my shoulder with his lovely slender hand. When I touched
the piano and put my whole heart and soul into the rendering of
those wonderful adaptations of his from Wagner&rsquo;s operas he
shook his head and said with a tone of regret, &ldquo;<i>Non! Ce
n&rsquo;est pas cela</i>&rdquo;(that isn&rsquo;t it), meaning of
course that I for one would never &lsquo;make the piano
sing&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Anyway, there it was. It was no use thinking about it too much.
All that was left to me were my dreams and vague stirrings of
something I could not explain even to myself. They certainly did
not tend then in the direction of fiction writing, nor did they
prompt me to put some of my thoughts&mdash;some of my
dreams&mdash;on paper. I was not yet twenty and very young for my
age. Nowadays, girls only just in their teens are publishing
novels, verses, writing plays, and what not. I was just storing up
experiences more or less interesting in my mind, a jumble of
inspirations and glimmerings of all sorts of knowledge.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, like a bolt from the blue there came the time
when these vague stirrings took on a definite form and I really and
truly believed that at last I was on the way of finding my true
vocation. My cousin, who had been in the convent school with me in
Paris, sent me from Budapest a picture painted by herself. It was a
study of a group of flowers in the open air with the light of the
sun behind them. With it there came a letter from her telling me
that she was going to join her brother who was studying painting in
Munich, and that she, too, intended to follow an artistic career in
earnest. I don&rsquo;t remember whether the picture was good or
not. It certainly would be a difficult subject to tackle and I
remember my mother and one or two English friends who came to look
at it giving it unstinted praise and praising also the energy and
high spirits of the young artist which caused her to turn to
something useful in life rather than to idle it away as so many
girls did who failed to find a husband&mdash;the only vocation open
to women in those days.</p>

<p>The incident was a revelation to me. I hardly slept at all that
night and the next for thinking and thinking and planning what I
could do to attain what had suddenly become an all-consuming
desire: to follow an artistic career. I knew, of course, that that
desire would be difficult of attainment. I hadn&rsquo;t got a
brother who was studying painting in Munich or elsewhere, and I
knew that my parents would never consent to my careering about
Europe to learn painting any more than they had allowed me to
complete my studies by going to Cambridge.</p>

<p>Little did I guess that the sending of my cousin&rsquo;s picture
from Budapest was yet another link (and a very strong one at that)
in the chain of my life which was to lead me not only to the
satisfaction of my vague ambitions but to happiness such as seldom
falls to the lot of any human being. If my cousin&rsquo;s picture
had not been sent from Budapest. . . . If this had not happened . .
. or that . . . if . . . if. . . . Were not these &lsquo;ifs&rsquo;
the dominant factors throughout my early life which brought about
my ultimate destiny? They cropped up again now with the arrival of
that blessed&mdash;blessed picture.</p>

<p>If the picture had not been sent, I would not have been obsessed
all of a sudden with the mad desire to adopt an artistic career. I
don&rsquo;t know how or why this desire took possession of me. I
had never dreamed before of an artistic career. I loved to look at
pictures in the way that I loved listening to music, in a calm,
comfortable way, but suddenly the idea that one day I would paint
pictures which would be hung in the Royal Academy exhibitions or in
the salons of Paris and Munich became a perfect obsession. The
whole thing was a beautiful day dream.</p>

<p>I imagine that this fixed idea affected my temper and that I
worried my poor dear mother to death with my constant requests for
permission to attend an art school. In the end I succeeded, thanks
chiefly to kind words spoken on my behalf by Sir Frederick
(afterwards Lord) Leighton, the then President of the Royal
Academy, one of the most charming, most fascinating men in late
Victorian society. My mother had met him at one of Countess
K&aacute;rolyi&rsquo;s receptions; he had invited her to come and
see his pictures which he was showing that year in the Royal
Academy. She took me with her.</p>

<p>The studio with its multiplicity of sketches and studies by the
master hand was nothing short of a revelation. I was dumb not only
with shyness, I was dumbfounded with admiration and enthusiasm. I
think the dear man was amused by this school-girlish tribute to his
genius. He was so kind, so understanding. Before I knew where I was
I had told him of my fervent desire to become a great
artist&mdash;nothing less than great&mdash;and I suppose that I
said something about my parents&rsquo; reluctance to allow me to
attend an art school.</p>

<p>Nothing much happened for many days after that momentous visit;
Sir Frederick who was passionately fond of music and a great
concert goer, heard some of my father&rsquo;s works and . . . and .
. . well, I don&rsquo;t really remember how it all
happened&mdash;things always had a way of happening in my
life&mdash;certain it is that presently I found myself entered as a
student at the West London School of Art, a branch of South
Kensington.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The South Kensington School of Art is an institution which owes
its foundation to the Prince Consort (the husband of Queen
Victoria). Soon it threw out branches in London and in many
provincial towns. I think I am right when I say that its object was
decorative art rather than pictorial, and was for many young
artists merely the stepping-stone for admission to the Royal
Academy Schools and the Slade. I certainly began my short artistic
career at the West London but never distinguished myself
sufficiently to obtain admission to other more important
schools.</p>

<p>But there was always &lsquo;Heatherley&rsquo;s&rsquo;.
Heatherley&rsquo;s in Newman Street where so many fine, if perhaps
not great, English artists served their apprenticeship.
Heatherley&rsquo;s demanded no special qualifications for joining
the life class, <i>i.e.</i> working from the living model. One paid
one&rsquo;s two guineas a month and was at liberty to work either
from the nude or the costume model every day from 9 a.m. till dusk,
with an interval for luncheon. All this I learned from
fellow-students at the West London, and it all sounded very
attractive. It suggested freedom for the exercise of one&rsquo;s
special talents (if one had any) and I was bound to admit that the
tuition which I was receiving at the time was on the dull and
uninspired side, for it only meant drawing from plaster casts in
charcoal or in chalk, and I hated drawing. I wanted to paint. I
wanted to run before I had learned to walk. I wanted to go to
Heatherley&rsquo;s and paint pictures. I saw pictures floating like
visions before my mind, pictures were hung on the walls of the
Royal Academy, and this I should never attain by making
representations of plaster casts in charcoal and in chalk.</p>

<p>Happily I encountered no opposition from my parents when I
broached the question of Heatherley&rsquo;s by way of a change. I
imagine that the poor darlings looked upon me now as an emancipated
product of English education and felt that &lsquo;in for a penny,
in for a pound&rsquo; of this emancipation was the best course to
pursue in the interests of peace in the home. And I was allowed to
go to Heatherley&rsquo;s. There one could, if one was so minded,
continue to draw in chalk or charcoal from the plaster
casts&mdash;there was a very fine one of the Apollo Belvedere, more
groupings of coloured pottery and metal ornaments with the addition
of graceful draperies and flowers. One might work in oils or
water-colours or pastel. The model was there for the student to
exercise his genius in portraiture, but there was no real
teaching.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Old Heatherley&rsquo;, as he was familiarly called, went
round the studios once in the mornings and once in the afternoons.
He would make sarcastic remarks or criticize the work if it was
worthy of criticism, and left one entirely to one&rsquo;s own
devices. The rest of the day he spent upstairs in his private
apartments playing the flute, practising scales and exercises on
that delectable instrument. He was a funny old boy, in appearance
like <i>Faust</i> in the first act; he wore a long sort of velvet
garment, down to his heels, very much the worse for wear and
shuffled about in faded red leather slippers. His face was really
very noble both in features and in expression, with light blue eyes
and a transparent pale skin. His hair was snow-white and scanty,
and he wore a straggy kind of beard.</p>

<p>Three or four times a year a distinguished Royal
Academician&mdash;an old Heatherley-ite&mdash;kindly gave up an
hour or two of his valuable time and came to his old art school to
criticize the work of the students. These were red letter days for
us all, for these great gentlemen said very kind and encouraging
words to those who deserved it. I am sure I never did, and though I
loved the life in the studio and worked regularly and
enthusiastically it soon began to dawn upon me that I had not the
real <i>feu sacr&eacute;</i> which would one day carry me to the
pinnacle of fame.</p>

<p>Soon I realized that it was going to be mediocrity for me.
Mediocrity, again, my bugbear, my nightmare! Oh! how I loathed the
very word and how it haunted me! All the same this artistic side of
my life was a happier one than the musical one.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the studio was more congenial to my
temperament than the concert halls and the fashionable opera. The
students were for the most part simple girls and boys, most of them
from the City of London or St. Paul&rsquo;s school; some were
possessed of ambition as I was, others just content to look upon
the craft of the brush as a likely means of earning a livelihood.
As a matter of fact not one of these aspirants to fame or fortune
who passed in and out of &lsquo;Heatherley&rsquo;s&rsquo; during
the three or four years I worked there, achieved greatness. I
certainly did not. We all made pictures; oh yes! pictures which we
would hopefully send in to the Royal Academy every year, looking
forward to seeing them hung and possibly sold to an art patron, and
more often than not had them returned &lsquo;unhung for want of
space&rsquo; the little bit of sugar to disguise the bitterness of
the pill.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact pictures of mine were accepted and hung in
the Royal Academy three successive years. One of these now hangs in
the dining room of my home in Monte Carlo; the other two were sold
to unknown patrons who I am sure have no idea that these
masterpieces (?) were perpetrated by a humble artist who mayhap has
pleased them in another branch of art. It was during my studentship
at &lsquo;Heatherley&rsquo;s&rsquo; that I earned the friendship of
two very distinguished artists who remained my sincere friends
throughout their lives.</p>

<p>Edwin Long, R.A., was then an elderly man and a great popular
favourite. He was not a portrait painter but his huge pictures in
the Royal Academy or other exhibitions always attracted a crowd of
admirers then. His was a popularity very like that of the French
artist, Gustave Dor&eacute; (who had a gallery in Bond Street
devoted exclusively to his works). The pictures of both these
artists would be called &lsquo;hopelessly old-fashioned&rsquo; now:
huge canvasses which could never find a place in modern exiguous
houses and flats; biblical and oriental subjects for the most part;
elaborate compositions crowded with life-size figures composed and
grouped together in a way that would be far beyond the power of any
artist of to-day even to attempt.</p>

<p>Edwin Long&rsquo;s name which in the &rsquo;90&rsquo;s was as
well-known as is that of a popular writer of fiction in this
twentieth century is forgotten now; only in the provincial and
colonial galleries, in the Tate or Jones collections can a student
stand before those &lsquo;old-fashioned&rsquo; masterpieces and
give grudging admiration to the genius that conceived and the
knowledge and power of expression that accomplished these Herculean
tasks.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to him one day at
&lsquo;Heatherley&rsquo;s&rsquo;, when he came to criticize the
students&rsquo; work. He had attended the life classes there in his
youth and was most kind and encouraging to us all. He was a dear
old thing: simple and unaffected. We became great friends then and
there, and he asked one or two of us to come one day to his studio
and bring our work with us for closer criticism. Three of us did
muster up courage and did go to the Labyrinth, his lovely house on
top of Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue. Oh joy oh rapture! I was actually
allowed to be one of the three privileged ones.</p>

<p>How vividly stands that visit before my mind&rsquo;s eye as I
write! There was a finished picture on the easel, one which he had
completed for the forthcoming Royal Academy Exhibition. We three
humble students gave a simultaneous gasp of admiration in face of
this truly amazing work. It really was amazing: it simply glowed
with colour and there was something real and essentially vital in
every one of the life-size figures that filled the huge canvas.
They all seemed alive somehow. The artist stood by, enjoying I am
sure in his quiet way our silent tribute to his genius.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what went on in the minds of my two friends,
but I do know and for many years afterwards continued to feel the
fascination of that picture. It represented a scene in ancient
Egypt, &lsquo;The trial of the dead&rsquo;. In the centre of what
looked like an immense hall, open to the sky there stood an upright
human figure swathed in white wrappings and through which the
features of the face were discernible.</p>

<p>All around were several tiers of stone seats placed in a
semi-circle each side of a tall throne on which propped up with
cushions a gorgeously attired figure&mdash;The
Pharaoh&mdash;reclined and to right and left of him men and women
in picturesque attire and glowing headgear sat, each holding a
lotus blossom in their hand, in various attitudes. Next to the
central figure stood a man robed in white and wearing a wide belt
of a brilliant lapis-lazuli colour on which were engraved what
looked like hieroglyphics. With one hand outstretched he was
pointing upwards, and with the other to the swathed human figure
and to a woman who was crouching at its feet embracing its
knees.</p>

<p>While I was gazing in rapt attention at this extraordinary
picture, I heard, in a semi-conscious way, the voice of the artist
talking in his soft gentle voice&mdash;he had not the Oxford
accent&mdash;explaining the historical fact on which his conception
had been built.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mode of administering justice,&rdquo; I remember him
saying&mdash;and his words have often rung in my ears since
then&mdash; &ldquo;is the surest keynote in every country to the
character of its people. These ancient Egyptians sat in judgement
sometimes over the living but always over the dead, to decide if he
or she was worthy of the holy rites of burial. The man standing
beside my central figure is recounting the sins of the deceased.
Those figures in dark draperies are his widow and his children.
They may speak for or against him, as could his friends and enemies
also. Ever since I first became a student of Egyptology,&rdquo; the
artist went on, &ldquo;I was impressed with this idea of a pleading
for one who was so silent and so still. He could neither defend nor
incriminate himself but just stood in awesome majesty hearing
accusation and defence with the same contemptuous solemnity, the
same dignity of eternal sleep. The woman crouching at his feet is
the principal witness for or against him. On the belt of the
accuser the words carved thereon in cuneiform are
&lsquo;Mercy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Justice&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he continued to talk on that absorbing lore&mdash;the
story of ancient Egypt seven thousand years ago. His knowledge of
the subject was prodigious, he was historian and arch&aelig;ologist
at the same time, and above all he was a poet and an artist and
something of a mystic too. I little guessed that the time would
come when that picture would rise with intense vividness before my
mind&rsquo;s eye and that it would fall to me to give with pen,
ink, and paper in my romance <i>By the Gods Beloved,</i> a picture
of that scene which so impressed me in my kind friend&rsquo;s
studio.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And it was also at &lsquo;Heatherley&rsquo;s&rsquo; that I first
met David (afterwards Sir David) Murray: such a dear, kind, hearty,
canny Scot. He and W. B. Leader and J. Farquharson were the best
known and most admired landscape painters of the epoch. Their
pictures not being of such gigantic proportions as those of Edwin
Long, Lord Leighton and others, they found their places in private
collections and in many provincial and colonial galleries as well
as in the Tate and Jones collections. I remembered hearing these
three artists chatting together one evening at the Royal Academy
<i>soir&eacute;e</i>, I making a humble fourth in a very
interesting discussion.</p>

<p>As it happened, both David Murray and Joseph Farquharson were
exhibiting works that were different from their usual choice of
subjects. David was showing three or four <i>sea</i>-scapes which
he had never done before. He was essentially a <i>land</i>scape
painter, but with that unrestrained artist&rsquo;s conceit which I
always admire for its perfectly natural and undisguised blatancy
(why indeed shouldn&rsquo;t an artist be conceited?) he just wanted
to show Henry Moore and those other fellows that he could paint the
sea just as well as they did. As for Joe Farquharson he had painted
sheep in snow year after year till he was sick of them, so this
year he was exhibiting pictures which had nothing to do with either
snow or sheep.</p>

<p>Of the three distinguished artists W. B. Leader alone had stuck
to his ever popular rendering of leafy summer in England. The
amicable discussion between them interested me enormously. All
three were men who made a large income by the sale of their
pictures. Dealers fought for the privilege of securing their R. A.
pictures year by year, knowing that they could sell them to art
patrons at a considerable profit. But it seems that these dealers
were rather doubtful as to fresh incursions by popular artists in
subjects hitherto evaded by them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! very fine, Mr. Murray,&rdquo; one Philistine had
said to David; &ldquo;but I am afraid that your admirers
don&rsquo;t want any <i>sea</i>-scapes from you. They love your
moors and your Scottish hills . . . you understand . . . but very
fine . . . very fine . . . but I, for one, could not venture to buy
. . . I know your admirers . . . etc. etc . . .&rdquo; David was
furious and said some very rude things about dealers in general,
for it seems that with one accord they all began to make the same
excuse: &ldquo;Yes, very fine Mr. Farquharson . . . the trees . . .
the Spring of the year . . . but I am afraid your admirers
don&rsquo;t want spring and summer from you. . . . Sheep, you know,
Mr. Farquharson . . . in the snow . . . you understand . . . but
very fine . . . very fine. . . . Only I, for one, could not venture
to buy . . .&rdquo; and so on, and so on. And the two great Scots,
being Scots, would not see the humour of the situation which
appealed very strongly to W. B. Leader. The latter was smiling
quietly inside himself congratulating his own sound English sense
which had made him stick to his usual popular subject,
&lsquo;Spring and Summer in leafy England&rsquo;.</p>

<p>How many artists, how many writers have had to suffer in the
same way in their career? the demand of the public&mdash;of their
admirers for what they were accustomed to receive from their
favourites&mdash;a sort of slavery in fact. Fetters which will
always require an almost superhuman effort to break a kind of set
down in artistic aspirations, above which only a transcendent
genius is strong enough to rise. I suppose that these days if an
artist (?) accustomed to painting naked ladies with green thighs
and faces like acidulated pumpkins were to offer to his patrons a
beautifully drawn female figure of classical proportions, it would
be rejected by them as not quite . . . quite . . . what was
expected of him; and if he persisted in following his new
inspiration, his income would go down to zero and the number of his
admirers vanish from out his ken.</p>

<p>Let me confess at once that though my incursions into an
artistic career are not worth recording and my attempts at
pictorial art were anything but glorious there is a thing for which
I shall always be profoundly grateful, and that is that my artistic
training enabled me to see <i>pictorially</i> what later on I
attempted to describe with my pen. Quite apart from that wonderful
experience in Edwin Long&rsquo;s studio when he made me visualize
those glowing presentations of ancient Egypt, I obtained through my
training in pictorial art the faculty of seeing the scenes, the
characters, the movement of what my imagination was evoking for
me.</p>

<p>In the same way as I originally saw my Sir Percy Blakeney on the
platform of a railway station, so did I see the seething mobs in
the Paris of the Revolution, the tumbrils, the guillotine, the
prisoners in the Conciergerie, the Scarlet Pimpernel plotting and
planning for their release; I saw him in his various disguises, I
saw him feigning sleep at midnight at Lord Grenville&rsquo;s ball
with Chauvelin vaguely puzzled at first, then with the dawn of
comprehension lighting up his thin sallow face. Pictures! Yes! they
were all pictures before me, real vivid pictures! to transcribe
them with my pen was a comparatively simple matter.</p>

<p>Readers have so often said to me, &ldquo;How you can think of
all these things, I don&rsquo;t know. How you can describe those
scenes that happened years and years ago&mdash;and make them so
real that one can almost see them.&rdquo; And that is my answer.
&ldquo;They are real to you&mdash;Bless you!&mdash;because they
were real to me, because I saw them as pictures before I put pen to
paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But above all things (and one for which I can only thank God on
my knees) which came to me during the none too glorious years of my
artistic career, it was during that time that my life was turned
from darkness into light. It was in the studio at
&lsquo;Heatherley&rsquo;s&rsquo; that I met the man who from that
day became and remained all the world to me. The subject is secret
and sacred to me so I will not speak of it except to say this, that
the whole of my life, every step in my career has been bound up
with what Swinburne glorifies in such exquisite words: <i>Love that
keeps all the choir of lives in chime</i>. . . . My marriage was
for close on half a century one of perfect happiness and
understanding, of perfect friendship and communion of thought. The
great link in my chain of life which brought me everything that
makes life worth the living.</p>

Married Life</b>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9" id="Chapter9"></a>Chapter
9</b>
</h2>

<p>The first weeks of our married life we spent in the strictest
incog. In the studio flat we had taken in Holland Park Road, next
door to Val Prinsep&rsquo;s beautiful house and cheek by jowl with
so many beautiful artistic houses. Lord Leighton&rsquo;s,
Watts&rsquo;, Marcus Stone&rsquo;s, and others. Phil May had a
studio flat opposite to us in the same block as ours; so had
Herbert Schmalz (who during the 1914-1918 war changed his name to
Carmichael, as there was such an inveterate feeling against names
that sounded German). In fact that little backwater behind High
Street, Kensington, was a regular artist&rsquo;s colony. And there
we spent our honeymoon.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t go away in the orthodox fashion, as the weather
was in one of its worst London moods. Dark, damp and foggy, one
simply shuddered to think what it would have been like in the
country or by the sea. And our little home was very cosy. We had
engaged a very efficient and understanding female domestic, a
German woman of the old-fashioned type. Her name was Minna, and
hers was a type which, alas! has vanished out of existence for
ever. She was awaiting us at the flat with an excellently cooked
little dinner. We were supremely and childishly happy.</p>

<p>My dear father was dead, my mother who was in delicate health
and who had never really cared for England&mdash;not as my father
and I did&mdash;had gone back to Hungary as soon as she saw me
happily and contentedly married. Travelling across the continent of
Europe was no longer the slow and complicated affair of one&rsquo;s
young days and one could get over from London to Budapest in less
than thirty-six hours without stepping out of one&rsquo;s
comfortable <i>lit-salon</i>.</p>

<p>However we were not thinking of <i>lits-salon</i> and of Hungary
just then. We were going to settle down to work and to work very
hard. My mother-in-law was in the last stages of a severe illness
and every evening, wet or fine, we went over to see her in her
pretty little house in Bedford Park. To get to it we had to go
through Hammersmith Broadway, then a very rowdy and none too
reputable a district, especially when the customers of the many
public-houses were turned out into the streets at closing time. But
we were never molested or in any way annoyed.</p>

<p>London crowds, even in their cups, are like that. There is
always something in them, even amongst the worst, that restrains
them from being offensive to quiet passers-by. At least that has
always been my experience; my husband and I went about a great deal
in all sorts of highways and byways in London which would have been
called disreputable in those days, the like of which in Paris or
Brussels or Vienna it was always prudent to avoid.</p>

<p>This was the year when the whole of London was stirred to
excitement by the criminal activities of &lsquo;Jack the
Ripper&rsquo;. Before I was married I knew little if anything about
it, but I know that friends made up parties to go and view the
scenes of those horrible crimes. Strangely enough it was during the
first week of our marriage that one of those abominations was
brought very close to our door. We were returning from our nightly
visit in Bedford Park when turning into Holland Park Road we were
met by Mr. Alfred Praga, the miniature painter who lived quite
close to us. He said hurriedly to my husband: &ldquo;Take your lady
in quickly before crossing the road. Something very unpleasant has
happened.&rdquo; And it had.</p>

<p>My husband deposited me in the flat in the care of good old
Minna and then went out to see what had actually happened. A
wretched woman was lying on the pavement outside Val
Prinsep&rsquo;s door, obviously another victim of the mysterious
Jack the Ripper. Prinsep, roused by the sound of talking, for a
small crowd had already collected and a couple of police had been
loudly summoned, begged for as much quiet as was possible.
&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has just given birth to a
son. She is none too well. The doctor is with her.&rdquo; I
don&rsquo;t know why but this juxtaposition of horrible death and a
new innocent life took hold of my imagination as something weird
and mystically predestined. And when, twenty or thirty years later
I met the man who had been that baby, I wondered whether his inner
being had in any way been affected by his quasi-mystical birth.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>My husband (it seems funny not to speak of him by his Christian
name but his god-parents had treated him very scurvily.
&lsquo;Montagu&rsquo; was quite impossible, and its diminutive even
worse). Well! he had for some time been engaged in black and white
work, illustrations for books and magazine
stories&mdash;pot-boiling he called it. It certainly was
pot-boiling, but in those days it was of a very lucrative and often
interesting kind. Such brilliant artists as John Tenniel, John
Charlton, Phil May, Linley Sambourne all on <i>Punch</i>, Lucien
Davis, the several Wilsons, the Pagets, Raven Hill, and also my
husband, held the field. Full-page drawings by those artists in
magazines and in the weekly Press were, I venture to say, more
appreciated then than are to-day &lsquo;Lady Somebody Something
walking in the Park with Sir Matthew thingummy&rsquo; or &lsquo;the
Duchess of X.Y.Z. at Their Majesty&rsquo;s drawing-room wearing her
superb diamond tiara&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Well! it is all a question of taste and of fashion, of course,
and I am the first to admit that editors of magazines and of the
illustrated Press know their public and have learned from
experience just what Tottie Hoots of Balham and Lilian de
Montmorency of Tooting desire to see in their <i>Daily Sketch</i>
and <i>Mirror</i>. These modern young ladies don&rsquo;t want to
see &lsquo;pretty pictures&rsquo; any more; they want
&lsquo;actualities&rsquo;, and like to know just how Lady Somebody
Something looks when she walks in the Park and how a superb diamond
tiara would become them if they happened to possess one.</p>

<p>During the final years of the dying century, a humorous
periodical aptly called <i>Pick-me-up</i> was launched under the
joint direction of Raven Hill and Arnold Goldsworthy. The former
did the weekly political cartoon and Goldsworthy wrote articles on
the leading questions of the day and reviewed books and plays in
his inimitably witty style. Sime also contributed a full-page
drawing every week which shocked the general public just
sufficiently to make <i>Pick-me-up</i> one of the great financial
successes of humorous publications. He called his series of
drawings: &lsquo;The Shades&rsquo;. The first one represented the
nether regions with a lot of little demons running helter-skelter
about, as if in a state of terror, and the legend below the picture
was &ldquo;Look out, you fellows, she is coming,&rdquo; and the
other little demons enquiring &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; and the first
little demon in awe-struck tones &ldquo;The new woman!&rdquo;
Another had the approach to the nether regions for its background
and sturdy little demons were trundling along barrows laden with
paving stones &lsquo;First consignment for the New Year&rsquo; was
inscribed below. There were others that were often less funny and
sometimes blasphemous.</p>

<p>Whether this had any bearing on the ultimate decline of the
circulation of <i>Pick-me-up</i> I am not in a position to say. It
certainly was at its apogee during the last years of the century
and during the years of the South African War. My husband was
commissioned to do a weekly front page drawing for it&mdash;in a
sort of politico-classical style . . . Britannia and so on, more
&lsquo;classical&rsquo; than politico, I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>

<p>Anyway, the public who loved its <i>Pick-me-up</i> loved these
&lsquo;classics&rsquo; to the extent that the editors decided to
issue reproductions of the original drawings on &lsquo;plate-paper
for mounting&rsquo;. And then Messrs. W. H. Smith, the autocrats of
the railway bookstalls, thought fit to object to all
&lsquo;classical&rsquo; drawings as well as to &lsquo;The
Shades&rsquo;, and I imagine that <i>Pick-me-up</i> died a
lingering death about this time&mdash;I certainly lost sight of
it.</p>

<p>There were several others; there was <i>Fun</i> and <i>Judy</i>
and <i>Lika Joko</i>, and others the names of which I ought to
remember and don&rsquo;t, just as good in their way and often far
more amusing than the immortal <i>Punch</i>&mdash;immortal in very
truth. Nothing has ever ousted <i>Punch</i> from its supreme
position as the one and only humorous English periodical, the only
comic paper worthy to rest on the tables of reading-rooms in the
select clubs of St. James&rsquo;s and in houses of &lsquo;the
county&rsquo;. Its politics have always been &lsquo;sound&rsquo;.
Perhaps this accounts for its &lsquo;immortality&rsquo;.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And we did enjoy life the two of us. These were the last years
of the dying century. London was still &lsquo;good old
London&rsquo; then: the London of the &lsquo;eighties and the
&rsquo;nineties so much derided, so mercilessly satirized by young
moderns to-day.</p>

<p>Living so much abroad as I have done during the past years, but
seeing London fairly regularly four months out of twelve, it seemed
to me every time that I came over for my annual visit that
something of its dear old face had undergone change. It seemed
already at the beginning of this century that London had been to a
beauty parlour, had had its wrinkles smoothed out, its face
massaged and lifted. Oh, yes! lifted! There were times when I
hardly knew it, times when it seemed a strange unknown city,
without its Nash&rsquo;s Quadrant and its ancient Piccadilly
Circus. At others it just seemed as if it were peopled with ghosts:
ghosts and pictures of the past.</p>

<p>It seemed strange even all these years ago to see London without
its old horse &rsquo;bus going clippety-clop up the Edgware Road or
along Oxford Street . . . the &lsquo;Royal Blue&rsquo; was the one
I remembered best. It used to ply from somewhere near Oxford Circus
to Victoria and took three-quarters of an hour doing it. Nominally
there was room for twelve inside; it usually held eighteen. There
was straw on the floor, which on wet days . . . well! never mind
about the straw on wet days. The conductor, insecurely perched on
the step at the rear, would collect fares, and the door there was a
square tablet on which he chalked up the amounts which he had
collected.</p>

<p>I remember being very much puzzled as to the mathematical
process by which, when he had taken fourpence from me, he chalked
up threepence, and once, quite innocently, I asked for an
explanation of this abstruse calculation. But only the once! The
explanation, I may say, was neither satisfactory nor relevant. I
forget in what year the punching-clip and ticket system was
introduced into the omnibus service, but I do know that this ticket
system was greatly resented by the &rsquo;bus conductors. And one
of the earliest strikes I recollect was an omnibus strike in
protest against that unpleasant innovation.</p>

<p>Of course, one never went on top of &rsquo;busses until what was
poetically termed &lsquo;garden seats&rsquo; were introduced.
Before that there was what was called the &lsquo;knife-board&rsquo;
by way of seating accommodation, and only the lords of creation
were able to negotiate the iron ladder which led up to it. One
passenger was privileged to sit on the box beside the driver, but
how he obtained that privilege I have never known to this day.
Needless to say that this privilege, too, was reserved for the
great sex.</p>

<p>When the &lsquo;garden seats&rsquo; first came into use the iron
ladder, too, was made more accessible, and some of us, more
venturesome than others, made our first attempts at climbing to the
top of a &rsquo;bus. <i>Punch</i> at the time had a joke about the
shy young lady out for a country walk. She comes to a stile over
which she will be forced to climb. To her consternation a man is
standing close by, and she marvels how she can possibly negotiate
the stile without showing her ankles, whereupon the stranger
remarks, genially: &ldquo;Lor, don&rsquo;t you be afeeard, miss, I
am a &rsquo;bus conductor; ankles ain&rsquo;t no treat to
me!&rdquo; <i>Autres temps, autres moeurs</i>. Ankles, methinks,
ain&rsquo;t no treat to anybody these days.</p>

<p>Being a mere woman, one&rsquo;s mode of locomotion in old London
in varying degrees of plutocracy, consisted&mdash;if you only had
pennies to spare&mdash;of the aforesaid horse-&rsquo;bus, or you
could also go by Underground. They were the well-named
&lsquo;bone-shakers&rsquo;, consisting of one very tall and one
very small wheel, impossible for any woman to mount. I think it was
about &rsquo;95 that the &lsquo;safety bicycle&rsquo; came in,
together with the inflated rubber tyres and the curved cross-bar,
capable of being negotiated in skirts. I have a very distinct,
though not altogether pleasant, recollection of the introduction of
the safety bicycle.</p>

<p>It was in the days when I considered myself an artist by
profession, not having yet discovered that I could write novels and
I had been commissioned by Messrs. Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons to
illustrate a coloured picture-book for bairns. All the pictures
were to be comic animals doing everyday things. One of the pictures
I had devised represented a bicycle race run by comic green frogs.
Of course, I had drawn them on the old &lsquo;bone-shakers&rsquo;,
but the cyclist frogs he rejected. &ldquo;If you have a bicycle
race,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;you must have the modern safety
kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had to do my picture over again, and was in great trouble to
get a correct drawing of the wonderful new safety machine. Directly
after its introduction, however, bicycling at once became not only
of general utility to women, but also very fashionable. In the late
&rsquo;nineties the great thing in London was to go and watch the
bicycling in Battersea Park. After tea-time the Park was thronged
with all the smartest women in London. I remember seeing the
beautiful Lady Warwich there on one occasion, most exquisitely
dressed, and countless others, if not equally beautiful, at any
rate equally smart.</p>

<p>But, of course, bicycling then was for the young in the same way
as riding in omnibuses was not considered &lsquo;the thing&rsquo;
for a Society woman to do. She might&mdash;if she did not keep a
carriage&mdash;go in a &lsquo;growler&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago any fashionable woman would have done so; more
particularly as it was not thought decorous for her to ride in a
hansom alone. The hansom was the height of smartness. Lord
Shrewsbury and Talbot, the smartest man about town at that time,
launched the hansom-cabs in London. They were called
&lsquo;Talbots&rsquo; for a long time. He himself drove a private
one. It was painted canary yellow, and certainly was the smartest
affair to be seen in the Park.</p>

<p>But the fashionable Society woman drove either in her brougham,
her victoria, or the family landau&mdash;with &lsquo;C&rsquo;
springs, if you please! In these she could do her shopping and pay
her calls. After tea her business&mdash;and, no doubt, her
pleasure&mdash;was to drive in the Park for an hour or more, up and
down the Lady&rsquo;s mile. Everybody who was anybody had to be
seen there at that hour.</p>

<p>Duchesses in landaus with &lsquo;C&rsquo; springs; on the box a
bewigged coachman and a powdered footman, who looked like a stuffed
dummy if he was properly trained; smart society in elegant
victorias; elderly dowagers in closed broughams. It was bad form to
drive two horses unless you had a footman on the box. Soon after
five o&rsquo;clock the then Princess of Wales, with her daughters,
would drive once or twice up and down the Lady&rsquo;s Mile,
smiling and bowing to right and left practically without
ceasing.</p>

<p>There was a generally-accepted legend at the time that the
Princess had a hidden spring in the back cushion of the carriage,
which rocked her forwards and back without any effort on her part.
Personally I should think that was very likely, otherwise I do not
see how any woman could have gone on bowing to right and left so
unceasingly and so regularly without turning giddy and faint.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales&mdash;I am, of course, referring to the
late Queen Alexandra&mdash;unlike many other Royal ladies had a
great influence over London fashions. I don&rsquo;t say that London
fashions were universally accepted, say in Paris or Vienna, but
there were certain modes which she originated and kept to in spite
of dictates from the fashion kings and queens of other
countries.</p>

<p>The Alexandra bonnet for one thing: that close-fitting little
affair, which framed her beautiful face so exquisitely and was
thought <i>so</i> becoming. It had narrow strings tied under the
chin and was &lsquo;trimmed&rsquo;&mdash;we always
&lsquo;trimmed&rsquo; our hats and bonnets in those
days&mdash;either with a velvet bow or a flat bunch of flowers.</p>

<p>One always went to church in a bonnet, never in a hat. It was
thought very bad form even for a girl just &lsquo;out&rsquo; to go
to a fashionable London church in a hat. Nor would our
mothers&mdash;however beautiful or young-looking they
were&mdash;have worn a hat in London for calling or driving in the
afternoon: always a bonnet tied under the chin and a veil reaching
exactly down to the tip of their nose. And at home a cap. Yes,
Madam 1946, a cap!</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales, one of the loveliest women of her, or
any, time, always wore a cap. At the theatre, at her own intimate
tea-parties, or when receiving friends at Marlborough House, if she
did not wear a cap it was because the occasion was grand enough for
her to wear a tiara.</p>

<p>The matron&rsquo;s cap&mdash;you were called a matron very soon
after you had turned thirty-five&mdash;varied in fashion from year
to year: it could be quite diminutive, no bigger than a large
butterfly or large like a miniature Alsatian bow; it could be made
of the most exquisite filmy <i>point d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on</i> or
of a length of velvet ribbon. The Princess of Wales invented one
made of a twisted coloured silk handkerchief over a buckram shape.
Of course, it was called &lsquo;the Alexandra cap&rsquo;. I
remember seeing her at the opera one night in a pale blue cap with
a huge diamond brooch pinned into it in front. Of course she looked
beautiful as she always did, but imagine a young woman of the
present day&mdash;one with complexes and inhibitions and I
don&rsquo;t know what not&mdash;going to the opera in a cap!</p>

<p>Of course, on great occasions&mdash;gala nights when the de
Reszkes were singing, dinner-parties, dances, and so on&mdash;you
wore a tiara, if you had one; if not, you wore some kind of
jewellery in your elaborately-dressed hair. Pearls were nothing
like the rage that they are now, and on gala nights at the opera
the boxes were literally a blaze of diamonds. For more ordinary
occasions one wore pendants, brooches, necklaces, all rather on the
large side; and I remember the time when a gold locket on a gold
chain round the neck over a high dress was not considered at
all&mdash;shall I say&mdash;out of place.</p>

<p>For one thing, if for no other, must we be eternally grateful to
post-war fashion-kings or queens and that is the introduction of
the short dresses. Whatever fault the old-fashioned fogies may find
with the present promiscuous display of legs, there is no doubt
that the short skirt is infinitely more comfortable and more
hygienic. Quite apart from athletics, don&rsquo;t we all remember
the hideous discomfort of walking in London on a muddy, rainy day,
holding up an umbrella with one hand and our dress with the
other?</p>

<p>When I was a girl, and officially &lsquo;out&rsquo; the dresses
had what was called a foundation, with a flounce round the bottom
and an inside &lsquo;frilling&rsquo; besides. And when you thought
you had your dress well in hand and out of the mud, lo! when you
got home you found that your foundation had escaped you and that
not only was it smothered in mud, frilling and all, both inside and
out, but it had also splashed your boots and your stockings up to
your knees.</p>

<p>It was in &rsquo;92, if I remember right, that the
&lsquo;umbrella&rsquo; skirt first came in. Cut on the
cross&mdash;on the principle of an umbrella&mdash;and lined with
silk throughout and free of any drapery, it seemed then the acme of
comfort, even though it did not reach the ground. It was about that
time too, that we gave up all ideas of artificial excrescences
about our body. Until then we had a series of them. The
&lsquo;bustle&rsquo; in the late &rsquo;nineties, followed by the
&lsquo;waterfall back&rsquo;. The latter was an indescribable
nuisance when getting in and out of &rsquo;buses and cabs: but it
was generally admitted that it gave grace to the wearer&rsquo;s
movements when walking!!!</p>

<p>The waterfall back was a series of steels of graduated lengths
reaching from the waist to the hem of the gown: each steel tied
back with tape so as to form an arc. There was an art in swinging
this erection behind one as one walked.</p>

<p>I remember in the early &rsquo;nineties some lovely ball-gowns I
had. Tulle skirts and satin or moir&eacute; bodices to tone were
all the rage for girls, and I had a dress, the skirt of which
consisted of four layers of tulle one over the other shading from
pale lemon to deep chrysanthemum orange. Under the top layer and
going from the waist-line on the right across the front, to the hem
on the left was a cascade of shaded chrysanthemums: the top layer
of tulle veiling the flowers; the bodice, cut in a deep V back and
front, and laced up at the back, was of chrysanthemum orange
moir&eacute;; on the left shoulder a bunch of shaded
chrysanthemums. Another dress was of saffron-coloured tulle, with a
flight of tiny bright blue birds down the side, again veiled by one
layer of tulle.</p>

<p>That was also the time when the tight &lsquo;eel&rsquo;s
skin&rsquo; dresses were fashionable. One wore a skin-tight bodice
of jersey material above a pleated skirt. The jersey moulded the
figure like a skin. The great thing was to have a small
waist&mdash;the smaller the waist, the more marvellous the figure.
Every girl aspired to an eighteen-inch waist, but there was a very
celebrated London beauty, Mrs. W., whose waist only measured
thirteen. Of course, one wore the &lsquo;hour-glass&rsquo; corsets
with what was known as the &lsquo;spoon&rsquo; busk down the front,
and the more often that spoon-busk&mdash;which was of steel, mind
you&mdash;broke across in the region of your waist, the prouder you
were of your figure.</p>

<p>In spite of those corsets, however, I can assure you young ones
that dancing was extremely graceful&mdash;more graceful in the
strict sense of the word, though of course, not so acrobatic as it
is now. I don&rsquo;t pretend to know how girls played tennis in
the &rsquo;nineties. Apart from the corsets, the long voluminous
skirts, and hats pinned tightly above an elaborate
hair-construction cannot have been either suitable or
comfortable.</p>

<p>I suppose you would all say that they must have looked supremely
ridiculous. Perhaps they did. I don&rsquo;t know. I did not play
tennis in those days, but I do know that the old valse <i>&agrave;
six temps</i>, danced to the tune of &lsquo;Myosotis&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;Bingen on the Rhine&rsquo;, by two perfectly-matched
partners who looked as if they were moving as one body on soundless
roller skates was a lovelier thing to behold than the fox-trots (or
whatever they are now called) of to-day.</p>

<p>One did not dance all day and every day then, and it would have
been thought the height of bad form to dance in an hotel or in any
public place. But everybody who had a house of any size in London
gave private dances&mdash;one or two during the season. If you had
a parquet floor in your &lsquo;double drawing-room&rsquo; so much
the better; but there was a special kind of drugget, very shiny and
very slippery which could be stretched over your Wilton carpet and
was excellent to dance on.</p>

<p>After a while public dances did begin to creep in; at first, for
those who stood on the less exalted rungs of the social ladder in
the shape of Cinderellas at the local town halls. Those at the
Kensington Town Hall were very popular, and, of course, there were
others; but until well within this century entertaining by a
Society hostess in an hotel or other public place was out of the
question. Nor was it good form for ladies to dine in restaurants.
As a matter of fact, London, in the matter of restaurants, was far
behind every other city in Europe&mdash;restaurants, that is, to
which ladies could go. It is quite amazing, when you come to think
of it, how recent some of these innovations actually are with which
we are so absolutely familiar to-day.</p>

<p>Tea-shops, for instance. I remember when I first was an
art-student in London there wasn&rsquo;t such a thing as a tea-shop
anywhere near where we&mdash;the girl-students&mdash;could go and
get some lunch or a cup of tea. The only places of the sort were
the &lsquo;Zoedone&rsquo;. In the &rsquo;nineties they were very
rough and quite impossible to go to, though perfectly well
conducted. Tea, coffee, or cocoa was served over the counter at
three-halfpence a cup. I remember the joy and excitement caused by
the opening of the first A.B.C. shop close to Oxford Circus. I can
only speak for art-students, but I am sure that every girl or
woman-worker in the neighbourhood felt that the era of luxurious
living had dawned on good old London at last.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Did we enjoy life less, I wonder, then? Did we find those
restrictions irksome? I don&rsquo;t know. We didn&rsquo;t miss
cocktails or cigarettes simply because we had never tasted them.
And as we did not lead quite such a strenuous life&mdash;driving in
a brougham or a growler was nothing like so nerve-racking as taking
your life in your hands in a two-seater in London traffic
to-day&mdash;we had no need to &lsquo;buck ourselves up&rsquo; with
gin and vermouth.</p>

<p>Slowly, however, the cigarette habit crept in more and more; but
it was not so very long ago&mdash;I was already married at the time
and dining in restaurants had become more general&mdash;that I went
with my husband and two other men friends to dine at what was the
old Florence in Rupert Street. When we came to our after-dinner
coffee we all lighted cigarettes, and I was at once pounced upon by
the manager and told that smoking for ladies was not allowed in a
public room.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We had never, of course, heard of night clubs, and I think I am
right in stating that the only two ladies&rsquo; clubs in the
London of the &rsquo;nineties were the Albermarle and the Alexandra
in Grosvenor Street. The Albermarle was what was then called a
&lsquo;cock and hen&rsquo; club, men being admitted both as members
and visitors, but the hall porter at the Alexandra would not have
permitted a creature wearing trousers into the club save over his
dead body. It was said of the Alexandra in those days that it was
easier to enter the Kingdom of Heaven than the membership of the
club.</p>

<p>A motion put to the committee to permit husbands or brothers to
enter public rooms and have tea with a member was rejected by an
overwhelming majority, the ladies of the committee remarking that
were such a thing allowed it would become impossible for a member
to leave her daughters unchaperoned at the club whilst she herself
went out shopping.</p>

<p>Music-halls, of course, were out of the question until the happy
day when the Princess of Wales went to the Alhambra&mdash;I think
it was the Alhambra or else the Empire&mdash;to witness a special
gala performance. Her presence then at a music-hall gave the latter
the required <i>cache</i> and from that time forth ladies went
openly to the better-class music halls. They had done it before, of
course, but always hoping that none of their friends would be there
to see them.</p>

<p>It was in &rsquo;ninety-two that Lottie Collins sang her
celebrated song &lsquo;Tarara-boom-de-ay&rsquo;, at the old
Pavilion. Everyone flocked to see her and I can&rsquo;t help
thinking that Lottie had as much to do with bringing society ladies
to the halls as the gracious Princess herself.</p>

<p>The days of Vauxhall and Rosherville Gardens were dead and gone
before my time, but the exhibitions at Earl&rsquo;s Court were
immensely successful and bore a great share in the social life of
vanishing London. &lsquo;The Fisheries&rsquo;, the
&lsquo;Healtheries&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Colinderies&rsquo;; I have
often wondered why they were given up, with their pretty gardens,
their outdoor caf&eacute;s and bands; they were a solace and a joy
to jaded London workers. The labyrinth of flats which occupy the
site on which those exhibitions were held are so much less
attractive.</p>

<p>The Earl&rsquo;s Court exhibitions were very successful for a
time. In the neighbourhood of Kensington, with its teeming
population, they must have been a great boon. For the large sum of
half-a-guinea you could go in every evening for three months; if it
was fine you could sit outside and listen to the band, and if wet,
the buildings were large enough to accommodate you and the band as
well. And now a wilderness of flats has taken the place of the
pretty Earl&rsquo;s Court Gardens.</p>

<p>One of the charms of those old gardens for those of us who lived
on the unfashionable side of the Park were the evenings which one
could spend there during those summers when we had what got to be
known as &lsquo;Queen&rsquo;s weather&rsquo;. Dear old V.R. was
always credited with bringing fine weather with her whenever she
drove out (she could no longer get out of her carriage, poor dear),
and there were some lovely evenings when one could stroll about the
very pretty gardens and listen to one or other of those really fine
military bands which are second to none anywhere in Europe,
whatever our German cook might say.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Apart from those unsophisticated amusements the military
pageants were always a great joy. They were exceptionally fine
during Diamond Jubilee year and were constantly to be seen in the
streets of London for the delight of us all, young and old, London
and visitors. Crowds of sightseers followed in their wake, as they
marched past with their splendid bands and joined in with them to
sing (or yell?) &lsquo;Soldiers of the Queen&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
British Grenadiers&rsquo;. Were there ever before or since such
splendid inspiring tunes?</p>

<p>I know we have &lsquo;Land of Hope and Glory&rsquo; now, and I
for one adore it, but try &lsquo;Soldiers of the Queen&rsquo; next
time you see the Guards ride by in their glittering panoply of
cuirass and helmet, on their magnificent horses and you will see
what I mean. All I know is that in that wonderful jubilee year men,
women and children were boisterously happy and proud to witness
&lsquo;the glory and pageant of our world-wide Empire on which the
sun never sets&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Our German cook said to me one day in her halting English,
&ldquo;Madam, please what it means the sun never sets? I saw
yesterday a bee-utiful sunzet. The English are liars. Not?&rdquo; I
tried to explain but failed to convince. Nor was Minna
over-impressed by the galas, marches past, the pomp and array of
our military parades. She had seen, so she assured me, much finer
ones in Berlin.</p>

<p>I must say I loved it all. Colour, movement, the splendid
appearance of the Guards, the horses, the uniforms, all those
things always appealed to me. And I felt a little lump in my throat
when I saw the crowd outside St. Paul&rsquo;s cathedral waiting to
catch a glimpse of a little old lady in black who was too feeble to
get down from her carriage, while the organ pealed from within the
sacred building and the voice of the Archbishop of Canterbury, of
the clergy and of the immense congregation inside and out intoned
the prayers for her health and welfare.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Skating-rinks had in the meanwhile become the rage all over
England as great a rage as dancing is to-day. But even the huge
buildings built at enormous cost for this passing whim failed to
hold the fancy of later London. Yet the &lsquo;moderns&rsquo; of
forty years ago loved their skating. They went to the rinks in huge
parties, and experts and beginners went round and round and round,
very much in the way that they go round and round a dancing-floor
to-day. The only difference that strikes one now is that at the
skating-rink at a given moment, an attendant would blow a whistle
when every skater had to turn and go round the other way. Why this
was done I do not know.</p>

<p>Society, however&mdash;I mean Society with a capital
&lsquo;S&rsquo;&mdash;did not patronize roller-skating. Against
that, skating on artificial ice at Prince&rsquo;s Club in
Knightsbridge was the height of fashion in the middle
&rsquo;nineties. But the craze was of short duration. Skating
requires more practice, <i>i.e.</i> hard work, than most
fashionable women of those days cared to bestow on mere sport, and
nothing in the world is quite so dead as a fashion which has ceased
to please.</p>

<p>Indeed, London has had its nice old face lifted. There is hardly
a shop on its new Regent Quadrant that was there when the houses
were low and stuccoed and coated with London grime and redolent of
the sentiment of a bygone age. Louise, the great and wonderful
hat-shop; Lewis &amp; Allenby, reminiscent of lovely Kate Terry,
afterwards Mrs. Lewis&rsquo; the Stereoscopic Company where one
stood and gazed at the photographs in the shop windows of the
fashionable beauties of the day: lovely Lillie Langtry, Mrs.
Cornwallis West, Lady Londonderry in gorgeous tiara, Lady Dudley,
and always, always, the exquisite Princess of Wales. . . .</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10" id=

</h2>

<p>One of our greatest delights was the theatre. The English stage
was waking out of its three-hundred-year-old torpor, and beginning
to realize that it was heir to the great traditions, not of
Shakespeare alone as so many seemed to think, but of Wycherley and
Marlowe, of Massinger and Beaumont and Fletcher and of Sheridan.
The days of artistic insularity which acclaimed everything that was
foreign and condemned everything that was English were slowly but
surely passing away, the days when <i>The School for Scandal</i>
was hissed off the stage and Sheridan bowing to the hostile
audience spoke his prophetic words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen you have seen fit to damn my play:
let me tell you that my play will live, long after you are all dead
and . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English stage was then and for many years after on its hands
and knees in unqualified admiration of France. The days of the
glorification of Russia had not yet dawned and France, of her
Corneille, and of her Racine, her Moli&egrave;re and her
Beaumarchais, of her Dumas and her de Musset, of France who had
proclaimed with trumpet calls the glories of her immortal stage,
whilst England remained meek and dumb and accepted the rebuke that
but for Shakespeare (who according to his continental admirers was
not English at all but a sort of international freak) there was no
such thing as English drama, no such person as an English
dramatist.</p>

<p>Oh! France does know, none better, how to appreciate her great
men, and how to compel the rest of the cultured world to join in
her glorification of them, and we honour and admire her for that,
but at the time England was all jumble and content to accept
adaptations of <i>La Dame de chez Maxime,</i> of <i>Le
Contr&ocirc;leur des Wagons-Lits,</i> or <i>Occupes toi
d&rsquo;Am&eacute;lie</i>, and of the melodramas of Victorien
Sardou or Victor Hugo.</p>

<p>But that time was surely, if slowly, passing away. Tom Robertson
and Albery had delighted us with their charming innocuous comedies,
H. J. Byron was making us laugh at <i>Our Boys</i> without having
recourse too often to that perfectly revolting form of humour,
&lsquo;puns&rsquo;, and Henry Arthur Jones was showing us in the
<i>Middleman</i> and the <i>Silver King</i> what a fine and
impressive work of art a good well-constructed melodrama could
be.</p>

<p>Irving, of course, in conjunction with lovely Ellen Terry showed
us all that could be done in the way of artistic excellence in
theatrical production. Not only did he give us Shakespeare at his
best as the great Phelps had done it before him, but he introduced
to us that delightfully romantic dramatist W. G. Wills.
Irving&rsquo;s impersonation of his Charles I, or of The Vicar of
Wakefield (how lovely Ellen Terry was as Olivia) stand out as among
the finest theatrical events of those barren years.</p>

<p>And presently A. W. Pinero burst upon the theatrical firmament
as a newly-discovered star of the first magnitude, as great in
thrilling dramas as in side-splitting farces. We loved him when he
gave us <i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i>, loved him more than ever
when he gave us <i>The Gay Lord Quex</i> (which by the way was
severely criticized by a goodly section of the Press), and just
adored him when we laughed ourselves silly over <i>The Magistrate,
The School Mistress,</i> and so many others. Indeed the theatre was
now giving us ardent playgoers all the intellectual enjoyment we
could possibly crave for.</p>

<p>We used to have great fun with the plays which we saw, for we
had invented a special game of our own, which will sound not only
silly but certainly very cheeky to many highbrows. The game was not
quite original but was an adaptation of one which the great
Victorian Sardou had indulged in in the early days of his brilliant
career. Whenever a new play was produced we would go and watch the
first two or three acts until the great scene when the plot had
become a tangled skein of dramatic surprise. This, in most cases,
would take place at the end of the third act, with the fourth act
to come. But we did not wait for the fourth act.</p>

<p>We took ourselves and our impressions home and there, in our
inexperienced way, attempted to unravel the tangled skein of the
drama as we in our ignorance thought it should be unravelled. Or
else we would deliberately miss the first act (of a new play),
watch the building up of the story, of which we did not know the
beginning, and at home reconstruct the plot, introducing the
characters whose acquaintance we had made in the subsequent act;
and finally, on another occasion, we would sit through the whole
play and see how far we had been wrong or right in our ideas of
dramatic construction.</p>

<p>It was great fun, and proved most useful in after life, though
we did not know that at that time, and my husband was just as
keenly interested in these intellectual acrobatics as I was. I know
that we both learned a great deal that way, both about the
construction and characterization, and as I was able to help in the
arrangement and composition of pictures, so he was of immense help
to me later on . . . later on when . . . But I am not there
yet.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Let me own up at once that our enjoyment of the theatre was not
always of an intellectual kind. It was not only at the Lyceum that
one could revel in fine productions of Shakespeare and Irving did
delight us in presentations of other characters than Hamlet,
Shylock, and so on. He was thrilling as Bill Sykes in <i>Oliver
Twist</i>, and gave us a marrow-freezing impersonation of that most
villainous villain, Louis XI. As for Mephistopheles in Wills&rsquo;
adaptation of Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, it really seemed as if
Nature herself in fashioning Irving&rsquo;s exceptional personality
had deliberately endowed him with every physical attribute
necessary to perfection in the part.</p>

<p>Irving first played Mathias in <i>The Bells</i> (what an
exciting play!) the year that I was born. He woke the next morning
and found himself famous, thus fulfilling the prediction spoken by
Charles Dickens on an earlier occasion: &ldquo;You may take it from
me,&rdquo; the great author had said, &ldquo;that in a few years
young Irving will be the leading actor on the English stage.&rdquo;
He certainly was that for close on half a century, until his tragic
death at Bradford after his remarkable impersonation of Lord
Tennyson&rsquo;s Becket.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The greatest fun of all in the theatrical way we used to get at
the outlying theatres: the old Surrey in Blackfriars Road, or the
Standard Shoreditch. Here we got real melodrama, hot and strong,
especially at the West London theatre just off the Edgware
Road&mdash;to which we often went when we wanted a good laugh.
Melodrama there was what &lsquo;Carados&rsquo; so wittily called
&lsquo;sanguifulminous&rsquo;, and farce was of the broadest. The
stalls cost 1s. 6d. and the dress circle 9d. or 1s. The gallery was
3d. I forget the name of the street where the West London was
situated. Huge flats occupy the old site now. But when I was first
married the pavements were lined on each side with street-vendors
and their stalls lighted up by flares. Shouts of &ldquo;Buy!
Buy!&rdquo; greeted you to right and left as you tried to make your
way through a dense crowd to the theatre door.</p>

<p>Outside the theatre your eyes were gladdened by a magnificent
giant clad in what had once been a gold-braided uniform. He
controlled the &lsquo;queue&rsquo; with a mixture of chaff and
physical energy which would have done credit to Patrick Mulvaney.
Having paid 1s. 6d. for your stall and thus belonging to the
&eacute;lite among the public a &lsquo;chef&rsquo;, dressed in
traditional white, cap and all, was there ready to sell you ham
sandwiches, while the programme girls offered you lemonade and
oranges. There was also a chucker-out of large proportions,
gorgeously attired, standing down in the stalls, who, whenever
gallery of pit-ites became at all boisterous or started pelting the
audience with orange peel&mdash;which they often did&mdash;would
shout up to them in a stentorian voice: &ldquo;Now then, ladies and
gentlemen, up there, horder; horder! Or do you want me to come up
to yer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently the ladies and gentlemen did not desire such an
eventuality for &lsquo;horder&rsquo; was soon restored. Those who
had personal acquaintance with this magnificent chucker-out avoided
contact with him. I saw him once &lsquo;come up&rsquo; to two young
men who had had &lsquo;one over the eight&rsquo; and were shouting
out rude remarks at the leading lady, whilst throwing a shower of
orange peel at the audience in the stalls. After two stentorian but
ineffectual summons of &ldquo;horder! horder! gentlemen in the
pit&rdquo;, he seized the offenders by their coat collars, lifted
them over into the back of the stalls, ran them out of the house
and pitched them out into the street, the whole operation not
taking more than a few minutes. He was worth his salary, whatever
it was. It was said of this athletic gentleman that he had been a
famous boxer at one time and a great man in the ring.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Oh! we saw some wonderful thrillers there. All the best that men
like Paul Merritt, Andrew Melville, Arthur Shirley and so on had
given to West End audiences at the Adelphi, marrow-freezing dramas
like <i>Susan Hopley</i> or <i>The Vicissitudes of a Servant
Girl</i> (what a perfect title for a play!, <i>Lady Audley&rsquo;s
Secret, The Lonely Man of the Ocean,</i> and so many others the
names of which it would take too long to enumerate. The one thing
all these thrillers had in common was their moral tendency. This
was always above reproach. Virtue was inevitably triumphant in the
end. Vice, as exemplified by the villain, brought about its own
chastisement; and comedy was always on the side of virtue.</p>

<p>The low comedy couple got all its laughs against the villain:
and the latter never got a laugh save one of derision at his final
discomfiture. Yes! the &lsquo;trend&rsquo; of melodrama at the
Surrey, the Standard and the West London was essentially moral and
&lsquo;elevating&rsquo;, and magistrates who nowadays when passing
sentence on youthful delinquents so often ascribe their fall from
rectitude to the baneful influence of the cinema, had never a word
to say against the theatre.</p>

<p>I remember there was a very successful play in which the villain
was a Turk. You knew at once that he was a Turk because he wore a
scarlet fez and a huge diamond crescent on his breast. He arrived
on the scene in a motor-car&mdash;a cardboard one but most
realistic. It honked in the wings in a most impressive manner. He
was dressed in a frock coat and pepper and salt trousers. He was a
real sanguinary villain. The moment he appeared you knew at once
that he was a villainous villain because of the effect of his black
moustache, the points of which stuck up almost to his eyes. The low
comedy couple saw through him at once, for they were very rude to
him and spoke of him always as &lsquo;the black-and-tan beauty in a
tea cosy&rsquo;.</p>

<p>But <i>the</i> most remarkable and successful play we saw here
was <i>The Worst Woman in London</i>. It had a long run of thirty
performances as against the usual weekly change of programme. There
was a villainess this time. She was a &lsquo;vamp&rsquo; and a
French governess. In the opening scene the lady of the house said
that she was not altogether satisfied with the new French governess
whom she had engaged for the children indeed she felt there was
something amiss with her. This was scarcely surprising for that
lady presently appeared for luncheon in what was described on the
playbill as an &lsquo;aristocratic English country house&rsquo;
dressed in a very low-necked black satin dress covered all over
with sequins; she displayed also a vast expanse of back and a very
magnificent pair of arms and wore a huge black hat decorated with
long trailing feathers. Moreover, she was smoking a cigarette in a
very long holder.</p>

<p>The audience with a sigh of excited anticipation, &lsquo;settled
down to it&rsquo;, as it were. They had spotted the villainy
concealed behind these gorgeous appurtenances of sequins and
cigarette smoke even though the dignified lady of the house was no
more than slightly puzzled at the governess&rsquo;s appearance. We
didn&rsquo;t see the children. Presumably they lunched
upstairs.</p>

<p>In Act II as the plot warmed up so did the governess&rsquo;s
attire. She wore a gown of the same cut, very low back and front
and diminutive about the shoulders, but this time it was green and
covered with shimmering green beads. (Fortunately in those days
dresses were always long or I shudder to think of the length of leg
she would have displayed.) In Act III the lady wore yellow and a
multitude of glittering gold sequins; and in the final act, which
took place in her bedroom, her dress&mdash;what there was of
it&mdash;consisted exclusively as far as we could see of bright red
sequins. On this occasion she forestalled modern fashions by
showing a generous leg encased in red silk stocking which she
displayed when reclining on a sofa, through a slit in her skirt
right up to her waist. She made no attempt at first to go to bed,
but she appeared very agitated.</p>

<p>Things were obviously coming to a climax. She became very
nervous about something or other, and finally gave us to understand
that she would ring for the maid to help her undress. She rang the
bell . . . and immediately through both the windows two policemen
appeared and apprehended her whilst the comic couple entered by the
door and said rude and funny things to her. The audience applauded
frantically and shrieked with delight. There were a number of
curtain calls and the villainess was loudly hissed. The audience
always hissed the villain of the piece and reserved its applause
for the dauntless hero and persecuted heroine. All went away happy
and satisfied and filled with good resolutions and orange
juice.</p>

<p>In connection with <i>The Worst Woman in London</i> it was
rather amusing at the time to note that during its run at the West
London Theatre the stalls (still at 1s. 6d.) were filled with a
fashionable audience who drove down in their broughams and
landaus&mdash;and in full evening dress too&mdash;to see this much
advertised play. The management, dazzled by this unexpected success
thought to transfer the drama to a West End house and opened what
he hoped would be a long run of <i>The Worst Woman in London</i> at
the Adelphi in the Strand. But, funnily enough, the fashionable
playgoer would have none of it there. Hardly any broughams or
landaus deposited lovely ladies in Paris gowns and gentlemen with
starched shirt fronts at the door, and the drama that had thrilled
hundreds at the dirty old playhouse in the Edgware Road played to
empty houses for a fortnight in the West End and was then
withdrawn.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Whenever we were away in the country&mdash;either staying with
friends or just on our own&mdash;-we always made a point of
visiting the local theatre if there was one fairly close by and
many an amusing incident did we witness at these unsophisticated
play-houses. Of course towns like Leeds, or Nottingham, or
Bradford, not to mention Liverpool, Manchester or Birmingham do not
come under this category. The principal houses in those towns known
as the T.R. usually were anything but unsophisticated. The most
important London companies with their latest successes and full
array of scenery, costumes, and properties paid them annual or
bi-annual visits of a week&rsquo;s duration, and the aspect of the
houses on what would be called the fashionable nights when the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of the neighbourhood drove over in full force
to see the show rivalled Covent Garden in magnificence in the way
of Paris gowns, diamonds, and immaculate shirt fronts.</p>

<p>But in the small provincial cities, travelling
companies&mdash;reinforced by local aspirants to the
stage&mdash;afforded great delight to the inhabitants and sometimes
intense amusements to us two young Bohemians possessed of an
unquenchable sense of humour. Just think how delighted you would
have been when witnessing one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s historic
dramas to hear local talent announce with imperturbable solemnity:
&ldquo;My Lord, the Dook is wown-ded.&rdquo; And the response:
&ldquo;What? wown-ded sayest thou?&rdquo; and local talent again
responding: &ldquo;Aye! Mor-tally I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then there were the witches in <i>Macbeth</i> wherein local
talent was very much to the fore. One of these weird characters was
enacted by one of the scene-shifters who had been in the Dragoon
Guards at one time, and had also been a noted amateur actor in his
day and a master of theatrical &lsquo;make-up&rsquo;. It seems that
at rehearsal he had greatly worried the producer by slightly
misquoting a certain line in Act IV, scene i. The words in the text
are: &ldquo;Cool it with a baboon&rsquo;s blood, etc.
etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The producer pulled him up once, then again and even a third
time when he repeated the offence, but the ex-guardsman wholly
unperturbed, invariably gave him the playful advice: &ldquo;Keep
your &rsquo;air on, mister,&rdquo; and added reassuringly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be all right on the night.&rdquo; But &lsquo;on
the night&rsquo; it was not all right; reminiscences of the old
days were too strong for the ex-guardsman, and out of the mouth of
the witch came the sonorous words loud as a clarion call:
&ldquo;Cool it with a dragon&rsquo;s blood . . .&rdquo; followed
immediately by a resounding expletive: &ldquo;My crumbs! I&rsquo;ve
said it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tableau, as the witch clutched her hair (which being a wig came
off in her hand in its entirety) in an agony of self-deprecation.
As a matter of fact I don&rsquo;t think there were more than half a
dozen in the audience who noticed this lapse from rectitude.</p>

<p>But by far the most amusing &lsquo;lapse from rectitude&rsquo; I
ever witnessed occurred in the T.R. of a small city in an
industrial district somewhere in the Midlands. I won&rsquo;t name
the town, but I am sure there are many of the local townsfolk of
to-day who remember the incident and how thrilling that incident
was. It happened like this. The programme consisted of three
one-act plays. The first a gentle little comedy of love, the scene
of which was laid in an English garden. The second, a real
thriller, was set in the wilds of Africa, and the third in a London
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Local talent was requisitioned for the African scene, savages in
chocolate-coloured tights and head-dresses fashioned of feathers
collected from the neighbouring chicken-runs. They were taught how
to brandish tomahawks and to emit yells of brutish delight at sight
of the English party who had apparently come to the wilds to
explore this outlying part of the British Empire, bringing several
ladies with them who had their hair beautifully waved and wore the
daintiest high-heeled shoes for the purpose of tramping about in
the African jungle.</p>

<p>Of course there was one specially lovely lady (the others
hadn&rsquo;t much to do) whose hair had recently been
&lsquo;inecto-ed&rsquo; and who had been far-seeing enough to bring
her best frocks and silk stockings along with her. And there was
the gallant hero who was in love with her and who had brought her
along with him on this expedition for the express purpose of
winning her regard with his dauntless courage when fighting lions
and crocodiles on her behalf. We did not see the lions and
crocodiles but the lady told us all about her young man&rsquo;s
valour in fighting the denizens of the jungle and how safe she
would always feel under his protection even if a whole herd of
cannibal savages were to attack her and threaten her life.</p>

<p>The cannibal savages in chocolate-coloured tights had been
instructed as to the exact moment when with wild
&ldquo;whoops!&rdquo; they were suddenly to enter with a rush upon
the scene and there behold the hero and heroine in the jungle
having a heart-rending love scene locked in each other&rsquo;s
arms. They were then to bounce with unearthly sounding yells upon
the loving couple and tomahawk the hero or rather endeavour to do
so, and only failing owing to the latter&rsquo;s superhuman valour
in defending his beloved with a revolver, killing every one of the
cannibals who fell in a heap all over the floor, raising a cloud of
dust from the boards.</p>

<p>It was a most thrilling, marrow-freezing scene which, the
theatre posters announced, had drawn crowded audiences for hundreds
of nights in one of the most fashionable theatres in London. The
pay-going public of the city was agog with expectation. Those who
had been privileged to witness the dress rehearsal, friends or
relatives of the manager or the producer declared that never in all
their experience had they witnessed anything so sensational and so
entirely engrossing. The applause on the nights after the final
curtain drop would shatter the roof of the house. This was the
opinion of the producer, the prompter and the leading lady with the
&lsquo;inecto-ed&rsquo; hair. Only the manager felt rather nervous.
It is an old tradition in the theatre that if a dress-rehearsal
goes without a hitch there is sure to be trouble &lsquo;on the
night&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Local talent had been well drilled. The savages knew to within a
few seconds the moment when they were to rush with wild yells upon
the stage. It was a very hot day in mid-July. Local talent like
most other talents was very hot and very excited . . . also
thirsty. The dress-rehearsal had lasted till past six and the turn
of the cannibals was &lsquo;on&rsquo; at thirty-five minutes past
nine. There was plenty of time for supper . . . and drink.</p>

<p>As ill-luck would have it, a slight defect was discovered at the
last moment in the African scenery. Nothing serious and could
easily be repaired. Seamstresses were at once set to work, but it
was going to be a somewhat longer job than had been anticipated;
the manager was appealed to and he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
simple, we&rsquo;ll change the whole programme. We&rsquo;ll have
the drawing-room comedy first, then the pretty little set in the
garden, and keep the African play to the last; that will give
plenty of time for all the mending that is necessary.&rdquo; The
stage manager was ordered to inform all the actors of this change
in the programme, including of course the talented local performers
who were killing time and enjoying life in the bar of The Running
Footman round the corner.</p>

<p>How it all came about and whose fault it was no one ever knew.
It was generally attributed by the Company to the potency of the
Running Footman&rsquo;s whisky. Certain it is that during the
second item in the programme when in the lovely English garden all
flowers and moonlight, the hero was clasping the heroine in his
arms and their lips met in a lingering kiss, the cannibal savages
in chocolate-coloured tights and a multiplicity of feathers came
rushing and scrambling on the stage tumbling upon one another, and
to the accompaniment of unearthly yells and &ldquo;Whoopees&rdquo;
effectually &lsquo;tomahawked; the hero and heroine who, still
clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms, tumbled headlong into the
flowing shrubs below. Tableau and quick curtain.</p>

<p>Thus we certainly had plenty of variety to amuse us during our
early theatre-going days. As one grew older and more sophisticated
one certainly got more intellectual pleasure out of the theatre but
not nearly so much fun. We both enjoyed a good laugh, as I think
most theatre-goers do; even the high-brows. Pinero gave us the best
of laughs in his farces at the Court Theatre, and the wit in Tom
Robertson&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve little comedies and later on in those
of R. C. Carton was always pleasant.</p>

<p>There was one side of stage-craft which has completely died down
since the early days of this century and which, until then,
afforded pleasure to a great many theatre-goers; this was
burlesque. Every successful play and every popular actor had to go
through the ordeal, not always a pleasant one, of being satirized
in a one-act <i>resum&eacute;</i> of his success, often very
cleverly written and constructed. Some dramas lent themselves more
than others to burlesque. The more &lsquo;intense&rsquo; and
soul-stirring they were, the more easily did they lend themselves
to Francis Burnand&rsquo;s or H. J. Byron&rsquo;s or Chance
Newton&rsquo;s caustic pen. One of the most successful burlesques
was <i>Paw Claudian</i>. It lent itself so admirably to
travesty.</p>

<p>Wilson Barrett, whom we all loved for the sake of the past, had
just started a <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> style of costume
which displayed his manly chest, and he rolled out W. G.
Wills&rsquo; verses with his round, sonorous voice and sentimental
diction. Claudian in the original drama was a tyrant of ancient
Rome who, because of some flagrant crime against morality, was
condemned by the gods to live on for ever. Only love could redeem
him in the end and this was accomplished by Miss Eastlake as a
beautiful slave who called him: &ldquo;Master! dear
Master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the burlesque, Johnnie Toole that prince of English
comedians, travestied every attitude, every mannerism of our W. B.,
the bent knee with the pointed toe of one scarlet boot lightly
touching the floor and the wide sweep of arm and hand. And the
beautiful slave spoke to him in mellifluous tones calling him,
&ldquo;Masher! Dear Masher!&rdquo; for this was the period when
smartly dressed young men subsequently called &lsquo;knuts of
Piccadilly&rsquo;, &lsquo;Johnnies&rsquo;, and other things, were
known as &lsquo;mashers&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And that fine actor E. S. Willard, who made such a name for
himself as &lsquo;the Spider&rsquo; in <i>The Silver King</i>,
played a sanctimonious patriarch called the &lsquo;Holy
Clement&rsquo;. In Burnard&rsquo;s travesty he was called the
&lsquo;Coal holey Clement&rsquo; and the Tetrarch of the drama
became the Tea-Tray in the burlesque. . . . Ah, well! !</p>

<p>Another very good burlesque was <i>The Lady of Lyons Married and
Settled</i>, a travesty of Bulwer Lytton&rsquo;s very successful
play. The lady&rsquo;s vicissitudes in the humble surroundings of
the Melnotte household as well as the unfortunate Claude&rsquo;s
grandiloquent lucubrations did certainly lend themselves to satire.
But there! All that is as dead as the dodo. Either taste in such
matters has undergone an entire <i>volte-face</i> or the pens of
our light-hearted dramatists are less caustic than they were, or
what is certain modern drama does not lend itself to burlesque. I
know not. What could any Burnand or Chance Newton do with Bernard
Shaw&rsquo;s plays, with <i>The Walls of Jericho</i>, or <i>The
Only Way</i>, or even <i>Monsieur Beaucaire</i>, all highly
successful plays with great popular favourites in the principal
parts? I think that <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> would have lent
itself admirably to burlesque, had not burlesque been sacrificed by
then on the funeral pyre of popular taste.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I have been tempted to speak more of our theatre-going days than
I had originally intended: but as a matter of fact the theatre did
play a very important part in the first days of my married life. We
had made the acquaintance of Robert Arthur, proprietor of the
Coronet and one or two other suburban theatres of a high order
where West End successes were always presented for a week&rsquo;s
run each in their turn, and with the original West End companies
during the autumn months. The manager of the Coronet in Notting
Hill Gate, Mr. Edward Lytton, was always very kind in placing a box
at our disposal whenever we wanted to go, which was pretty often.
Since then the Coronet has fallen from grace and finally succumbed
to the tentacles of the cinema, as did most&mdash;if not
all&mdash;the suburban theatres in London. But at the time it was
as smart and as comfortable as any West End House and the audience,
from South Kensington and Belgravia mostly, was as fashionable as
anyone would have wished to see.</p>

<p>There were no &lsquo;amusing incidents&rsquo; at the Coronet
comparable with those at the Surrey or the West London Theatre; no
tomahawking at the wrong moment or doubtful speaking of the text of
the &lsquo;immortal&rsquo; bard. But I do recall one rather funny
incident which amused us very much, but greatly upset the genial
manager of the Coronet. It happened during the rehearsals of the
Christmas pantomime. There was no suburban theatre in those days
without its annual pantomime, fairy queen, principal boy, comic
relief, harlequinade, transformation scene and all: and all very
decorous and &lsquo;vestal virgin-ish&rsquo; tights and so on, not
in the least <i>&agrave; la Folies Berg&egrave;re</i> or what the
English public simply called &lsquo;French&rsquo; in those
days.</p>

<p>But it seems that on this occasion, the fairies of the ballet
complained to the stage manager and to the costumiers that the
tights which had been put out ready for them to put on were
&lsquo;damp&rsquo;: they had just come home from the wash and had
not been properly aired. Indignation of the ladies in charge of the
costumes and of the stage-manager, for the fairies threatened that
they would not come on in damp tights. The stage manager
complaining to the manager in the presence of the obstreperous
fairies said in his wrath that he supposed these ladies would
prefer to &lsquo;go on&rsquo; without tights, <i>i.e.</i> with
naked legs.</p>

<p>Whereupon the fairies, a prey to virtuous indignation declared
that they had never been so insulted in all their lives and
threatened a general strike unless a complete apology were
immediately tendered them. Well! if those same fairies could have
seen a vision of the fairies and other denizens of the ballets of
to-day, what I wonder would have been their thoughts on that vital
subject.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was also about this time that we laid the foundation of very
friendly relations with &lsquo;old Man Russell&rsquo;, as he was
familiarly called and with his family. The old man was the writer
of those famous songs: &lsquo;Cheer boys, cheer&rsquo;,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good time coming, boys&rsquo;, &lsquo;To the
West&rsquo;, and many others which did so much good work in
bringing the minds of young people to the thought of starting a new
life in the colonies. They were excellent propaganda, those songs,
far more stirring than the speeches in Toynbee Hall. The Government
thought very highly of them and of their composer&mdash;whom it
aided financially in their publication and dissemination.</p>

<p>Old Man Russell was the father of that one very popular nautical
novelist, W. Clark Russell. At the time that we first knew old man
Russell he was already very much an old man but he was full of fun
and vitality, and many a jolly evening did we spend in his house
while he played and sang (yes, sang, thought I think he was over
seventy then) not only his own stirring ballads but the latest
music-hall ditties.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *<br>

<p>It was not till towards the end of the century that ladies ever
went to music halls. It was not thought to be &lsquo;the
thing&rsquo; for them to be seen there; there was supposed to be a
certain atmosphere in the halls which was not pure enough for young
or old ladies to breathe. Anyway, the variety shows were taboo to
the fashionable world (except of course to the men who never
dreamed of bringing their family with them to these abodes of
iniquity). One didn&rsquo;t go to music halls and that was that. It
was not until Mrs. Ormiston Chaunt carried on her successful
campaign against the &lsquo;promenades&rsquo; in the halls and
their habitu&eacute;s that the taboo was gradually lifted.</p>

<p>Smart ladies who held liberal views on subjects such as the
independence and privileges of women joined in the controversy
which raged around Mrs. Chaunt, familiarly known in the Press as
&lsquo;the prude on the prowl&rsquo;, and her purity campaign. They
were classed as New Women, wore divided skirts, smoked cigarettes,
and discussed the case of Oscar Wilde in public. What their views
were on the subject of &lsquo;promenades&rsquo; is rather difficult
to determine. They certainly flooded the daily Press with
correspondence, this sharing public favour and self-advertisement
with those ladies who had such a lot to say on another engrossing
subject: &lsquo;Is Marriage a Failure&rsquo; carried on the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> by a well-known feminine light in
contemporary literature.</p>

<p>And suddenly the whole controversy was settled in an unexpected
manner, when H.R.H. the Princess of Wales went to the Alhambra to
witness a variety show organized for the benefit of some charity or
other. This of course settled the matter. Where the Princess of
Wales went, there could every Duchess and every Mrs. Ponsonby de
Tomkins be also seen to advantage, diamonds, Paris gowns and all.
There followed the golden era of music halls and variety talent.
Where the smart set went, the respectable masses who had hitherto
held aloof naturally followed suit. This golden era, however, did
not last very long. It has in its turn been largely ousted by the
cinema.</p>

<p>Personally I never cared much for the &lsquo;halls&rsquo;. There
were, of course, a few real artistes among the usual variety talent
whom one could not fail to appreciate and admire, but there was
such a lot of vulgarity and boredom to endure for the sake of a few
minutes of real pleasure (such as Vesta Tilley&rsquo;s male
impersonations, Marie Lloyd&rsquo;s songs or Albert
Chevalier&rsquo;s pathos) that we very seldom wasted an evening
that way. The only hall which appealed to we two inveterate
Bohemians was a funny little one under the arches of Charing Cross
Bridge where aspirants to fame were given a trial with a view to a
possible engagement in one or the other of the important halls.
Thus they were &lsquo;tried on the dog&rsquo;, as the ordeal was
called, and many a famous artiste started his or her career under
the &lsquo;old arches&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I remember seeing there the d&eacute;but of the Levy sisters,
who became such favourites and made such fortunes afterwards. There
was no stage at the &lsquo;Old Arches&rsquo;, only a platform in
the centre of the hall, where sat enthroned the manager at a
rostrum when he announced each item of the programme together with
the name of the artiste about to perform and tapped the desk before
him with a wooden hammer. The audience sat on seats and benches all
round the central platform, very much as they do round a
prize-ring. A few privileged members in the audience were permitted
to sit on the platform with the manager, but this privilege
entailed the obligation to pay for that gentleman&rsquo;s
drinks.</p>

<p>Yes! those early days of our married life were indeed jolly and
happy and, above all, care-free. We had plenty of work to occupy us
and plenty of ways to amuse ourselves. Our boy was born the last
year of the century.</p>

<p>We were both of us great readers and it was
interesting&mdash;yes! and stimulating&mdash;to witness the gradual
infiltration of American light literature into the hitherto rather
close borough of English fiction.</p>

<p>Many of us had always loved our Bret Harte. I was a passionate
worshipper at his shrine. I still feel, even to this day, that no
other author with the exception of Dickens has ever come near him
either in pathos or in humour, and I loved his own devotion to
Dickens.</p>

<p><i>Dickens in Camp</i> is such a wonderful tribute from one
great writer to another. I hate to think of Bret Harte as being
&lsquo;out of date&rsquo;, as I was assured by a young highbrow
recently that he certainly was: and, talking with young moderns
sometimes about books and so on, it has often made my heart ache to
hear them quite casually say that though they may have heard of
Bret Harte&mdash;&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he U.S. Consul at
Glasgow?&rdquo; they would ask&mdash;but they had never read any of
his books. Fancy never having read: <i>How Santa Claus came to
Simpson&rsquo;s Bar,</i> or <i>The Outcasts of Poker Flat.</i>
Well! well! Of course since then Mr. Sinclair Lewis has come along
and Mrs. Edith Wharton and <i>Anthony Adverse</i> and <i>Gone with
the Wind</i>, and thousands of us subscribers to circulating
libraries are profoundly and humbly grateful to them for the many
happy hours we have spent with their enthralling works, imbibing
knowledge of their wonderful country and their social conditions,
getting to know America and casting away our silly prejudices and
ignorant imaginings.</p>

<p>Oh yes! we say &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; to them with a full
heart, but don&rsquo;t let us forget in our admiration for them
their fine &lsquo;old-fashioned&rsquo; authors: Hawthorne, their
poet, Longfellow, and above all their sublime Bret Harte, the man
who poetized the <i>Wild West</i> which the cinema has since then
done its best to vulgarize. I for one like to think of him in his
own beautiful words:</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll always think of you<br>
As the thing we could not take away<br>
The balsam that dwells in the wood<br>
The rainbow that lives in a spray.&rdquo;</p>

</h2>

<p>And then it all happened. Everything happened when I least
expected it. I didn&rsquo;t know it was coming. Three months before
I didn&rsquo;t know that it was coming. But it came. And in such
funny ways. Step by step. Silly steps, that did not seem of any
importance as they occurred. Links in the chain of life! That is
what they were, but I didn&rsquo;t know it. I didn&rsquo;t as much
as feel that the chain was nearing its completion with all those
links so closely connected one with the other, the first in the
plains of Hungary and the last in a London suburb.</p>

<p>Our lease of the studio flat had come to an end. The block was
about to be pulled down to make room for more commodious flats.
Anyway, we would have to move if not this year at any rate soon,
and in the meanwhile my husband had a lot of work on hand and
needed a studio. Residential studios were not easy to find. But
there was a house, a dear little house at the back of High Street,
Kensington, a house with a bit of a garden and in the garden a
really good studio. Well! that was going to be all right, but the
house would not be vacant for another year.</p>

<p>Worth waiting for? Why certainly. It was quite ideal, and we
would manage somehow, though we really had to move out of the
studio flat right away. Our plans were quickly made. This was the
last year of the century, and it was nearing its end. In six
month&rsquo;s time the great exhibition in Paris would be full on
and we had long ago made up our minds that we would go to Paris and
see the exhibition. There were only six months in which to be
uncomfortable and homeless. No matter. We would go as p.g.&rsquo;s
to some nice people and take a separate studio somewhere close by.
Go as p.g.&rsquo;s to some nice people! Little did either of us
guess what we were going to owe to that inspiration.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;nice people&rsquo; we hit upon, thanks to an
advertisement in <i>The Times</i>, were Derbyshire folk. These were
father and mother and two girls: well-bred, well educated the lot
of them. Soon we discovered that the mother and both the daughters
had literary ambitions. They wrote stories which they sent round to
magazines on the principle that &lsquo;hope springs eternal&rsquo;
. . . always in the hope that these stories would be accepted for
publication.</p>

<p>We became quite friendly with the family after a week or two and
presently they told us about their literary ambitions and asked us
to give our opinion of their authorship. Taking our consent for
granted they took to reading their stories out loud to us on the
rare evenings when we happened to be in. We listened patiently,
feigning an interest we were far from taking, and gave as
favourable an opinion of these amateurish productions as we
possibly could without perjuring ourselves too flagrantly.</p>

<p>And then one day great excitement in the house. A story by one
of the girls had been accepted for publication by a magazine
belonging to the Aldine Press. The payment for the story was to be
&pound;5. And that is how it all came about. That same evening I
said to my husband: &ldquo;Think of these people who have come from
the wilds of Derbyshire, who know nothing of life, and never have
spoken to anyone who might have taught them something, and yet able
to write stuff good enough for publication!&rdquo; and I added with
a funny kind of twirl in my heart, half shame-faced and
half-appealing: &ldquo;And here I am who have known so many
brilliantly clever people, who have travelled and seen and
appreciated so many marvels of this wide, wide world, who have
studied art and music, history and drama, why shouldn&rsquo;t I try
to write something I would like to know.&rdquo; And my beloved
simply replied: &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was the genesis of my literary career.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>My first effort was a story which ultimately developed into that
popular novel and film <i>The Emperor&rsquo;s Candlesticks.</i> My
husband, who was doing a lot of work at the time for various
Pearson publications, took it to Mr. Everett (as he then was), one
of their principal editors. Of course, like all beginners I had not
taken the precaution to find out anything as to the technical
requirements of magazines: the question of length for instance. My
story was 25,000 words long&mdash;too short for a book and too long
for a magazine story. And so my first effort came back, but not
with that hateful slip, &lsquo;Returned with thanks&rsquo;, but
with a well-gilded pill, a message of encouragement from kind Mr.
Everett. I was of course too inexperienced to contemplate the
lengthening of my story, nor perhaps sufficiently ambitious to
think of it as a work of fiction. What I did do and should have
done from the first was to buy a number of popular magazines and
read their stories, not only for length but for the style and type
of narrative that would answer to their requirements. If only young
aspirants to success would take this precaution how many
disappointments, how many rejection slips would they be spared. (I
have known young writers send a detective story to a religious
publication or a &lsquo;pussy-foot&rsquo; propaganda one to the
<i>Bystander.</i>)</p>

<p>Anyway, common-sense kept me from committing that kind of error.
I felt somehow that Mr. Everett would give me a chance if I could
give him the type of story which his readers liked to find in
Pearson&rsquo;s various magazines. I wrote two, &lsquo;The Red
Carnation&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Juliette: a Tale of the Terror&rsquo;,
and sent them to him&mdash;by post this time. Three days later I
had his reply. He accepted both the stories for publication, one
for <i>Pearson&rsquo;s</i> the other for the <i>Royal</i>, and his
letter ended with a charming invitation to lunch with him and talk
over the future. Both stories accepted and an invitation to lunch
to talk over the future! My future! My joy was unconfined. When I
remembered lunches with the great ones of this earth, with Franz
Liszt and Sir Frederick Leighton, with diplomats and plutocrats
various, they faded into insignificance beside the honour of being
asked to lunch by the editor of a popular magazine who thought I
had a future.</p>

<p>Well! the primary result of that never-to-be-forgotten lunch was
firstly a promise from me that I would submit everything I wrote to
Pearson&rsquo;s in the first instance, and secondly that, at any
rate for the time being, I would be paid &pound;10 for every
contribution accepted for publication. I was in the seventh heaven
of delight: and so was my darling husband, whose joy in my initial
success was as great as mine. How true is the proverb: &lsquo;A joy
shared is twice a joy!&rsquo; Now we could go to Paris with a happy
heart&mdash;and we went.</p>

<p>My husband collected a plentiful supply of orders for
illustrations, both black and white and coloured illustrations,
among others for my story &lsquo;Juliette&rsquo; to be published in
the <i>Royal</i>. Editors liked the idea of these being done, and
of course inspired in Paris. &ldquo;Send us something, Mr.
Barstow,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;that is really Parisian. Just get
your inspiration from that exhibition we hear so much about and put
some of your beautiful touch into the work.&rdquo; That was as
encouraging for my dear one, as Mr. Everett&rsquo;s final words to
me: &ldquo;Send us as much stuff as you care to write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My first reaction to Mr. Everett&rsquo;s encouraging words began
on one dank and foggy evening. We had spent a happy afternoon
(weren&rsquo;t we always happy?) in the National Gallery, where we
had gone to see the Velasquez recently purchased by the nation: the
exquisitely painted nude figure of a woman&rsquo;s back (flippantly
dubbed by the impertinent: &lsquo;One good stern deserves
another&rsquo;). We came home by &rsquo;bus&mdash;the good old
horse &rsquo;bus it was then&mdash;which took us past Westbourne
Park Station, over the bridge on the canal known in those parts as
&lsquo;The Cut&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It was while we were lumbering over the bridge that I had an
inspiration, I simply can&rsquo;t call it anything else for it
meant a great deal to me for some time after that. The fog had
descended in all its grim-faced abomination. The horses were going
at foot-pace. Through the darkness and the fog one could just
vaguely distinguish the turbid water of The Cut, and the dim
outline of a barge slowly drawing out from under one of the arches.
All so dark, so gloomy, so silent and mysterious, and the thought
came to me of the many deeds of darkness that could be (that were
probably) accomplished under this cover of fog and of gloom.</p>

<p>It was out of that first thought and from that grim background
of murkiness which could almost be felt, that the whole concept of
a series of stories of detection and crime came to my mind. I had
never thought of crime and detection before, but I did then. All I
knew of the subject was what I read in the newspapers; the crime,
the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, the police court and all the rest. But
as soon as I got home I broached the matter to my husband, as I
always did. He liked the idea and thought that if written in not
too &lsquo;sanguifulminous&rsquo; a way the stories might be very
successful. He was nothing if not practical, and the first advice
he gave me was to try and think of an original character&mdash;yes,
<i>original</i>, he insisted, around whose personality I could
build my stories of crime.</p>

<p>That personality must in no way be reminiscent of Sherlock
Holmes, that at the height of that interesting gentleman&rsquo;s
popularity. And I must &lsquo;say it as shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;,
that &lsquo;Old Man in the Corner&rsquo;, as I conceived him, was
in no way reminiscent of any other character in detective fiction.
I thought of him even before I embarked on that popular series of
stories, of him and his big checked ulster, of his horn-rimmed
spectacles, his cracked voice and dribbling nose, but above all of
his lean, bony fingers, fidgeting, always fidgeting with a bit of
string.</p>

<p>That was my first reaction to definite encouragement. The second
was my determination to reconstruct my story, &lsquo;The
Emperor&rsquo;s Candlesticks&rsquo;, which had been found to be too
long for a magazine story and too short for a book. As a matter of
fact this did not turn out to be as difficult as I had anticipated.
My brain was then seething with all sorts of ideas, and the nucleus
of &lsquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s Candlesticks&rsquo; was a good one!
It had been written in a hurry, avoiding all explanations and
descriptions which I then thought would be irrelevant and
unnecessary. I thought that brevity was an invaluable asset in the
armoury of short story writing. The work of making the story a
suitable length did not take me more than a fortnight. In its
revised form I sent it to Mr. Everett, who was kind enough to
approve of it and recommend it to his firm for publication.</p>

<p><i>The Emperor&rsquo;s Candlesticks</i> was duly published in
the autumn of 1899. Its appearance coincided with Kruger&rsquo;s
ultimatum to Great Britain, immediately followed by the outbreak of
the Boer War. My first effort, like many first efforts during that
eventful year, fell quite flat. I believe that only ninety copies
were sold. Somehow I did not break my heart over that initial
failure. I was interested in my stories of detection and crime and
in my funny old man with his piece of string, and ready to give my
whole mind to the proposed series.</p>

<p>And so we were both of us well-armed with work that would keep
us busy for some time and we went off to Paris gay and happy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12" id=
"Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
1900 - 1901</b>
</h2>

<p>We found Paris all over exhibition and <i>fin de
si&egrave;cle.</i> Everything was <i>fin de si&egrave;cle,</i>
revues, plays, dress, manners, customs, everything. The
emancipation of women was in full swing. The French, hitherto in
the rearguard of the movement, threw themselves whole-heartedly
into it to celebrate the death of the old century. French ladies
became reckless: they danced, they puffed at cigarettes, they went
unaccompanied to restaurants, they qualified for admission to one
or two of the liberal professions: they passed their
<i>doctorat</i> and qualified for jurisprudence. Only of votes for
women there was no question. That was English and, of course,
ridiculous.</p>

<p>We were well-hated during this time. The French man in the
street was heartily pro-Boer. The English were after the gold over
there. <i>S&rsquo;ils n&rsquo;avaient fait que planter des pommes
de terre . . .</i> was the slogan. (If they, the Boers, the brave,
peaceable agriculturists had only planted potatoes the wicked
grasping English would never have molested them.) The comic papers
were full of virulent articles and pictures representing the
British lion in every kind of humiliating posture.</p>

<p>There was one absolutely scurrilous cartoon which confronted us
at the kiosks and corners of every street, and which those of us
who happened to see it then, cannot quite forgive even now. It
showed Queen Victoria lying across Kruger&rsquo;s knee and being
whipped by two attendant Boers. In the music-halls there was
invariably a one-act sketch representing the handsome manly Boer
and the long-legged cringing English soldier in short scarlet tunic
tilting at the Boer with a tin sword which curled up as soon as it
touched the enemy&rsquo;s noble bosom, and the Boer then knocking
the English soldier down, putting his foot on the latter&rsquo;s
neck and inflicting chastisement upon him with a riding-whip.</p>

<p>The Englishman on the stage and in the comic papers always had
red hair and side-whiskers and a huge mouth with large yellow
teeth. English women were represented wearing early Victorian
dresses, yellow straw boaters, long moth-eaten fur boas. They had
huge feet and hands and huge teeth. There was a scurrilous
publication called <i>V&rsquo;l&agrave; les Angliches</i> with a
picture cover of Joan of Arc at the stake, of English sportsmen
decoying crocodiles by tying children to stumps of trees on the
shores of infested rivers, and English women in early-Victorian
dresses photographing emaciated Hindoos and children in the last
stages of starvation.</p>

<p>In the shops the former legend &lsquo;English spoken&rsquo; was
changed to &lsquo;U.S. spoken&rsquo;. One amusing incident I recall
which made us laugh, for it was characteristic of the attitude of
every class of Frenchman at the time. A couple of <i>cochers</i>
were having an altercation on the Boulevard. Each driver had drawn
rein in order to give his language full scope. What the origin of
the quarrel was we didn&rsquo;t know, but abuse and a variety of
expletives flew backwards and forwards together with copious
spittings and cracking of whips. Neither of the antagonists was
getting the last word. Both were egged on by the crowd that had
speedily gathered round them. They had called each other every kind
of abusive name under the sun, <i>cochon</i> and <i>chien</i> and
<i>l&acirc;che</i> being the most favoured. Backwards and forwards
did the insulting words fly from mouth to mouth, and it seemed as
if they would go on flying until the middle of next week, the
gendarme, by the way, never attempting to interfere, when suddenly
one of the belligerents, standing upon his box and shaking his fist
at his antagonist, yelled at the top of his voice the one word,
&ldquo;Fashoda!&rdquo; and immediately the turmoil ceased. There
was no answer to this supreme insult.</p>

<p>In addition to hatred of the English over the Boer War there was
the Fashoda incident, which was looked upon by every French man and
woman as the deadliest insult ever inflicted on the French
army.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We were in Paris on that great day in November when old Kruger
came to visit the capital. We had left London soon after the great
Mafeking night&mdash;when all London was mad with joy and thronged
the streets shouting and singing. The worst of that horrible war
was over. It would not be long now before the final capitulation of
Kruger and Cronje, and De Witt and the rest of them. The certainty
of victory, the hope of seeing the boys come home before the
spring, was an intoxication of joy. Let joy be unconfined.</p>

<p>Well! Paris was going mad with joy also. The brave Boers! The
fine old man Paul Kruger! Those abominable grasping, brutal
English! Yes! the war would soon be over, the English would be
brought to their knees, driven out of Africa! and wouldn&rsquo;t
this be just the beginning of the final break-up of that much
vaunted, arrogant British Empire. Indeed we all found Paris as full
of joy as London had been when we left. Paul Kruger, the heroic
President of the Transvaal, was coming to pay a visit to the great
capital. To see the great exhibition? Oh dear me, no! He came to
see what financial and military support he could get out of his
French admirers. Demonstrations and shouts of <i>&lsquo;Vive les
Boers&rsquo;</i> was all very well. The old villain wanted
something more substantial than that.</p>

<p>Well! he didn&rsquo;t get it, but cheers he got in plenty on the
day of his arrival; and for days afterwards the streets were
thronged; the access to the station was a veritable ant-heap of
humanity; the roofs of neighbouring houses and factories were black
with throngs of enthusiasts, many of them in work-a-day clothes,
pushing and jostling for a good place from which to see the great
arrival. The streets were beflagged; at every window women and
children waited with flowers and confetti to shower upon the open
landau when it would come rattling along the Boulevard Diderot with
its eagerly awaited occupant. Senators and deputies, presidents of
councils, municipal bigwigs from Rouen, Lyons, and Bourges were all
there waiting at the station to give a rousing and respectful
welcome to the heroic defender of his country&rsquo;s liberty.</p>

<p>And suddenly the noise and hubbub subsided. A solemn silence
fell over the assembled multitude as the huge locomotive of the
presidential train came puffing into the station. Then a terrific
cry of <i>&lsquo;Vive Kruger!&rsquo; &lsquo;Vive les
Boers!&rsquo;</i> The train came to a standstill and a shabbily
dressed and none too clean old gentleman then stepped on to the
platform. A military band blared forth the
&lsquo;Marseillaise&rsquo; with much trombone and multifarious
brass. The crowd yelled itself hoarse. The women and children
pelted the landau with flowers. Unfortunate pedestrians were pushed
and jostled, some seriously hurt, others swallowed mouthfuls of
confetti. Everybody was happy.</p>

<p>The reception was a great success.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We saw all that from a window in the Boulevard Diderot, in the
house of English friends, who had a grocery shop in the Boulevard
St. Michel where we used to purchase various delicacies for our
picnic lunches. We saw a good deal more of Paul Kruger after that.
He went about sightseeing and among other places he came over to
the Latin Quarter to visit the Pantheon, where France&rsquo;s
eminent dead are buried. He came chiefly on the invitation of the
students of the Sorbonne and of the several schools and colleges
there, the Beaux Arts, the &Eacute;cole de Medecine, and so on.
These young people turned out in their thousands to acclaim him
when he drove in the open landau along the Boulevard St. Michel
(familiarly known as the Boul&rsquo; Miche).</p>

<p>We had rooms in the H&ocirc;tel des Etrangers, at the corner of
the Boulevard St. Michel and the Rue Racine, and we had a splendid
view of the huge and boisterous crowds of Parisian youths. We had
frightened our landlady to death by telling her that we would hang
a Union Jack out of our window which gave on to the boulevard. Of
course we had no intention of doing any such thing, for the mob
would most certainly have smashed all the windows and doors of the
hotel and probably have set fire to the whole place.</p>

<p>The students from the &Eacute;cole des Breaux Arts were in the
forefront of the particular show to welcome Kruger on his arrival
at the Pantheon. In the fullness of their hearts they presented him
with a statue of Victory, modelled by one of their best sculptors.
Unfortunately, the complete success of the demonstration of
sympathy was marred by the fact that Victory was not wearing early
Victorian clothes such as Mrs. Kruger would have approved of. In
fact, she wore no clothes at all. And when she was finally
deposited in the suite occupied by the old man in the H&ocirc;tel
Scribe, she had to be swathed in antimacassars hastily dragged from
the red plush chairs of the sitting-room so as not to offend the
chaste eyes of the austere President. He was staying in the
H&ocirc;tel Scribe and when on his return from the Latin Quarter,
he opened wide the window of his room and stepped out on the
balcony to receive further ovations from the enthusiastic crowd, he
beheld exactly facing him the gaily illuminated shop fronts of
&lsquo;Old England&rsquo;.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the crowd in this fashionable part of Paris
was not nearly so demonstrative in its enthusiasm as the youthful
denizens of the Latin quarter. There certainly was quite a good
crowd round and about the Scribe, but there was no noisy cheering
and English visitors were not molested. We certainly had nothing to
complain of. We drove down the Grands Boulevards in a small open
voiture fully expecting to have eggs or cabbages hurled at us in
execration, but nothing of the sort happened. While we sat outside
a caf&eacute; opposite the Scribe, a small boy shouldering a Boer
flag marched up and down the pavement, shouting: <i>&rdquo;A bas
les anglais&rdquo;.</i> We called to him, promised him a few
centimes if he changed his tune for <i>A bas les Boers,</i> which
he promptly did and pocked his centimes with a grin. Old Kruger
spent about a fortnight in Paris, during which time excitement over
his visit gradually cooled down.</p>

<p>Another great&mdash;far greater&mdash;event now occupied the
mind of the &lsquo;man in the street&rsquo;: the illness and
subsequent death of Queen Victoria. The &lsquo;man in the
street&rsquo; certainly took a great interest in that event which
filled us and our English friends with sorrow. It was such a great
passing away of <i>the</i> most outstanding personality of the past
hundred years. The morning that the news appeared in the <i>Paris
Daily Mail</i> we were greeted by all our friendly tradespeople
with subdued voices and a certain awed expression of face:
<i>&rdquo;Vous savez?&rdquo;</i> they all said, even before they
answered to our <i>&rsquo;bonjour&rsquo; &ldquo;Votre idole est
morte&rdquo;.</i> Your idol! That is how they talked of Queen
Victoria.</p>

<p>She was to their minds (more insular than those of our own
people) something quite apart. Not altogether real. A fetish that
we, the hated English, almost worshipped, and to their credit be it
said that with her death, all scurrilous cartoons and postcards
disappeared from the kiosks, nor did any derogatory or
disrespectful article appear in the Press.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Well! all through this period of excitement we two continued
with the work which we had made up our minds to do while we were in
Paris. My husband was busy with what he always called pot-boiling
work for Messrs. McKenzie, one of the most important firms of
colour printers in London. This left him sufficient leisure to make
ready his pictures for the Paris Salon, for the Spring exhibition
of the Royal Institute of Painters in water-colours, and eventually
for the Academy. Daylight, alas! was of short duration, but we had
a very nice room with a good North light and on the whole the
winter was bright and often sunny. We breakfasted and lunched in
the hotel. And when the weather was fine we dined at a restaurant
on the other side of the river and had our coffee on the Boulevard,
watching the passers-by.</p>

<p>I was busy for some time with the series of detective stories
(six in number) which I had planned around the personality of the
old scarecrow with the piece of string and of the lady journalist
who discussed crime-lore with him in the A.B.C. tea shop. Under the
comprehensive title of <i>The Old Man in the Corner.</i></p>

<p>That, of course, was all right as far as it went and &pound;60
for the six stories was quite pleasant, but already I felt inside
my heart a kind of stirring that the writing of sensational stuff
for magazines would not, and should not, be the end and aim of my
ambition. I wanted to do something more than that. Something big.
Something that would spread my name throughout the country, that
would make it known and repeated by people who read, people who
mattered, people whose opinion I would value.</p>

<p>Had I the power to accomplish this? I had no idea. All I knew
was that this was to be the aim of my life, that every thought and
every aspiration of my soul must tend that way and no other. I just
believed that if only one longed for something with the whole of
one&rsquo;s mind, of one&rsquo;s heart and of one&rsquo;s strength,
it would come. Come eventually. For to my mind ambition is the
<i>primum mobile</i>, the key-stone of success. The striving after
one aim&mdash;and one only. Not to be satisfied with small things,
with easily-gained successes. Not to aim at an eagle and then be
content if one has brought down a sparrow. Dash the sparrow!</p>

<p>And so I went on thinking and planning while hand in hand with
the one being in the world who thoroughly understood my varying
moods and to whom I could confide my every thought, we wandered
through the streets of that quarter of old Paris which held
enshrined the whole of her marvellous history and along the
pavements which to my ears still echoed with the footsteps of
Robespierre and Danton, of Charlotte Corday and Madame Roland, with
the clatter of the tumbrils and the shouts of <i>&lsquo;Ca
ira&rsquo;</i> of the revolutionary mob thirsting for freedom at
the price of the tyrant&rsquo;s blood.</p>

<p>Thoughts and pictures crowded in upon my mind. With every step
we took up the Boul&rsquo; Miche or the Rue &Eacute;cole de
M&eacute;decine, past the house where Marat was assassinated,
through the Palais Royal where Camille Desmoulins had stood upon
the table and inflamed his hearers with the fire of his own hatred
and enthusiasm, and where Rouget de l&rsquo;Isle had first sung his
&lsquo;Marseillaise&rsquo;, and past every corner of this old Paris
I seemed to be thrust back into a life which I had lived not so
very long ago.</p>

<p>These were, of course, the final links of the chain of my life
which culminated in the conception of the <i>Scarlet Pimpernel.</i>
His personality and that of the minor characters in the story had
not yet begun to shape themselves in my mind. I did not then as
much as think of him nor of Chauvelin nor of Marguerite, but the
background was there: the pity for the victims of that terrible
revolution, which had been brought about by injustice and tyranny
and of which so many were the innocent sufferers. And during the
last month of our stay in Paris the outline of my story began to
take definite form in my mind. The shell only: the vital core was
yet to come.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Back in London in the Spring of that year I was still aiming at
an eagle; but, in the meanwhile, one or two little sparrows fell to
my gun, and for these I was sincerely grateful. The most important
of these small pieces of good fortune (I refused to call them
successes or to take pride in them) was the suggestion from kind
Mr. Everett that I should continue the series of my <i>Old Man in
the Corner</i> stories which the <i>Royal</i> was bringing out now
month by month, but with this difference that the various crimes,
whatever they were which the old scarecrow elucidated for the
benefit of the lady journalist, should occur not in London but in
one or other of the great cities in England or even in Scotland. He
even suggested one or two towns as possible backgrounds for the
stories, Glasgow might be one, York another, and so forth: any
town, in fact, that I happened to have visited and to know.</p>

<p>Well! I was not fool enough to grumble at this piece of good
fortune. I was promised good publicity for the stories in the
several towns where their venue was laid, and with a half-sigh of
regret I put the notes I had already made for my <i>magnum opus</i>
away in the innermost recesses of my mind as one would put away
some jewel of great price but not immediately wanted for wear, into
a precious casket, and gaily set to work on the new set of
stories.</p>

<p>I had thought out a capital and mysterious murder full of
surprises destined to baffle the most astute body of police in the
kingdom and decided on Glasgow as its location. I knew Glasgow
fairly well and, anyway, it was only a question of choosing the
street and the house where the crime would be committed. I had
everything pat: the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, the several witnesses,
the contradictory evidence, the activities of the police. . . . Let
me say at once that both the editor and the reader of the
<i>Royal</i> were delighted with the story, and even assured me
that they were looking forward with pleasurable anticipation to the
rest of the series.</p>

<p>Little did they and I guess what was in store for us. The story
appeared . . . and within three days, editor, reader, and the
unfortunate author were absolutely snowed under a voluminous
correspondence. Letters poured in by the dozen, by the score, and
yes! by the hundred, from every town in the kingdom&mdash;chiefly
in Scotland&mdash;where the <i>Royal</i> was read. Angry letters,
sarcastic letters, letters written more in sorrow than in anger,
but all to the same purport: <i>There is no such thing in Scotland
as a coroner&rsquo;s inquest.</i> Didn&rsquo;t the author know
that? Of course she didn&rsquo;t; then how had she the temerity to
display her ignorance? Didn&rsquo;t the editor or the reader know
that there is no such thing as a coroner&rsquo;s inquest in
Scotland? That the first investigation of a misdemeanour is carried
on by the Procurator Fiscal? Very much in the same way as this is
done in France by the <i>Juge d&rsquo;instruction?</i></p>

<p>Oh! I know all about that now, but at the time. . . . Imagine,
my shame and my despair! I saw myself jeered at, discredited for
ever, my career blighted, even before the great work was begun.
Would it ever be begun now? Would any reader or editor ever look
again at any manuscript submitted by that stupid, ignorant author
who did not even take the trouble to verify the most important
facts relating to her lucubrations?</p>

<p>I felt thoroughly cheap and ashamed. It was only my husband,
always kind and understanding, who found the way to lay salve on my
wounded vanity. His advice to me was: &ldquo;Carry the war in the
enemy&rsquo;s camp. Hit out before you yourself get hit. Ask the
editor of the <i>Royal</i> and his reader how it came that neither
of these clever gentlemen, or anyone in the office for that matter,
knew anything about criminal procedure in Scotland, no more that
you did in fact. Then see what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well! nothing happened. I did write the letter my dear consoler
had suggested, it was a nice simple, not too humble a letter.
Fortunately for me the clever gentlemen in the office of the
<i>Royal Magazine</i> had a sense of humour. They certainly did not
know anything about the Procurator Fiscal, either, but they saw the
humour of the situation, threw the two hundred and fifty letters
they had received into the waste-paper basket and advised me to do
the same with those which had been addressed to me. And so ended on
a happy note this very distressing episode. But the lesson it
contained was a severe one, and I certainly benefited by it in
after life, for I never again embarked upon a statement of facts
before feeling satisfied that I knew&mdash;yes, <i>knew</i>, what I
was writing about.</p>

<p>In the case of historical romances this was of course of vital
importance. I won&rsquo;t say that I never stumbled; I would not be
so arrogant as to suggest this for a moment, but in writing of
times that are past and gone there are such countless little
details to remember and so much study needed to master them all
that I venture to say <i>mea culpa</i> with a persistent but not
too shamefaced a spirit.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And thus did I bring down many little sparrows at which I had
not aimed but for which I was indeed immensely grateful. I was
gathering confidence and, above all, experience all the time. And
it is experience&mdash;of this I am absolutely certain&mdash;which
is the only word to real and <i>lasting</i> success. Experience of
life, of humanity, of its virtues and its failings. Mine has been a
long life, and I have seen much and studied a great deal, and in my
old age now I am more convinced than I ever was that youth is far
too readily inclined to give out to the world all that it has
learned and absorbed in the very few years of development out of
childhood. In the essence of things that &lsquo;all&rsquo; can only
be very little. Against that it may be very fine and the world may
welcome it with enthusiasm. But having given its all and having
tasted the sweets of success, youth no longer wants to study or to
absorb. It has already absorbed all that it needed for the making
of success, for astonishing the world and bringing that world to
its feet. Why should it trouble itself any longer? Why continue to
study life when one knew by the instinct of genius <i>all</i> there
was to know? and the result is almost invariably the same.</p>

<p>How often has that initial success, gained by the flicker of
genius, survived the years that followed? How often has a young
prodigy continue to bring out work equal in quality and staying
power to that first wonderful book or play that the select few had
proclaimed immortal. And this applies not only to the making of
books, but very much to music. Think of the great number of
&lsquo;infant prodigies&rsquo; in the musical world who seemed to
fade out of recognition as they passed from adolescence into
manhood. You will think of Mozart, of course, but how many more can
you remember?</p>

<p>During the course of my musical life I heard and admired a great
many, but twenty years later their very names had faded out of
one&rsquo;s ken: &ldquo;Oh yes! So-and-so,&rdquo; one often heard
musicians say; &ldquo;I remember hearing him play at the
Philharmonic Concerts, or in Paris, or Vienna, I forget which. He
was marvellous, and only ten years old at the time, and with a
technique that would take all that time and more to acquire. I have
often wondered what became of him. I haven&rsquo;t heard of him for
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes! that was just it, the admirers of this or that infant
prodigy so often wonder in the years to come what had happened and
why they had not heard of him for years. Strangely enough there has
been no infant prodigy among artists (meaning painters). With the
exception of Millais, who was said to have had a picture exhibited
in the Royal Academy when he was ten years old, I know of no other.
My readers will probably put me right if I am wrong there. But I do
wonder whether this means that art (again meaning painting)
requires longer study than music, and more years of maturity than
the making of books.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Among the many little sparrows that fell to my gun about this
time there was one which I facetiously called a blackbird. He was
too big to be called a sparrow. The firm of C. Arthur Pearson who,
in the person of Mr. Everett, continued to show me both kindness
and encouragement, had launched their great scheme of bringing out
a daily paper, very much on the lines of the <i>Daily Mail</i> (by
way of a rival to it, so everyone thought). It was to be called the
<i>Daily Express</i> and to be distinct from its great rival by
various new features, even if it would necessarily perhaps wear the
same old face. Among other things, the editor desired to run a
serial and I was asked, among other unknown writers, to submit a
long story of adventure, not a detective story, but something
equally exciting without the paraphernalia of police and amateur
investigations of crime.</p>

<p>My mind, of course, jumped at once to the great (!) story
conceived in the Latin Quarter of Paris, and not as yet in its
initial stage. What a joy to set at once to work with the certainty
of its appearing in print as soon as complete (and it
wouldn&rsquo;t take long), first as a serial in a widely read paper
and then in book form. The editor of the <i>Daily Express</i>
granted me an interview, and I told him quite vaguely what I had in
my mind. But I got a cold douche as soon as I mentioned the two
words &lsquo;French Revolution&rsquo;. &ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo;
was the emphatic response, &ldquo;we must have something modern.
The public doesn&rsquo;t care for France and her revolution.
Let&rsquo;s have something that the man in the street will
understand and feel that it might happen again to-day or to-morrow,
and not the romantic imaginings of the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very much subdued, but in no way discouraged, I did write a
modern story of adventure which I called <i>The Shamrock</i>, and
which duly appeared in the <i>Daily Express</i> as a serial. But my
mind at this time was so engrossed with my beloved great story and
the adventures which those six months in the Latin Quarter of Paris
had helped me to conceive, that something of their spirit crept
into <i>The Shamrock</i>, and which duly appeared even though the
scene was laid in Russia, and the period was entirely of the day. I
don&rsquo;t think that the serial was particularly successful. I
certainly never made the slightest effort to offer it for book
publication.</p>

<p>And so <i>The Shamrock</i> died a natural death.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13" id=

<p>One of the great lights in the literary world said to me once:
&ldquo;The greatest misfortune that can happen to any writer is an
outstanding success early in his career. That outstanding success
will always be his enemy, because all his subsequent work will be
measured by that one standard and in the opinion of the
unintellectual will always be thought to fall short of it.&rdquo;
Of course, there is a good deal of truth in that pronouncement. It
goes back to what I said just now on the subject of early, youthful
success. But the great man&rsquo;s general condemnation of an early
success was mitigated by his qualification, &lsquo;in the opinion
of the unintellectual&rsquo;. There is no doubt that the general
public, having taken one particular work to its heart, will measure
the author&rsquo;s further creations by that one standard. Well! if
that standard be a high one, there is nothing to grumble at. And I,
for one, refuse to look on <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> as my
literary enemy, and I am certain that Conan Doyle never looked on
<i>Sherlock Holmes</i> as anything but his dearest and most valued

</p>

<p>Anyway, here I am ready to come to grips with the inner history
of that creation of mine, <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, remembering
all the success that came to him and to me through him during close
on fifty years since his original conception. I have so often been
asked how I came to think of him, how did his personality first
present itself to my mind. It was during our stay in Paris that the
background and the nucleus of the story were first conceived, but
what I wanted&mdash;and I knew that I wanted it more than anything
to make my story worth while&mdash;was a real live, outstanding
personality. I remember Arnold Bennett saying once to me: &ldquo;A
book will live by the characters that people its story, characters
that make the story real; it will never live by the story alone,
however well-constructed or interesting it may be.&rdquo; And he in
his dry, sarcastic way: &ldquo;Do not be afraid about the future of
your <i>Scarlet Pimpernel.</i> It will live because of its
character long after far finer books have gone the way of
oblivion.&rdquo; He did not mean this either ironically or
carpingly.</p>

<p>We went on talking about Dickens&rsquo; immortality as against
Thackeray, in many ways by far the finer writer of the two,
certainly the more literary: however contemptuously modern youth
may refer to Dickens (whom for the most part they have never read),
there is no getting away from the fact that Mr. Micawber, Mr.
Mantalini, Pecksniff, Squeers, and all the rest, are as alive
to-day as they were when enthusiastic readers fought for the
privilege of being the first to read the installments of
<i>Pickwick Papers</i> or <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> as they
appeared week by week in <i>Household Words</i>.</p>

<p>Does Esmond or Barry Lindon, fine as they are, ever mean the
same to millions of thoughtful readers as does Mr. Pickwick or Mr.
Pecksniff and so many others? And even in the case of that greatest
writer of all time, does not one&rsquo;s mind dwell on
<i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Othello, Lady Macbeth</i> and <i>King Lear</i>
rather than on the story of <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> or
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost.</i> But this, perhaps, is
beside the point. The conversation with Arnold Bennett occurred
long after my book had overstepped its umpteenth edition. For the
moment I was intent on the personality which would make my story
live.</p>

<p>Strangely enough that personality of the Scarlet Pimpernel came
to me in a very curious way. I first saw him standing before
me&mdash;don&rsquo;t gasp, please&mdash;on the platform of an
underground station, The Temple. I had been to see someone on the
<i>Daily Express, &agrave; propos</i> of some minor work, and was
waiting for my Inner Circle train for Kensington. Now, of all the
dull, prosy places in the world, can you beat an Underground
Railway Station? It was foggy too, and smelly and cold. But I give
you my word that as I was sitting there, I saw&mdash;yes, I
saw&mdash;Sir Percy Blakeney just as you know him now.</p>

<p>I saw him in his exquisite clothes, his slender hands holding up
his spy-glass: I heard his lazy drawling speech, his quaint laugh.
I can&rsquo;t tell you in detail everything I saw and
heard&mdash;it was a mental vision, of course, and lasted but a few
seconds&mdash;but it was the whole life-story of the Scarlet
Pimpernel that was there and then revealed to me. The rest of the
day has remained a blur in my mind, but my thoughts were clear
enough for me to tell my beloved husband about the wonder that had
occurred; the birth of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2000341h-images/page097.jpg" alt=""

</p>

<p>Everything else was easy. I set to work the very next day and
wrote <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, as it now stands, in five
weeks. I wrote it as a book; I thought of it as a possible play.
Scenes, pictures, love-scenes, adventures both comic and tragic,
thrilling moments, dramatic scenes, and above all
character&mdash;always character&mdash;after running riot in my
brain all settled themselves down into a simple and complete
whole.</p>

<p>I think that I may look on those five weeks as some of the
happiest in my life. To feel my creation become more and more real,
to feel it growing into something that would live, into something
vivid that would not fail to stir the imagination of all those who,
on reading about that imaginary personage, would in their turn feel
that he was absolutely real, that he had indeed lived and laughed
and loved, that was my happiness and my joy. And I know that Sir
Percy Blakeney has become such a real living personality to so many
millions of readers that books of biography and history have been
consulted by the studious to discover his prototype somehow,
somewhere; that for over forty years now I have been bombarded with
letters from all over the world demanding a pronouncement from me,
&lsquo;Who was the original of your Scarlet Pimpernel?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The literary critic of an important colonial paper paid me, I
think, the most subtle compliment I ever received (not meaning to,
of course) when he said that the author had not quite grasped the
real character of the original Sir Percy Blakeney. Subtle,
wasn&rsquo;t it? For Sir Percy Blakeney is mine, and mine only,
just as I have given him to the world, to the French, to the
Italians, to Poland and Denmark and Norway; it has been translated
into sixteen foreign languages, including Japanese, and in several
Eastern dialects, notably Urdu. Its crowning laurel was when, in
the early days of the Russian Revolution, it was translated into
Russian. But, above all, I gave him with my whole heart to the
English-speaking world: the world that best understood him.
&ldquo;I love your character so,&rdquo; said Joynson Hicks
(afterwards Lord Brentford) to me one day, &ldquo;because he is so
very English. You have put your finger on what is best and truest
in English character.&rdquo; And another great politician said with
a sigh: &ldquo;I like your Blakeney so much; he is such a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Well, anyway, there he was, quite ready now at last to make his
bow before the reading public. His triumphs of course came a bit
later, for let me tell you at once that things did not go quite so
easily for me as I had so confidently anticipated. The book was
ready for publication: the most important thing now was to find a
publisher. My husband and I had put the play together in
collaboration, and it was ready for production. The thing was to
find a theatrical manager who would produce it. But the book first.
In my ignorance I thought that the choice of a publisher for my
book rested with me. And so it started on its weary way. Yes! weary
way indeed, for my beloved book on which I had built such hopes was
refused by a round dozen of publishers in London. Starting at the
top of the publishing world, I sent it to Macmillan and to
Heinemann, to Murray, and so on, and always with monotonous
recurrence came that fatal rejection slip. However, I was not
discouraged. I thought and thought. I tried this, that, and the
other. Personal introduction, personal interviews.</p>

<p>In the offices of the powers that be people were always very
kind and sympathetic. I spoke about having dramatized the book and
this aroused a glimmer of interest, for I remember Mr. Heinemann,
to who I had a personal introduction, saying to me: &ldquo;Well! if
your play is produced and is successful, you bring me back your
book, and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader at Cassell&rsquo;s liked it too and recommended it
for publication. It was kept three weeks in the office pending
final decision. And &lsquo;final decision&rsquo; was again the
rejection slip. One firm offered me publication and a certain
amount of publicity if I paid all expenses connected with the
printing and general advertising of the book. That I never would
agree to; and never throughout my whole life did I ever spend one
penny for the pushing of any of my works. I don&rsquo;t believe it
ever does any good, though I have heard of several young authors
who have been lured into this trap by promises that never
materialized. A publisher&rsquo;s business is to publish, and if he
does not consider it worth his while to spend the few pounds
necessary for the publishing and advertising of any particular
book, then it certainly is not worth the author&rsquo;s while
either to risk his money in an undertaking which is not his and the
success of which he cannot control.</p>

<p>Another firm, a more important one this time, offered to buy
outright <i>all</i> rights in my book for the sum of &pound;30
down. Now though I won&rsquo;t admit for a moment that I was
getting discouraged by then, nevertheless I will own that the offer
was tempting. Why? I cannot say. We were not in need of &pound;30.
We had enough to live on and have a bit of fun into the bargain,
but my spirits were rather droopy under the weight of those
abominable rejection slips. The future looked somehow foggy and
grey, nothing very rosy about it in the literary way.</p>

<p>Was I wrong in my estimate of what a reading public would care
for when it wanted to be not only entertained, but taken out of
itself? Out of the drabness of its surroundings, of its daily
duties or even of its amusements, out of the daily round in
&rsquo;buses or trains, or swagger Rolls-Royces, of lunches at
Claridge&rsquo;s or the A.B.C. tea-shops? Rich or poor, life was
all the same: so often drab and monotonous and I had thought I
would give them romance, stories of the past that would bring back
to their minds happy days of youth and carefree adolescence, love,
laughter, adventure, gaiety.</p>

<p>Was I wrong? Were those business men right who kept their
fingers on the pulse of the reading public and said to me with a
shrug: &ldquo;Yes! I rather like your book, but the public does not
care for that sort of thing. The days of old Dumas and <i>The Three
Musketeers</i> are as extinct as the Dodo. Give them something
modern, true to the life of to-day, not the romantic imaginings of
a past they care nothing about.&rdquo; &ldquo;So unreal!&rdquo;
most of these gentlemen would add, sometimes with a sigh which I
was at a loss to interpret.</p>

<p>Well! I was gradually being forced into thinking that perhaps
they were right. After all they ought to know. It was their
business to know, and anyway as not one of them was willing to put
their opinion to the test by publishing my book, there was no way
of knowing whether they were right and I was wrong. The long and
the short of it all was that I suddenly made up my mind to accept
that miserable &pound;30 and part with <i>every right</i> in my
<i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> and, pending publication, to see whether I
could get in touch with a theatrical manager who might be willing
to put up the play.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I had no difficulty in this. I had at one
time made the casual acquaintance of an actor, who during periods
of inactivity in his stage career, busied himself with theatrical
agency. He was a very poor actor and his appearance rather told
against him, but he was a magnificent reader, with a beautifully
modulated voice, and knew how to get the best out of every line
written by an inexperienced dramatist. His advice, too, was always
sound. He seemed to know by instinct what would &lsquo;get across
the footlights&rsquo; and what would not. Anyway, I submitted the
play to him. My darling and I had spent a great deal of time in
trying to get it as good as we possibly could make it; &ldquo;as
good in its way as the book&rdquo;, my dear collaborator would say.
The actor-agent thought it good. &ldquo;A charming play,&rdquo; he
called it, and added that he happened to know that the Terry
management (Fred Terry and his wife Julia Neilson), who were now
running a highly successful romantic drama, <i>Sweet Nell of Old
Drury</i> were on the look-out for something equally romantic to
follow.</p>

<p>Our friend submitted our play to them and on Friday the 13th of
May, 1903, it was definitely accepted for production at some future
date. Friday the 13th. The conjunction of day and date had always
been lucky for us. That of 1903 certainly was so. And there we were
now full of happy anticipation. We had seen <i>Sweet Nell</i>, and
felt quite satisfied that production and caste would all be
everything that even an established dramatist could desire. Our
contract with the management didn&rsquo;t seem any too bad. It had
been drawn up by our old family solicitor, who, experienced as he
was in such legal matters as wills, or conveyancing, knew nothing
whatever about theatrical contracts, or the value of any kind of
work of art. He didn&rsquo;t foresee any of those eventualities
which gathered fast and furious as the play continued in its
successful career.</p>

<p>But there were many tribulations before that happy event came
about. Nearly two years went by before anticipation became
realization. In the meanwhile the enterprising publisher who had
made me the generous offer of &pound;30 for all rights in my book,
thought better of it and entrenched himself behind a condition that
the offer would only hold good if the play was produced and was a
success. This gave me the chance of refusing the offer then and
there. The publisher didn&rsquo;t mind; at any rate he expressed no
regret, and I was left to thank my stars that I had not fallen into
the temptation of &lsquo;selling my birthright for a mess of
pottage&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Armed with the certainty of the production of the play on a
grand scale by an important management, I had another try or two at
getting the book published. My idea was that production of the play
should occur simultaneously with the publication of the book. You
see I had more belief in the book than in the play, and I thought
that even an unsuccessful play would be publicity for the book.
But, as before, publishers thought otherwise.</p>

<p>Anyway, no one wanted to publish <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>
until&mdash;almost in desperation&mdash;I bethought myself of a
small firm who brought out a weekly publication, <i>The Play
Pictorial.</i> I argued to myself that the powers that be in that
particular firm were especially interested in theatrical matters. I
obtained a personal interview and offered my book, explaining about
the play and its future production. Mr. Greening was very kind,
though a little doubtful, as all of them were. I left the book with
him and when I saw him he was good enough to say that personally he
liked the book but was not inclined to back his opinion;
&ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I can
do. When I am doubtful about a book I submit it to my dear old
mother, who lives down in Cornwall. She is, quite unsophisticated
but knows what she likes. If she likes the book I publish it,
because I take her to be a criterion of the taste of the great
reading public for whom I wish to cater.&rdquo; That was in
substance what he said and what he did. Evidently the
unsophisticated old lady from Cornwall liked the <i>Scarlet
Pimpernel</i>, for the firm of Greening &amp; Co. accepted the book
for publication (publication to be co-incident with the production
of the play) and gave me quite a good contract for it, considering
that I was then an unknown writer.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The play, on the other hand, which, by the way, had its 2,000th
performance in London alone, went through certain vicissitudes
which it is amusing to recall. Definitely accepted for production
in May, 1903, it had its tentative production at the Theatre Royal,
Nottingham, in the autumn of that same year. We went down to see
it. In the theatrical jargon such a production is called
&lsquo;trying it on the dog&rsquo;. It usually goes to show how the
great theatre-going public in London would take to a play. The
Nottingham public was theatrical-minded. It knew what it liked and
gave its approval or disapproval ungrudgingly. In the case of the
<i>Scarlet Pimpernel,</i> lavishly produced and cast to perfection
with Fred Terry as Sir Percy Blakeney, a r&ocirc;le which fitted
him like the proverbial glove, and Julia Neilson, beautiful and
emotional as Marguerite, approval was not only ungrudging but
enthusiastic. So much so that a large portion of the audience who
had come some little distance to the show and did not possess a
motor-car stayed in the house applauding and acclaiming author and
performers, regardless of time, and missed their last &rsquo;bus or
train to the suburbs. &ldquo;I have never known anything like that
to happen,&rdquo; the stage-door keeper said to me as I tried to
make my way out of the theatre. &ldquo;Missed their last train,
they did. Wouldn&rsquo;t go till the last fall of the curtain. That
shows it&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em.&rdquo; And it certainly had. The
local Press was enthusiastic in its praise; the few kind friends
with whom we had become acquainted during our short stay in
Nottingham talked freely of an outstanding success. We went to bed
as happy as the proverbial &lsquo;b&mdash; in a rug&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The next day, however, there came a snag. The Terry-Neilson
management, faced with an unusually heavy and expensive production
had asked the late Frank Curzon to come down and see the show with
a view to partnership. Frank Curzon was one of the most experienced
and most progressive managers of the day. He came and saw, but was
<i>not</i> conquered. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve got something else
for London, my dear fellow,&rdquo; was his verdict. &ldquo;This is
all right for the provinces, but it won&rsquo;t do for London. The
Press for one will never stand it.&rdquo; But Fred Terry stuck to
his guns: &ldquo;I bet you five pounds,&rdquo; he retorted,
&ldquo;that it will do for London&rdquo;; and Curzon also stuck to
his guns: &ldquo;I bet you fifty pounds it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
Whether the bet was taken or not I don&rsquo;t know. Frank Curzon
was all wrong, of course.</p>

<p>Years afterwards I met him at the 999th performance of the
<i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, and he said quite frankly: &ldquo;Well! I
was wrong. I admit it; but then if we none of us ever made a
mistake, we would all die millionaires.&rdquo; He did hedge a
little, however, by adding: &ldquo;As a matter of fact I
couldn&rsquo;t stick that fourth act. It was enough to damn the
whole play.&rdquo; That act followed the end of the book quite
closely, as indeed did the whole play. But there is no doubt that
the outdoor scene, the sea, the rocks, the soldiers, the general
atmosphere in fact might easily bring the level of the play down to
melodrama and handsome, debonair Fred Terry did not like the idea
of making his final bow to the public in the unattractive disguise
of an old Jew. This last was the determining factor.</p>

<p>I was only too ready to fall in with his views, and before the
next trial production&mdash;fixed for Newcastle&mdash;a new fourth
act had to be constructed. I was down with an awful attack of the
Spanish &lsquo;flu&mdash;then very prevalent in London&mdash;so my
dear collaborator set to work one morning, and by the late
afternoon he was by my bedside flourishing a few sheets of MS.
Paper covered with his neat calligraphy. &ldquo;I have got the
fourth act,&rdquo; he said, with his infectious laugh; &ldquo;no
sea, no rocks, no soldiers, and Terry bowing his last as handsome
as ever before.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The play with its new fourth act (as you, dear reader, have no
doubt seen it) was tried out at Newcastle and later on in Dublin;
after which it was ready for its London production. We hoped that
this would be some time in 1904, but once again we were
disappointed. Soon we heard from outsiders that the Terry
management, unable to secure the theatre they wanted for the
<i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i>&mdash;namely, the New&mdash;were putting
up an altogether smaller production, <i>Sunday</i>, at the Comedy.
It was already in rehearsal and the <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> was
shelved for the time being until a larger theatre could be secured.
Our play was put into rehearsal the following autumn. The
rehearsals took place in the Shaftesbury Theatre. We attended only
a very few of them. We felt that we were not wanted, and did not
indeed feel inclined to submit to the inferior position allotted to
the creators of a work that was destined to bring fame and fortune
to all those who had a hand in its production.</p>

<p>One felt that the remarks or criticisms of the merest
scene-shifter were of more importance to the theatrical mind than
those of the author of the play. I remember on the occasion of the
first rehearsal&mdash;before we had learned our lesson of
self-effacement&mdash;we turned up at the stage-door and after we
were allowed to pass through we found our way to the stage. Only
one or two members of the company had arrived as yet and were
pacing up and down looking over their lines. Oh! it was cold! We
were too early. Some of the stage hands were placing tables and
other furniture about for the Inn Scene in Act I.</p>

<p>A diminutive, but seemingly very important call-boy approached
us and in a patronizing way asked us if we were members of the
company. We informed him modestly that we were not exactly members
of the company but just happened to be the authors of the play,
whereupon he indicated a quiet corner up O.P. and remarked:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better sit here. You&rsquo;ll be out of
everybody&rsquo;s way.&rdquo; I think that small boy had already
some experience of theatrical affairs. Neither our opinion nor our
advice were wanted, so we never offered any. I remember some time
afterwards speaking about this to an eminent playwright who was
also a friend, a man who had learned by experience all there was to
know about these matters; his comment was very pertinent.
&ldquo;You see, you were not anybody of importance, yet.
And,&rdquo; he added with a twinkle of his shrewd eyes, &ldquo;you
were not paying for the production, were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I only recollect one or two trifling incidents which helped to
break the monotony of those dreary rehearsals. All artists, in
every branch of the arts, are notoriously temperamental. Musicians
terribly so, and actors too, but actor-managers most of all, so I
have found. I suppose they have more at stake than minor members of
their company. Money and prestige in addition to artistic success.
Fred Terry was the most temperamental man I ever met. His nerves
always seemed to be on edge. Sometimes he would let himself go,
giving his ebullient temper free rein, as when, on one occasion, a
minor member of the company was called and did not happen to
respond on the very second, he was called to account for wasting
time and delaying rehearsal. For over ten minutes did the
unfortunate man have to stand by and listen to abuse and a string
of swear words that made the lights turn blue. Everyone was upset
and the rehearsal was delayed, and time of course was wasted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there never was a more kind and patient teacher
than Fred Terry when the mood was upon him. I watched him one day
for twenty minutes teaching the Prince of Wales in Act II how to
manage his sword, and how to sit down gracefully without getting
his legs entangled in it. Twenty minutes&mdash;and never once
losing patience! In his beautifully modulated voice he would go
over and over certain lines with his wife until she spoke them in
the way that pleased him. But I would not have liked his many
admirers to have heard him when we&mdash;oh! so
modestly&mdash;objected to his singing the verse of a song one
minute before the final ending of the play. I ask you, would any
man sing a song after the vicissitudes he had just gone through in
the last act and with his adored wife just waiting to clasp him in
her arms.</p>

<p>All the same I have often, even to this day, been asked who came
nearest in the flesh to my ideal of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and
unhesitatingly I always name Fred Terry.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Well! everything does come in time doesn&rsquo;t it? And the day
did come when, sitting in a tea-shop in Oxford Street rather
anxiously discussing our prospects, on an omnibus which came to a
halt opposite the shop we saw a big advertisement in
flaring-letters: &lsquo;New Theatre: <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>,
Julia Neilson and Fred Terry&rsquo;, and in much smaller type our
two names. We had by now sufficient theatrical experience to know
better than to expect being &lsquo;starred&rsquo; in any way. The
limelight was for those who were paying for it, not for a mere pair
of unknown authors. Still! it was our play that was being
advertised and we were such a pair of young ninnies that to see
<i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> in large flaring letters all along the
side of the &rsquo;bus thrilled us to the very marrow. The fact
seemed to us so wonderful! Wonderful, from the very fact that our
theatrical experiences of the last two years had not given us the
chance of getting spoilt or given us &lsquo;a swollen head&rsquo;.
Our feelings were like those of a child when first beholding a
Christmas tree. We hastily called the waitress, paid our bill, and
rushed out of the shop only to see the &rsquo;bus disappearing down
the street.</p>

<p>We swallowed our disappointment and walked down to Oxford Circus
and, lo! and behold, there we saw another &rsquo;bus bearing the
same advertisement in flaring red letters. It was heading for the
city and we were making our way to the Marble Arch, but the desire
was irresistible. We climbed up to the top of that &rsquo;bus and
sat happily enthroned behind the magic placard all the way to
Tottenham Court Road. Weren&rsquo;t we fools? But oh, such happy
fools. Of course we reckoned to see heads turned and eyes fixed
excitedly on those wonderful lines. But no! the crowd on the
pavements just hurried along, seemingly unaware that the title of a
great work was being freely displayed for everyone to see. Not one
person looked up at the advertisement, not one gleam of
intelligence flashed from the eyes of that indifferent crowd, so we
quietly paid our pennies, descended from Parnassus, and boarded a
&rsquo;bus going the other way. I noticed that its side bore the
advertisement of Quaker Oats.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;Then came the first night of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>
at the New Theatre in London. We two in a stage box, very nervous,
hid ourselves as much out of sight as possible. We had no wish to
satisfy the curiosity of Press or public; but we need not have
worried, for not a soul took the slightest interest in us. We had
asked for a few free tickets and about half a dozen of our friends
were in the house. Once or twice a smile of encouragement was
directed towards us, and at the end of Act I one or two friends
came to our box and said kind things to us. It was going to be a
big success, so they all declared. This bucked me up a bit
until&mdash;when the curtain went up once more&mdash;I looked down
into the stalls and saw row upon row of sleepy-looking, obviously
bored, men grinning at one another and shrugging their shoulders
before composing themselves to another snooze . . . the
critics!</p>

<p>Up in the gallery a controversy was going on which we knew
nothing about at the time, but heard of afterwards from a friend
who had gone up there on purpose to hear the opinion of &lsquo;the
gods&rsquo;. This was the era when a small number of young
hooligans (I can&rsquo;t call them anything else) had banded
themselves together for the express purpose of attending first
nights and &lsquo;booing&rsquo; any and every new play save those
that came from the pen of an established dramatist. It was a cruel
and entirely unwarranted action on their part, because they did
succeed more than once in turning a likely success by an unknown
author into an admitted failure.</p>

<p>The critics who are not usually kind to unknown authors, were
ready to comment upon this &lsquo;booing&rsquo;, which they termed
&lsquo;the expression of disapproval on the part of the general
public&rsquo;&mdash;which it often was not&mdash;and the new play
would be put down as a failure, when it might have been worked by
timely publicity into a success. And the management lost its money
and the poor actors their jobs. And that was the controversy that
went on in the gallery and was overheard by a friend, unbeknown to
us on the first night of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel.</i> &lsquo;To
boo or not to boo?&rsquo; that was the question. What the answer
was I know not, for I was too dazed and too excited to hear
anything but the rapturous applause which greeted the final fall of
the curtain.</p>

<p>It was indeed rapturous, no other words will describe the
ovation to which the Terry&rsquo;s responded with smiles, repeated
bowings and the usual speech: &ldquo;On behalf of Miss Neilson and
myself . . . and so on.&rdquo; Then a number of voices from every
part of the house called: &ldquo;Author! Author!&rdquo; and Fred
Terry glanced up at our box. I suppose that it was dark and he
didn&rsquo;t see us; he thought perhaps we had already run away,
anyway he stepped forward and said: &ldquo;I regret to say that the
authors are not in the house.&rdquo; And that was that. But we
didn&rsquo;t care. Nothing, we thought, could hurt us now. Our play
was a success. A triumphant success, and there was no room in our
minds for anything but thankfulness and joy.</p>

<p>Our half-dozen friends who had been in the house drove round
with us to the flat for a picnic supper. Of course they all praised
the play and predicted a lasting success. Most of them though were
sorry that &lsquo;the English damn&rsquo;&mdash;which in the book
comes from the Scarlet Pimpernel after the terrible ordeal he has
gone through, and which is to my thinking really the best line in
the book&mdash;had been omitted from the play. But the exigencies
of the fourth act as it stood did not permit its retention and,
after all, success was there, hot and strong, and the reading
public which does not necessarily comprise the theatre-goers could
still enjoy the &lsquo;English damn&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The next morning we sent out for the papers.</p>

<p>We did want to know what those somnolent, flaccid gentlemen of
the Press would have to say after this overwhelming success. Well!
we had the surprise of our lives: and such a surprise! Hardly a
good word from any of the critics. A. B. Walkley in <i>The
Times</i> was mildly sarcastic; a few of the others gave us an
encouraging little pat on the back, telling us to try and do better
next time. Our names&mdash;Baroness Orczy, Montagu
Barstow&mdash;had been condensed to &lsquo;Orczy-Barstow&rsquo;,
and this gave one or two pleasantly-minded gentlemen the
opportunity to say something facetious about that. But it was the
<i>Daily Mail</i> that, to put it mildly, did the management and us
almost in. I don&rsquo;t know who the pleasant gentleman was who
wrote the paragraph concerning &ldquo;the new play at the
New&rdquo;. He started his notice by saying that &ldquo;the only
good thing about this play is its name&rdquo; &mdash;I am quoting
<i>verbatim</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the Scarlet Pimpernel is a little
flower that blossoms and dies in one day, which is the obvious fate
of this play,&rdquo; and the gentleman went on to say: &ldquo;Fred
Terry was laboriously light and Miss Julia Neilson gave a rather
poor imitation of Mrs. Patrick Campbell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have said before that Fred Terry was temperamental and hinted
that his command of language was both forcible and varied. I was
not present when he read the above paragraph in the <i>Daily
Mail,</i> imagination recoils before the picture it presents to the
mind. I believe it was many years before Fred Terry allowed a
representative of the offending paper to be present at one of his
&lsquo;first nights&rsquo;. I wonder if the writer of the paragraph
felt at all cheap when on the hundredth night of the play he saw
the box-office besieged and notices &lsquo;House Full&rsquo;
outside the theatre night after night. But at the time it was a
real hammer-blow.</p>

<p>Arthur Garret, Terry&rsquo;s manager, came rushing round to us
with something like despair in his face. &ldquo;Something has got
to be done,&rdquo; he said, all a quiver with consternation.
&ldquo;The <i>Daily Mail</i>, with its huge circulation, will turn
the show into a flop.&rdquo; And it very nearly did. The following
night there was not &pound;50 in the house, and the night after
that barely &pound;60. The first matin&eacute;e was a shade better,
but the receipts still fell far short of three figures. Free seats
were showered upon us for our friends (they had become valuable
assets). &ldquo;You must help to dress the house,&rdquo; Garrett
went on to say. &ldquo;We are doing our best. We can&rsquo;t have
rows of empty seats. . . . Mr. Terry won&rsquo;t give in to those
blighters. . . .&rdquo; And so on.</p>

<p>Well! everyone, including ourselves, made a great effort to
&lsquo;dress the house&rsquo;, and on the Saturday night there was
a slight rise in the barometer of the box office and the house did
not look so desolate as it had done the night before. Hope springs
eternal, etc., etc. And it did . . . until the following morning
when the Sunday Press came down upon the play with hammer and tongs
of abuse.</p>

<p>Mr. J. T. Grein, <i>en t&ecirc;te</i> in the <i>Sunday
Times</i>: &ldquo;As I sat for three mortal hours,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;trying in vain to find something to praise,&rdquo; and so on
in the same strain, which seemed really to have an element of spite
in it so virulent was it. &lsquo;Something to praise&rsquo;? surely
there must be something to praise even by the most inveterate
highbrow in a play that has since held the theatre-going public
enthralled half over the world for over thirty years. Anyway, with
but very few exceptions such as the <i>Referee</i> and one or two
others, the Sunday Press came into line with the dailies. Another
slump in the box office. Was the play which had been acclaimed to
the skies by all those who had seen it (except the critics, of
course) really going to fail lamentably? really going to be like
its namesake, the little flower that blooms and dies in one day?
Ne&rsquo;er a bit of it. It slumped against a bit on the Monday,
revived a little on the Tuesday . . . and on Wednesday the
illustrated weeklies came out with criticisms as damning as the
daily and Sunday Press.</p>

<p>Another slump. More dressing of the house. Then a slight rise in
the barometer in the middle of the week and a decided rise for
Saturday both matin&eacute;e and evening. Three figures for the
Saturday matin&eacute;e! We met Arthur Garrett in the foyer of the
theatre, mopping his streaming brow: &ldquo;We are saved,&rdquo; he
declared.</p>

<p>Yes! we were saved. Failure had turned into success. From that
moment there was no retrograde movement in the barometer. But how
near we were to failure, we and the management who must have felt
anxiety and disappointment just as keenly as we did. Honestly, I
was as grieved for them during the past anxious week as I was for
ourselves; and quite apart from the happiness success brought to
us, we both in our hearts gave an ungrudging admiration to Fred
Terry and his beautiful wife for the pluck and tenacity with which
they stuck to their guns, and were genuinely thankful that they
reaped their rich reward.</p>

<p>And that is how <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, one of the most
popular plays ever staged in an English theatre, was on the brink
of failure.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But not so the book, which was published early in 1905. Its
first appearance on the bookstalls coincided with the production of
the play. Unlike the play, however, it was an immediate success.
Praise from every section of the Press was whole-hearted. It takes
longer than young authors imagine to get really <i>known</i>.
Messrs. Greening always warned me of that. &ldquo;You have got to
get known. You must not rest on your laurels. You must go on
pegging away as hard as you can. Follow up your success.
We&rsquo;ll do all we can for you, but you must back us up with the
very best work you can do. The play is all very well, that shrewd
business man went on to say, &ldquo;but you must remember that
there are thousands&mdash;not to say millions&mdash;of men and
women in this country who never dream of going to the theatre. As a
nation we are not theatre-goers, not like the French, who go to the
play as a matter of habit.&rdquo; He was quite right there, and
many years went by before those same men and women who used to
avoid the theatre (an old Puritanical strain in them so I always
thought) took to going in their millions to the cinema.</p>

<p>But in the meanwhile they took my books to their hearts. Bless
&rsquo;em!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And I was thankful to put all thoughts of plays and theatres
behind me and to think only of my books. The books I was going to
write: the books, the scenes and stories of which were seething in
my brain. A regular whirlwind of scenes and adventures they were.
My Scarlet Pimpernel! Well! he was not going to rest in idleness in
London and in Bath, no! Not even in the arms of his beloved
Marguerite while men, women, and children were being tracked down,
tortured, and killed the other side of the Channel. Of course he
would continue his life of devotion and self-sacrifice in their
cause. He and his brave, loyal henchmen. There were at least half a
dozen adventures into which I knew that he must plunge whilst I had
the power to put his glorious deeds into words. So I began by
setting to work and writing <i>I will Repay</i>, the first of a
whole series I intended to write on my favourite subject. Oh! there
were no rebuffs, no disappointments in my career now.</p>

<p>How many times have young authors said to me, &ldquo;Oh! if only
I could write a play! A play is so much more exciting than a book.
The production must be such a wonderful thrill! To see the scenes
which you have conceived and hear the words which you have put in
the mouth of your characters! It must be too wonderful!!&rdquo;
Well! I dare say it is, but I don&rsquo;t want any of that
excitement. I can quite well do without that thrill. Give me the
thrill of creating a character, a scene, a situation, of putting it
all into words of my own imagining and then placing it before the
public without the aid of actors and producers and scene painters
and what-nots. Give me the unalloyed joy all the time of writing a
book for a public which has learned to understand you and who loves
you and there is no greater thrill to be had in all the world.</p>

<p>I remember on one occasion, during a performance of a play of
mine, <i>Beau Brocade</i>, at the Queen&rsquo;s Theatre under Frank
Curzon&rsquo;s management, he and I were having a talk over that
same subject: play <i>versus</i> book writing, and he was much
amused by my declaring that I would far rather be the writer of
successful books than of successful plays. &ldquo;To begin
with,&rdquo; was my argument, &ldquo;there is no dramatist living,
however great a success he might have had with a play who can be
sure that his next venture will not be a failure. He depends on so
many outside factors. Think of the actors who have to interpret his
work and so often misinterpret it. Then there is the question of
fashion, of the temper of the critics, of outside circumstances
such as the weather or a death in the royal family and down goes
the barometer of the box office and the play is a failure.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But what about a book?&rdquo; he argued with a good-natured
laugh. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you equally dependent on outside
factors? What about the critics?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;a novelist once he has established himself in the heart of
his readers, has nothing to fear from the Press. One book may be
less successful than another, he may be attacked by some of the
reviewers, but at all times good or bad, fair weather or foul,
people must and will read, and they will always turn to their
favourite authors. And that is where we novelists get the pull.
There are no actors between us and the public. What we have written
is there for the public to read and to judge for itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It has also been argued that play-writing is more lucrative than
book-writing, and the question of money naturally looms large in
the hopes and ambitions of young writers. But that also is a
fallacy. Putting aside the precariousness of a play being an
outstanding success, a successful book is worth far far more from a
money point of view than any play even if it runs to many thousand
nights. Play-writing is a great, a wonderful, art. I am only too
ready to admit it. Success in it does come to a few. All I mean is
that success in it is more precarious, and is more fraught with
disappointments, and even with heartache than is the art of the
novelist. As a matter of fact to say that a book is a failure is an
anachronism. A first book by an unknown author may fail to attract,
the sales may be confined to a few orders from the circulating
libraries, but it does not mean that it is a failure, <i>i.e.</i>
that it will be relegated to the scrap heap of literary endeavour.
If only a few copies have been sold, those copies go on existing,
they are bound to pass from one hand to another if only over the
counters of the libraries. Nor does it follow that a second book by
the same author will not be published and find appreciation and the
desire for more work from the same author.</p>

<p>My contention is that there is no such thing as stark failure
for a book. Not the stark failure that attends a play which does
not happen to please the public and which has no chance of being
given a second hearing. It is dead. It is gone. No manager will
want to look at it again. And great dramatists, popular dramatists,
have known that kind of failure, and not once only. But a novelist
has not that disappointment to contend with. Readers may say:
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care for that book of yours,&rdquo; but
they will always add: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a patch
on your X.Y.Z.&rdquo; But they will have read it and will have
discussed it with others. The book will always be there for every
thinking reader to judge for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young authors, stick to your books,&rdquo; is the advise
of an old stager like I am; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bother about plays;
put all that is best in you in your books; peg away at them till
you are well known. Appreciation will come in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;As soon as <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> was an established
success in the theatre, I was approached by foreign dramatists who
desired to translate it for their own stage. Oh! if these clever
gentlemen had only been content to translate the play, keeping its
original root-idea such as I the author had conceived it, and above
all keeping the original characterization, I for one would have
been quite happy to hear the words which I had written given out in
a foreign tongue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately those same clever gentlemen desired to adapt the
play to what they declared were the requirements of their own
public, a public which I was naturally not supposed to know
anything about. I agreed to this idea of adaptation. As a matter of
fact our own dramatists here in England had for years been busy
adapting French farces and French dramas for the English stage, and
very successfully too. I will only cite <i>The Marriage of
Kitty</i> as an example, and adaptation of <i>La Passerelle</i>
which, in the rigid translation, would certainly have shocked the
prudish British nation, but as a clever adaptation, just a little
twist here and there, was perfectly &lsquo;chaste&rsquo; and most
amusing.</p>

<p>There were others of course, and I, remembering these readily
agreed to the adaptation of my <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> for the
French, the Italian, the German, and Spanish stage. The play was
very successful in Italy; it was performed not only in Rome, but
also in Milan and one or two of the other important towns. I
didn&rsquo;t see it, nor did I see the script. I have the German
script where the play was called <i>Cour As!</i> (Ace of Hearts).
The language appears to me ponderous and the dialogue entirely
lacking brightness and humour. It was first performed a year or so
before the outbreak of the 1914 war. I was not in touch with anyone
in Germany then, the agent who drew up the contract and saw that it
was properly carried out was certainly not enthusiastic about the
production. He told me that in the opinion of the critics the story
and characterization were too essentially English, and as the
English were very unpopular in Germany already the play was not to
the taste of the Anglophobe public. Funnily enough I have since
then been approached more than once (both during and after the War)
by German musicians for permission to adapt the play for opera or
operette.</p>

<p>The one &lsquo;adaptation&rsquo; I did witness, however, was the
French one. It was done by Monsieur Jean-Joseph Renaud, who in
addition to his literary fame (he was a well-known novelist and
journalist) was one of the fencing champions of France. I
understand that he has figured more often than any other man as
second in <i>affaires d&rsquo;honneur</i> (otherwise duels). Well!
he may have been (certainly was) an expert in the noble art of
duelling, but he was apparently not expert in knowledge of the
public taste&mdash;his own public, mind you. Of course I was
supposed to know nothing about the taste of the Parisian play-going
public, but M.J.J.R. knew <i>all</i> about it having been mixed up
with the theatre since boyhood and being on intimate terms of
friendship with every journalist and most theatrical managers of
Paris. My dear collaborator and I then gave him permission to adapt
the <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> for the French stage.</p>

<p>We had promised that we would go to Paris for the first
performance and we went. What I suffered that night is
indescribable. It was a mixture of agony of mind and&mdash;of
positive rage. My beloved Scarlet Pimpernel which had so often been
spoken of as the perfect presentation of an English gentleman was
the perfect presentation of a French <i>bourgeois</i>, rotund, loud
of voice, heavy of gait, profuse of gesture. He was for ever
clenching his fist. Sir Percy clenching his fist!! But what
positively outraged me was that the adapter had introduced an
intrigue between&mdash;whom do you think&mdash;Sir Andrew Ffoulkes
and Marguerite!! Sir Andrew in love with his friend&rsquo;s wife!
Even the film people didn&rsquo;t do that . . . but more of them
anon.</p>

<p>How I sat out the evening I know not. After the first act
everything became a blur and I remember nothing more. We were
staying at the time with a dear friend, Mademoiselle Cugnier, a
charming, cultured French lady, who had certainly read the
excellent translation of the book, but she had never been in
England and had therefore never seen the play. She knew what my
dear collaborator and I were both suffering, and she did and said
all she could to soften the blow&mdash;for it was a blow. I felt as
if that rotund, rubicund gentleman on the stage had knocked me on
the head with his clenched fist.</p>

<p>To add to our troubles, several friends of Mademoiselle Cugnier
came into our box to be introduced to the authors and they spoke
such flattering, such obviously insincere, eulogies of the play and
of the acting and prophesied a lasting success. In that they were
so very charming and so very French. I was never one to suffer from
&lsquo;nerves&rsquo;, but that night . . .!!!</p>

<p>The only comfort I derived from the whole thing, and it was a
funny sort of comfort, was that obviously the play was a failure
from the very first. But how a well-known French author could so
misunderstand the taste of the highly cultured public of his own
country has remained a puzzle to me. Subsequently <i>The Tangled
Skein,</i> from my own romance of that name was also adapted for
the French stage; I forget who was the adapter at that time. The
play was produced at the Theatre Sarah Bernhardt, and that is all I
know about it. We didn&rsquo;t go over to see it. Once bitten,
twice shy.</p>

<p>But worse was to come a few years later when the film people
worked their wicked will on so many of my books.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Since the days of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> I have written a
number of historical romances. History always fascinated me, and as
I never really cared for social life I didn&rsquo;t find that
modern thought and modern views of life attracted me sufficiently
to place my romantic stories in the setting of to-day. I
don&rsquo;t mean to suggest by that that there is no romance in the
life of to-day. There is plenty and to spare, more perhaps than
there was in the olden days. All I mean is, that somehow I am not
in tune with it. Never, even in my young days, was I fond of social
life. I am something of a hermit and the company of my husband and
a few intimate friends was all I ever craved for in the way of
society. I always found going to parties a terrible waste of time.
How much happier one is in the midst of an intimate circle, where
one does not have to contend with well-meaning, garrulous gushers
such as I met once, I remember at a &lsquo;party&rsquo;, a pleasant
enough woman who approached me with a glass of sherry in one hand
and a sandwich in the other, and exclaimed in a loud voice somewhat
marred by the piece of sandwich she was munching, &ldquo;Dear
Baroness Pimpernel!&rdquo; (Oh! how I hate that; I meet it so
often.) &ldquo;How I loved your lovely book! I think Chauvelin is
one of the most lovely heroes I have ever read about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What can one say on such occasions?</p>

<p>The book that gave me more pleasure to write than any of the
others is <i>By the Gods Beloved</i>, not only because I could
allow my imagination to go roaming in hitherto unexplored realms
but because I could give it full sway in picturesque descriptions
of places that did not really exist, and in people and characters
who could have no attributes that were entirely normal and modern.
My friendship with Edwin Long in the past was a great incentive for
me to embark on such an imaginative subject. He made me feel the
reality of it all, and had brought before me pictures of those
scenes which I now trained myself to describe and as he had the
wonderful talent for achieving pictorial effect, as all his
canvases were rich and colourful creations so did I try now to
achieve the same effects, the same colourful descriptions, with my
pen.</p>

<p>He taught me many artistic truths, and confessed to me the
secret of his success, and this was that he never allowed
backgrounds to dominate the human figures in his pictures. The
central figures always stood out prominently, and throughout my
long career I have always tried to emulate him in this:
&lsquo;Character&rsquo;, has been my watchword all through. As my
old friend Arnold Bennett impressed it upon me so vigorously,
&ldquo;By characters your books shall live, not by their story or
their back-ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Another period of history which has always fascinated me is that
of the struggle for independence of the Netherlands and the
ultimate overthrow, after heroic struggles, of Spanish domination
and tyranny. I just got to love those old Dutch burghers with their
obstinate desire for religious and political liberty. To me they
were never prosy and always picturesque and wandering as I did
sometimes through the cobbled streets of Haarlem, that picturesque
and thriving little town, where they lived and plotted and fought
like heroes, the hard ground always seemed to me to send forth a
memory echo of the firm heavy footsteps of those valiant old
fellows; and the old gate of the Spaarne through which they used to
pass seemed to me still haunted by the sound of their gruff voices
calling out <i>guten mittag</i> or <i>guten abend</i> as they
dispersed to go back to their homes after their gossip over their
mugs of beer at the &lsquo;Lame Cow&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The two characters that most fascinated me in their picturesque
setting were the &lsquo;Laughing Cavalier&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Leatherface&rsquo;. No one knows who was the original of the
&lsquo;Laughing Cavalier&rsquo;, that truly marvellous portrait by
Frans Hals, one of the most precious possessions artistic England
is lucky enough to boast of. With me that picture is almost an
obsession. I admire it with a kind of passionate fervour for which
I can never account. That smile, that attitude of his, his swagger,
his dress, the twinkle in his eye fascinate me, and nothing would
do but I must try and make him live before my readers in the same
vivid way in which he always appears before me.</p>

<p>Strangely enough the history of the original of the
&lsquo;Laughing Cavalier&rsquo;, of the man who sat as model for
that sublime picture, had never been written before. And yet
countless thousands must, during the past three centuries, have
stood before his portrait: we of the present generation who are the
proud possessors of that picture now, have looked on him many a
time with sheer joy in our hearts, almost forgetting the genius of
the artist who portrayed him in the very realism of the personality
which seems to laugh at us out of the canvas.</p>

<p>Anyway, I soon ascertained that no biographer had ever attempted
to tell us anything of the man&rsquo;s life, nor had anyone
attempted to lift the veil of anonymity which hides the identity of
the &lsquo;Laughing Cavalier&rsquo;. Am I so very wrong in
thinking, as I certainly do&mdash;that he was the direct ancestor
of another man with the same laughter on his lips and the same
twinkle in his eyes, of Sir Percy Blakeney in fact, the Scarlet
Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Do go and look at the picture one day. It is a part of the
Wallace Collection, and tell me if I am wrong.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14" id=
"Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
1908</b>
</h2>

<p>It was about this time that we finally decided to settle down in
the country. We were both of us country lovers at heart; neither of
us cared for social life, and we had had enough and to spare of
town life, its bustle and noise. What we wanted was peace and
quietude. What we hoped for was the opportunity of buying some
small property not too far from town but with a nice garden where
we could indulge our passionate love of flowers and trees and birds
and the broad expanse of heaven above us. But of course that was
not an undertaking that could be gone into in a hurry, and in the
meanwhile we rented a nice old dower house near Minster, in Thanet.
Thanet is not a beautiful part of England. It is flat; there are no
hills, few trees, only big fields and wide spaces with the tang and
smell of the sea all around. We spent three very happy years
there.</p>

<p>My reputation was now on a solid foundation. I could write just
whatever I wanted to. I could let my imagination and my love of
romance have free play. Whatever I wrote was eagerly sought for
publication and welcomed by an ever widening circle of readers.
Bless &rsquo;em for their goodness and loyalty to me. It was in
Thanet that I wrote <i>The Nest of the Sparrowhawk</i>, the scene
of which was laid in our neighbouring village of Acol. That book in
one of the few romances of mine with an English background. I have
often been asked why that was so. English history is every bit as
colourful, and picturesque, and as romantic as that of any other
country, and I loved it and studied it with all the ardour which my
love for my spiritual home had engendered in my heart. So I was
always a little bit at a loss how to reply to that question.</p>

<p>The real reason was the difficulty of dealing with names of
places and persons. I have never disguised these in my romances, as
fiction-writers almost invariably do. In writing of Paris and
Boulogne, of Clichy or Anjou they were always Paris or Boulogne,
and so on in my books The streets of Paris and Nantes bear the same
names to-day as they do in <i>Eldorado</i> or in <i>Lord
Tony&rsquo;s Wife.</i> I have old maps of all the towns which, to
my ears, still echo the footsteps of the Scarlet Pimpernel and his
devoted followers. There is not a country lane the configuration of
which I have in any way distorted. To me, had I changed the names
or the positions of any actual place I would, I feel sure, have
lost something of their reality and been unable to infuse that
reality into my narrative.</p>

<p>Now with English places you would have to be almost superhumanly
careful. Place but an oak tree twenty yards further than it is
standing to-day and you would bring the wrath of a score of local
readers on your head. Speak of some tiny footbridge over a rivulet
one hundred and fifty years ago and of a certainty you would be
told more in sorrow than in anger and with the addition of
documentary evidence that that footbridge had only been in its
present place one hundred and ten years ago. I remember speaking to
W. J. Locke about that and venturing to upbraid him for disguising
the names of places in his books as if he wanted to mislead his
readers, and his answer was very much what I have been trying to
explain. &ldquo;You must do it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;especially
when you have got any part of England as a background, because at
the slightest error in topography, however insignificant it might
be, you would simply get a deluge of correspondence upbraiding you
for your misdemeanour; correspondence too, to some of which
self-preservation or merely courtesy would compel you to reply, and
the life of the worker is too short to be wasted in that
way.&rdquo; &ldquo;What about French topography?&rdquo; I
suggested. &ldquo;That is not so important,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;you can do pretty much as you like provided you make no
glaring errors; but the French reader is not nearly so inclined to
be captious as your English one. I don&rsquo;t know about other
countries. And anyway,&rdquo; he went on in his charming, modest
way, &ldquo;our great master, Thomas Hardy, set us the example
didn&rsquo;t he, with his Wessex and his Casterbridge?&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But our time in Thanet didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean all work
and no play. We spent some lovely days in Transylvania&mdash;the
home of my mother&rsquo;s family&mdash;an altogether different part
of Hungary than Tarna-&Ouml;rs, and the Lowlands; they had their
origin there. Transylvania is the Eastern part of Hungary; it was
then an integral part of that Kingdom and the family owned
extensive properties over there. Transylvania, before the 1914-1918
war and the disastrous Treaty of Trianon was politically and
racially very much on a par with Ireland, that is to say, the
owners of the land&mdash;as well as the professional and middle
classes&mdash;were Hungarian. The peasantry, more numerous but
entirely uneducated, was Szlovak, <i>i.e.</i> Roumanian. The Treaty
of Trianon, which transferred the whole of Transylvania to
Roumania, dispossessed those landowners who refused to swear
allegiance to its King, and Transylvania itself has ever since been
tossed battledore and shuttlecock, from Roumania to Hungary and
back again, in accordance with the political views first of
Cl&eacute;menceau and then of Hitler.</p>

<p>But before the 1914 war it was a fine country, entirely
agricultural, surrounded by the high range of the Carpathians, the
forests of which are the haunts of bears and wild boar and herds of
wolves, and on the higher peaks of which the adventurous sportsman
can oft descry the timorous chamois, a graceful silhouette against
the intense blue of the sky. We always took our boy, Jack, with us
on our yearly visits to Czege, my maternal uncle&rsquo;s place; and
for him the outdoor, somewhat wild, life was just Paradise,
although he was not yet in his teens and had only known the
sophisticated life of towns. But my uncle often took him out with
him when he was after chamoix or small game; hare, snipe; and wild
partridge abounded, and there was wild duck on the lake three miles
long which was close to the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>The local gunsmith made a small gun for Jack and he quickly
learned to handle it in a childish fashion. He never hit anything,
but this did not worry him. He had had his fun. When I asked him if
he had brought any wild duck down he replied quite happily:
&ldquo;No; but they flew away, and they were so frightened when I
shot at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My uncle and aunt, Countess Wass, and all the cousins simply
adored &lsquo;the English family&rsquo;. They thought my English
husband the handsomest man they had ever seen, the free and easy
intercourse between us and Jack appealed to their hearts. At first
they wondered a little at what they thought must be a want of
respect of the boy towards his parents, but presently they realized
that it is through friendship between father and son that the fine
characters of Englishmen are allowed to develop early in life.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Czege, my uncle&rsquo;s place, was more primitive than
Tarna-&Ouml;rs or Tisza-Ab&aacute;d, but we loved it all the
better. My uncle drove us round to call on the nearest neighbours,
the nearest one to Czege was distant over twenty miles, and
motor-cars had not yet penetrated to the mountain fastness of
Transylvania. There were a few taxis in Kolozsv&aacute;r (the
capital town now called Chy) where my old aunts pulled down their
blinds so as not to see those inventions of the devil stationed
outside the medi&aelig;val cathedral, and there was a rich cousin
somewhere close by who owned the one and only modern car in the
land and was the terror of the entire population of Transylvania.
We drove about in the light carriages that were specially suited to
the soft sandy roads, and to the dear little Arab horses who
galloped away with them, sometimes in teams of four or in teams of
six, as if they had only a load of feathers behind them.</p>

<p>Among many other activities my uncle was a great breeder of
horses. As he na&iuml;vely used to say to us: &ldquo;You know, my
dears, a wretched landed proprietor in this wild country has very
little coin of the realm to bless himself with. The sale of my
horses is my great mainstay whenever I am short of
money&mdash;which I very often am.&rdquo; We got him to tell us
just how the business of buying and selling was carried on, and how
he had made a start with the fine stud which had become one of the
most important ones in Eastern Hungary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hungarian and the Egyptian Governments,&rdquo; he
told us, &ldquo;are two of my best customers, and I also sell to
the Serbian and Bulgarian armies. The breed of our horses in
Eastern Hungary is splendid for military purposes, as the beasts
have boundless endurance and though they are small they are very
strong and hardy. I know,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;that at
the time of your South African War our horses came into disrepute,
when a lot of dishonest middlemen came here to purchase horses for
the British Government. These men were hopelessly dishonest. They
were Polish Jews for the most part, and they lined their pockets by
buying all sorts of worthless horses and palming them off on the
unsuspecting British remount officers who sat smoking cigarettes in
the H&ocirc;tel Hungaria and were entirely in the hands of those
Jews as they did not know a word of Hungarian.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And then one day we had a most thrilling experience. The
Hungarian Government was sending two remount officers to Czege to
select and purchase a certain number of horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to see some fun,&rdquo; my uncle said to us
that morning. And we did.</p>

<p>To begin with in the early morning the stud which we used to see
grazing on the hillside far away had been driven into a field
below, close to the ch&acirc;teau. After lunch we all went down
into the field. There were some five hundred horses there then.</p>

<p>The chief herdsman was there with my uncle, stud book in hand,
to select and check off the beasts. We, who had never seen anything
of the sort before, were just enthralled. Firstly the pick of the
herd was checked off, those that were not for sale to the
Government but would be kept for the owner&rsquo;s own use or for
sale to his friends.</p>

<p>How different to the staid, solemn business of a horse fair in
England.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the Hungarian <i>csik&oacute;s</i> the
herdsmen are a race apart. Their knowledge and handling of these
wild creatures surpasses anything the Wild West has ever shown us,
and they wield the lasso as skilfully as the most expert American
or Argentine cowboy.</p>

<p>All I know is that at the end of the day all was peace and quiet
once more. The remount officers had been and made their purchases.
The horses which they had chosen had been branded with the
Government stamp and number, and this with the young untamed
animals was neither an easy nor a pleasant process, nor was the
work of the troopers who had to lead the horses afterwards some
eighteen miles to the nearest railway station for entrainment. The
horses that were too young or too small, the valuable brood mares
and the very promising two-and three-year-olds, were allowed to
return to their free life unhampered on the hillside far away.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>While Jack was still at his prep. school in Stanmore Park we
once spent two autumn months, October and November, in Czege. My
uncle was &lsquo;a great hunter before the Lord&rsquo; and we were
keen on seeing some of the great trophies that fell every year to
his gun and those of his friends. The most interesting trophy to me
that year was the magnificent skin of a huge brown bear which my
uncle shot in the forest of the Carpathians, a skin which adorned
the hall of Snowfield for some years and is now spread on the floor
in the dining-room of my little villa in Monte Carlo&mdash;<i>sic
transit gloria</i> . . . He must have been a magnificent fellow,
standing in life not far short of ten feet on his huge pads. Count
Wass shot him in the dense forest at ten paces. &ldquo;It was
either the bear or me,&rdquo; he used to say with a laugh;
&ldquo;for he came at me quite unawares from nowhere seemingly, and
with outstretched arms; but he made a good target of himself and I
was the lucky one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bear in the Carpathian Mountains is the grizzly or Russian
bear, and as powerful as he is fierce if attacked. This one&rsquo;s
skin had been promised me by my uncle if he happened to bring him
down. A close relation of his adorned the Paris Exhibition
(Hungarian section) 1900. He, to, had fallen to my uncle&rsquo;s
gun. He had not been skinned but stuffed, and stood upright, fully
ten feet high from his pads to the crown of his splendid head. He
was black, except for a white waistcoat and collar. A rich Armenian
bought him for the adornment of his house in Alexandria.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The forests of the Carpathians are also the abode of a large
breed of wild boar, and of course the haunt of wolves. The year we
were there in the late autumn, winter had set in very early and was
very severe. The mountains were already deep in snow, and the
wolves were hungry and extremely unpleasant, because at night they
came down in herds to the foot of the mountains, close to the
ch&acirc;teau, and there set up a howling fit to wake the dead. A
weird sound at night. I didn&rsquo;t like it. Of course battues
were organized and wolves were rounded up and encircled as an enemy
army would be in wartime. Most of the peasants were armed with guns
and were a valuable addition to the gentlemen who joined in the
<i>razzia</i> in a sporting spirit. A number of the ravenous beasts
were invariably shot and the rest would get away and lope back up
the mountainside, and I imagine that they were a prolific lot for
it seemed to me that the nightly howlings after a few days&rsquo;
respite when calm appeared to have descended on the forest
restarted as unpleasant and as loud as before.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We did some delightful journeyings from Czege into Roumania,
Moldavia, and over the Carpathians into Bukovina. No
motor-cars&mdash;just that perfect means of getting about, four or
six sturdy little horses and the light carriages which skimmed over
the excellent mountain roads and over mountain passes which no
motor (at any rate those of thirty years ago) could have tackled,
except to the great inconvenience of travellers and constant wear
and tear of tyres and mechanism. We spent a very happy month in
Tusn&aacute;d, a watering place with hot sulphur springs which was
close to Brass&oacute;, the last Hungarian town on the Western
number of visitors during the summer season, rich Roumanian and
Bulgarian Jews and other merchants.</p>

<p>Granting that everything in the way of hotel accommodation was
primitive, it was always spotlessly clean and the cooking
super-excellent. The hotel we stayed at was right in the middle of
the forest, and one had all one&rsquo;s meals out-of-doors under
the trees with the scent of pine, of cedar and of rich earth in
one&rsquo;s lungs, and the air as invigorating a tonic as the most
modern vitamines could possibly devise: in fact, so invigorating
was it that I&mdash;who was never a great walker and certainly
never much of a mountain climber&mdash;was able to go up to the
&lsquo;Anna T&ocirc;&rsquo;, a lake two thousand feet up, as blue
as the Mediterranean on a sunny day.</p>

<p>We also went over to Sinaia, on the Eastern side of the
Carpathians, the summer residence of the King of Roumania, as
beautiful a spot as any sovereign could wish for, in which to rest
from politics and forget the turbulence of his people. Here we had
the pleasure of meeting the Queen of Romania, known to the literary
world as <i>Carmen Sylva</i>, and had the honour of being
introduced to her. She was a Princess of Wied, rather plain with a
red face and heavy German features, but she was very gracious,
speaking to us in English (fluent with a German accent).</p>

<p>I had never been an admirer of her <i>Thoughts of a Queen</i>
for the &lsquo;thoughts&rsquo; had not seemed to me either original
or exalted. Probably she had no opinion of my works either, though
she admitted being &lsquo;conversant with them&rsquo;. So we threw
bouquets at one another, she very condescendingly to me, and I with
the respect due to her rank and her attainments, which must have
been considerable seeing that she was honorary Doctor of something
or other of the University of Budapest.</p>

<p>Not very far from Sinaia, but still on the Hungarian side of the
mountains was Dorna Watra, a watering-place with some kind of
curative springs. It seemed to us both as the exclusive abode of
Jews. There are a great many Jews in every part of Hungary, but
never had I seen so many people of the old faith congregated in one
town. We struck it in mid-September, the day of their great
festival. There they were, young and old, men, women and children;
the men and the boys in long kaftans down to their heels, round fur
bonnets on their heads, and all of them with the characteristic
curl down each cheek in front of the ear. Though they came from
various parts of Hungary and of Roumania, they were of the race of
Polish Jews.</p>

<p>I cannot bear to think now of that crowd as I saw it that day,
knowing what unspeakable misery, what hideous mental and bodily
torture those brutish Nazis have inflicted since upon those same
people whom we shouldered on that peaceful day in September so many
years ago. Of course as a race they had their faults&mdash;and they
were grievous faults. No nation is more aware of these than the
Hungarian, where the peasantry has groaned from centuries under
their exactions and their rapacity, but it was not for the
barbarous and sadistic Nazis to retaliate with murder and
butchery.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15" id=

</h2>

<p>The happiest of all memories we had of our visits to
Transylvania were the five lovely little horses from the pick of
the stud which we bought from my uncle one year. We sent the
coachman over to Hungary (we were still living in Thanet then) to
fetch them and bring them over to England. They arrived quite safe
and sound, but they had been very sea-sick in the North Sea (so
much for those wiseacres who will have it that sea-sickness is the
result of imagination, and therefore easily controlled by
will-power). They were a real joy to us and to our friends. We had
the greatest fun in breaking them in. They had, as a matter of
fact, been broken in for harness and saddle but they had never seen
a motor-car in all their young lives and the scampering that went
on when first they met that unbelievable horror was as exciting to
the driver as it was to them. Thanet, as a matter of fact was a
perfect country for this breaking-in. I am talking of forty and
more years ago. There were no hedges to break the even carpet of
huge fields which lay under deep snow during the winter and were
just rough pasture and grazing ground the rest of the year. We went
warily and gradually to work. The coachman&mdash;a Thanet
man&mdash;was immensely interested in the work and was wonderfully
efficient and patient. I had of course to bide my time patiently
until it was decided by the powers that ruled lovingly over me that
it would be safe for me to hold the reins.</p>

<p>We used to get up at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning that
first autumn, when, harnessed to a light wagonette which we had
brought for the purpose, we first took those dear timorous things
out on the roads between Acol and Minster, and many a scamper we
had over fields at the first approach of a motor and its ominous
honking. Well! I was not called upon to wait very long for the
happy day when first I was allowed to hold the reins. I drove the
two beautiful greys first in a light phaeton and lovely they
looked. But the great joy was when first we harnessed the five in
the light wagonette, Hungarian fashion, three leaders and
Goldie&mdash;lovely Goldie with the burnt sienna satin coat and the
golden mane and tail, the loose one between the other two
leaders.</p>

<p>To say that we created a sensation in the sleepy backwater of
Minster-in-Thanet would be to put it mildly: but the team was a
delight to the schoolboys of Mr. Hawtry&rsquo;s school whenever
they caught sight of it. Only Mr. Hawtry didn&rsquo;t like it. When
we drove the team of four he was angry and jumped off his bicycle
muttering some rather rude words: but when he met us presently with
our team of five he was outraged and shouted after us: &ldquo;How
many more of these abominable beasts are you going to drive about
the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well! the fun and delight of those dear little Hungarian horses
did not last more than a very few years. So very many things
happened. Events followed events in quick succession. For one thing
our lease of Cleave Court, the old Manor House in Thanet, was up.
The house was really rather inconvenient and we didn&rsquo;t care
to renew it. The lease was subsequently bought by Sir Edward
Carson, who greatly improved the house and made it his week-end
quarters for several years.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16" id=
"Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b>
</h2>

<p>In the meanwhile we had been in treaty for the purchase of
Snowfield between Maidstone and Ashford. It was about the size that
we were looking for, some twenty acres of garden. The house was
very ugly, but thanks to the architectural genius of Mr. Andrew N.
Prentice, backed by my husband&rsquo;s artistic conceptions, it was
soon transformed into a thing of beauty. By the time those two
artists had done with it there was nothing left of the old villa,
except the inside walls. The outside became lovely and mellowed,
beautiful in line and in colour, backed by a hill which we very
soon planted with rhododendrons and flaming azaleas out of which
rose here and there on the brow stately Austrian pines and lower
down clumps of mountain ash.</p>

<p>We were passionate gardeners, both of us, and the making of that
beautiful Kentish garden was one of the joys of our life. The hill
behind the house was a protective screen against north-easterly
winds, and roses are flowering shrubs revelled in the mild climate
of south-eastern England and gave us all that we could wish in the
way of colour and beauty. Here we lived a happy and prosperous life
until the close of the war in 1918. In 1906 I inherited, through
the death of an uncle, the greater portion of the Hungarian
property of Tarna-&Ouml;rs. Some amusing stories were soon current
in the Press about this inheritance of mine. Of course its
proportions were swelled in print to most wonderful and impossible
proportions; but, apart from that, the imaginative journalistic
mind had woven a romance all its own around the &lsquo;fortune that
had come unexpectedly to the author of <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i>&rsquo;. I do believe that journalists beat us
novelists hollow in imagination.</p>

<p>I had just published my book, <i>A Son of the People</i>, the
scene of which I laid in Tarna-&Ouml;rs itself, describing the
house in which I was born and the life of the territorial magnates
of Hungary with which I had been familiar in my childhood. As a
matter of fact the love story which I wove into the plot actually
occurred in the next village to Tarna-&Ouml;rs, and the daughter of
the territorial noble who owned that property did actually marry a
highly educated and rich peasant who had fallen desperately in love
with her. Her father had been brought to financial disaster through
the same agrarian troubles that had nearly ruined my own dear
father, and he gave a reluctant consent to the incongruous
marriage. It was a romantic episode ready to my hand when I wrote
<i>A Son of the People</i>.</p>

<p>What did my imaginative journalistic friends do but seize upon
the publication of this book and weave around it the romance of my
inheritance? According to them I had been lost to the Hungarian
world. No one knew what had become of me, where to find the owner
of the fortune which had, as it were, fallen from heaven and was
drifting ownerless somewhere in mid-air (as a matter of fact I was
at the time in treaty with a publisher in Budapest for the
translation of <i>A Son of the People</i> into Hungarian). But
never mind, the journalistic romance was too good to be lost to the
world. <i>A Son of the People</i> had revealed to the lawyers in
Hungary that the Baroness Orczy was very much alive and ready to
take up the inheritance which was hers by right.</p>

<p>Everyone set to work to bring about the reunion of lawyers and
family with the fortune author and, incidentally, caused much
perturbation in the Income Tax Department of His Majesty&rsquo;s
Exchequer. How to ascertain its exact amount? How, above all, to
assess the sum due by the lucky Hungarian legatee to His
Majesty&rsquo;s Income Tax <i>and</i> Super Tax Departments? Well,
these were problems which took a lot of time and trouble to unravel
to the satisfaction of the above departments. Luckily, Dr.
Herschel, our lawyer in Hungary, spoke English fluently. He came
over to London armed with all the information necessary for the
elucidation of the financial puzzle. But my dear husband was the
principal victim in this affair, with the amount of time he had to
spend cooling his heels in the bureaux of the powers that be, in
satisfying them that the gigantic fortune boldly assessed
originally at &pound;20,000,000 was in reality only a few
thousands.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>After these incursions into romance, peace reigned in Snowfield.
Work, hard work, was the order of the day. My husband had built for
himself a studio in the garden, and I had my library and desk in
the house. But the distance between the house and the studio was
only fifty yards across the rose garden and as there was no light
in the library for painting, I soon took to establishing myself and
my books and my desk in the studio. In the early days of our
married life we had always worked together in one room&mdash;my
darling at his easel and I at my desk&mdash;that I found it
impossible to concentrate on my work sitting in a room all alone.
And to this day, until the light went out of my life, I have always
done my work either in Snowfield, in London, and finally in Monte
Carlo, with my dear one working beside me and more often than not
with his model posing on the throne a few feet away.</p>

<p>Though I got through a great deal of work during the next few
years&mdash;as a matter of fact I brought out two historical
romances a year, and after a time three in two years&mdash;we did
not spend the whole of our time in Snowfield. We were always there
for Christmas because my boy Jack, then at Stanmore Park, always
brought two or three of his special chums with him to spend the
holidays&mdash;boys whose parents were somewhere abroad&mdash;and
we certainly had a riotous time during their stay with us. Our
nearest neighbours were the Pelham Warners who had a boy and girl
of their own, and during the whole of Christmas-time the fun at
Snowfield and at Charing&mdash;the Warner&rsquo;s place&mdash;was
certainly fast and furious.</p>

<p>Christmas Day was always spent at Snowfield, so was the evening,
and the Christmas tree was always set up in the dining-room there.
The next day we all went over to Charing. We drove over with our
beloved team in time for lunch and were fetched after dark by the
coachman in the staid and sober landau. But even this happy
arrangement did not last very long. The Kentish roads round about
us were narrow and twisting. Motor-cars soon increased in numbers
and took possession of the roads to the detriment of peaceful
driving which I loved.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>When the war came our little Hungarian horses were taken over by
the Kent Yeomanry for officers&rsquo; chargers, and for some months
after that I used to get letters from both officers and men giving
me news of Goldi or Netti or Tatiana, who were always treated as
pets. Then news became more scarce and finally ceased to come.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17" id=
"Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</b>
</h2>

<p>The happy holidays in Transylvania came to a sad end in 1913
with the death of my uncle. And after that came wars and rumours of
war and the whole world as we knew it seemed all to crumble up and
change its face of joy and merriment into one of gravity and at
times even of gloom. At first it was war in the Balkans with an
attendant collapse on the Stock Exchange, the tumbling of
securities that had seemed as safe (or very nearly as safe) as the
Bank of England, down to unheard-of levels, and so many friends had
been hit right and left with financial troubles and there was
constant talk of selling houses that were too expensive to keep up
or properties that were falling in value.</p>

<p>We never worried about all that. We had plenty of work to do,
and the work was congenial and remunerative. We felt secure
financially as to our future whatever happened. I wrote two
romances during 1912, <i>Fire in Stubble</i> and <i>Meadowsweet</i>
and started (at I am happy to say, public request) yet another
adventure of my always popular Scarlet Pimpernel, namely,
<i>Eldorado,</i> which was completed and finished the following
year. It has always seemed to me strange how universally popular
that hero of mine had become. In fact his popularity had grown and
spread with the years.</p>

<p>The Terry management were reviving the play time after time
either in London or on tour in the big towns, and since the first
publication of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> itself I had written
<i>I Will Repay</i> and <i>The Elusive Pimpernel</i> and still my
readers seemed to be asking for more&mdash;so much so, in fact that
I began at times to feel weary of that elusive personage, but never
for a moment did my imagination give out as to his adventures. He
had always been so intensely alive to me that at any moment I could
conjure up pictures of him in the turmoil of revolutions and
persecutions, ready to help and relieve sorrows and sufferings with
his boundless energy and resourceful brain. I loved all his
friends: Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lord Anthony Dewhurst, Lord Hastings,
and above all I loved Marguerite, his brave and devoted wife. I
knew them all personally. They were more real and more vivid to me
than the friends of this world.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>These were the exciting times of the great feminine movement,
&lsquo;Votes for Women!&rsquo; The slogan was everywhere.
Discussions were hot and strong between those for and against the
movement, discussions which often ended in loss of temper and
sometimes alas! in the snapping of ties of old friendships.
Needless to say that we took no part in the movement at all. We
were workers and artists, not politicians. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t
care one way or the other. I knew&mdash;as certainly as I knew
anything&mdash;that for good or ill women would get their
parliamentary vote, sooner of later, and I was content to wait till
that time came along. But in the meanwhile we knew, as indeed every
thinking English man and woman knew also, that nothing in the
political world is ever gained by gentle and peaceful methods. It
is only by shouting and beating drums, by noise and untiring
activity, by loud insistence and perseverance that anything in the
way of reform is ever attained in this country or in any other.</p>

<p>In our village (Bearsted) the population, those at any rate who
thought about things at all, were decidedly &lsquo;anti&rsquo;. Mr.
Lushington, the vicar, was getting on in life, and I don&rsquo;t
think worried himself much about the matter. He certainly never
expressed an opinion on the subject either in the pulpit or out of
it. Against that his curate was violently anti-suffragist, and
looked upon Mrs. Pankhurst and her adherents as something akin to
female anti-Christs. (There were people like that in those days,
both men and women.) He was practically in charge of the parish,
and fired by the accounts in the Press of outrages perpetrated by
the &lsquo;suffragettes&rsquo;, as they were called (including
certain raids on London churches and demonstrations in Downing
Street and Westminster), he organized a corps of day and night
watchers, whose duty it was to guard the church and its approach,
as well as the village green, against possible depredations.</p>

<p>We had spent Jack&rsquo;s Easter holidays in Switzerland and on
our return found the whole village in a turmoil of excitement
against the &lsquo;suffragettes&rsquo;. Among other duties these
watchers undertook the unpleasant task of ducking in the village
pond all those women who attempted any demonstration or depredation
of any sort or kind in the village. Thus were many men and women
who declared themselves to be devoted to the cause of law and
order, kept on the watch and out of their beds night after night.
But no untoward incident had occurred up to now, and we were at the
end of April. I imagine that gradually the zest for keeping watch
o&rsquo; nights&mdash; with the likely pleasure of ducking
one&rsquo;s political opponents in the village pond&mdash;had begun
to cool down a bit.</p>

<p>Then came the great day of the cricket match, Bearsted
<i>versus</i> Royal Marine depot. There was not a soul in the
village or in any of the villages round who would not be present on
that great occasion. There had even been a vague, if unconfirmed,
rumour that Pelham Warner who had promised to come over and see the
match, would give hundreds of spectators the delight of seeing him
play&mdash;on which side and under what rules were not stated. We
were giving a monster tea-party at Snowfield to all our friends and
acquaintances and we had engaged the Royal Marine depot band from
Deal to play on the green, where my secretary, and one or two of
our old servants, would dispense tea and cakes in a tent in the
intervals of play. The weather had been glorious for the past week
and the barometer was behaving splendidly, as steady as a rock.</p>

<p>And lo! In the early morning Bearsted was confronted with an
outrage as abominable as it was unexplainable. The village green
was dotted all over with small flags each bearing the legend in
bold, black lettering:</p>

<p align="center"><b>&ldquo;NO VOTES FOR WOMEN, NO CRICKET FOR
BEARSTED.&rdquo;</b>
</p>

<p>Who had perpetrated this gross offence against order and
decency? Who had dared launch this flagrant menace and proclaim
this insult against the whole population of Bearsted? The reaction
was terrific. The villagers were up in arms. They patrolled every
approach of the village green, armed with their scythes and their
sickles and their spades. They cast longing eyes on the village
pond into which they hoped to hurl those female miscreants as in
the olden days witches were hurled till they drowned.</p>

<p>In Snowfield we know nothing. We guessed, but we did not know:
nor did any of our servants with the exception of one who had
perpetrated the outrage and he had done it by way of a joke. But
who that one was we did not know till long afterwards. He was
instigated and aided in the writing on the flags by my secretary, a
nice girl, as quiet and simple and as a little mouse, but she
worshipped at the shrine of Mrs. Pankhurst &amp; Co. Anyway, though
the menace was emphatic and categorical, nothing followed. Nothing
happened. The cricket match was a great success (I forget which
side won), so was the tea and so was the band; and all of us from
Snowfield were able to go about with the air of complete innocence,
for not one of us knew anything at all. I think that the man who
felt the keenest disappointment in the whole affair was our poor
curate, who had so looked forward to the delight of ducking a few
militant suffragettes in the village pond.</p>

<p>I find it amusing to see in my dear one&rsquo;s small diary for
that year (1913) that &lsquo;2 aeroplanes passed over Bearsted on
that eventful afternoon&rsquo;.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p><i>Eldorado</i> was published that year and I made a start on a
book to which I had looked forward with immense joy for some time.
This was <i>Unto C&aelig;sar</i>, a romance of ancient Rome in the
time of the C&aelig;sars. I had spent many days and
months&mdash;not to say years&mdash;of study of that fascinating
epoch, and we had gone on a long holiday to Rome recently so as to
enable me to consolidate the pictures which my mind had created of
that magnificent period. My idea was to place in the midst of
opulent, pagan, gorgeous Rome, a man in high position and therefore
of influence who had been present in Jerusalem at the time of the
death of our Lord, had in fact been an eye-witness of His death
upon the Cross and had thereafter become a Christian. The likely
reaction on a strong, dominating character after such an experience
fascinated me and set me thinking, so did the contrast that
presented itself to my mind of such a man&rsquo;s character and way
of thinking, as against the thoughts and feelings of those who had
been his close associates in the past in the service of the
C&aelig;sars; so did, above all, the idea of love for a woman to
whom that which had altered the whole course of his life and had
completely changed his character and his every thought would be
only a mere incident not worthy of notice&mdash;just a very
ordinary event, the punishment of a malefactor.</p>

<p>As in all my books the dominant idea for me was always character
rather than story. I have always begun my books with the conception
of a character and then built my romance round that. <i>Unto
C&aelig;sar</i> gave me immense pleasure to write: that book and
<i>By the Gods Beloved</i> have always remained my favourite
works&mdash;leaving <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> as one apart from
anything else I have ever done. In those books I could allow my
imagination and my love for the picturesque to run absolutely riot.
I am happy to say that both have been among the most popular, the
most widely read, and the most frequently translated into European
languages.</p>

<p>In this same still peaceful year I wrote <i>The Laughing
Cavalier</i>, which was also one of the romances I most rejoiced
in. There was no difficulty in creating this character. It was all
there, glowing out of Hals&rsquo; vivid and magnificent picture.
All I had to do was to imagine what he would do, what adventures
would befall him and above all how the serious business of love as
well of political and religious conflict would affect him. <i>The
Laughing Cavalier</i> was published the following year&mdash;the
great year. But more of this anon.<br>

<p>For it was the great year, though we didn&rsquo;t know it when
in beautiful, peaceful Snowfield we heard the bells of our little
church ring in the new-born year. All was peaceful and happy during
the first six months. I was completing my romance of <i>The
Laughing Cavalier</i>; my beloved husband was painting. He had
contrived to arrange for models to come down to Bearsted and sit to
him in his studio while they stayed in the lodge at Snowfield. One
of these was a West Indian girl named Helen Cox, beautiful in her
wild, dark way and as graceful as a Persian cat. A large picture of
her hangs in the studio of our villa in Monte Carlo. I often look
at it now, for somehow her pose and her set smile remind me more
than anything else of the quietude which we enjoyed during those
first six months of the eventful year.</p>

<p>We had football matches at Maidstone and cricket matches on
Bearsted Green. We bought our first motorcar, often went up to
London in it to see our new plays or interview Mr. Watt, still (and
I always hope) my literary agent. We spent a week or two in Rome,
where Sir Rennell and Lady Rodd entertained us most charmingly at
the Embassy. We saw a good deal also of the <i>beau monde</i> of
the Italian capital. I may safely say that nowhere in any of the
great European capitals have I seen so many magnificently beautiful
women.</p>

<p>There was a Princess Colonna who was, to my mind, a veritable
queen of beauty, tall above the average with her regal figure and
creamy skin, her small head crowned with a wealth of soft black
hair, her wonderful jewels and exquisite Parisian gown, she was to
me a sight never to be forgotten. She seemed to carry with perfect
ease on her superb shoulders the burden of her aristocratic
ancestry and of her historic name, and her presence carried with it
the authority that only great beauty confers.</p>

<p>But there were others of course whose names escape me after all
these years, and I was always very bad at names but a whole-hearted
admirer of beauty, and at the reception in the fine rooms of the
British Embassy in Rome I could indulge in this admiration to my
heart&rsquo;s content. Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking all
the time of those Roman matrons of the period of which I had dealt
in my book, <i>Unto C&aelig;sar.</i> In my mind, giving my
imagination full play, I forgot their Paris gowns and their
diamonds and draped their beautiful bodies in rich folds of crimson
or purple togas and confined their dark tresses in fillets of
gold.</p>

<p>Most of the men I met that evening only spoke very indifferent
French and only a few, naval officers for the most part, could say
a few words of English. Luckily I was fairly conversant with
Italian, sufficiently at any rate to understand the charming things
that were said to me about my books. <i>La Primula Rossa</i> was
apparently as well known all over Italy as was <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> in England. Nearly all of my books had by this time
been translated into Italian, and had appeared serially in the
monthly editions of the <i>Corri&egrave;re della Serra.</i></p>

<p>During the rest of the days, which we still spent in Rome after
the wonderful party at the Embassy, I was kept quite busy
autographing copies of those charming volumes of my works issued by
the Florentine firm of Adriano Sanani, beautifully printed and most
artistically bound and sold at the low price of five liras (four
shillings at that time). I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that our
seven-and-six-penny editions compared unfavourably as to get-up
with the Italian editions as did our cheap reprints with the
four-lira editions issued by Casa Editrice Sanzogno of Milan.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We went to another memorable party while we were in Rome: not so
brilliant a one as that in the British Embassy but certainly more
amusing and original. This was at the house of Conte Luigi Primoli,
great grandson of Lucien Bonaparte, younger brother of the Emperor
Napoleon, who had married his cousin Z&eacute;na&iuml;de, also a
Bonaparte. So our host was Bonaparte &lsquo;all over&rsquo;, and
showed it in the decorations and appurtenances of his house in the
Rua Sallustiana. It certainly was a remarkable house. A short
flight of stone steps led up to a perron and to the front door.
These were lined by flunkeys (I can&rsquo;t call them anything
else) clothed in extraordinary livery: tail-coats that had once
been scarlet but were now a dull, faded shade of pink, yellow plush
breeches, white cotton stockings, buckled shoes, and white cotton
gloves. Their hair was powdered and worn in eighteenth-century
fashion, with a black tricorne hat on top.</p>

<p>The two reception rooms were already crowded when we entered.
They were as remarkable as the outside of the house, crammed with
Napoleonic relics of every sort and kind; a few of real value such
as a fan of lace and mother-o&rsquo;-pearl which had belonged to
the Empress Josephine, and a satin shoe which had been worn by
Marie-Louise; these things and one or two others of genuine
interest were in a glass case, but cupboards, shelves, and tables
all over the two rooms were simply loaded with the veriest bazaar
trash in the shape of busts and statuettes of the great Napoleon.
Busts of every conceivable size, some life-size, others no more
than an inch or two in height; busts and statuettes of marble and
busts of plaster; statuettes carved in wood, the figure draped in
roman toga or clothed in military uniform. And on the walls
pictures and reproductions of pictures representing various phases
of the great man&rsquo;s meteoric career.</p>

<p>And the company was as remarkable as the setting in which it
moved about and chattered. The noise as we entered the rooms would
have drowned the sounds of the parrot house at the Zoo. Some of the
ladies would have put the nymphs of the Folies Berg&egrave;re to
shame by their semi-nakedness; others were in simple, often quite
shabby, day dresses; and it seemed as if the descendant of the
great Bonaparte family had gathered round him representatives of
all the countries of two continents. One heard French and Italian,
a very little English, any amount of Spanish and Portuguese.</p>

<p>There was a celebrated French artist present&mdash;a
much-admired painter of the nude who could have found inspiration
for his pictures in the daring <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> of
some of the South American beauties. Altogether an exceptional and,
in its way, an amusing party. There were two or three of our
Italian friends present and with them we wandered round the rooms
looking at the extraordinary mixture of a few beautiful old pieces
of Empire furniture with so much that was trash and glaringly
vulgar, and of a few obviously great ladies exquisitely dressed (or
undressed) with some who looked shabby and even unwashed.</p>

<p>As we were leaving Rome for Naples the next day we didn&rsquo;t
stay late, but I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever forget this amazing
party in that very remarkable museum of family relics. The host
received his guests with all the charm of manner peculiar to
well-born Italians. I don&rsquo;t think there was a hostess
present: at any rate I was not introduced to one. Our kind friend,
Madame Cortazzo, had procured us the invitation and I am very glad
we had been able to accept as I had never seen any gathering quite
like it, or any house like that of the Conte di Primoli in the Rua
Sallustiana in Rome.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Our Italian holiday was quickly at an end. We had many
engagements and duties to attend to in Snowfield: foremost amongst
these was the court Ball to which we had been honoured by an
invitation. I had been to such a great function before and always
loved it, because I have always loved glitter and pageants and, to
my mind, none other in the countries which I had visited ever
equalled the beauty and glamour of Buckingham Palace on great
occasions. This one, I knew, would be more glamorous than former
ones. All the younger members of the Royal Family would certainly
be there, and the Corps Diplomatique would be in full force and in
full array of gorgeous national dress.</p>

<p>Our dear friends, the Karolyi&rsquo;s, had been succeeded in the
Austro-Hungarian Embassy by Count Deym who was Czech by birth and
had a German wife: and we certainly would miss the Hungarian
element and the gorgeous Hungarian national dress which became the
former dignified ambassador so well. But one always met friends
among the brilliant throng and there was always the chance while
the more exalted among the guests were at supper to dance to the
strains of that wonderful Artillery String Band, alternating with
the Guards Band, both of which are to my mind supreme among all the
military bands of other countries I have ever heard. The date fixed
for the ball was 28th June, and we had arranged to spend a few days
in London after it.</p>

<p>The weather was very hot, eighty degrees in the shade in the
garden. We drove up to town by motor, and as soon as we reached the
suburbs we were faced with the huge placards in the afternoon
papers: &lsquo;Assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir
to the Austro-Hungarian throne.&rsquo; Of course one knew at once
that there would be no Court Ball this day, but we drove on into
town for further news. The Ball was, of course, postponed, but a
subsequent date would be announced later in the Press. The news was
even more appalling than had at first appeared; at least, to me it
seemed more appalling, because the wife of the Archduke had also
been killed by the side of her husband while they were driving in
Serajevo, the capital of Bosnia which they were visiting: she was
one of the many daughters of Count Cothek, of the Czech nobility,
who had been Austro-Hungarian minister in Brussels while my parents
stayed there and my sister and I were at convent-school. This same
Countess Clothilde Cothek I knew very well as a child, as I did all
her sisters (but I never saw her again after the Brussels days), so
very naturally this horrible crime, to which she fell a victim,
affected me very strongly.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We drove back to Snowfield that same evening, but had another
outing in London three days later. We went up to Harrow for
prize-giving day. I always love the school songs; &lsquo;Forty
years on&rsquo; is one of the most affecting songs I know and the
cheering on the terrace and general atmosphere. My Jack
didn&rsquo;t get a prize. He never did. We took him and other boys
who were non-prize winners to the tuck-shop where they consoled
themselves with numerous &lsquo;dringers&rsquo;&mdash;horrible
concoctions of variegated ice-creams mixed with lemonade.</p>

<p>The Court Ball eventually took place on 16th July. It was very
brilliant. But, looking back on it, I feel that somehow there was
an atmosphere not exactly of gloom but of unrest in the midst of
what should have been unmixed gaiety. There must have been a good
many there, men in high places or in official positions who must by
then have had an inkling of the trouble that was brewing, of the
trouble which we, the common herd, had no idea of as yet.</p>

<p>Thus on the night of the Court Ball, the usual atmosphere of
heartiness and gaiety seemed somehow absent. The brilliance, the
pageant, the gorgeousness were all there, the supper was
magnificent, the dancing general. The Prince of Wales was there but
he seemed moody and rather bored. The <i>quadrille
d&rsquo;honneur</i> which opened the ball was danced by the Queen,
who had chosen the ambassador of one of the great powers (I forget
which) as her partner: she looked most beautiful and exquisitely
dressed, her lovely fair hair crowned with a superb diamond tiara.
His Majesty, on the other hand, looked serious. He could not have
been feeling very well for one thing, and there was a decidedly
troubled look in his eyes. The Prince danced the <i>quadrille
d&rsquo;honneur</i> with one of his aunts. I suppose this was a
question of etiquette; but he did not look as if he enjoyed it.</p>

<p>A striking figure that evening was the Russian Ambassador: the
last to be seen at the English Court for many years to come. He
wore a magnificent kind of tabard, stiff with gold embroidery and
below this his thin legs appeared clad in black silk breeches, silk
stockings and curiously shaped thin black boots. The
Austro-Hungarian Ambassador was of course not present owing to his
court&rsquo;s deep mourning, and to me the American Ambassador
appeared most conspicuous as he was the only one among his more or
less gorgeously clad confr&egrave;res who wore plain evening
dress.</p>

<p>A fortnight later came the crash.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19" id=
"Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19</b>
</h2>

<p>I am not going to talk about &lsquo;the crash&rsquo;. So many
books have been written about it. Everything has been told and
retold, and so much has been lived through, and so much remembered,
so little forgotten. My son was too young and we were too old to be
of any use &lsquo;out there&rsquo;: and all that I want to recall
is the way my home life and my work were affected by that terrible
cataclysm.</p>

<p>After the first shock of those awful headlines in the morning
papers of August 4th &lsquo;England declares war on Germany&rsquo;,
what intruded most persistently on my consciousness was the
ever-flowing stream of Belgian refugees which threatened to
submerge our small towns and villages in this part of Kent.
Hospitals could not, of course, cope with it; the stream overflowed
into every house, every cottage, every stable and barn from Chatham
to Rochester, to Maidstone, to Ashford.</p>

<p>Devoted, impecunious old gentlewomen gave up their beds, denied
themselves every comfort to house these poor people who descended
like locusts upon the entire neighbourhood, expecting everything,
demanding everything; every attention, every comfort. Dear
Belgians! How we loved them, how we pitied them, how we were all of
us happy to do what we could for them . . . for a long time. All
the same we were very thankful to our authorities when the whole of
the Maidstone district was included in the military area where no
alien, whether friend, ally, or foe, was allowed to dwell within
its boundaries. And we saw our Belgians depart without shedding too
many tears.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Naturally, as far as I was concerned, the question of my work
soon cropped up. My latest book <i>The Laughing Cavalier</i> was
ready for publication, but was this the time for publishing
light-hearted works of romantic fiction when the whole nation was
plunged in anxiety and sorrow? Well! The whole question was soon
settled for me personally and I was overwhelmed with work.
&lsquo;Carry on!&rsquo; was the slogan that was dinned into the
ears of all us professional people. Carry on! Remember all those
hundreds and thousands of workers whose existence depends on what
you can give them to do, how by keeping up your own work, you can
keep so many going on with theirs. As far as we writers of fiction
were concerned there were the printers and compositors, the
bookbinders, the newsvendors, the booksellers&mdash;all these
corporate bodies had to be kept going.</p>

<p>I consulted Messrs. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who had <i>The
Laughing Cavalier</i> in hand, and they also said unhesitatingly,
&ldquo;Carry on! as we also mean to carry on&rdquo;. Moreover, they
were bringing out books for the benefit of different big charities
that needed help, and those of us who had the privilege of
popularity were necessarily expected to contribute to the making of
such books, which were to be printed and sold in their thousands
and tens of thousands. &lsquo;Short stories, long stories,
articles, drawings, sketches. Send us everything you can&rsquo;,
was the order of the day. I remember that several members of the
Authors&rsquo; Society raised a protest against the publication of
these books, which flooded the bookstalls and the counters of
booksellers, of Harrod&rsquo;s, Selfridges, and so on, arguing (and
justly some thought) that since they were produced at the mere cost
of printing and binding without remuneration to contributors they
could be sold at a paltry price in direct competition with other
works of fiction that in many cases were the sole means of
existence for authors already hard hit by the troublous times.</p>

<p>The controversy on the subject raged for some time I remember
and several popular authors undertook to refuse contributions to
the &lsquo;charity books&rsquo;. I took no part whatever in the
dispute. When I was asked to send a story or an article for one of
those books I wrote what I was asked for, and thought no more about
the rights or wrongs of the whole question. I didn&rsquo;t seem to
have any time for polemics and, anyway, there was obviously
something to be said for both sides. And so <i>King Albert&rsquo;s
Book</i> was published and <i>Princess Mary&rsquo;s Book</i> and
many others&mdash;all of them with contributions from my pen and
all sold at fantastically low prices and in equally fantastic
numbers.</p>

<p>I was also constantly requisitioned for conferences, addresses,
or lectures, and these of course needed careful preparation. Indeed
my time was full up. A committee of ladies in our district who had
not the vocation for nursing, for tending the wounded, or serving
in the numberless canteens that had sprung up all over London for
the entertainment of the soldiers moving to and fro, arriving or
departing for the front begged me to give them conferences of
lectures, something in fact to &lsquo;take their mind off&rsquo;
the war. They found time, so they said, hanging very heavily on
their hands. I naturally agreed to this for I have never in all my
life learned to say &ldquo;No!&rdquo; to any appeal of that sort.
So I said &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; I won&rsquo;t say reluctantly, but
hesitatingly, for I knew what a lot of preparation and a lot of
reading such conferences would entail. The committee representing
the audience were to choose the subject of the conferences.</p>

<p>Well! it seems that the ladies desired to know more than their
old history books had taught them about our war with Napoleon
Bonaparte. I pointed out to them, that as this conflict lasted from
first to last two-and-twenty years, the subject was on too vast a
scale for cosy talks round the fireside at Snowfield. For it seems
that this was what they wanted, &lsquo;just cosy talks&rsquo;, no
more. I disclaimed any attempt at military history. It was the
political side of the war that they wanted to hear about. What had
brought on the conflict, and why had England remained such a fierce
antagonist of the great Napoleon who had been the national hero of
France even in the midst of his final failures and his humiliating
downfall? Even without the military side of this all absorbing
period in history the subject was a big one.</p>

<p>However, I tackled it and the &lsquo;cosy talks&rsquo; were
immensely appreciated. So much so that when I had come to the end
of all that I wished to say on that particular subject, the
audience wanted something more. Would I deliver a few &lsquo;cosy
talks&rsquo; on English literature, especially on contemporary
literature? This was, of course, a less strenuous subject for me to
tackle. It only meant brushing up what had been one of my most
constant studies for the past twenty years.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the question of the publication of <i>The
Laughing Cavalier</i> was definitely solved. I had demurred long
enough and the romance was published early in the autumn. The
following &lsquo;publisher&rsquo;s note&rsquo; was included in
every copy of the first edition of the book.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">Publisher&rsquo;s Note</p>

<p class="note">On the outbreak of the war the Baroness Orczy
decided to postpone the publication of <i>The Laughing
Cavalier.</i> In response, however, to many requests from the
novel-reading public and from those employed in the bookselling,
printing and binding trades which will suffer greatly if fiction is
not published as usual, the author of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>
agreed to the publication of this book&mdash;for which we render
her our thanks.</p>

<p>A few of us members of the Society of Authors and Composers
formed ourselves into a small committee of assistance for those of
our colleagues who were severely hit by the war . . . and by the
ever-growing sales of the charity books. We met in town every
Tuesday, and every member of the committee brought forward any
cases of distress that had come under his or her notice. It was a
difficult business: difficult, because one so often came up against
pride and reticence. Our chairman in the beginning was John Buchan
(he was Colonel Buchan then), but soon he was called up to his
military duties, and my dear friend, W. J. Locke, took his place
and continued in that capacity till the end of the war. As a
chairman he was just perfect, with his charming manners and perfect
understanding of all the difficulties that beset his colleagues
less fortunate than himself and that beset all of us who tried our
very best to be of help to them.</p>

<p>We were quite a small committee but it was a representative one:
Alfred Sutro, Alice Perrin, May Sinclair, and that kindest, most
self-effacing Charles Garvice. From time to time Anthony Hope,
Always exquisitely dressed and full of charm, shed the light of his
countenance upon us and gave us most welcome help and advice.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we found that musicians&mdash;both composers
and executants&mdash;had been the hardest hit, more so than
authors.</p>

<p>But with all these activities and the several duties devolving
upon me, and with the many hours of the day which I put into my
literary work, I soon found that my health was not standing the
strain of it all as I had hoped it would. To put it mildly, I had a
bit of a breakdown. Our dear old medical adviser said,
&ldquo;Change. You must get away somewhere,&rdquo; very
tentatively. How and where could one go for a change when the whole
of the world seemed to be in the grip of war? England, anyway,
would be no use. &ldquo;You would only get dragged in again into
conferences and opening of bazaars and committee meetings. No! no!
not the British Isles for you.&rdquo; Then where? France, of
course. The only country possible. Preferably the South. But we had
never been to the South of France. There was Nice and Cannes and
Mentone, where friends used to go in the happy days of peace, and
they used to tell us all about the &lsquo;earthly Paradise&rsquo;:
but somehow we had never been tempted to go. Rome or Holland or
Belgium had seemed so much more attractive, and so often we went to
Paris without thinking of pushing on further South. And there had
always been Transylvania and its wild and glorious holiday moods!
We knew nothing, absolutely nothing, about the play-ground of
Europe.</p>

<p>But once again, unsuspected by me, here was yet another link in
the chain of my life. The last link of all, which brought me and my
beloved to anchorage in Monte Carlo. A very dear friend, a widow
with an only son, was possessed of a small villa in Monte Carlo.
She wrote to say that her son had just been given a job in the
Foreign Office. They had been spending the Christmas holidays in
their villa and were now returning to London for the whole winter.
The Villa would be empty: why not go down and occupy it until their
return?</p>

<p>Why not, indeed?</p>

<p>Links in the chain of life.</p>

<p>A fortnight later we were in Monte Carlo. And there I stayed and
I wrote twenty of my most popular romances.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="note">NOTE</p>

<p class="note">The whole of this book was written between the
years of 1938 and 1945. The political aspect of the whole of Europe
has since that time undergone a radical change. The small
insignificant Principality of Monaco has had its changes also. At
the time of writing this chapter on the subject of Monte Carlo
these changes had not yet taken place and what the future would
bring for the Principality in its political, social and economic
aspects was still in doubt.</p>

<p>Chapter 20 deals exclusively with pre-war Monaco.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20" id=
"Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20</b>
</h2>

<p>The majority of people who have never been in Monte Carlo
invariably think of it as the abode of every kind of misdemeanour,
such as robbery and violence, fraud or forgery, or any other
delinquency that has money for its driving power.</p>

<p>But before I go any further I would like to explain one or two
things with regard to Monte Carlo which I find are unknown to
ninety percent of foreign visitors, and even residents who come out
to this land of gaiety and of sunshine. The principality of Monaco,
of which Monte Carlo forms an important part, is not France, as so
many people seem to think. It is an independent territory which has
its own sovereign Prince&mdash;an autocratic ruler of the House of
Grimaldi, the oldest reigning family in Europe, whose power is as
absolute as was that of the Bourbon Kings or the Tsars of
Russia&mdash;it has its own constitution, its own laws and courts
of justice. Its people are neither French nor Italian. They are
Mon&eacute;gasques and speak a language of their own which is a
mixture of Italian, French, and Spanish. The customs are leased to
France but not the post, and French stamps are not valid in the
Principality nor are the Mon&eacute;gasques ones in France.</p>

<p>The only thing Monaco has in common with France is the money,
and certain laws and usages with regard to banking business which
France has virtually imposed upon it. The Principality is under the
protection of France, but is not her vassal. It has no obligations
towards her in the way of foreign policy or of military duty. In
the case of war Monaco proclaims its neutrality and maintains it,
and if Mon&eacute;gasques desire to fight on the side of France or
Italy, all they can do is to join the French Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>There are several other points of interest in connection with
the internal affairs of the Principality, not all of them relevant
to my present subject. One is that the chief officials in the
Government are, with very rare exceptions, French, and so is the
Commandant of the tiny Mon&eacute;gasque army. But the French
Courts have no jurisdiction over crimes committed in Monaco and, in
connection with that, it is interesting to note that there is no
capital punishment in the Principality.</p>

<p>At a point quite close to my own home the territory is at its
narrowest, less than three-quarters of a mile wide&mdash;at its
widest it is about a mile and a half&mdash;and its whole length is
only eight miles. France encircles it. It will at once &lsquo;jump
to the eyes&rsquo; of students of criminology how easy it is for a
malefactor to skip across the frontier from Monaco to France or
vice versa, according as the laws of either country react in his
favour or not, because the police of one country have no power of
arrest in the other.</p>

<p>There was a very curious case not so long ago when an English
solicitor was charged with fraud and out on bail made his escape
into France. The machinery of extradition was at once set in motion
at home. France was willing to give up the criminal and set her
police to work to find him. He was known to have gone South. As a
matter of fact he was in Nice, got wind that the French police was
after him, and came to Monte Carlo. For a time he was safe enough
here. The French police had no power to arrest him inside the
Principality, and Monaco had not entered into a treaty of
extradition with any country except France. She would not harbour a
fugitive from French justice, but in this case the criminal was
English and his offence had been committed in England. And in any
case, the Sovereign Prince, whose final word is the law of the
land, was away shooting and no decision could be got from him as to
what was to be done with the foreign solicitor.</p>

<p>But although Monaco ignores all extradition treaties, her police
have the right to turn any person out of the Principality at a
moment&rsquo;s notice without trial or appeal. The Sovereign Prince
also retains and often exercises this right of expulsion. Over here
we often say that if His Serene Highness does not like the look of
your boots he can turn you out from his tiny dominion at a few
hours&rsquo; notice. Under pressure from France, the
Mon&eacute;gasque police therefore decided to turn the gentleman
out of the territory bag and baggage. For obvious reasons he had
never applied for a <i>permis de s&eacute;jour</i> which, in the
Principality, takes the place of <i>cartes
d&rsquo;identit&eacute;</i> required in France. This neglect made
his crime doubly heinous in Mon&eacute;gasque eyes because it was
looked upon as a defiance of the laws of the land.</p>

<p>And so the farce began. The French police were after the
delinquent on one side of the frontier, and the Mon&eacute;gasque
on the other. And there are one or two houses on the actual
frontier here and there, one half of which&mdash;a garden, perhaps,
or a separate wing&mdash;is in French territory and the other in
the Principality.</p>

<p>The English solicitor was astute enough to take up his abode in
one of these houses and, as there is a decided rivalry between the
police of the two countries, they never work together in harmony,
with the result that in this case they did not come to any
understanding either as to their joint action. At times the
Mon&eacute;gasque authorities would make a descent on the Monaco
side of the Englishman&rsquo;s apartment, when he would at once
skip over into the French side. When he heard rumours that the
French police were coming to arrest him, back he would skip into
the Principality. It seems unbelievable, but this farce lasted a
whole fortnight before the man was finally cornered and sent back
to England to serve a sentence of several years&rsquo; penal
servitude.</p>

<p>As in France, Mon&eacute;gasque justice is very lenient to what
is called <i>crime passionnel.</i> A young governess at the High
School in Monaco thought that her lover, also a teacher, was being
unfaithful to her. She waylaid him one evening as he came out of
the school building and deliberately shot him in the back. There
was no question about it. It was premeditated murder. She was
acquitted, the jury expressing sympathy with the poor girl driven
out of her mind by jealousy. A number of cases of the same sort
occur at least twenty or thirty times in the course of a year, and
always with the same result: sympathy for the criminal (man or
woman) mad with jealousy or unrequited love.</p>

<p>One curious case occurred here a few years ago. A man whom I
will call Briano (it isn&rsquo;t his name), an Italian proprietor
of a second-rate hotel in Monte Carlo, married, and father of two
children, suspected his wife of infidelity. To one of his race and
temperament the death of the delinquent was the only means of
allying his jealousy. So one night he cut her throat and, as the
children who slept in the same room as their mother, started
screaming, he cut their throats also. Alarmed by the screams, the
night porter came rushing into the room, arriving just in time to
pick up the little girl aged nine who was bleeding from a wound in
the neck and carry her away out of the reach of the raging
madman.</p>

<p>In spite of Briano&rsquo;s sworn assertion that his wife and the
children had been murdered by the woman&rsquo;s lover, whom he,
Briano, had traced to his wife&rsquo;s bedroom and there discovered
<i>in flagrante delicto,</i> the testimony of the night porter and
the little girl weighed heavily against him. He would undoubtedly
have been acquitted on the usual grounds of <i>crime passionel</i>
but for the fact that he had killed one of his children and meant
to kill the other. This revolted the jury, who found him guilty. As
there is no capital punishment in Monaco, the murderer was handed
over to the French authorities for deportation to Devil&rsquo;s
Island, the Principality having no penal settlement of its own.</p>

<p>Briano, then, was duly deported. After a couple of years he
contrived to escape and made his way to Trinidad. Here the English
authorities refused to give him back to the French, he having
established his Italian nationality as well as Mon&eacute;gasque
residence. They simply sent him back, under police escort, to
Monaco, the scene of his crime and of his trial for murder. And
here another curious point comes in.</p>

<p>The Sovereign Prince, for reasons which none of us here could
ever fathom, granted Briano a free pardon. He had a perfect right
in law to do that if he chose, for his word is law in the
Principality, and against it there is no appeal. Briano, I believe
went to live in Italy.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE</p>

<p class="note">As I write this chapter in the year 1944, I am
still in the dark as to what fate the final ending of this terrible
war has in reserve for the Principality of Monaco and its jealously
guarded neutrality and independence. Whatever that fate may be it
will have to submit to it.</p>

<p class="note">I am quite sure in my own mind that the great
victorious powers, desiring nothing but &lsquo;peace upon earth and
goodwill towards men&rsquo; will respect the wishes of the
population of this hitherto independent little abode of quietude
and gaiety: &lsquo;the playground of Europe&rsquo; where strangers
from every land will of a certainty continue to come in search of
health and respite from the troubles and sorrows brought upon them
by the war.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21" id=

</h2>

<p>I cannot say at what precise moment during our two month&rsquo;s
stay in Mrs. French&rsquo;s villa in Monte Carlo we were first
seized with the desire to have a kind of secondary home&mdash;just
a <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> for the winter months in that
beautiful place. We felt its beauty from the very first, were
shaking a large slice of the world to its foundations. When I say
placidity I don&rsquo;t mean that there were no incidents, no
actual circumstances connected with the war which touched Monte
Carlo. There were some that brought sorrow and anxiety right home
to one&rsquo;s consciousness the whole time. We had not been in the
villa a week before that terrible debacle of Mons brought large
numbers of our retreating armies, including a great number of
wounded, seeking shelter in this peaceful part of France.</p>

<p>There was no question of disagreement then between us and our
ally. She was whole-heartedly with us and remained so during the
whole of the war. Disagreements only cropped up with the peace! At
any rate, our retreating army was made very welcome all along the
shores of the Mediterranean. Everything was done by every class of
the population to make their lot easier for them. Gentle pity,
unselfish devotion on the part of the poor and of the well-to do
alike, met them at every turn, in every home however humble. Gentle
pity! Mrs. French had left her faithful old cook in the villa to
look after our comforts&mdash;incidentally, she was an excellent
cook. She came to me one morning to tell me that she had seen
<i>ces pauvres messieurs</i> straggling into Monte Carlo, tired,
haggard, and hungry. Among them I gathered there were several men
belonging to one of our Highland regiments, and good old Estelle,
with tears streaming down her cheeks, went on with a heart-broken
sigh: <i>&rdquo;Oui, Madame, ces pauvres messieurs, pensez donc,
ils n&rsquo;avaient m&ecirc;me pas de pantalons&rdquo;.</i> (Think
of it, Madame, these poor gentlemen, they haven&rsquo;t even got
their trousers.) It sounded so much funnier in polite French:
<i>&rdquo;ces pauvres messieurs&rdquo;!</i> And when one tried to
thank some of these peasant or working folk, some of them very
poor, for their kindness to our soldiers, they just shrugged their
shoulders and said: Q<i>ue voulez-vous? On fait ce qu&rsquo;on peut
puisqu&rsquo;on combat la main dans la main.&rdquo;</i> I heard
that phrase quite often. (One does what one can. Are we not
fighting hand-in-hand?)</p>

<p>There were a great number of Senegalese here, the French African
troops. Funny, good-natured fellows as black as your hat. Unable to
stand the climate in Flanders they had been sent down here to
recuperate from its baneful effects. They were quartered in
Mentone, and had seemingly a jolly good time there, judging by the
bevy of young Mentonese beauties who hung about round their
quarters and walked out and flirted with them to the loudly
expressed disapproval, not to say horror, of the American visitors.
In France, of course, there is no such thing as differentiation
between white and coloured races. Black or yellow or white, if
<i>enfants de la France</i> (&lsquo;children of France&rsquo;), all
are alike in the eyes of Frenchmen and, seemingly, of Frenchwomen
also.</p>

<p>The ladies of the foreign contingent, both residents and
visitors, did all that was possible for the entertainment of <i>ces
pauvres messieurs</i>, both officers and men. These were not
allowed to enter the gaming rooms of the Casino in uniform, this
being a hard and fast rule of that great institution, and a wise
one too, but a number of English officers who were provided with
mufti were able to have their flutter incognito on the tables if
they were so minded. Neither my husband nor I were ever bitten with
the gambling craze, not from any principle but simply because it
did not amuse us.</p>

<p>We both thought it &lsquo;a mug&rsquo;s game&rsquo;, as did the
American millionaire, Jay Gould, when he was first initiated in the
intricacies of roulette. &ldquo;You put your money on red or
black,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;on a number or on three
consecutive numbers or on a consecutive dozen, on this, that, or
the other. If your number or colours turns up you win; if it
doesn&rsquo;t you lose. Simple, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and the
millionaire put up a small stake on red; black turned up and he saw
his money swept away. &ldquo;Simple?&rdquo; he murmured angrily.
&ldquo;I call it a mug&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are any number of English people who either come down
regularly to Monte Carlo every winter and many who have taken up
their residence here who have no wish nor inclination to play
&lsquo;the mug&rsquo;s game&rsquo; either. But it is always amusing
to watch the players. What a study of character for the writer of
modern fiction. I have often been asked when I would publish a real
Monte Carlo novel. &ldquo;You know Monte Carlo so well,&rdquo;
friends have often said to me; &ldquo;you know the casino in and
out, all its exciting adventures and all its romance. Why not put
it all into a book?&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s just it. To me there
is no romance in the casino or even in the adventures, so often
ending in tragedy of its <i>habitu&eacute;s;</i> somehow this
throwing money about (it was gold when first we visited Monte
Carlo) on the chance of a diminutive ball tumbling into one tiny
groove rather than into another, always seemed to me rather sordid
and certainly futile. What is it but the craving after wealth
without having to work for it? Well! I have many friends, some of
them very charming and very dear who will call my point of view
futile and stupid. It is all a question of temperament. They have
had thrills in those adventures with the diminutive balls and
elusive grooves which, I for one, never experienced.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>There is romance, however, in the old history of Monaco and in
that of the house of Grimaldi, but somehow it has never tempted me
to write a story round those early days of the Principality. There
was always too much fighting and bloodshed from the days of the
Roman conquest of this part of ancient Liguria, conquest which is
not more interesting than that by the same mighty hordes of other
countries including our own. Too much fighting and bloodshed during
the invasions of the Saracens, of the Vandals, of the Goths and so
on, the struggle for possession between the great parties of Guelfs
and Ghibellines, the occupation ending in the domination and
tyranny over Monaco by the powerful republic of Genoa.</p>

<p>There are one or two poetic little legends that cling to the old
rock, and which tradition has kept alive for many centuries. The
prettiest is that of Sainte D&eacute;vote, the patron saint of the
Principality. She was a young Christian girl who suffered martyrdom
in Corsica sixteen hundred years ago. A priest and a fisherman
between them gathered up her remains, and set out to convey them
secretly by sea to Africa. The wind blew their barque towards the
North, and the martyred saint appeared to the two men in a dream
and ordered them to sail to the port of Monaco to the spot which a
white dove flying out or her mouth would indicate. And effectively
a white dove did come to rest in the valley of Gaumette. But the
wind was so adverse that the men could not make the port. They
tried to bury the saint higher up in the valley but whenever they
attempted to lower her into the ground a terrible storm would break
out which hindered their work. In the end, after equal
vicissitudes, there came a fire which destroyed the boat just when
she was in sight of the harbour. Nothing could be done with her any
more and the two good and pious men were thus compelled to bury
Ste. D&eacute;vote there where she had desired to be interred.</p>

<p>And now after sixteen centuries, with never a break, on the day
of the feast of Ste. D&eacute;vote, a procession of pious
Mon&eacute;gasques march with banners flying from the church on the
rock which is dedicated to their patron saint down to the shore,
where a boat is brought in and set alight and burned down at the
water&rsquo;s edge. It is a pretty sight, with the banners flying,
the flames reflected in the smooth waters of the port, and the
everlasting stars winking down on this pious manifestation of faith
and devotion to tradition. The Prince of Monaco, with members of
his family and ladies and gentlemen of his little court usually
attend the ceremony. A special tent is erected for them and there
is always a crowd of local people who must have witnessed the event
dozens and dozens of times, who nevertheless foregather year after
year to see this burning of a little boat all over again; but I
have never seen any foreign visitor or resident among them.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Among the English friends who were in Monte Carlo that year
there were Mr. And Mrs. C. N. Williamson, the distinguished authors
of <i>The Lightning Conductor,</i> and many other delightful works.
They had just completed the building of a beautiful villa,
&lsquo;La Pausa&rsquo;, on the hills of Roquebrune just outside
Monte Carlo; the situation was just perfect with exquisite views
right across the Baie des Anges as far as Bordighera. &lsquo;La
Pausa&rsquo; remained their home until Charlie Williamson&rsquo;s
death which occurred, alas! a very few years later. It was indeed a
beautiful home with a delightful mingling of Italian artistic
expression and of English comfort. Many charming afternoons and
happy luncheon hours did we spend there that year. Both these
distinguished authors were <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the gaming
rooms. Charles Williamson played a good deal, and played high.
Whenever I happened to be watching him he was winning, and always
took up his winnings or saw his stake swept away with the same
good-humoured smile of complete detachment.</p>

<p>A very noted gambler at the tables was the beautiful Madame de
Bittencourt, the wife of the Argentine Minister at the Court of St.
James. She would arrive soon after dinner and remain at the tables
till the small hours of the morning. In those days the Casino was
kept open till all sorts of hours whenever there were players, if
only one or two, who were putting up big money. Madame de
Bittencourt was certainly among these. When she arrived (it would
be about nine o&rsquo;clock) she looked perfectly lovely,
exquisitely dressed always, with magnificent jewellery, her eyes
bright, her lips smiling; but once or twice we happened to wander
in with friends after the fall of the curtain at the opera, and it
really made my heart ache to see the change in that beautiful face;
the tired look, the unnatural brilliance in the eyes, the haggard
lines of the cheeks. Ah, well! As I say, people tell me that there
are marvellous thrills to be got by watching that miserable little
ball twirling round and round and bringing fortune or disaster; a
thrill perhaps, but at what a cost!</p>

<p>Another equally noted gambler was Her Imperial Highness the
Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia, nicknamed
&lsquo;Satanasia&rsquo; in the Principality. She was the mother of
the then Crown Princess of Germany. I have seldom seen a more
unpleasant looking old woman with the face of a lizard, and
claw-like hands which one shuddered to watch as they grabbed at the
money whenever she happened to make a win, which occurred very
seldom&mdash;for she was a persistent loser. So much so that in the
end she came to a very tragic end, after she had lost every penny
of any fortune she may have had in the past. Her death was so
sudden after her last throw on the table that she could not be
conveyed all the way to her villa on Cap Ferrat (it was four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning) so she was taken to the neighbouring
hotel where she died.</p>

<p>Personally I sedulously avoided her, though one could not help
meeting her in restaurants or in the Caf&eacute; de Paris, where
she was always to be found at the luncheon hour surrounded by a
bevy of young girls, amongst whom I was really sorry to note a few
English ones, who hung round her with every mark of affection and
respect (!!). I suppose the magic words, &lsquo;Her Imperial
Highness&rsquo;, fascinated them, and Satanasia was always ready to
the last to entertain them with cocktails and other strong
drinks.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We had some real pleasure that year in Monte Carlo, and that was
in music. Monte Carlo has always been, and still is, in the
forefront of great musical centres, and in spite of war conditions
the Casino provided us all with some wonderful treats in the way of
concerts and operas. Caruso was there, and so was Litvine; also
Vanni Marcoux and Maguenat, two of the finest baritones I have ever
heard. Thus we had <i>A&iuml;da</i> with Litvine in the name; she
was a pupil of Jean de Reszke and had a glorious voice and her
teacher&rsquo;s unparalleled method. Caruso was Radam&egrave;s. He
was still in splendid voice then. What a loss it was to all opera
lovers when he died in the prime of life. He also sang
<i>Pagliacci</i>, a part one felt had been created specially for
him, and <i>Manon</i>.</p>

<p>During the war years we often had what they called here
&lsquo;auditions&rsquo; of grand opera, which meant the whole work
sung by all the singers with full orchestra and chorus but without
scenery or costumes. The singers were grouped on the bare stage
with the chorus and the orchestra behind them. One paid twenty
francs for one&rsquo;s very comfortable stall, a matter of sixteen
shillings in those days. I must say I enjoyed these auditions.
Somehow one did not miss the scenery or the costumes, and the
orchestra was perfect. The two noted Belgian musicians, Lauweryns
and Jehin, had sought refuge down here after the occupation of
their country by the Germans. The Casino at once offered them each
an important post as <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestra</i>. Leon Jehin
became the conductor whenever grand opera was given either in its
entirety or as an audition, and Lauweryns wielded the
<i>bat&ocirc;n</i> for lighter music.<br>
<a name="page144" id="page144"></a></p>

<p align="center"><img src="2000341h-images/page144.jpg" alt=""
width="729" height="750">
</p>

<p>Leon Jehin often came to see us. He had known my parents in the
olden days in Brussels and, I think, was happy to meet me again,
though he had not seen me since I was a flapper. His wife was a
noted singer both in Brussels and in Paris where she had created
the principal r&ocirc;le in the Saint Sa&euml;ns great opera, <i>Le
Roi de Lahore.</i> Jehin adored his wife, and held that there never
was, or ever would be, a singer who could hold a candle to her. She
was getting on in years and was very ill when she finally arrived
in Monte Carlo, and it was pathetic to hear the old musician say
quite simply as he so often did: <i>&rdquo;J&rsquo;adore la musique
et j&rsquo;adore ma femme&rdquo;.</i></p>

<p>Of an altogether different standing in the musical world was
Louis Ganne, so well-known as the composer of
<i>Funiculi-Funicula</i> and a number of tuneful operettas which we
all enjoyed during those anxious days in Monte Carlo. One did need
to be taken out of oneself sometimes and Louis Ganne did that for
us with his light-hearted music.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Out of the many pleasant evenings we spent in the
opera-house, two have a special place in my memory. One was the
production of <i>l&rsquo;Anc&ecirc;tre</i> was his latest work, and
he came over to Monte Carlo to conduct the performance in person.
He was a very old man then and most venerable looking with a
flowing white beard and a wealth of curly white hair. Remembering
his exquisite <i>Samson et Delilah</i> we all of us here felt
thrilled at the prospect of seeing him and of acclaiming his latest
work to the skies. We certainly did acclaim him&mdash;we of the
English contingent especially&mdash;but I imagine that the general
public did not take to the music, for the opera was only performed
the once in Monte Carlo and, I believe, never subsequently.</p>

<p>The same sad, and to me unexplainable, fate attended the
performance of <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i> which surpassed in
melody and beauty anything the composer had written before (not
even excepting <i>Manon).</i> Maguenet, that exquisite baritone,
sang Mark Anthony, and Royat was a beautiful and dramatic
Cleopatra; but here again it appears that general public opinion
did not coincide with mine, for <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i> was
considered to be a failure and was never performed again, not even
in Paris.</p>

<p>Another distinguished Belgian who had sought refuge in Monte
Carlo was the artist, Jan van Beers. He had a French wife who
looked after him and gloated over him as a fond mother over her son
He had been very successful in his work both in the 1890&rsquo;s
and the beginning of this century. I remember hearing a lot about
him when I was a girl and was first &lsquo;out&rsquo;, for he spent
more than one season in London, where he went a great deal into
Society and entertained lavishly. Since then his fame had somehow
declined. The younger generation called him old-fashioned. Perhaps
he was that, with what was now contemptuously called anecdotal
pictures. They were genre pictures, somewhat after the style and
technique of his greater compatriot, Alfred Stevens, but the
dresses of 1880 and 1900 which unmistakably &lsquo;dated&rsquo; Jan
van Beer&rsquo;s paintings were not so picturesque as those which
Stevens had chosen for the expression of his more serious art. One
saw chromos of the van Beer&rsquo;s pictures all over the place,
cheap reproductions, unfortunately; I think most of us will
remember &lsquo;The Husband&rsquo;s Boat&rsquo;, a girl in a white
pleated skirt and eel-skin tight jersey descending the companion
ladder down towards a young man with a heavy cavalry moustache who
was standing up in the boat, hat in hand ready to receive her. The
technique was very like that of the Belgian Stevens and our own
equally great Sandys, but the ugly 1880 dress of the principal
figure and the cavalry moustache of the other did somehow vulgarize
the picture and bereft it of that absolutely unexplainable
attribute, &lsquo;feeling&rsquo;. The artist entrusted us with a
few of his pictures which he had painted during his stay in Monte
Carlo, which he would have liked to exhibit and sell in London, and
when we returned to England we took these pictures with us and saw
one or two Bond Street dealers about them, but I am very sorry to
say that everywhere we met the same criticism, that terrible
bugbear of nineteenth-century artists:
&lsquo;Old-fashioned&rsquo;.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was during our short stay in Monte Carlo in 1915 that I first
conceived the romance which I think was, next to the Scarlet
Pimpernel books, my most popular one. Already in <i>The Laughing
Cavalier</i> I had indulged in glimpses of the Low Countries and of
their heroic fight for independence against the political and
religious tyranny of Spain. I had for some time before this been
absorbed in that romantic period of history. Mottram&rsquo;s
<i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i> and his <i>John of Barneveld</i>
had thrilled me and sown in my mind the seeds of those imaginings
which were now about to bear fruit. It was while sitting on the
terrace of the little villa during those months of February and
March of that year&mdash;months so full of sorrow and anxiety for
us and for all those we cared for&mdash;that I mapped out the
romance of <i>Leatherface.</i> Meanwhile, Messrs. Hutchinson had
published <i>A Bride of the Plains</i>, a story of peasant life in
the Hungarian Lowlands, and I had also completed <i>The Bronze
Eagle,</i> a story of Waterloo. This romance had been written at
the suggestion of my valued friend, Mr. Robert H. Davis, of
<i>Munsey&rsquo;s Magazine.</i> It was published both in America
and in England in June 1915, the centenary of the great battle.</p>

<p>By that time I was deep in <i>Leatherface,</i> the writing of
which gave me an immense deal of pleasure. It was published the
following year. Indeed, those terrible years 1914-18, on which I
cannot bear to dwell in thought even after all this long time,
were&mdash;as far as my life&rsquo;s work was concerned&mdash;very
fruitful for me. In the midst of so much sorrow what a joy it was
to receive letters&mdash;countless letters from men at the front,
from highly-placed officers and Tommies, from nurses, and
prisoners, telling me of the pleasure that my books had given
them&mdash;taking them out of themselves, as they always put it.
&ldquo;Hardly ever does a parcel go out to Flanders,&rdquo; my
publishers would tell me, &ldquo;or to France without one of
Baroness Orczy&rsquo;s books being included in it.&rdquo; Nor did
the public in England seem to tire of the play. Ten weeks&rsquo;
tour in the spring always, then sometimes a season in London, and
finally the big autumn tour in the large towns. How hard the Terrys
worked, poor dears! And during one season in London there was a
terrible catastrophe. They were playing <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> (at the Strand, I think it was) when during an air
raid a bomb fell just outside the theatre and one of the employees,
a young lady who was standing close to the entrance, was hit by
fragments of heavy masonry and killed.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Except for those few weeks in Monte Carlo in 1915 we did not
indulge much in holidays. We did spend a week or so in Bath from
time to time. It was quiet and restful, and the climate is
decidedly more agreeable than London and its fogs. Two events dwell
in my mind in connection with our visits to Bath. One of these was
amusing and the other happy. We stayed at the Empire Hotel which
was, during the war, a kind of stronghold of conservative
&lsquo;die-hards&rsquo; to whom the very name of Lloyd George, the
&ldquo;robber of hen-roosts,&rdquo; was positive anathema. Many of
the people in the hotel formed a circle of actively antagonistic,
anti-Lloyd-Georgites. So much so that when the Prime Minister came
to Bath for the wedding of his son and when he entered the lounge
of the Empire, not even a glance of curiosity met his ingratiating
smile.</p>

<p>The lounge was quite full at the moment. It was the tea hour. No
one moved. Not a word was spoken or a sign made, the only sound
that greeted one of the most important men in Europe at this time
was the rattle of the tea-cups. Only the two page boys at the
entrance door bowed low to the distinguished guest. To be quite
frank, though my husband and I were anything but admirers of the
great little man, we felt a little bit ashamed of the attitude of
our fellow-guests in the hotel. We were crossing the hall at the
moment and stopped in order to allow him to pass in front of us. He
gave us a nice little smile and went on.</p>

<p>Well! he stayed the best part of the week in the hotel, during
which time there were luncheon&mdash;and dinner&mdash;parties given
for him by his friends and there was the great day of his
son&rsquo;s wedding with the traditional bride-cake, and sumptuous
luncheon, the die-hards keeping ostentatiously out of the way. But
the little man appeared quite impervious to black looks and even to
some rather shameful acts of discourtesy. He was amiability
personified. He smiled at everybody and nothing was easier than to
enter into a conversation with him if one was so minded&mdash;and
after a day or two many were so minded. He talked, he chatted, he
smiled: oh yes, he smiled all the time and even some of the
die-hards remarked that &lsquo;the fellow certainly had a way with
him&rsquo;. The staff in the hotel adored him. And the amusing part
of the whole thing was the departure of &lsquo;the robber of the
hen-roosts&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Again the lounge was full of visitors. It was after luncheon and
there was a rattle of coffee-cups and silver spoons when he came
down the stairs. But as he stopped in the lounge, coffee-cups were
pushed aside and everyone rose. And he bowed to them all as he
passed by and said: &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye! I hope this fine
weather will continue&mdash;lovely place this. . . .
Good-bye!&rdquo; And the die-hards all said: &ldquo;Good-bye
sir,&rdquo; and everyone remained standing until the swing doors
had finally closed behind him.</p>

<p>It was a question of personality I think: &lsquo;the robber of
hen-roosts&rsquo; had a way with him.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The second event which will always dwell in my mind in
connection with our war-time visit to Bath was my first meeting
with Rudyard Kipling. He was also staying at the Empire with his
wife and daughter. It was soon after his only son had been reported
missing, and it was heartbreaking to note that those three dear
people all equally believed that the report would presently be
contradicted and that the dear one would soon return. But he never
did. I had many a talk with that very dear and very great man. It
would be impossible to imagine anyone distinguished as he was, more
simple and unaffected, so full of charm and understanding. He made
me very happy with his generous praise of my work, telling me just
what he admired in it, and why in his opinion it had been so
successful and popular.</p>

<p>Of course his deep love, his fetish in fact, was the Empire. The
very words, &lsquo;British Empire&rsquo;, would kindle a flame of
ardour in his deep-set eyes. One felt that here was a man who would
sacrifice everything in the world for the grandeur and glory of his
idol. I know that since then many a jeer has been flung at what the
modern youth chooses to call his &lsquo;Imperialism&rsquo;, and
that these young vandals have even tried to drag Kipling down from
the pedestal on which the hearts of millions of English readers
have enthroned him. Well! they may succeed for a time, but there is
one thing very certain and that is that Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s
work will live through the coming centuries because of his
sincerity, his lofty patriotism, and his comprehension of
everything that is noblest and best in this Empire which he
loved.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22" id=

</h2>

<p>My boy, Jack, came out to Monte Carlo for his Easter holidays,
after which we returned to England&mdash;the three of
us&mdash;having thoroughly enjoyed a lovely, all too short,
holiday. We had a lot of trouble&mdash;amusing trouble
really&mdash;about passports and <i>visas</i>. Our British
Vice-Consul in Monaco, Mr. Charles Sim, was most kind and helpful,
and so was the British Consul in Nice; but it was the authorities
of France, on the one side, and of the Principality, on the other,
that were quite ludicrous with their red tape. There seemed to be a
kind of jealousy between them as to their respective administrative
importance. We were sent from pillar to post between the two of
them&mdash;or rather three&mdash;because presently the Prefect of
the Department joined in the fray. Each one of these three
officials declared that it was their authority that was paramount,
and that their <i>visa</i> on our passports was all that was
required. So we went from one to the other.</p>

<p>In the end it was agreed between the lot of them that in any
case a permit to leave Monte Carlo was absolutely essential, and
this only the <i>Commissaire de la Surete Publique</i> of Monaco
could deliver to us; at any rate, without it, the railway refused
to sell us tickets. So off we went to see the Commissaire, whom by
the way, we had already interviewed twice before with varying
results. This time we ran him to earth just after the lunch hour.
He had lunched not altogether wisely but certainly too well. He was
very hilarious and most amiable. He wouldn&rsquo;t sign anything,
but he was ready to affix an official stamp on anything and
everything we presented to him. So he stamped, and he stamped,
papers and passports and identity cards, but ne&rsquo;er a pen
would he take in his hand; he smiled benignly at us and assured us
that everything would be all right, as he of course was the supreme
authority, above all those other authorities which we had been
foolish enough to interview before. Well! that was that.</p>

<p>We got our tickets for London (no sleepers to be had of course,
but that we did not mind) and trusted to Providence to see us
through. In the end, still somewhat disturbed in our minds, we
wired to the British Consul in Boulogne asking exactly what we
should require for going through from here to England. And lucky we
did do that, for the kind man wired back saying that passports with
a French <i>visa</i> and permit to leave Monte Carlo from the
Commissary of Police would be sufficient. And it was that telegram
that saved us a lot of trouble at Boulogne, where the local
authorities, customs, and so on did not condescend to examine our
passports and looked askance and Monsieur le Commissaire&rsquo;s
numerous stampings thereon, but they appeared to be very much
impressed with the fact that we were of sufficient importance for
the British Consul to have given himself the trouble of sending us
a telegram. Apparently no French consul would have condescended
quite so far towards ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>For some obscure reason British-born civilians were very
unpopular with French officialdom just then. We all appeared to be
under suspicion of espionage. A very well-known English society
lady had had a slight altercation in Paris with the Customs
authorities where she was held up for some formality or other. Her
name, as a matter of fact, was as familiar in French society as it
was in London. But she was rather autocratic in her ways,
and&mdash;as I am afraid is often the case with English people
travelling abroad&mdash;she was rather off-hand with the French
officials.</p>

<p>In the end she got her way and was allowed to go on to Boulogne,
but not before the Jack-in-office in Paris had muttered a curt
threat as she left his bureau: <i>&rdquo;Vous verrez,
Madame,&rdquo;</i> he mumbled; <i>&rdquo;vous verrez.&rdquo;</i>
(&ldquo;You will see, Madame! You will see!&rdquo;) And she did.
Presumably the Jack-in-office of Paris sent some sort of a report
of the incident to his colleague in Boulogne. Certain it is that
the poor lady on her appearance there was taken into a private room
and stripped to the skin; the female searcher even made her take
her &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; off and fumbled about in her
hair.</p>

<p>How lucky for me that we had had that blessed telegram from the
British Consul. We were allowed to proceed quietly on our way and
arrived safe and moderately sound in England. But the journey
through France had been terribly trying and nearly ended in
disaster. Railways and all transports in France were&mdash;as was
to be expected&mdash;in a pitiable state. Sabotage, too, was rife.
In time of national trouble the discontented are always to the
fore, and so are the mischief-makers. In our case a very serious
railway accident close to the station at La Ciodad, some thirty
kilometres from Marseilles, was only averted by the presence of
mind and quick action of the engine-driver.</p>

<p>Two coaches, including the one we were in, were overturned. We,
happily, were immune, and there was no serious casualties, but I
for one was very much shaken by the shock. We managed to crawl out
of the overturned coach as others did, helped by two soldiers and
three sailors. It was four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and
bitterly cold. The station was closed and pitch dark, no one
apparently in charge; the few houses close by displayed an equally
inhospitable front. And there we were left some forty or fifty of
us, keeping ourselves as warm as we could be stamping up and down
the railway platform. There was no one to see to the injured and no
chance of anything to drink&mdash;not even water. It was not till
seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning that a relief train came along
and the line was cleared. The station was opened up and we were
able to get some tepid coffee.</p>

<p>But all that, bad as it was, was not the end of our troubles. We
spent the whole of that day in the train, and arrived in Paris in
the middle of the night. There were no porters, no taxis, and we
had to run about from hotel to hotel before we could get a room.
Ah, well! there&rsquo;s no reason to dwell on those very minor
troubles and discomfort. We were so thankful to be in England once
more. Back in Snowfield. Back to our work.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I had two important projects in my mind and started on them
right away. One was the writing of <i>Leatherface,</i> which I had
planned in Monte Carlo, and the other one more <i>Pimpernel</i>
book, probably the last, which I had promised to complete for
publication in 1917. I had also promised a series of short stories
for one of Messrs. Cassell&rsquo;s magazines, ultimately to be
issued in book form. <i>Leatherface</i> was publishedin 1916, and
<i>Lord Tony&rsquo;s Wife,</i> the <i>Pimpernel</i> book, in 1917.
No! I certainly was not idle during those terrible war years. I
tried to &lsquo;carry on&rsquo; as I had been asked to do. Two
books in 1917, two in 1918, and two in 1919; nothing made me so
happy as the knowledge that my work was not only appreciated but
also loved, and with it all there was I the happiest woman on earth
in my home life, in the love and tenderness of my adored
one&mdash;husband, lover, and friend. No wonder that my work did
not suffer in quality or quantity.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I often grieved over the fate of Hungary during those days at
Snowfield. Poor little Hungary, the country of my birth, tied to
Austria as co-partner in the Empire fighting for a cause she cared
nothing about, with nothing to look forward to but devastation in
the near future and certain ruin in the years to come. My mother
was now living with us in England. We had built a dear little house
for her in the grounds of Snowfield and though she was,
technically, an &lsquo;enemy alien&rsquo;, all those in authority
in the country were full of kindness and consideration for her. For
a time letters came through for her from her relations in
Transylvania through the kind offices of a Dutch shipping firm.
Messrs. Kuyper van Dam &amp; Smeer, who were also instrumental in
getting her her Hungarian money. The letters for the most part were
quite cheerful during the first four years of the war.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the Germans and the Austrians kept all true
information from their unfortunate partner, except what tended to
their own glorification and military successes. Practically until
the early autumn of 1918 they knew nothing in Hungary of what went
on in Flanders and in France. They had heard of the German
Army&rsquo;s initial success in Belgium, the occupation of
Brussels, the destruction of Louvain and Ypres and Rheims. They had
heard of the disasters that had overtaken the Russian armies; and
in the great agricultural districts of the Hungarian Lowlands, and
in the forest lands of Transylvania, the soldiers who came home on
leave from the Russian front (the Hungarians never fought in
Flanders) declared na&iuml;vely: &ldquo;There, now we have beaten
the Russians, it won&rsquo;t take us long to beat the
Prussians.&rdquo; (And this is all on a par with some of our old
folk in the Kentish villages. One old lady said to me one day,
&ldquo;Yes! yes! the Proosians, the Proosians is sly, but
it&rsquo;s the Russians as I am afeeared of.&rdquo;)</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was in June 1918 that my poor dear mother got it into her
head that she was doing us harm (especially to my husband) by
living on our property. She was an &lsquo;alien enemy&rsquo; and
although the neighbours around, the police and the authorities were
most kind, there were some village folk, either malicious or merely
ignorant, who were not. And my mother made up her mind that it was
everyone&rsquo;s duty to be in their own country in war-time. The
British Government were then engaged in repatriating such aliens as
were not interned in concentration cramps for political or military
reasons, and who desired to return to their own country. There were
several neutrals among these. A Swiss friend of ours was returning
to B&acirc;le; my mother joined her and off she went.</p>

<p>We had a telegram from her saying that she had arrived, minus
her luggage, at Tapi&oacute;-S&aacute;gh, the property of her
nephew Count Szirmay, which I knew well; it is quite close to
Budapest. Then no news whatever for over two months, during which
our feelings were harrowed by accounts in the English papers of the
outbreak of Bolshevism in Hungary. It was Bolshevism in its now
ancient, and then in its worst, form. The Premier of Hungary, count
K&aacute;rolyi, a cousin of our old friend the Ambassador, had sold
his country to the Bolshevik part in Hungary, headed by those
unspeakable scoundrels B&eacute;la Kuhn and Sz&aacute;muely. Their
rule of terror (for such it was) did not last long. The Hungarian
peasants drove them out of the country. Khun and Sz&aacute;muely
fled into Austria, where the former committed suicide and the
latter disappeared.</p>

<p>But a detachment of those terrorists had descended upon
Tapi&oacute;-S&aacute;gh: it was so near Budapest. They demanded
the owner&rsquo;s blood. The peasantry, loyal and devoted to a man,
scenting trouble had arranged a hiding-place for Count Szirmay in
the forest and there they supplied him with food and such comfort
as they were able to give him in the way of blankets and rugs, for
to light a fire was of course out of the question. My poor dear
mother was too old and feeble to contemplate fleeing and hiding in
the forest, but my cousin&rsquo;s servants were both devoted and
quite fearless. They remained in the ch&acirc;teau in order to look
after her.</p>

<p>I only heard some months later the authentic account of what
happened there during a ten weeks&rsquo; occupation of
Tapi&oacute;-S&aacute;gh by the Hungarian Bolsheviks. They were
never numerous in Hungary; they descended on the ch&acirc;teau in
full force, bringing a number of ugly depraved women in their
train. They ransacked the place from attic to cellar, and stole
everything of value they could lay their hands on. My darling
mother saw her dead sister&rsquo;s rings and bracelets on the
fingers and arms of those horrible women. She was commanded to sit
at meals with them: and this she did, never for one moment losing
her presence of mind or her supreme dignity. From time to time she
was interrogated as to the whereabouts of Count Szirmay. Her reply
was: &ldquo;I do not know and if I did I would not tell you.&rdquo;
She was threatened with death if she persisted in this attitude.
Her reply was: &ldquo;I am seventy-five years of age. I have very
little time to live, anyhow. So shoot away if you have a mind to.
What difference does it make?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All these details I heard long afterwards from a dear, devoted
maid at Tapi&oacute;-S&aacute;gh who was with her the whole of
these terrible ten weeks. Her fortitude and unshakable dignity
never left her for a moment. She said to me afterwards&mdash;long
afterwards, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really mind much. I felt like
Marie-Antoinette going to the guillotine.&rdquo; Well! the triumph
of this ugly offshoot of Russian Bolshevism did not last long. The
agricultural population of Hungary, hating and despising them,
drove them out of the country, chased them with their sticks and
their scythes and garden implements. Many of them they hung on
their village lamp-posts. Bolshevism in Hungary was as dead in that
country by the end of 1918 as with Stalin&rsquo;s statesman-like
and beneficent rule it is now dead in Russia.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But poor little Hungary did not see the end of her troubles with
the downfall of the Bolsheviks. The Roumanians who had marched into
her territory, ostensibly on the pretext of protecting her against
them, did her more material harm than an army of those terrorists
would have done. They pillaged, they stole, the disregarded every
clause of the treaty of Trianon, which had fixed the frontiers of
Hungary. They began by gobbling up Transylvania. Well! that would
have been all right, since Mr. Lloyd George, President Wilson and
Monsieur Cl&eacute;menceau had allocated that large portion of the
country to them. But what they did in the rest of Hungary was not
all right, for here they commandeered and drove away every head of
cattle in the country&mdash;some of which had actually been a gift
to impoverished Hungary by the Americans&mdash;they robbed the
peasants of their crops, of their rich cornfields in the lowlands,
and of their lands. They devastated their homes. They stole every
locomotive, every piece of rolling stock, and every vehicle usable
for transport.</p>

<p>Hungary had been impoverished by the war; she was irretrievably
ruined by the Roumanian occupation effected in defiance of the
Treaty of Trianon. Ah, well! The Roumanians after sitting on the
fence for three-and-a-half years with their guns pointing sometimes
one way and sometimes the other, had at the eleventh hour turned
them against their former allies and ranged themselves on the side
of the victorious armies of Great Britain, of Italy, and of France.
They had apparently come to the tardy conclusion that being a Latin
race they should be allied to their Latin sisters, Italy and
France. They had come to this conclusion because Verdun had not
fallen and because Great Britain was very obviously winning the
war.</p>

<p>I received letters from relatives and friends in Transylvania
giving me an account of what they were going through under the iron
heel of the Roumanian soldiery. Through the kindness of the
Protestant pastors (the Roman Catholic priests and the monks had
been dispossessed and driven into exile, and many had been
murdered) I obtained documentary and sworn evidence of all that was
going on in that distressful country, and what I knew to be <i>the
truth</i> I embodied in my romance, <i>Pimpernel and Rosemary,</i>
which was published by Messrs. Cassell in 1924. I was writing of a
country which I knew intimately and of a diversity of people with
whose lives I have always been in close touch, both the peasantry,
the industrials, and the landowners.</p>

<p>The incidents (save those of the love story) are taken direct
from the events which occurred directly after the Peace Treaty, and
the whole picture of post-war Transylvania is true in every detail.
The vicissitudes through which pass the principal characters in the
book are faithful transcripts of actual events which occurred soon
after the Armistice of 1918. The place which in <i>Pimpernel and
Rosemary</i> I have named &lsquo;Kis Imre&rsquo; is actually a
ch&acirc;teau in which my husband and I spent many happy days
during our visits in Transylvania.</p>

<p>I was very glad that translations of the book were published in
many European countries. I wanted those countries&mdash;-most of
them had been neutral during the war&mdash;to know what was going
on in the most distressful among all the defeated countries.
Translations of <i>Pimpernel and Rosemary</i> were published in
Swedish, by the firm of Isberg of Grunbaum in Norwegian and Danish,
of Ranicimientae in Spanish, of Kirberger and Kisper in Dutch.
There was, of course, a Hungarian translation; there was the
Tauchnitz edition, the Italian translation brought out by that very
go-ahead firm of A. Salani, the Polish translation, the Portuguese
and several others; the German and Roumanian alone were conspicuous
by their absence.</p>

<p>Roumania had been our ally during the final stages of the war
when victory was assuredly on our side, and no one was supposed to
say or write a word that would be defamatory to an ally. And so,
unlike all my other books, <i>Pimpernel and Rosemary</i> never
appeared serially in journal or magazine. As a book it ran through
the usual number of editions and these are alive to this day. It
did not suffer from any criticism of its political bias. I
don&rsquo;t think readers in 1924 bothered their heads as to
whether Roumania had been our ally or our enemy in 1914-1918.
During the four-and-a-half years of the war be it noted that Allies
were always angels of light and of goodness, and enemies . . .
well! they were enemies and that was that.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23" id=

</h2>

<p>I think it was &lsquo;La Pausa&rsquo;, the C. N.
Williamson&rsquo;s beautiful home in Roquebrune, that finally
caused us to make up our minds to have a kind of secondary
resting-place in this lovely part of the world.</p>

<p>After the European monetary deb&acirc;cle, following the
Armistice of 1918, I had lost the whole of the private fortune
which I had inherited in 1906&mdash;the fortune round which
imaginative journalists had woven such a wonderful romance of the
lost heiress only traced through the publication of her book, <i>A
Son of the People</i>. Well! that fortune came as unexpectedly in
1906 as it vanished in 1918. It vanished owing to the economic
collapse of Hungary which followed that of Germany: the Hungarian
kronen was devalued as the German mark had already been. Ah, well!
keep on smiling was always our motto, and though we had something
to lament over, we had plenty to be thankful for. My husband was
anything but a poor man and I could still write; there were
royalties galore on books and plays and cinema still to come.</p>

<p>It was then that we decided to buy a villa in Monte Carlo. We
had tested the amenities of that delightful place and found them
very much to our taste. The climate, for one thing, was a great
attraction, perhaps the greatest, for my husband had in recent
years developed a very delicate throat and English winters and
English springs were &lsquo;playing old Harry&rsquo; with that
throat. So climate was the first attraction and inclination a good
second.</p>

<p>At first we had great difficulty in finding a villa that would
meet all our requirements. We wanted to be in the centre of town,
we wanted a garden, we wanted this, that and the other, and there
were very few (hardly any) villas to be sold in those days. We
could not then spare the time to run down to Monte Carlo and
villa-hunt for ourselves. Through the kindness of Mrs. French,
whose villa we had rented in 1915, we heard of the Villa Bijou. Our
kind friend viewed and rented it for us.</p>

<p>She wrote to say that in her opinion it was just the house we
were looking for. It wold require many alterations and
improvements: the garden was there but would have to be made anew;
the number of rooms was adequate and . . . it was for sale. But the
matter was urgent, the villa would be snapped up if we did not
hurry. Well, we hurried by telegram! We wired our acceptance of the
price asked for the house and Mrs. French wired the reply that the
house was ours; she had paid the deposit asked for, clinching the
bargain.</p>

<p>There was, of course, a great risk in buying a house one had
never seen, but we trusted in the taste of our friend who knew our
taste, and knew Monte Carlo out and out: she had lived there for
over twenty years. But never for a moment did we regret our
bargain. In the course of one&rsquo;s life one commits more than
one act of folly which one has to regret later on, but our purchase
of the Villa Bijou (a pig in a poke as it were) was, as it turned
out, an act of supreme wisdom.</p>

<p>Six months later we went South to view our bargain. What we saw
was a pink house standing square inside a ring fence with a tall
iron gate, and in shape like an inverted match-box: at right angles
to the house but with no direct access to it. There was a sort of
annexe which in its day had consisted of stables down below and
four or five small rooms on the floor above. That house now, with
its annexe, is a thing of beauty, but it took some time to effect
the transformation. We began by turning three small rooms of the
annexe into a large studio with a North light: we connected the
annexe with the house by a short oak staircase, and transformed the
inverted match-box by adding a porch, two terraces and a loggia
till all its ugly squareness had been transmuted into beautiful
lines. In fact what we did <i>not</i> do with the inverted
match-box would take too long to relate.</p>

<p>Of equal interest to us was the question of the garden. As a
matter of fact there was nothing there that could be called a
garden. There were a few seedy looking orange trees all overgrown
and smothered in scarlet geraniums. There was a huge ficus tree in
the wrong place, a pepper tree also in the wrong place, and the
angle between the house and annexe was just a huge pebbled court
where presumably carriages driving through the iron gate were
turned, and horses groomed in front of the stables. Well! that
pebbled court is now an Italian garden with&mdash;in the
centre&mdash;a pond and a dear little marble fountain of the
Florentine <i>bambino</i> hugging a fish&mdash;who spouts water to
the delight of the wild birds who come to preen their feathers and
have their daily bath under its pleasant trickle. The south wall of
the sunken garden is covered for ten months of the year by a
gorgeous mauve curtain of that lovely <i>Lantana Delicatissima</i>,
which begins to bloom early in March and is still in full bloom at
Christmas. Lantanas do marvellously on that wall because it is in
full sun all the year. There is a gorgeous red one which we call
General Du Cane, and a daffodil yellow, but the Delicatissima
reigns supreme.</p>

<p>On the other hand bougainvillea (usually so abundant in this
part of the world, even running wild on the rocks in many places)
does not do very well with us. We have sacrificed the best wall to
the Lantanas, and the two pergolas are given over to the roses. The
finest rose season here is April and early May, after which the sun
is too hot for those dear things and the weather more often than
not too dry. (I have known as many as ten months without a drop of
rain in Monte Carlo.) Against that the second period of
blooming&mdash;the autumn&mdash;lasts well from October until
Christmas.</p>

<p>It takes an English amateur gardener, such as we both were, some
time to learn what will simply <i>not</i> be coaxed into
luxuriance; for Monte Carlo is altogether different from other
gardens on the Riviera, like Beaulieu, Mentone-Garavan and so on.
It is built on rock and the drainage question, especially for roses
becomes acute. But in the rock there are crevices and hollows. We
imported good soil from Garavan to cover the garden to a depth of
60 centimetres and trusted to luck that we would hit on such few
crevices as there were that would accommodate the roots of climbing
roses for two pergolas.</p>

<p>The two pergolas indeed have done very well. One of these goes
from the outside gate to the new porch. Madame Abel Chatenay,
Noella Nabonand, and Paul&rsquo;s Scarlet Climber make a lovely,
sweet-scented corridor from the gate right up to the front door.
The other pergola is at the south end of the garden, parallel with
the containing wall there. Here Folette is a dream of beauty in
April in juxtaposition with my favourite Eglantine. The climbing
Mrs. Herbert Stevens is in its gorgeous second blooming in November
right up till Christmas. We have to avoid the Wichurianas. They are
at their best much later in the spring when we are already on the
wing for England, and offer no autumnal blooming.</p>

<p>For this same reason we never attempted to plant the perennials
which I love, though I have often sighed for the blues of
delphinium which would be such victorious rivals to the blue of the
sky and of the Mediterranean, and our garden is too small for the
planting of the gorgeous Ischium in sufficient masses such as it
demands for the proper display of its wonderful colouring.</p>

<p>I hope I have not tried the patience of those of my readers who
are not garden fans by this long dissertation on our efforts. There
is just one feature in our garden which I think is interesting from
an almost historical point of view. The olive trees of the South of
France are larger and more imposing&mdash;they certainly are
older&mdash;than those of Northern Italy (one notices this
difference directly one has crossed the frontier). The reason may
be that the trees in Italy were planted closer together originally
and had not the same chance of development. They form clumps here
and there. A number of them have been made to enter into the
composition of Riviera gardens: their age is determined by the size
and condition of their trunks and by the formation of their growth
and of their roots. We found a most venerable old fellow in our bit
of garden on a small eminence in the very &lsquo;rightest&rsquo; of
positions. Experts in arboriculture assure us that it is well over
a thousand years old.</p>

<p>And here legend has stepped in. This is a country of legends,
and here is another very pretty one. It is generally believed that
Saint Paul rested under that tree when proselytizing on the shores
of the Mediterranean. Some pious old folk go even further and will
have it that our Lord also wandered along these shores preaching
the Word or God and that He, too, rested under that solitary giant
tree. So poetic and na&iuml;ve, like all the legends of Provence!
There is a deep hollow in the trunk at about eight feet from the
ground and inside it our predecessor (an old lady who had been Maid
of Honour to the Empress Eug&eacute;nie) had arranged a small
shrine with the statuette of St. Anthony of Padua, a toy candelabra
and a couple of small china pots with china flowers in them. Very
pretty and charming. We never interfered with it. It is there to
this day.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>There are few things in life more interesting than watching the
development of a city from waste land to the slowly spreading
accumulation of street upon street and houses upon houses. When
first we came on a visit to Monte Carlo, in 1915, the enormous
agglomeration of houses down in the valley called the Condamine
between the rock of Monaco and the heights of Monte Carlo had not
yet been started. There were a few streets&mdash;one important one
which was the direct tram road to Nice&mdash;there were one or two
unpretentious hotels, there was a tennis court on which only the
local people played, and there was the port; as for the rest, there
were olive trees isolated or in groups through which a few palm
trees raised their melancholy heads.</p>

<p>It was after 1918 that the land butcher and the builder got to
work, and the grove of olive trees where half an acre of land was
then worth a few shillings, rose in price within a couple of years
to as many pounds, and by 1920 to as many &pound;100 notes. Soon
land was unobtainable save at an exorbitant price, dearer than
freehold land in the City of London. The curious part about this
fantastic rise in value is that no original proprietor&mdash;they
were peasants for the most part&mdash;made a fortune out of these
transactions. They sold their bit of land at the first small rise
in the price, the buyer resold within a few weeks at another rise,
and this buying and reselling went on in that way month by month,
almost week by week, always with a small profit, but never with a
big one. The French peasant is cautious; when he saw his profit he
was content to take it however small it was.</p>

<p>Now the whole of the Condamine is like a huge rabbit-warren and
where from the terrace of our villa we looked down once on the soft
grey-green waves of olive trees, we see houses upon houses so
closely built one against or over the other that they seem as if
they were about to push one another over the slope of the hill into
the port. At one time, while this frenzy of building was going on,
we felt akin to despair. What would this once so picturesque, so
tranquil, Monte Carlo come to? The quarter where our Villa Bijou is
situated is luckily quite immune from the activities of the
speculative builder. It is, if I may so call it, the Mayfair of
Monte Carlo, but outside its circumference which is not extensive,
rabbit warrens abound. There seems to be no artistic control over
the designs (save the mark) of new buildings: they are no longer
inverted match-boxes but just immense blocks of stone with row upon
row of small windows and mean-looking front doors, Germanic in
character and wholly void of artistic features; just hideous
skyscrapers which mar the beauty of distant mountains and of forest
land.</p>

<p>Well! as I said before it was interesting to watch this
development of waste land into an important city. Interesting, but
oh, really heart-breaking. The place might have been made so
beautiful; Nature had done her best for old Monaco, had expended
her priceless treasures of beautiful colour, of mountains bathed in
mists of rose and purple and delicate grey, of blue sea and sky and
the varied greens of olive and palm, of orange and lemon with their
shiny metallic leaves, of tall cypresses and distant horizons of
silvery moonlight and the glint of sunshine through the trees, of
fiery sunsets and of pearly dawns. Yes, Nature had been more than
kind, and man did his best to spoil those priceless gifts which she
had so lavishly showered on this privileged corner of the earth.
Ah, well!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;There is a very apt French proverb which says: <i>Heureux
le peuple que n&rsquo;a pas d&rsquo;histoire</i> (Happy the people
that has no history). And this I may amplify by saying the same
thing about individuals: &lsquo;Happy they who have nothing to put
on record.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I, for one, have very little to put on record once we were
definitely installed in Villa Bijou, Monte Carlo. I went on with my
work steadily, if not quite so prolifically as before. One
historical romance now became my average yearly output, sometimes
interspersed with short stories such as <i>Castles in the Air</i>
and <i>The Man in Grey</i> and sets of <i>Pimpernel</i> stories
which had been commissioned for magazines before they appeared in
book form.</p>

<p>My husband went on with his painting, and found it difficult to
keep pace with the demands of a small colony of rich Americans who
after the war took to coming to Monte Carlo winter after winter.
They were great admirers of his pictures. I was always selfishly
very sad when some of these, usually those I was fondest of, were
shipped off to the States, but of course one has to remember that
after all, most pictures are painted for the purpose of being
sold.</p>

<p>We had an interesting time with the building and consecration of
the English Church. There has been none in Monte Carlo since the
war, but a project had been on foot of building one for the last
few years. In view of this the old church which was not in the
Principality but in the neighbouring township of Beausoleil had
been closed&mdash;rather prematurely as it happened&mdash;and
demolished. With the increasing number of English visitors and
residents the question soon became imperative. The trouble was the
difficulty of getting land in the centre of Monte Carlo, a site
easily accessible to those who could not always afford car or
carriage all the time. &ldquo;We must have a place where we can
sing &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo;&rdquo; was the demand of all
loyal English people, rich and poor alike (there were a great
number of English employees in shops, bureaux and private houses by
this time); but the cost of land had become absolutely
prohibitive.</p>

<p>My husband and I set to work with heart and soul to solve the
great problem. We felt sure that we could get the money together
for building the church. We had an estimate of 450,000 francs
(<i>i.e.</i> &pound;7,500 at the then rate of exchange), but land
would run into nearly a million in addition. Well! we did set to
work. We interviewed the Mon&eacute;gasque Government: we were
honoured by then with the friendship of the Prince of Monaco, who
came frequently to our house and often dined and lunched with us;
we enlisted his sympathy; we obtained for our efforts the priceless
support of H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, that magnificent type of
English loyalty and . . . thank God! we succeeded. The Princely
Government <i>gave</i> us a site for our English Church in the very
heart of Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the site, splendid as it was, was
not as might be supposed, a flat or at any rate horizontal piece of
land, but a vertical one, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>side</i> of one of the
many rocky elevations on which few booths and
woodsheds&mdash;mostly derelict&mdash;were then standing. These
were expropriated. The patrons of the Chaplaincy (the S.P.G.)
appointed a chaplain in succession to the former one who had
retired, and the foundation-stone of the English Church was
graciously laid by H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught and (strangely
enough perhaps, she being a Roman Catholic) in the presence of
H.S.H. the Hereditary Princess of Monaco. I suppose she had a
special dispensation for her share in the ceremony.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Gibraltar was of course present, and there were a
number of clergy from various neighbouring chaplaincies. All this
vast concourse of distinguished people caused great excitement
among the local population. A great crowd watched the ceremony from
the adjacent streets and from the windows of the houses close by.
It was our Bishop who caused the greatest sensation. He was robed
in cope and mitre and the people here, accustomed as they were to
their Protestant pastor and utterly ignorant of the status and
tenets of the Anglican Church, could not understand that we, too,
had a Bishop seemingly so very like their own.</p>

<p>And so the building of the English Church was forthwith begun.
The architects and builders in this part of the world are really
amazingly clever in the way they tackle the erection of buildings
on these often sheer sides of rock formations. They have, of
course, any amount of experience in that line. Remembering the
first sight one had of that truly priceless gift of this generous
government, the almost sheer rock, all chasms and crevasses, its
desolate aspect which to us&mdash;ignoramus as one
was&mdash;appeared indeed hopeless, and two years later saw the
result, one is lost in admiration of the local building craft.
There is the church on what had been the top of the rock&mdash;it
accommodates close on four hundred people and a small vestry;
connected with it by an inside stair-case there is a very nice
apartment for the occupation of the chaplain with sitting-room,
dining-room, study, three bedrooms, bathroom and usual offices;
below this again a large recreation room the use of which became
invaluable) with a small flat attached to it of one bedroom,
sitting-room, and bathroom; and finally below that a flat of three
rooms and a kitchen for the use of the verger and his family.</p>

<p>The recreation room was soon put to most excellent use. A club
for English maids, valets, and chauffeurs was presently instituted,
with English papers and magazines for their use, accommodation for
making tea for themselves and their friends, and, oh joy! for the
entertainment of the crews of English ships which happened to put
into the Baie des Anges or in the port of Monaco. This
pleasure&mdash;it was a pleasure for us all as you may well
imagine&mdash;was quite frequent during the next few years. At
first it was the coal-boats which came into Monaco: the
<i>Uskvale,</i> the <i>Uskmouth,</i> and the <i>Uskdale.</i> The
crew, their skipper, and their mates were royally entertained in
the Church club as it came to be called. It possessed many
amenities by this time: a draughts&rsquo; board, ping-pong, card
tables and cards for whist drives, and&mdash;best of all&mdash;a
gramophone with a number of the best dance records; there was a
dance every Tuesday evening in the large recreation room; there was
a canteen with light beer and soft drinks and plenty of sandwiches.
Our English maids, valets, and chauffeurs loved it, and so I assure
you did the crews of the English coal-boats.</p>

<p>Presently, however, we were honoured and overjoyed with the
visit into the Baie des Anges, into the port of Monaco, or into
Mentone, of British warships. In turn we had the joy of
entertaining the officers and crews of the <i>Royal Sovereign,</i>
the <i>Delhi,</i> the <i>Hood</i>, the <i>Repulse,</i> as well as
of the surveying, scientific <i>Ormond,</i> and others.</p>

<p>We at the Villa Bijou had <i>th&eacute;s-dansants,</i> dinners
and evening parties for the officers; and the members of the Church
Club were half-crazy with the joy of entertaining the crews at
different times. In return the ships gave us all most magnificent
entertainments. There was always a dance for the members of the
Church Club and a splendid tea for them, when they were permitted
to go all over those splendid units of the British fleet.</p>

<p>It was during the visit of the <i>Delhi</i> at Mentone that we
had the pleasure of receiving Admiral Brownrigg in our house. We
know that &lsquo;every woman loves a sailor&rsquo;, but how could
we help loving those who came to visit us during those happy, happy
years, when peace seemed to have at last descended upon our
troubled world and appeared to have come to stay. Ah, well! . . .
Admiral Brownrigg, on leaving Mentone, wrote me such a charming
letter to thank me and my husband for our hospitality to his
officers and to his men, and I look on that letter as one of my
cherished possessions. He was such a delightful personality; a true
British sailor: no wonder that his men always called him
&lsquo;Papa&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There was a rather amusing incident in connection with the visit
of the <i>Delhi</i>. As usual, when a British ship touched into
Monaco or the Baie des Agnes, a certain number of the crew and
officers came on parade&mdash;with band playing&mdash;to the
English Church. It was such a beautiful site to see those handsome
men in their dark blue marching up along the avenue which skirts
the port, and the streets adjoining as well as the Gardens of the
Casino were thronged with sightseers who cheered them as they
passed. Their way led them past the Casino, and the next day our
padre received a letter from the S.B.M.
(&lsquo;Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bains de Mer&rsquo;&mdash;in
English, the &lsquo;Society of Sea Baths&rsquo;&mdash;which is the
official name of the Casino Company), asking that the British
sailors should stop the music when nearing the Casino &lsquo;so as
not to disturb the players at the tables&rsquo;. We thought this
was too lovely for words. It had its humour; but in the future the
bands always stopped playing when passing close to the Casino so as
not to disturb the gamblers at their work.</p>

<p>We, of course, loved those Sundays when our little church was
filled to overflowing with men and officers in blue, and we sang
our hymns to the accompaniment of their splendid band. I had a very
happy afternoon when we gave a <i>th&eacute;-dansant</i> for the
officers of the <i>Royal Sovereign.</i> They came in full force, as
many as could get leave to come; but what delighted us both was to
see our guests arriving, each with a smile on his good-looking face
and a something scarlet in their button-hole. I thought at first
that the French Government had decorated the entire staff of
officers of this British ship with the Legion of Honour for some
conspicuous act of bravery&mdash;it does that sometimes with a
regiment or a ship&mdash;but not a bit of it. All those dear chaps
had fashioned&mdash;out of red paper&mdash;little scarlet
pimpernels, and wore these as a trophy in their button-holes.
Happy, happy me!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Indeed, the twenty years that followed our installation in Monte
Carlo were of unalloyed happiness for me. And looking back on them
I often wonder what it was that I had done to deserve it. Nothing,
of course. God had given me a vivid imagination which I had turned
to account in books that had won the appreciation of a very large
public. He had given me the companionship of one who was the
perfect husband, lover, and friend always. And I? Well! I took
everything for granted as it came, thinking no doubt that these
years of happiness would go on and on until we both were very old
and then just went on to life everlasting together . . . hand in
hand.</p>

<p>Just as in the past I never cared much for social gaieties the
entertainments which we gave or helped to give for the British
ships were the only ones that gave me real pleasure. But, of
course, there were other gaieties on foot from which one could not
altogether keep away. The English colony had considerably increased
in numbers during the years 1923-33. From a few hundred visitors
and residents ten years before it now numbered just upon 1,400, and
one&rsquo;s own circle of acquaintances waxed therefore in
proportion. Ever since 1924 we had made it a point to ask our
friends to a tea and cocktail party on New Year&rsquo;s Day. That
first year we sent out sixty invitations. Three years later we
could not ask fewer than two hundred without offending a number of
acquaintances who would naturally expect to be asked.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25" id=
"Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25</b>
</h2>

<p>&nbsp;But through all these days of gaieties and of varied
experiences of life and character I carried on assiduously with my
work. Between the years 1920&mdash;after we were finally and
comfortably settled in Villa Bijou&mdash;and 1940 I brought out
some of my most successful books: <i>The Uncrowned King, A Spy of
Napoleon</i> (a story of the Second Empire), <i>The Hon&rsquo;ble
Jim.</i></p>

<p>The Scarlet Pimpernel had not lost his hold upon my readers, and
many adventures of my dauntless hero did I put on record during
those happy Monte Carlo years, both in long and short stories. As a
matter of fact there are now no fewer than ten full-length romances
dealing with him and two volumes of short stories. The play, too,
was also constantly before the public either in London or in the
provinces. As was only to be expected I was often approached by
cinematograph companies for licence to make a film of that ever
popular story. Personally, I would have been quite willing; but not
so the great Mr. Fred Terry. The contract for the play as between
him, together with his wife and partner, Miss Julia Neilson, and
ourselves had been drawn up by a solicitor who had had very little
experience of theatrical matters and persons. It was very loosely
worded. Fred Terry was an avowed and bitter enemy of the films,
which he looked upon as successful rivals of theatrical
enterprise.</p>

<p>There had been a good deal of correspondence as to whether I as
the author of the original book or he as the owner of the rights in
the play held the cinematograph rights in the story. Ultimately we
were advised to go to law about the whole thing and get a decision
from the Court on that very moot point. Well! the case went against
us in this way, and whereas the copyright in the book was
indisputably mine, the rights in the play were equally indisputably
the Terry&rsquo;s. Neither side would be allowed to negotiate
cinematograph rights without the consent of the other. And Fred
Terry was adamant. There was no question of sharing either. When
the word cinematograph cropped up Fred Terry saw red.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And then it was that the great Master of us all put an end to
all controversy. Fred Terry had been ailing for some time. I
believe it was a question of gout, which became very acute and
finally touched the heart and carried that ideal Sir Percy Blakeney
away when he had scarcely passed the prime of his life. For he was,
and always will be in my opinion, the ideal in the flesh of my
favourite creation. He had the charm of manner, the beautifully
modulated voice, the humour, and the dominating personality. Soon
after his death the cinema companies got busy again. The London
Film Productions had recently been formed and had already attained
a great outstanding success in <i>Henry VIII</i> with that fine
actor, Charles Laughton, in the name part. It certainly was a
magnificent film and deserved the reputation which it conferred on
Alexander Korda, in my opinion, the finest film producer, bar none,
the cinema world has as yet known.</p>

<p>One of the directors of L.F.P. was that well-known actor, George
Grossmith, and I suppose that it was through him that the company
learned that Miss Julia Neilson was not adverse as her late husband
had been to the filming of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel.</i> She was
approached and so was I. By the decision of the Court the consent
of both of us was essential for obtaining the right to produce the
cinema version of the ever-popular book and play.</p>

<p>I had never been averse to this and willingly gave my consent:
Miss Neilson and I to share equally in the proceeds. It gave me
great pleasure to meet Alexander Korda, for I had long been
interested in him. He and his two brothers were a trio of young
Hungarian Jews with brains enough between the three of them to
furnish a dozen and more artistically minded and ambitious youths.
They betook themselves to Hollywood and there learned all there was
to know of the trade they had decided to make their own, and
Alexander, the eldest, burst upon the cinema world as the film
producer <i>par excellence.</i> What his brother Zolt&aacute;n did
not know about designing and constructing scenery was not worth
knowing, and the last of the three was the great technical expert:
a marvellous trio forsooth to come from a small Hungarian village
not far from Tarna-&Ouml;rs where I was born. <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> was shown subsequently over half the world. It is not
for me to speak of its success. I understand that it was one of the
most outstanding among the many successes achieved by English
cinema companies.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>There was one amusing incident in connection with the production
to which I cannot help referring here. Alexander Korda had
announced in the Press that Charles Laughton had been engaged by
him to play the part of Sir Percy Blakeney. . . . Whereupon both
he, by private correspondence, and the Press, by way of open
letters, were bombarded with protests by film &lsquo;fans&rsquo; as
to the unsuitability of that excellent actor to impersonate the
Scarlet Pimpernel. Physically he certainly might not have
<i>looked</i> the part, though a great actor can always rise above
mere physical defects (we had an example of this in Henry Irving),
and Laughton is indeed a great actor. But no! the film
&lsquo;fans&rsquo; were relentless in their demands: &lsquo;Charles
Laughton was unsuitable for the part of their favourite hero of
romance.&rsquo; Korda, open-minded as he was, gave way and engaged
Leslie Howard instead.</p>

<p>I have so often been asked whether I had been pleased or
disappointed in the film version of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel.</i>
Leslie Howard was certainly very attractive, very charming, he knew
how to make love, but he was not Fred Terry. Fred Terry was the
ideal Sir Percy and there cannot be two ideals in one&rsquo;s mind
of the one character. Howard had physical defects just as Laughton
had: he was short and could not look strong enough to dominate
certain situations, nor could he tower over Chauvelin, played, as
it happened, by a very tall man.</p>

<p>As for the working-out of the story, I thought all the scenes as
near perfection as any producer could conceive; they also followed
the book closely . . . until the end. But the end . . .!! Well! I
suppose that by that time film &lsquo;fans&rsquo; were satisfied
that all was well with Sir Percy and his lovely wife and were not
too critical as to how this had been brought about. This being so,
I think I may safely say that my pleasure in the presentation of my
romance on the cinema outweighed any disappointment I may have
felt.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>There had been one or two amusing experiences in connection with
the filming of some of my books. One, in particular, was so awful
that it became amusing. This was the presentation in France of
<i>The Scarlet Pimpernel.</i> Although the book published by
Nelson&rsquo;s and admirably translated, was known all over the
country as <i>Le Mouron Rouge</i> and formed part of many important
school libraries, the French film censor, not liking the title, had
it changed to <i>Le Chevalier de Londres.</i> But that was a small
matter compared with the&mdash;I was going to say outrage&mdash;of
turning Sir Percy and his devoted band into French
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> as it had been done in that
never-to-be-forgotten play at the Ambigu. He would not allow a
Frenchman (Chauvelin) to be &lsquo;downed&rsquo; by <i>un
anglais,</i> even an eighteenth-century one. But the worthy
official did not rest with that stricture. He went a step further
and would not permit any scene to be shown in which the guillotine
could be seen, except quite small and nebulous in the distance.
(Was he not aware of the fact that every French boy and girl had
learned their history at school and knew all about the revolution
and the guillotine?)</p>

<p>Anyway, &lsquo;doubled&rsquo; as it was and shorn of some of its
finest scenes with Leslie Howard and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes looking
unlike any French <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> that ever crossed
the Channel, the whole show was so bad that it became ludicrous. I
had been asked to be present on the opening night and bouquets of
red roses were most kindly showered upon me, but you must imagine
what it cost me to say something pleasant, even appreciative, to
all those concerned in what was nothing but the caricature of my
beloved book. I have often asked myself since, why&mdash;if the
whole setting of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> was objectionable to
French patriotic feeling&mdash;it was ever shown in France. Why not
have left it alone.</p>

<p>In Italy&mdash;as in the case of the play&mdash;the film was
presented in its original form as Alexander Korda had produced it.
Italians are too artistic to play tricks with works of art. Though
several of my books were filmed after that and shown not only in
England but in most of the European countries, I must confess that
I never took great interest in those productions. I certainly never
had the wish to go to Hollywood. What was the good? The cinema
people&mdash;principally U.S.A., of course&mdash;would &lsquo;gang
their ain gait&rsquo; whatever the author might say.</p>

<p>It is always stated most emphatically in the contracts that
&lsquo;no alterations in the story should be made without the
consent of the author&rsquo;. Nevertheless, whenever I have been
lured to witness a film based upon any book I had read and loved by
some favourite author of mine, I invariably came away wondering
mournfully why a charming story had been so foolishly mauled about.
There is always the story of the author who had witnessed a film
based on one of his popular books, remarking to the producer:
&ldquo;An admirable show, Mr. So-and-so. Very interesting. Who did
you say was the author of the original book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That delightful author, A. E. W. Mason, told me of an amusing
incident which occurred in Hollywood during the filming of one of
his historical romances. In one scene there was a crowd shouting
and making a great noise. One of the principal characters
witnessing this from a balcony demands peremptorily: &ldquo;What is
the meaning of this clamour?&rdquo; The producer interrupting:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he saying? Clamour: what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
The prompter: &ldquo;Clamour means noise, sir.&rdquo; The producer:
&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t he say noise?&rdquo; The prompter:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the text, sir.&rdquo; A pause. The producer is
wrapped in thought. Then peremptorily: &ldquo;Send for the language
expert.&rdquo; The &lsquo;language expert&rsquo; arrives and
explains: &ldquo;Clamour is archaic, sir, and as the story . .
.&rdquo; The producer, angrily: &ldquo;A cake? A cake? What kind of
a cake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also recollect one really amusing incident which occurred in
the filming of my <i>Beau Brocade,</i> a highwayman story of the
eighteenth century. The scene is laid in England and the film was
produced by an English company and beautifully done. There were
some charming pictures of English countryside, moorland, heath,
old-world villages, and so on. The producer, while motoring through
Surrey and Sussex, had come across an old coaching inn,
creeper-clad and entirely unspoiled; even the sign-post &lsquo;The
Running Footman&rsquo;, looked ancient enough for his purpose. He
was delighted with his find. It was just what he had been looking
for. Arrangements were soon made with the landlord and some of the
best outdoor scenes in the film were enacted in front of the old
inn. Only one little thing had been overlooked in the excitement of
the rehearsals and this was the notice&mdash;black lettering on a
white board swinging on a bracket to the right of the front
door&mdash;&lsquo;You may telephone from here&rsquo;. It was only
revealed during a private show done for my benefit of a few scenes
in which I was specially interested. Of course, these had to be
done all over again with the offending notice removed. Luckily the
frontage of the inn did not occur more than twice in the scenario;
but, even so, getting everything together again, the company, the
accessories, the supers, and especially the arrival and drawing up
of a coach and four, entailed a great deal of extra expense.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I want to ask my readers in the kindness of their heart to
forget the captious remarks I have made on the subject of
cinematography generally, especially those aimed quite
good-naturedly at American producers. I am more than willing to
acknowledge the pre-eminence of the U.S.A. film productions and of
film stars. They got ahead of us all, English, French, Italian,
Germans, during the four-and-a-half years that we were busy
fighting. They perfected their technique of that intricate art
while Europe was engaged in perfecting the technique of war and the
flower of her youth were laying down their lives for the honour of
their country and the defence of their homes. We owe some of the
finest films ever made to American producers. I need only name:
<i>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,</i> and <i>Intolerance,</i>
or <i>Broken Blossoms,</i> and there are many, many more which we
all remember as reaching the acme of what photography and perfect
dramatic presentation can achieve.</p>

<p>We in England reached the peak at that time in <i>Henry
VIII</i>, as did France in those delightful comedies, <i>Sous le
toits de Paris</i> and <i>Marius.</i> And if we owe the inimitable
Charlie Chaplin to the U.S.A., France can boast of her Raimu, and
we in England of Wallace Beery and Cicely Courtneidge.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26" id=

</h2>

<p>And all through these years, 1920 to 1939, Monte Carlo kept up
its high standard as one of the great musical centres of Europe.
<i>L&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra de Monte Carlo</i> was celebrated
throughout the musical world and the greatest artistes of the time
looked to a season in Monte Carlo as one of the crowning glories of
their career. Caruso, alas! was no more; and of the two de Reszkes,
Edouard had died during the war in misery in his native land,
Poland, and Jean had retired from the operatic stage and was living
in Nice, teaching singing to a privileged few. But we had that fine
Greek tenor, Lapas (who caused much amusement among the audience
once when singing Parsifal, which he did divinely, he forgot to
take off his wrist-watch), and the French artiste Thill, we had
Vanni-Marcoux, we had Fanny Heldy, and Melba gave her absolutely
final appearance on any stage as Marguerite in <i>Faust</i>.
Anyway, we had everything that heart of amateur or musician could
desire.</p>

<p>When there was no opera we had the Russian Ballets with
Diaghileff still in command; or else comedies, sometimes with Sacha
Guitry and his wife, sometimes with artistes of the
<i>Com&eacute;die fran&ccedil;ais</i> come especially from
Paris.</p>

<p>About this time, too, there was instituted in Monte Carlo a
<i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Conf&eacute;rences.</i> Monsieur
Labande, Keeper of the Archives of the Principality, was its moving
spirit. He was a charming, highly-cultured old man and under his
rule the Society quickly grew into artistic importance. He had
enlisted the support and patronage of Prince Pierre de Monaco (this
was before the divorce) who made it a point of being present at the
<i>conf&eacute;rences</i> which were held once a week. Great
personages in the French literary world, as well as distinguished
military and naval men, gave some very interesting lectures in the
<i>Salle des Conf&eacute;rences,</i> specially built to accommodate
the Society and its many patrons. The lectures were, of course,
held in French, but whenever we two went, which we did as often as
we could, we invariably met a small number of our English friends
who were conversant with the language and enjoyed them as much as
we did.</p>

<p>Monsieur Labande then did me the honour to ask me to give one of
these lectures. He also asked Commander Spicer-Simpson, of the
International Hydrographic Bureau, to do the same, as he, like
myself, spoke French fluently. For my lecture (I do so dislike the
word) I chose <i>Les Beaux et les Dandies des Grands Si&egrave;cles
en Angleterre</i> (otherwise the Beaux and Dandies of the
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. I spoke of the Duke of
Buckingham, Beau Nash, and Beau Brummel, and spoke without any
notes&mdash;of course in French. It was a great success, so much so
that the Society had it printed and distributed among its members
and a copy now rests among its archives.</p>

<p>That same year Commander Spicer-Simpson gave us a most
interesting account of a mission under his command to Lake
Tanganyika, entrusted to him by the British Government. He showed
us some wonderful magic-lantern slides which he had taken and
developed himself. Both he and I were subsequently asked to repeat
our lectures at two special galas given in aid of our Church
Building Fund, each gala being graced by the presence of H.R.H. the
Duke of Connaught. On those occasions both the Commander and I
spoke in English, and the hall of the H&ocirc;tel Metropole was
crowded with English visitors and hosts of our friends and
acquaintances.</p>

<p>After that I was asked, year after year, to give a conference,
which I did. The members of the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i> seemed
to like them. Two of my most successful ones were &lsquo;historical
mysteries&rsquo;, when I sedulously avoided the Man with the Iron
Mask&mdash;it would have been too trite for a French audience, even
in the manner so cleverly elucidated by Andrew Lang&mdash;but the
audience liked my version of the mysterious Comte de St. Germain
whom Horace Walpole had met in England in 1742, whom Madame de
Pompadour flirted with twenty years later, who is spoken of by the
noted French arch&aelig;ologist, Grosley of Troyes, in his memoirs,
as an exceptionally handsome young man in 1813, and Van Damme in
the same eulogistic terms as gracing the <i>salons</i> of Louis
Philippe, <i>i.e. circa</i> 1840.</p>

<p>My account of the great mystery connected with the false Jeanne
d&rsquo;Arc was also very much liked, especially by my American
auditors, and of course the Gowrie Conspiracy is always intriguing;
and there are several more which suited my purpose admirably.</p>

<p>Another successful conference I named: &ldquo;Books fatal to
authors&rsquo;. The wretched Urbain Grandier who was burned at the
stake for publishing an attack on Cardinal Richelieu, the
all-powerful minister of Louis XIII; our own Daniel Defoe, author
of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, a strong partisan of the Nonconformist
cause who published a pamphlet entitled, <i>The Shortest Way with
the Dissenters,</i> in which he ironically advised their entire
extermination. Parliament condemned his book to the flames and the
author to pillory and prison. After that he gave up writing
controversial pamphlets and gave us his immortal <i>Robinson
Crusoe.</i> I also tackled <i>Literary Frauds</i> and <i>Amours de
Reine,</i> both in English and in French.</p>

<p>The getting together of material for these conferences gave me a
very great deal of pleasure. The French ones were usually for the
<i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Conf&eacute;rences</i> and the English
ones in aid of one or other of those English charities which
interested us all, my own efforts in the matter being, of course,
honorary.</p>

<p>There was for every conference a good deal of
&lsquo;material&rsquo; to be got together as I was expected to talk
for an hour and a half without notes though all the French
lecturers I noticed always had their notes in their hands, but I
always think that to see the speaker&rsquo;s head bobbing up and
down, now looking at his notes and then at his hearers, is very
irritating to the audience. Luckily for me my memory was then still
very excellent.</p>

<p>One of the English charities we of the colony on the C&ocirc;te
d&rsquo;Azur were most interested in was the Victoria Memorial
Hospital. As its name implies it was built in memory of Queen
Victoria and was entirely kept up by private subscription,
principally English of course. Like every institution in France,
permission for the founding, the employment of an English nursing
staff, and for subsequent upkeep had to be obtained first, that so
many wards must always be retained for patients of French
nationality; and secondly, that if ever the hospital had to close
down for one reason or another, the French Government would then
enter in possession of the building and carry on with its own staff
at its own will.</p>

<p>However, at the time there was <i>no</i> question of ever being
obliged to close down. Subscriptions and donations had flowed in
freely from the first and the hospital was free of debt. A small
number of beds were already endowed by generous members of the
English colony for the accommodation of English patients, the donor
having first call on any vacant bed; to this number we did our best
to add a few more. I, for one, desired to endow one of these beds
to be known as <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> bed. So I set to work
with the help of that fine amateur actor, Captain Chadwick, who had
often sung in grand opera in Monte Carlo, to arrange two
<i>matin&eacute;es</i> of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i> with himself
in the name part, one to take place in Monte Carlo and the other in
Nice. The proceeds were to be in aid of <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> bed in the Victoria Memorial Hospital. Captain
Chadwick got an excellent company together among his friends in the
Monte Carlo theatre, and they all most generously gave their
services; he himself was so very good and sympathetic in the name
part. The result was most satisfactory, and there was, and still is
to this day, the endowed <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> bed in the
Victoria Memorial Hospital with happy, happy me having first call
on a vacant bed for any necessitous English patient.</p>

<p>Soon, as was only to be expected, the beloved hospital got too
small for its needs. The building had to be enlarged, the interior
modernized, accommodation for the ever-growing number of patients
and consequent nursing staff had to be provided. No less a sum than
&pound;9,000 was required for all this. Onward Christian soldiers!
I mean, Onward, English Colony of Monte Carlo! We organized a
super-gala in the opera house, which H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught,
with his usual goodness of heart, graced with his presence; there
were superb attractions and the prices of seats were raised to what
would have been impossible heights but for the liberality of the
English and American colonies. The money was got together in that
one afternoon and was subsequently amplified by other
entertainments, galas, amateur performances in the theatre,
lectures, whist drives, bridge tournaments, and so on. By the end
of the season &pound;18,000 was got together and the Victoria
Memorial was free of debt and able to carry on.</p>

</h2>

<p>Two important events in our lives occurred in the course of
those two happy decades. One was sheer delight and most fortunate
in every way, the other was only fortunate at the outset and then
very much the reverse; it was one of the great mistakes that one
unconsciously drifts into at some time or other; in our case I may
call it the only great mistake we ever made.</p>

<p>It had its origin in the conviction which gradually grew upon us
that Monte Carlo was getting too big for its boots. It was growing
and growing in size and in importance far beyond what we had
expected of it when we decided to make our winter home in what was
then an earthly paradise, the favoured child of Nature, all
sunshine and beauty and, above all, peace. Houses upon houses,
flats, hotels, villas were being constructed and piled one upon the
other; and soon whenever one&rsquo;s eye wandered in search of
those lovely views it used to delight in, the groves of grey-green
olives, the sunlight glinting through the lace-work of palm trees,
the glimpses of the blue Mediterranean, and the mountains of Italy
far away, it was met by hideous white and glaring buildings,
scattered all over the purple hills and blocking out those
fairy-like visas that one only remembered now as one does a
dream.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo was getting big and bloated; it bulged out in every
direction like a great ogre that was devouring more than it could
swallow and threatened to burst its sides. It reminded me of that
nursery tale of La Fontaine: the frog that desired to be as big as
the bull <i>(La Grenouille qui voulut se faire aussi grosse que le
Boeuf).</i> He puffed himself out and puffed and puffed, frequently
asking the opinion of his friends whether he was getting anywhere
near the realization of his ambition: <i>&rdquo;M&rsquo;y voici
donc?&rdquo;</i> he would ask (Have I got there now?).
<i>&rdquo;Point du tout,&rdquo;</i> was the reply. So he went on
puffing and puffing himself out until he burst. Well! Monte Carlo,
figuratively speaking, was like that frog. It wanted to be as big
as . . . I don&rsquo;t know what, but the boundaries of the
Principality could not be expanded seeing that there was the
territory of France to the west and to the north, of Italy to the
east, and the Mediterranean to the south, so that was that.</p>

<p>And still the ogre went on gormandizing. The number of American
and English visitors who desired to find a permanent home in the
&lsquo;earthly paradise&rsquo; where there were no fogs and no
taxes, was increasing year by year and every building was snapped
up even before it was completed, whilst hotels, also increasing in
size and numbers were full to overflowing. At first this trek to
the Riviera was confined to the winter months; but presently, when
Monte Carlo laid itself out for a summer season with a wonderful
summer Casino and Country Club, with tennis courts galore,
swimming-pool, and speed-boats, there were only two months left in
the year&mdash;July and August&mdash;when peace and freedom from
social duties which we had hoped to find permanently here, came for
that brief while like a beneficent dispensation. Two months, and
they were two out of the five or six which we always liked to spend
among our friends in England. The rest of the time, with so many
dear kind friends who came here season after season as visitors to
avoid the English winters, we soon found ourselves so full of
engagements that we literally got the wind up, feeling that work
was bound to suffer a set-back from so much interruption and
distraction.</p>

<p>Did our love for Monte Carlo and for our happy winter home which
we had adored and perfected until it was the real representation of
its name, <i>Villa Bijou</i>&mdash;the Jewel&mdash;actually begin
to waver when we saw the place of our dreams turned into a huge
rabbit-warren, I cannot say. Certain it is that we began to long
for some place where we would be more completely shut out from that
social world which we neither of us cared for, and which seemed to
be drawing us away, with its multifarious tentacles, from the
simple life which we loved.</p>

<p>As luck would have it we had a few years before this made the
acquaintance of a very charming English resident of Mentone, Mrs.
Cochrane, who had a second and very beautiful home in Italy. On one
occasion she asked us to come and spend a few days there with her,
and we accepted joyfully. Rezzola&mdash;such was its name&mdash;was
revealed to us as a dream of a place. Built on the hills that
overlook the Gulf of Spezia, it commands a view of the most
beautiful vista on God&rsquo;s earth, with the white-streaked
Carrara mountains way out to the left and the little town of
Lerici, with its medi&aelig;val tower, where Shelley had lived and
suffered, of Spezzia, backed by the spurs of the Apennines with the
old fishing town of San Torenzo at their base. And then there were
the gardens of Rezzola, down the side of the hill, a-glow when we
first saw it with the munificent Eglantine rose running riot over
terraces and balustrades, the Judas trees flaunting their crimson
blooms between sober grey olive trees and the shiny green of
graceful waving palms, and around the lawns violets and crocuses
and Poet&rsquo;s Narcissi, giving out as it were&mdash;with their
gentleness and their humility in the midst of so much gorgeous
vegetation&mdash;something that spoke to one of England. It really
was enchanting.</p>

<p>During that first visit to Rezzola we got to know Italy and the
Italians better than we had ever known them before, when we
wandered through the country more or less as tourists; that is to
say, we got to know the Italian <i>people</i> as they were then,
after Mussolini had restored order among the turbulent communistic
elements who were getting the upper hand in the country by
continuous unprovoked strikes, malicious destruction of private
property, damage to industrial plant, and frequent banditism, often
amounting to murder. Yes! looking back on that period in Italian
contemporary history, one could not help acknowledging that
Mussolini and Fascism in its infancy were, during those first
years, the salvation of Italy. And I think we all remember how the
vast majority of thinking English men and women&mdash;men
especially, and hard-baked Tories&mdash;so often gave utterance to
the pious wish: &ldquo;Oh! why has not England got a
Mussolini?&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was at Rezzola that we consolidated, as it were, our
friendship with that fine English sailor and scientist, Admiral
Reginald Bacon, a friendship which I am proud to say will, please
God, endure to the end of my life.</p>

<p>And then one day we heard that Admiral Bacon had bought a piece
of land adjoining Rezzola and was building a villa destined to be
his and his family&rsquo;s winter home in the future. Like
ourselves, he was longing for winter sunshine, for the peace and
quiet of this beautiful part of the world. He couldn&rsquo;t bear
Monte Carlo and was not enamoured with any part of France. The
villa which he built and called &lsquo;Primazzina&rsquo; was not
beautiful, but it was roomy and comfortable, the garden could be
made beautiful and the view over Lerici, its Bay, and its ancient
tower, over Carrara and the Apennines was just as lovely as the one
from Rezzola.</p>

<p>And so we pondered over all these things while we wandered
through the gardens of Rezzola and the thought of all the quietude
that reigned over this happy part of the world, gradually took on
the shape of a desire to abandon the turbulence and worldly turmoil
of bloated Monte Carlo for this abode of peace. A piece of
land&mdash;which for some unknown reason was called &lsquo;La
Padula&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> The Marsh)&mdash;adjoining Admiral
Bacon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Primazzina&rsquo;, was for sale. We bought it
and in our turn built a delightful little Italian villa on the
mountainside in the heart of olive woods which, in the spring, were
carpeted with Roman hyacinths and Poet&rsquo;s Narcissi. There was
a great dearth of house accommodation at this time in Italy, and
Mussolini had decreed that every house completed before 1927 would
be free of all taxes for twenty-five years. That finally decided
us, as we had heard very disquieting rumours about taxation on
landed estate in Italy. As it was, we did not spend much money on
the building, and the design of the villa was so charming, its
situation so unique, and its accommodation so convenient that one
felt there would never be any difficulty in letting it for so many
months in the year. With our passion for gardening we soon
transformed the forest of stunted olives into a lovely garden with
tiled paths leading down the hillside to an avenue of many-coloured
hydrangea and standard oleander trees. We still had a quantity of
furniture left over from Snowfield and warehoused in London; we
sent for it; it came over by sea as far as Genoa in a coal-boat,
and the transport in that way cost very little. Anyway, we had
transformed a wilderness of stunted olives into a place of beauty,
just as we had transformed an inverted match-box in Monte Carlo
into an architectural jewel, and an ugly suburban house in
Snowfield into a stately Queen Anne house. Somehow we felt that we
had done our best to enrich the world with those three works of
genuine art, works that would abide long after we ourselves will
have passed away.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we ever seriously thought of selling the
Villa Bijou, even though the value of the house and land had
increased enormously since we originally settled down in Monte
Carlo. Anyway, we put off final decision as to that&mdash;oh! how
thankful we were later on that we did&mdash;and in the meanwhile we
spent two autumn and two spring months in &lsquo;La Padula&rsquo;
and two winter ones in Monte Carlo, and the rest of our time in
England.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28" id=
"Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28</b>
</h2>

<p>It was while the building of &lsquo;La Padula&rsquo; was in
progress that the second great event in the happy decade took
place. We had the joy and honour of receiving an invitation from
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to visit Canada as their
guests, travelling on their system, and staying in their several
beautiful hotels on the way. To say that we accepted this
munificent invitation with delight is to express very inadequately
the gratitude and joy which we felt.</p>

<p>I never could have believed, had I not experienced it, that
kindness, consideration, and courtesy could reach such perfection.
The Company and its directors said that they wished to do honour to
the author of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, but oh! had I been the
most distinguished literary light that ever was, I could not have
received more generous cordiality or more friendly courtesy during
those happy ten weeks which we spent in that magnificent
country.</p>

<p>Of course ten weeks is a very short time in which to gather
together the great mass of impressions which crowded in upon one in
the face of so much that was both new and unexpected. There was so
much to see, so much to try to understand, to try to appreciate
that one&rsquo;s mind could not grapple with it all. It was all so
wonderful! from the moment when representatives of the Company met
us at Liverpool and saw to our embarkation on board the
<i>Montcalm,</i> and to our comfort even to the smallest detail, I
felt as if I were in a dream. And what&rsquo;s more, I felt that I
knew what it feels like to be a royalty, when everything is done
for you to save you the slightest trouble and done with
whole-hearted kindliness and understanding.</p>

<p>And the same kindliness and understanding followed us all the
way, in those magnificent C.P.R. hotels where the finest suites
were always reserved for us, where on arrival we always found our
rooms filled with flowers and a bottle of champagne set ready for
us. I cannot begin to enthuse over those hotels, which far surpass
in luxury and good taste anything that New York can give. Our first
experience was of Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac in Quebec, where we first
met Mr. Murray Gibbon, who was then publicity manager of the C.P.R.
Company. He is a distinguished Canadian author and he it was who
had planned and organized the whole of our trip. On our first
meeting he gave us our railway and steamer passes over the whole of
the C.P.R. line. He went through the itinerary with us and told us
of the wonderful arrangements he had already made for rooms at all
their hotels on the way. Under his guidance we would see all that
was possible in the short time at our command and gather
unforgettable impressions of a great and glorious country. We were
indeed overwhelmed by the kindness we received.</p>

<p>Often did my dear one and I say to one another: &ldquo;If we
were twenty years younger we would settle down in Canada.&rdquo;
One could not help feeling in the very air the spirit of youth and
of ever growing and developing incentive to labour and to create. I
cannot, of course, attempt to give a detailed account of everything
we saw and experienced during those ten weeks. So many books on
Canada have been written by authors far cleverer than I with
greater knowledge of the country and far wider experience of its
sentiment and of its people.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We spent four happy days in Quebec in perfect weather. It was
all so new to us, this strange admixture of old France and
ultra-modern England: the French dialect as it was spoken by the
early pioneers, the old French habits and customs, the domination
of the Roman Catholic Church of which the Province of Quebec is the
impregnable stronghold, with its quaint superstitions and elaborate
rituals, its forty churches inside the city, its numerous
monasteries, convents, and seminaries; the huge church of Ste. Anne
twenty miles outside Quebec, with its holy relics and healing
springs and its sacred staircase of thirty-five stone steps over
which one hundred and thirty pilgrims had gone up on their knees
during the previous year; the primitive life of the
&lsquo;habitants&rsquo; in their old cottages and patriarchal manor
houses on the outskirts of the city and on the <i>Ile
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans,</i> which reminded me of the homes of
Hungarian peasants in Tarna-&Ouml;rs. We loved the old-world charm
and the historical and sentimental associations all centring in
Quebec. And then, by way of contrast, there was the gorgeousness of
Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac (the C.P.R. Hotel) with every modern
comfort and luxury, with its magnificent dining-room and sumptuous
meals, its jazz-band and dancing floor, and the beautiful English
homes of those charming friends who so graciously entertained us at
luncheon; such a contrast! and oh! what an interesting one!!</p>

<p>Montreal did not appeal to me quite so sentimentally. There was
still the feeling of old France surviving in its language and some
of its unfashionable streets; and it felt quaint and bewildering at
first to ask one&rsquo;s way in French from the policeman on point
duty, or to buy one&rsquo;s stamps and register one&rsquo;s letters
at the <i>Bureau de Poste</i>; to order a <i>fine</i> at the local
caf&eacute; and to ask for an <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> when one
wanted a cocktail; Montreal in the Province of Quebec was
&lsquo;dry&rsquo;, but there was apparently no difficulty in
getting what drinks our kind host, Mr. Murray Gibbon, had ordered
for us and his numerous guests at luncheon in the luxurious
University Club, nor any in the comfortable C.P.R. Place Viger
Hotel, where our breakfast waiter turned out to be a Derbyshire man
who (just imagine how small the world is!) had been present in the
Theatre Royal, Nottingham, on the first performance of <i>The
Scarlet Pimpernel</i>!</p>

<p>The rest of the happy day we spent in Montreal was taken up with
a beautiful drive to Mont Royal, with its fine park on the high
hill and its glorious views.</p>

<p>Toronto, our next halting-place, I didn&rsquo;t care so much
about. King Edward&rsquo;s Hotel, where we had beautiful rooms on
the fourteenth floor (our first experience of sleeping so near to
the sky), was most luxurious and ultra-modern in all its
appointments, even to the head-waiter, who as soon as we sat down
to our luncheon, offered to get us whiskies and soda; this he did
in a whisper in my husband&rsquo;s ear, as Toronto (Province of
Ontario) was also &lsquo;dry&rsquo;. Thus we had gone through two
&lsquo;dry&rsquo; provinces (as &lsquo;dry&rsquo; as the U.S.A.!!!)
all except on the trains and . . .</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We both loved our trip over the Great Lakes on board the C.P.R.
steamer <i>Assiniboia</i>, such a fine boat, such comfortable
sleeping accommodation, and such excellent food as ever was. There
were two hundred and fifty passengers and it was among these that I
became acquainted with one lady who was a teacher in a girls&rsquo;
school in Toronto, who had never read or had even as much as heard
of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>. This, I am sure, sounds a
fearfully conceited remark to make; but, as a matter of fact, I
never had met anyone to whom the words &lsquo;Scarlet
Pimpernel&rsquo; just meant nothing at all. I found the experience
most refreshing.</p>

<p>How beautiful those Great Lakes are! The Captain was&mdash;as
C.P.R. officials invariably were towards us&mdash;most kind; he
invited us to go up on the bridge when we passed through the locks
and where at Ste. Marie we could see the Rapids and the wonderful
iron bridge which on a pivot carries the heavy C.P.R. trains to the
U.S.A. side.</p>

<p>We had rather an alarming night of it when steaming through Lake
Superior where we lost sight of land on either side; the
ship&rsquo;s sirens started off at 2 a.m. with their monotonous and
portentous calls. We were in a thick white fog which did not lift
till past six o&rsquo;clock in the morning. When on arrival at Port
Arthur we bade good-bye to our Captain and thanked him for all his
kindness and consideration, we felt bound to confess that we had
been rather alarmed at the density of the fog which was so much
thicker than any we had experienced when steaming on the Atlantic
or in the Channel between Gibraltar and Southampton; we expressed
our gratitude to him for having brought us safely to shore. He said
with a grave shake of the head: &ldquo;You are not more thankful
than I am, I assure you. These fogs on Superior are sometimes the
very d . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Though I have done a great deal of travelling by railway on the
Continent of Europe during my life, I have always hated it. I have,
of course, seen the growth of its (so-called) comfort from the old
first-class compartments with their red velvet seats and
antimacassars during those weary days and nights on the express! to
Budapest, to the present-day <i>wagonlits</i> on the <i>train
bleu</i>; from the halts for meals at various stations in Germany
with the scramble for a hurried snack at most inconvenient hours,
with the &lsquo;turn-out&rsquo; in the middle of the night for
Customs examinations on the German and on the Austrian frontiers
down to the present-day <i>wagons-restaurants</i>, of which the
least said the better. I have hated it all from those days to this.
But of all the discomforts that I have experienced in the past, I
cannot picture to myself anything worse than the accommodation for
night journeys on American trains. How the luxury-loving Americans
can ever bring themselves to travel by rail from San Francisco to
New York passes my comprehension. Of course there are a limited
(very limited) number of quite comfortable drawing-room
compartments with private wash-basins and so on&mdash;we had the
benefit of these throughout our journey across Canada&mdash;but the
usual first-class cars with twenty-four bunks on two tiers in each
car&mdash;and a narrow passageway through the centre with no
standing room, and just a curtain screening each bed; and oh
horrors! only one toilet place with lavatory so that the
twenty-four passengers have to wait their turn for their morning
ablutions!!</p>

<p>Well! never mind! we certainly had no cause to grumble and the
distance to Winnipeg was quite short. We had only a brief halt
there, while kind Mrs. Rogers took us to her beautiful home, gave
us cocktails and took us for a drive round the town. But it was on
the return journey that I had the real impression of Winnipeg, one
which will always abide with me as being some of the happiest hours
of that thrice happy journey through a splendid and hospitable
country.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Is there anyone who, having had the privilege of spending a few
days in Banff, does not treasure the remembrance of it and of the
Banff Springs Hotel&mdash;so comfortable, so luxurious, so
&lsquo;homey&rsquo;? I just loved every moment we spent there, the
view over the beautiful mountains, the hot springs, the bathing
pool. I even loved the train journey down from Winnipeg. I loved
the enormous expanse of flat country through which we passed, and
the immense cornfields which brought back the Hungarian
<i>puszta</i> so vividly to my memory. On the train we met Mrs.
Coleman, the wife of the vice-president of the C.P.R.&mdash;and
such a pretty woman&mdash;with her two little boys, her friend,
Mrs. Parker, and her secretary. They were on their way to Lake
Louise. Our black conductor was a native of St. Lucia in the West
Indies and therefore a British subject. He was very proud of this
and was very chatty. He had read the <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> and
many of my books; had passed his matric in the Cambridge
examinations and was studying engineering; whilst the head-waiter
in the dining-car was a Swede, whose brother was a doctor and had
served with the English during the 1914-1918 war.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it poured with rain the whole of the next day, but
undeterred we tramped about Banff, went to their delightful Zoo and
made friends with the &lsquo;Bob-Cats&rsquo;; then, when the next
morning the place was bathed in sunshine, we motored over to the
Camping Park, the holiday playground of the same sort of people who
in England jostle one another on the sands of Margate, or
Blackpool, or perhaps Ostende, after tumbling one over the other in
over-full trains, tired even before they start on their way, hot
and covered in dust, worried into irritability by tired and fretful
children and by anxiety over numerous baskets and paper bags and
finally finding a resting-place and tepid stewed tea with stale
bread and margarine in a crowded lodging-house.</p>

<p>In the holiday Camping Park, in Alberta, there is nothing but
quietude and peace; there are primitive but perfectly clean huts
wherein to sleep in unfavourable weather. But on fine nights there
is the most perfect sleeping accommodation heart of man can desire:
its walls, the stately pine trees of the forest; its roof the star
spangled sky; no crowd&mdash;for the Park is one of the largest in
the world and there is room for everybody&mdash;no bustle, no worry
with the children who have plenty of room to play about, or with
catering, for holiday-makers bring their provisions with them on
their bicycles and cook what they require on huge communal kitchen
stoves.</p>

<p>We both kept on thinking of the sands at Margate or Southend,
the nigger minstrels, the noise, the heat, the jaded nerves of
harassed mothers, and full of enthusiasm for what we had seen in
the Camping Park we determined to move heaven and earth (or what is
more difficult, to move the British Government), into establishing
such ideal holiday resorts in over-populated England. You think we
could move them? Interest them in our enthusiastic description of
the ideal holiday ground we had seen in Camping Park? Not a bit of
it. We were told politely, but most firmly, that our ideas were all
wrong. The English matron and the English family man want their
seaside, their sands, their donkey-rides, pier and wholly
inadequate shelters against the rain. As for sleeping in the open
air by moonlight and under the stars . . . Ah, well! No doubt they
are right and perhaps one day pioneers more eloquent than we were
would succeed in bringing the English official mind to try an
experiment in an ideal holiday ground.</p>

<p>How lovely is Lake Louise, and how beautiful the view from the
hotel over the blue waters! (My heart did ache a year later when
the hotel was burned down.) Everything in that part of Canada was
unbelievably beautiful and no words of mine could possibly express
the delight that filled my heart when we were driven to Lake
Moraine and the Valley of the Peaks (what a romantic name!) to Yoho
Camp and Falls, Whisky Jack, and Takakhaw Falls. Nature at her
grandest and most romantic. Wapton Camp, where we were entertained
by a charming English lady with a perfect Oxford accent, Miss
Dodds, and were rowed across the lake by an undergraduate of
Toronto University who acted as porter for our luggage. Oh! how I
admire all these young men whom we met during these trips across
country, students who, not being in a position to pay for all their
studies in college or university, just set to earn what money they
required for fees as well as for their living expenses; the
stewards on board the <i>Assiniboia</i>, the waiters in the great
hotels, the porters at railway stations, such fine fellows all of
them, so plucky, so determined to attain that which they had mapped
out for themselves, for their future as potential citizens of this
grand young country. Work! work! so long as it was clean, scrubbing
floors, or shouldering grips; God bless them and help them in their
endeavour.</p>

<p>Emerald Lake (yet another romantic name) was lovely too; so was
its delightful chalet&mdash;something between an hotel and a camp
where there was a central house with bedrooms, kitchen, dining-room
and club-room, and a few enchanting log huts with guest-rooms,
bathrooms, and so on. We had one of these huts all to ourselves,
two bedrooms and most luxurious bathroom. We only stayed there the
one night as we were in a hurry to get to Glacier. As a matter of
fact we had a scare <i>re</i> the latter place. We were told that
the hotel was due to close on the 15th for the winter, whereas we
were booked to arrive there on that very day. However, all was
well, and we were made most welcome; the little hotel (it was a
wooden one with the guest-rooms in more or less separate buildings)
had been kept open specially for our arrival. There were flowers
and fruit for us in our sitting-room, and oh! the view of
snow-covered Mount Glacier which dominates the little town!</p>

<p>We stayed two days and nights in Glacier. The caretakers had
already arrived for the winter season, three Swiss men who looked
the part, sturdy mountaineers all three of them. Our first visitors
were two darling bears. Yes, bears! Not the big Russian bears that
haunt the Carpathians of my young days and the skin of one of
which&mdash;nine and a half feet from nose to foot&mdash;adorns my
dining-room in Monte Carlo, but dear little fellows the size of
Himalayan bears, and so tame. They were padding out of the forest
towards the porch of the hotel and we fed them with sugar which
they took greedily from our hands.</p>

<p>We met Captain Russell who was (probably still is) the
&lsquo;boss&rsquo; of all the forests of British Columbia. He lives
at Field and is English born, married to a Canadian wife from
Victoria, and has been in the country for thirty-five years. Like
all experts who know everything they are talking about he was most
interesting on the subject of National Parks and of every branch of
arboriculture, and he enlightened our ignorance about the taking up
of crown land and the pegging out of claims for minerals and so
on.</p>

<p>Presently the rain came down which was getting ready to turn
into snow, but we got a good walk on both days and felt all the
better for the invigorating mountain air and high altitude.</p>

<p>On the third day we took the train for Vancouver. Some of the
Glacier Hotel staff travelled down also and we all had a splendid
view of Albert Canyon, of Sicamous and Kemloops. We met some dear
friends in Vancouver, Mr. and Mrs. Henshaw, who have a lovely
very-English home in North Vancouver, and Mr. and Mrs.
Rogers&mdash;he is ranger of Stanley Park&mdash;they have a very
beautiful house and were most gracious and hospitable; they gave us
a delicious lunch at the Country Club. How delightful and
&lsquo;homey&rsquo; are those Country Clubs! We got to know quite a
number by now; every city of any importance has got one and there
is something peculiarly attractive in the atmosphere of every one
of them.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>My dear husband and I both decided that only if . . . if . . .
and if we were ten years younger and if . . . if . . . and if
aviation had become a regular means of travelling from one end of
the world to another, we would fly over to Victoria, British
Columbia, and there spend two months out of every twenty-four at
least! What nonsense! But Victoria is so lovely, the climate so
perfect! the life? everything that is best in England and Southern
France, and friends&mdash;the kindest friends all ready to welcome
you. To start with there was the sea-trip across, past those
picturesque islands and then the Empress Hotel . . . ! How can any
traveller venture to extol the charms of the H&ocirc;tel de Paris
in Monte Carlo, or any of the most noted hotels in Lucerne or Le
Touquet if he has not enjoyed the beauty and homeliness of the
Empress at Victoria, British Columbia, and experienced the kindness
and attention of its manager, Mr. Wilson&mdash;such a perfect host
(I wonder if he is still at his post?) Of course,
Brentwood&mdash;the home of Mr. and Mrs. Butchart&mdash;with its
enchanting gardens, is famous all over the world. Mr. Butchart
drove us out there in his motor and we were royally entertained by
those dear kind friends. Here we met Mr. Oliver, Premier of British
Columbia, and we and other guests were taken by our host for a run
in his motor-boat; the picturesque coast scenery and those lovely
little islands, the colour, the atmosphere all contributed to our
delight. We felt in a kind of enchantment.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was in Victoria that I first had the honour of being asked to
lunch, and to give an address at the Canadian Women&rsquo;s Club. I
had already, in London, heard from Sir George Maclaren Brown, the
English manager of the C.P.R., something about these Women&rsquo;s
Clubs, but the one at Victoria was my first experience of them;
here I first learned to appreciate Canadian women in their
marvellous life of intellect and of activity; and this appreciation
grew into real admiration. You cannot find anywhere, women more
versatile, more competent in anything they give their mind to,
either in their home or in their intellectual life. They are just
as splendid in the quiet and efficient management of their home as
they are in the conduct of any business they might be engaged in,
or in any artistic or literary pursuit. Here&rsquo;s to the women
of Canada! My unqualified admiration to them, and may God bless
them and give them joy and prosperity all the days of their
life.</p>

<p>Well! I had the honour to meet three hundred of them at
Victoria, British Columbia. The time after luncheon was fixed for
my address to the members of the Club. There was rather an amusing
incident when my husband who had been one of the guests at
luncheon, accompanied me to the hall where my &lsquo;talk&rsquo;
was to take place. He was stopped at the gate and told quite
politely but very firmly that gentlemen were not admitted into the
hall. He tried to argue I know, but I did not hear the
altercation&mdash;if there was one&mdash;for I had already been
conducted to the platform and I could neither see nor hear what
went on at the door, nor did I see my husband again during the time
spent, first in my introduction to the audience by the chairman,
Miss Agnew, who said far too kind things about me, then in my
address, and finally in the usual votes of thanks. The audience was
absolutely charming to me, about my work and about the address
which they declared they had thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>It was when the bulk of the audience had left and the hall was
being cleared, that a dilapidated and very dusty black tie was
picked up from the floor and held aloft by the finder who announced
amid laughter and cheers: &ldquo;See! all that is left of poor Mr.
Barstow. He must have been torn limb from limb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day we had the pleasure of a visit from Mrs. Adams Beck
(Mrs. Barrington), the distinguished Canadian author, whose <i>The
Divine Lady</i> had delighted us all both in book form as a perfect
historical romance and also as a film which, in my humble opinion,
was admirably done.</p>

<p>In the evening we were present at a great dinner at which Mr.
Beatty president of the C.P.R. Company was the guest of honour; we
were very glad to meet him as well as Mr. Coleman, the
vice-president, whose charming wife had been so very sweet to us
ever since we first met her on our way to Banff. There were
forty-two guests at the dinner; but it was all most
<i>intim&eacute;</i> and friendly.</p>

<p>We left soon after 11 o&rsquo;clock and got on board the S.S.
<i>Princess Louise</i> on our way back to Vancouver.</p>

<p>The return journey across this glorious country which we had
already learned to love and to admire had begun.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>In Vancouver we were again the guests of those kind, hospitable
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Rogers, who I am happy to say have
remained our friends ever since, for they often came on a visit to
Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>In the evening I was asked to address a meeting of the Canadian
Women&rsquo;s Club at Vancouver Hotel. It was another unforgettable
occasion. There was a crowded hall of four hundred present, whose
kindness and enthusiastic reception of me could never be surpassed,
even in the case of far more distinguished persons than myself. The
next day we were the guests of the Canadian Authors&rsquo; Club,
where again I was asked to give an address which I did without
repeating anything I had said the day before. The company drank our
health in water and sang &ldquo;For they are jolly good
fellows&rdquo;, with much lusty cheering to follow.</p>

<p>The next day we took train for Banff and struck snow just before
Lake Louise. It seemed so strange after the warm sunny days of
British Columbia. At Banff it was quite deep, and we were greeted
at the station with many laughing &ldquo;A Merry Christmas!&rdquo;
We were childishly glad to see the snow, it looked like the real
Canada, and it was amusing to watch the girls bathing in the pool
of the hot sulphur spring in the hotel garden being pelted with
snowballs from the rising ground above.</p>

<p>Our second visit to Banff, with its luxurious Banff Springs
Hotel, only made us love it more and more. Our first walk through
the snow was to the Zoo to renew acquaintance with the darling
&lsquo;Bob Cats&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Then the long train journey back to Winnipeg, where I had an
exciting and very happy surprise. I had known before this that
there was a considerable colony of Hungarians settled in the great
middle plain of Canada. I remember Mr. Murray Gibbon telling me
that though Canada did to a certain extent discourage immigration,
she always welcomed Icelanders and Hungarians because the best
agricultural labourers came from these two countries. The news of
my odyssey across Canada had been very much spoken about in all the
local newspapers and, when it reached the ears of the Hungarians in
and around Winnipeg, a deputation of them came to meet me at the
station. They met me with music&mdash;real Hungarian music&mdash;as
the train steamed into the station and soon the music was drowned
in cheers. To any Hungarian&mdash;more especially to those from the
great plains where lie Tarna-&Ouml;rs and Tisza-Ab&aacute;d, where
most of these in Winnipeg came from, the name of Baroness Orczy the
famous authoress is as much cherished as that of . . . what shall I
say? . . . Bobbie Burns to the Scot, and I must say that the sight
of all those fine fellows in their work-a-day clothes, with their
music and their rough hands stretched out to grasp my hand gave me
a choky little feeling in my throat.</p>

<p>Here, too, we were again the guests of the Honble. and Mrs.
Rogers in their beautiful home, and at dinner that evening there
was, among the guests, a Hungarian friend of theirs, Mr.
H&oacute;dosy, whom we met again the following evening at a
delightful dinner at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Andrews and their
four lovely daughters. There were two Hungarian musicians on this
occasion who discoursed sweet music during and after dinner. And
presently they struck up a <i>Cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s</i>, and at the
request of our hostess and her guests, Mr. H&oacute;dosy and I took
the floor and danced the national Hungarian dance. I was a little
out of practice, I am afraid, as I had not danced the
<i>cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s</i> since that great evening in London
when I had the honour of being partner to H.I.R.H. the ill-fated
Archduke Rudolf of Austria. But the whole evening was delightfully
informal and great fun.</p>

<p>The next day was the great day for me. The Canadian
Women&rsquo;s Club and the Authors&rsquo; Society had jointly
organized a grand luncheon for me at the C.P.R. Hotel, at which I
had promised to give an address. There were seven hundred and fifty
guests. My address took an hour and a half and was voted a great
success; I was often interrupted by cheers and laughter. All those
present declared that it was one of the most spirited and amusing
speeches they had ever heard. Mrs. Rogers was in the chair, and I
sat next to Ralph Connor, the distinguished Canadian author of that
ever popular romance <i>The Sky Pilot</i>. He and I laughingly
decided that we would undertake a joint lecture tour one day in the
United States. Neither of us, however, had the least idea of ever
doing so.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>After that happy event we had to face a day and two nights in
the train on our way to Toronto. In spite of the beauty of the
landscape, the comfort of our drawing-room car, and the kindness
and attention bestowed on us in the dining-car, I felt very weary
and never got a wink of sleep during those thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>But we were so kindly received by friends and well-wishers in
Toronto that my heart warmed to that fine prosperous city as it had
not done on the occasion of our first visit there. The Canadian
Women&rsquo;s Club gave us a most beautiful lunch. There were over
five hundred guests, all women, with the exception of my husband
(who was not excluded from the sacred hall on this occasion) and
Dr. Locke. I had promised to give an address and this I did, and
everyone seemed very happy and all were certainly most kind and
loud in their praise and enthusiasm; the cheering when I finally
sat down was loud and prolonged. I was happy on that occasion to
have met Mrs. Fergusson, the wife of the Premier of Ontario, Lady
Poynter, and so many other charming and distinguished ladies. In
the evening we were entertained at dinner by Colonel and Mrs.
Maclean; Colonel Maclean is, with Mrs. Tyrell, co-proprietor of
<i>Macleans Magazine.</i> Mr. and Mrs. Tyrell were also at the
dinner, so were Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie&mdash;he being the editor of
the magazine. It was an altogether charming dinner party.</p>

<p>I gave two more addresses while in Toronto, one at the Canadian
Press Club, where I met Mrs. Steward of Stewart and McLellan, the
publishers and agents for Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co., and the other
at the Riverside Technical School where I had a splendid reception
and I shudder to think of the hundreds of copies of <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> which I autographed on that occasion.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>After a short leap over into the United States, where we spent
three very happy days with Mr. and Mrs. McKay&mdash;he the owner of
that fine American publication, <i>The Spur</i>&mdash;in their
charming home, Stone Crest, New Windsor, we returned to Montreal
and to the care of our munificent hosts the C.P.R. Company in the
Place Viger Hotel. In spite of an awful cold, which descended upon
me just when I least wanted it, I managed to keep my promise to
lunch at Mount Royal Hotel where a number of
&lsquo;Publicity&rsquo; gentlemen gave us both a right royal
welcome and were most appreciative of my short address which I
delivered, first in English, and then in French. The P.E.N. Club
also gave us a delightful dinner at the Ritz Carlton, where we met
Lady Drummond. The Authors&rsquo; association joined up with the
P.E.N. Club after dinner and I was asked to make a speech, which I
did. It caused much delight.</p>

<p>The weather was lovely the next day and though my wretched cold
was no better, I managed to put in a very full day. Lunch with
Colonel and Mrs. Watkins, who very kindly took us on to the Ritz
Hotel where I addressed the Women&rsquo;s Press Club (there were
only three men from McGill University present), and in the evening
we dined with Mr. and Mrs. Beardmore in their beautiful English
home on Pine, Mount Royal. Here we met Sir Robert Horne, so nice
and gay, and looking exactly like the pictures of him in the
English illustrated papers; also Sir Frederick Taylor, the jovial
and distinguished head of the Montreal Bank, whom we often met
subsequently in London.</p>

<p>The next day we went to Ottawa, where we met Lady Perley, the
wife of Sir George Perley, M.P. for the Constituency of Argenteuil
(Quebec) and until recently High Commissioner of Canada, and the
Hon. M. Burrel who was so terribly injured when the Parliament
Houses were destroyed by fire a few years previously. We were asked
to lunch at the Canadian Women&rsquo;s Club where I gave an
address, as I did later in the day at the Author&rsquo;s
Association in the Caf&eacute; Daffodil, where my husband was again
the only male creature present. This caused much amusement and I
gave a lively address. We had a very gay time there. We dined with
Sir George and Lady Perley, who were so charming to us; their
daughter and her husband were of the party. I was very tired and
was glad to get to bed early.</p>

<p>The day after that we had a very jolly lunch at the Golf Club,
Hull (Quebec), after which we left for Montreal and Quebec.</p>

<p>We were very happy to see H&ocirc;tel Frontenac again and so
many of our old C.P.R. friends. We again had the Royal suite, and
as we arrived late in the evening we were glad to renew our
impressions of all those wonderful historical associations which
meet one at every turn outside and inside the town. The Rotary Club
gave us a delightful lunch; there were some fifty or sixty guests
present, mostly French-Canadians. I gave an address in French, and
my darling husband who simply hates speaking in public was also
called upon to make a speech&mdash;also in French, of course. The
guests sang in chorus, a number of old French songs; it was very
charming, and reminded us both of the old Harrow songs on
prize-giving day.</p>

<p>The following day I was called upon to address the Canadian
Women&rsquo;s Club in the Ball Room of H&ocirc;tel Frontenac. Mrs.
Power, president of the Club, asked me to speak in English, but
somehow I wished she had not asked me to do this. I am equally at
home in either language, and somehow I had the feeling that the
English tongue was not so popular in Quebec as it might be.
However, I naturally had to defer to the wishes of the President.
There was a fairly large audience, but somehow I felt rather
chilled from the first when I faced two or three very stolid faces,
and realized that by speaking in English I was offending the French
elements in the Club. I had the feeling that there was not the same
whole-hearted loyalty as there had been in all those other Canadian
Women&rsquo;s Clubs throughout the country where the proceedings
were always started with the lusty singing of the Canadian National
Anthem, and invariably concluded with an equally lusty &ldquo;God
Save the King&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And after that day, good-bye to beautiful, glorious Canada and
the many, many friends we were lucky enough to make there, friends
we can never forget. We saw several of them now and again in Monte
Carlo or in London, but the remembrance of them all, of those
splendid Canadian women and those fine, so noble, so ardent, so
true young men, will remain with us always. We had a wonderful send
off after a jolly luncheon party with the Hon. Frank and Mrs.
Carrol. We missed dear Mr. Murray Gibbon at the last. He was
detained on serious business; but Mr. Stoles of the C.P.R. gave us
a farewell dinner and we drank to our next happy meeting in
champagne; he came with us to Shed 18, where we had to wait for the
steamer <i>Montclare.</i> I was presented with a beautiful basket
of flowers from Mr. Beatty, the president of the C.P.R., for a
friendly <i>au revoir.</i> While waiting for the steamer we saw the
most magnificent Northern Lights; the local people who were
standing there close to us declared that they had never seen finer
ones. It was an enchanting sight.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We had a rough journey homewards on the <i>Montclare</i>. Heavy
seas were our portion during the whole of the way, the waves
breaking right over deck A, but as usual everything was done for
our comfort by every employee of the C.P.R. Bless &rsquo;em! There
were only one hundred and twenty first class passengers on board,
among them a score or so of young Mormons from Utah; we were
greatly interested in them, chiefly I think because just before we
left England there had been a great deal of talk and some very
unpleasant rumours anent the activities of the Mormon Community of
Salt Lake City all over the country. Whether these were true or not
I do not know; certain it is that a number of young women had been
signalled to the police, about this time, as having left their
homes for some destination unknown. Most of my readers will no
doubt remember the trouble there was about these rumours and the
many allusions made to it, both serious and sarcastic, in
theatrical productions and music halls.</p>

<p>We saw very little of the young Mormon passengers on board the
<i>Montclare</i> because they never put in an appearance in the
dining-room whenever the sea was rough&mdash;much to the amusement
of the dining-room staff. Whether they really were going to Europe
for recruiting purposes we none of us knew.</p>

<p>Major General Sir Fabian Ware was on board: we felt so honoured
and happy to meet him, he had done such wonderful patriotic work as
Permanent Vice-Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission and
was twice mentioned in despatches (1914-1918). His interest in the
welfare of all seamen never slackened, nor did the help which he
was always ready to extend to them ever fail. He gave the best part
of his life to the cause he had so much at heart. At a concert
given one evening on board the <i>Montclare</i> in aid of the
Seamen&rsquo;s Home in Liverpool, Sir Fabian took the chair and
made an eloquent appeal for this greatly deserving charity. He
honoured me (I felt it was an honour to be associated with him in
this) by asking me to second his appeal, which I did although I
must admit that the swaying of the ship was very unpleasant; there
was a regular squall that evening. However, all went well and
between us we collected &pound;23 10s. 0d. for the Home, which was
not bad considering that there were not more than a hundred cabin
passengers (bar the Mormons who did not attend the concert) on
board.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And so &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; dear, dear Canada! God bless and
prosper you and your children always. And good-bye to our kind and
generous hosts, the C.P.R. Company, who gave us the time of our
lives and whose officials only saw the last of us at Euston after
they had seen us safely installed, luggage and all, in a taxi.
Generous and hospitable beyond what words can express: &ldquo;May
God bless and reward you,&rdquo; will be my constant prayer, for I
can do no more than say &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; with all my
heart.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29" id=

</h2>

<p>After our happy time in Canada came the happy days in Padula. It
was a lovely home in one of the most beautiful spots on earth. Le
Bon Dieu a cr&eacute;&eacute; la terre, il a sculpt&eacute;
l&rsquo; Italie (God created the world: he sculptured Italy); the
old saying was never more truly justified than in the case of this
exquisite part of Piedmont with the snow-white heights of Carrara
on the one side and the blue Gulf of Spezzia on the other, the
little bay of Lerici down below, the old castle on the rock, the
lateen-sailed little fishing boats like golden butterflies with
wings outspread skimming the placid waters; no wonder the poetic
soul of Shelley sought this heaven-moulded place wherein to dream
and to rest.</p>

<p>We loved our Padula . . . we loved it all along, even when we
began to realize that life in Italy was not what we had hoped it
would be; not what so many of our Italophile pro-fascist English
friends had so confidently predicted for us. Yes! we did love our
Padula. The villa was homely and comfortable, the garden and the
views dreams of beauty. My small household&mdash;all Italian except
for my English maid&mdash;were seemingly happy and devoted; and
very soon I had the pleasant surprise to find that in Italy my work
was almost as popular as in England. On one occasion, going to
lunch with a friend in Florence, I was amazed when the Italian
butler made me a profound bow and said: &ldquo;I salute the author
of <i>La Primula Rossa</i> (the title under which <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> is known in Italy), and a prominent officer of the
fascist militia told me that my <i>Pimpernel</i> books had roused
the enthusiasm of the young &lsquo;black-shirts&rsquo;, who looked
upon Sir Percy Blakeney as their ideal hero.</p>

<p>For the next six years after the completion of the villa we
mapped out our time by spending the autumn and spring in La Padula
in perfect quietude, the summer with dear friends in England, and
only two or three hectic months in Monte Carlo. Dear little Villa
Bijou! Thank God we were never seriously tempted to sell it,
although the offers we had for it at different times were sometimes
verging on the fantastic. There was a regular &lsquo;ramp&rsquo;
during these years for house and landed estate in the Principality
of Monaco, with its easy laws and light taxation, and Villa Bijou
was considered a unique property with its pretty garden and its
situation in the very centre of Monte Carlo; strangely enough
whenever an offer for its sale appeared more than usually tempting,
there always seemed to be something, some unseen force that held us
back and warned us not to sell. And Villa Bijou remained our
beloved home for the time being. As a matter of fact it was not in
the peaceful and poetic atmosphere of La Padula that I did my best
work at this time, but rather amidst the hectic surroundings of
social life in Monte Carlo. Wasn&rsquo;t it George Gissing who
said, in his New Grub Street, that an author is never at his best
in the tranquil air of the countryside, but rather in the turmoil
of a back street in suburban London, with the blare of a
barrel-organ coming to him through his open window and the tramp of
his fellow-lodger on the top floor over his head?</p>

<p>I have never tried the latter environment, but I see what poor
dear Gissing meant. The effort of concentrating is the breath of
life to imagination and good work. Many a pleasant talk did I have
on the subject with my dear, unforgettable friend, W. J. Lock, some
of whose finest and most poetic work was done in Cannes, where the
exigencies of social life were even more strenuous than in Monte
Carlo.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>All the same, the years which we thus spent partly in Monte
Carlo and partly in Padula were very happy ones. We were both of us
very hard at work during those years and I believe that some of my
best work was done at that time. It is universally said that an
author is never a good judge of his own work, but <i>The Scarlet
Pimpernel</i> aside, I venture to think that <i>A Spy of Napoleon,
The Uncrowned King,</i> and especially <i>No Greater Love,</i> were
three romances as interesting as any I had written before. <i>A Spy
of Napoleon</i> was considered to be one of the great successes
achieved by an entirely English film company. It was produced by
the Twickenham Film Studios at St. Margaret&rsquo;s Middlesex.</p>

<p>It was also about this time that I made a short, but as it
happened, a very successful plunge into historical biography. This
was with <i>The Turbulent Duchess</i>, the life story of H.R.H.
Marie Caroline Duchesse de Berri, the daughter-in-law of Charles X,
the last King of France. My first thought had been to weave a
romance round those troublous and convulsive times, so near really
to our own, which witnessed the final and irrevocable downfall of
the Bourbon dynasty. But soon I came to the conclusion that this
woman&rsquo;s life was so romantic and so picturesque, her
character and her actions so far beyond anything that imagination
could conceive, that I just thrust imagination into the background
and stuck to facts and nothing but facts. I simply revelled in the
writing of <i>The Turbulent Duchess</i> and, in putting together
for my purpose those various incidents of her life which were so
exciting and so colourful, I tried to keep the biography as light
and as entertaining as I could, but this was not very difficult
considering the wonderful material at my command. After a most
successful period of publication the book was taken over by the
Foyle Book Club, and it has been translated into almost every
European tongue.</p>

<p>I have so often been asked to write another historical biography
on the same lines as <i>The Turbulent Duchess,</i> but somehow I
have never been able to find another subject that fascinated me as
did the Duchesse de Berri and her madcap adventures and
vagaries.</p>

<p>Needless to say my beloved <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i> was not
allowed to rest idly during this time in the arms of his beautiful
Marguerite. He had to be up and doing; my dear loyal readers
demanded to know something more of his adventures and I naturally
felt that I must in gratitude satisfy them; and so, during one
peaceful autumn in Padula, I wrote <i>Sir Percy Hits Back.</i> This
was the sixth long romance dealing with my hero&rsquo;s adventures,
not counting two volumes of short stories originally published in
magazines. Those dear, kind readers! How I loved and blessed them;
they never seemed to tire of him or of me: nor did the
theatre-going public. Over a quarter of a century had passed away
since first he made his bow in the New Theatre, London, and hardly
a year goes by even now without a revival of the play in London, or
a tour in the large provincial towns.</p>

<p>I rather enjoyed the writing of <i>A Child of the Revolution</i>
which was published in 1932. It was a question of looking from the
inside at the gigantic cataclysm that devastated France and swept
away some of her oldest and most cherished institutions, seeing it,
I mean, from the point of view of the many intellectuals who felt
that nothing short of a complete overthrow of every one of her
time-worn traditions would make France, great once more, able to
take her place among the cultured and progressive nations of the
world. Writing that book, after serious and concentrated study of
the works of one or two of the great revolutionaries of the period,
was one of the most interesting pieces of work I ever set myself to
do. (<i>The Way of the Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, from the opposite
point of view, followed in the next year as a matter of course, and
<i>Sir Percy Leads the Band</i> three years later.)</p>

<p>It was also in the middle of one of the most brilliant seasons
in Monte Carlo that I decided to verify certain facts to be
embodied in a book I was engaged on at the time: <i>Pimpernel and
Rosemary</i>. This involved a visit to Transylvania. Transylvania
was then occupied by Roumania at the command of Adolf Hitler, and
my book dealt with that distressful period in Hungarian history.
While passing through Budapest I became acquainted&mdash;through
the intervention of my mother&rsquo;s solicitor, Dr.
Tolday&mdash;with an elderly Russian, a refugee from the recently
consolidated U.S.S.R., who had been the <i>staroshka</i> of his own
village (a <i>staroshka</i> is something rather more important than
a mayor in a Russian community) a well-educated man of obvious
integrity. He had often been in Hungary, spoke Hungarian quite
fluently, and was well-acquainted with my literary work which he
declared had given him great delight, especially everything
connected with the Scarlet Pimpernel. He had fallen on evil days,
it seems, had been dispossessed of his functions, and his property
had been confiscated. It was not difficult to guess on which
political side his sympathies tended. I was interested in the man
directly I saw him. I felt that there was something mystical about
him. He had the blue-grey eyes peculiar to Northerners, who gaze
out over and beyond ice-covered immensities and there see things on
the far distant horizon which are not revealed to those who have
darker eyes, and whose range of vision is circumscribed by
Nature&rsquo;s boundaries. Whenever I talked with him I felt that
there was something on his mind which he wanted to impart to me.
Those blue-grey eyes of his would be fixed on something that was
very far away, beyond the peaks of the Carpathians. He was looking
through the forests of pine and through the rocky heights at
something that lay beyond.</p>

<p>I met him again at the lawyer&rsquo;s office, where we were both
waiting for our interview, when quite without <i>arri&egrave;re
pens&eacute;e</i> I happened to say something about the late Tsar
and the terrible fate which had befallen him and his family, and
Dr. Tolday put in with a sigh: &ldquo;Ah! if there had been a
Scarlet Pimpernel then! . . .&rdquo; Nothing more was said at the
time, but the next morning I had a telephone call from Dr. Tolday
asking me if I would graciously receive his friend the
<i>staroshka</i>, who greatly desired an interview with me. I
acquiesced without hesitation. Little did I guess what I was
destined to hear from the lips of my mystical friend.</p>

<p>He came accompanied by a boy, obviously of the <i>moujik</i>
class, a boy with those same Northern grey-blue eyes and the same
air of mysticism as himself, and from the lips of those two there
was poured into my ears a story so extraordinary that it seemed at
first as incredible as it was stupendous.</p>

<p>At first . . . but I listened mute and enthralled. All I can say
is that to the best of my belief every event retold to me that day
by the old <i>staroshka</i> is absolutely true. The whole story was
confirmed by the young <i>moujik</i> who had played a not
unimportant part in some of those events. I only wish some of my
readers could have heard the story as it was told to me. Every word
the young peasant spoke bore the impress of truth, and one felt
that he could not possibly have invented the whole thing, and given
the multiplicity of detail which could only have been gathered
together from positive knowledge.</p>

<p>I will leave it at that.</p>

<p>Into the Russian background of this amazing story I interwove a
romance after my own heart, but <i>No Greater Love</i> was not
ready for publication until 1938, and by that time so many things
had happened&mdash;so many were happening every day that I could
not help feeling that perhaps this would be the last book I would
ever offer to my beloved public. I chose the title because of its
obvious application:</p>

<p><i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends.</i>

</h2>

<p>Thinking at this moment of the past, and of those few years in
La Padula, I find it difficult to recollect at what precise moment
a vague fear that all was not well with Italy and her future took
on a definite shape in our minds. Steeped as we both were in our
work, absorbed in our art, we had never allowed our minds to dwell
on matters outside that inner world of happiness and romance which
for us was a paradise on this earth. And turning over the leaves of
old diaries I do not find in them, during those first years in
Padula, any reference to those vague fears which gradually became
more insistent: which slowly but surely refused to be suppressed.
Gradually at first. Slowly but surely.</p>

<p>Neither of us had ever been ardent admirers of Benito Mussolini,
as were so many of our English friends; we never joined in the
chorus so often raised in London social circles at that time,
especially during the period of the Great Unrest as it was called,
which culminated in the General Strike of 1926. &ldquo;Oh! if we
only had a Mussolini in England!&rdquo; Mussolini, we were told
(and at first could not help but admit), had brought order out of
chaos in post-war Italy; he had built up a strong, well-disciplined
nation out of unrestrained bands of terrorists and bandits. There
was work for everybody now; the standards of life had been
substantially raised; organizations like <i>Dopo Lavore</i> looked
to the comfort and relaxation of workers. All this was explained to
us and enlarged upon by Italian friends in every walk of life, and
if down in our village and among our outdoor staff we sometimes
heard queer mutterings, quickly suppressed, we did not pay much
attention to these, well-knowing that in this new Italy free
expression of opinion was severely punished. One could not help
knowing that much. The March on Rome with the suppression of
political violence, and the ridiculous but effective forcible
administration of overdoses of castor oil was still fresh in the
people&rsquo;s minds.</p>

<p>Our own grumblings were not of great importance . . . at first.
We kept them to ourselves, anyway. We had officially received the
promise that in accordance with Mussolini&rsquo;s own decree any
house built from the ground and completed before 1927 would be free
of taxation for twenty-five years. Houses were badly needed, and we
had built one and with the garden contributed in no small measure
to the beauty of the landscape. In 1926, however, tax-papers
demanding payment began to pour in. We protested against this
breach of faith, basing our protest on Mussolini&rsquo;s decree and
were told that the decree only applied to house-tax but that there
was tax on the land, there was the <i>focatico</i> or family
tax&mdash;whatever that may mean&mdash;there were taxes on olive
trees, tax on the containing wall between our property and the
mainroad, all of which we had to pay. There was nothing for it but
to pay and look pleasant; so that was that.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Duce&rsquo; had also in the meanwhile enacted certain
laws for the protection of workers which hit some of our English
friends who had settled down in Italy very hard: they hit us also
in a lesser degree. No employer of labour (including domestic
servants) was allowed to dismiss an employee without certain
compensations&mdash;besides the usual month&rsquo;s notice which
included one month&rsquo;s wages for every year of service&mdash;to
this, in the case of outdoor servants, there was compensation for
house, light, and fuel. It all seemed perfectly fair on the face of
it; nothing to grumble at; I only mention it because of the curious
fatality that overtook some English friends of ours domiciled in
Italy who happened to inherit from a relative some real estate in
the neighbourhood of Florence and a small legacy. The deceased had
employed an overseer on her property for the past thirty years at a
salary of 1,000 lire per month. His services after her death would
no longer be required; but in her will she left this man the sum of
30,000 lire&mdash;about &pound;2,000 at the then rate of exchange.
I forget what was the value of the whole estate bequeathed to our
friends, something quite small I know&mdash;but not only was the
30,000 lire deducted first and foremost from the
residue&mdash;which was right and proper&mdash;but as the testatrix
had not stated explicitly that that amount was in compensation for
the man&rsquo;s dismissal, our friends were made to pay him the
legal compensation over and above the 30,000 lire bequeathed to
him, namely one month&rsquo;s wages for every year of service;
this, with the bonus for house rent, light, and fuel, came to
another 45,000 lire. So there was very little, if anything, left of
our friend&rsquo;s inheritance; the overseer had got the bulk of
it. This was just a typical case.</p>

<p>The law, as I say, did not hit us very hard. Our household was
small and we had not been employers of labour in the country very
long; but the power it gave to one&rsquo;s paid servants to do
whatever they jolly well pleased is pretty obvious. If your servant
was dissatisfied with his place, or simply desired a change, all he
had to do was to make himself unpleasant. He was not going to hand
in his notice to quit. Not he; for if he did there would be no
compensation for him in the way of one month&rsquo;s wages for
every year, together with bonus for house rent, fuel, lighting and
I know not what. All he need do was to shirk work, to be as lazy,
as dishonest even as he jolly well liked, until in sheer
exasperation you sent him packing and paid whatever extortionate
demands he chose to make upon you. If you were fool enough to go to
law about the matter . . . well! the law was always on the side of
the <i>impiegato</i> as against the principal, the employee as
against the employer. But there! We were so happy in so many ways,
so what did all these pin-pricks matter? And we had such kind and
helpful friends in the British Vice-Consul, Mr. G. Stafford, and
his family. Many a happy day did we spend with them either at
Padula or in their charming apartment in the Vaile Mazzini in
Spezia, and Mr. Stafford and his son were always ready to stand
between us and the exactions of a tyrannical and Anglo-phobe
<i>podesta</i>. The whole family spoke Italian like natives; the
three sons had been educated in Italy, and to one of them who had a
literary turn of mind I gave license to translate some of my books
into Italian.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was during the autumn of 1930 that we first became
unpleasantly aware of a certain change in the atmosphere of our
small establishment. We had passed a delightful summer in different
parts of Europe; we had spent a little time in Rome, then in
Cadenabia, and with friends in Sardinia. We had motored through
Germany and witnessed the <i>Passion Play</i> in Oberammergau
(which, by the way, had been curiously disappointing), having left
our Padula household perfectly happy and contented as we thought.
But when we came back there was a change . . . an indefinable
change . . . outdoor men were grumbling and muttering louder than
was usual. The gardener complained that his underlings
wouldn&rsquo;t do any work; the underlings that they were being
overworked and so on. Our Italian chauffeur was called up for a
month&rsquo;s supplementary military service; we engaged another,
highly recommended by the <i>podesta</i> and well-known to the
local authorities. He was an excellent chauffeur, splendid
mechanic, but . . . It was only when he had been duly installed in
his cottage with wife and family that he made us understand that he
belonged to the Fascist militia, and that there were certain
obligations to which he would have to submit when called upon for
service by his superiors. He wore a black shirt and various ribbons
and decorations in proof that he stood high in the Fascist
organization.</p>

<p>Well! that again seemed a small matter. We didn&rsquo;t like the
idea of having a &lsquo;black shirt&rsquo; in our service very much
but there it was. . . . But somehow there was a change. After this
advent in La Padula it spread from the outdoor to our indoor staff;
and all through that autumn the change became more definite, not
exactly alarming, but certainly disturbing to our placid
peace-loving minds. It was in the attitude of the female servants
that the change was most apparent. They had been so happy together
before, apparently so devoted to us and to their work. The
atmosphere of La Padula had been entirely cheerful and so very
friendly: they were dear, merry, unsophisticated creatures all of
them; always laughing, ready to do anything to please us or each
other. And now everything was different; an atmosphere of suspicion
and of fear had found its ugly way into the house. One could not
help noticing it, especially when the chauffeur was about. They
followed his movements with anxious eyes. They whispered in corners
and suddenly dispersed at sound of his footsteps. There was no
getting away from it, they were frightened of him. My English maid
was of course out of all this, but she, too, was aware of the
change. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said to me,
&ldquo;Ayella&rsquo;s brother was killed by the Fascists . . . that
awful castor oil killed him . . . he was delicate. There is a black
mark against her, she thinks, and she is afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I, of course, got to hate that atmosphere of terror, those
whisperings, those furtive glances over the shoulders. And no one
dared to say anything. It all got on my nerves and my dear husband
had much ado to keep me calm and my mind free for my work. This was
the time when an unsuccessful attempt was made in Genoa on
Mussolini&rsquo;s life. A pistol shot out of a crowd assembled to
listen to one of his harangues, just grazed his nose and took a
chip off it. The perpetrator was not caught, but it was generally
affirmed that it was a woman. Some said an English woman. Certain
it is that during the night the body of a woman was discovered on
the permanent way in one of the tunnels between Genoa and Spezia.
It was said that this woman was English, but no attempt was ever
made to identify her.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>There was no longer any doubt that the Fascist r&eacute;gime as
carried on in Italy was not one that could appeal to peace-loving
liberal-minded English residents. It had become a reign or terror,
comparable only to the Terror in the days of Robespierre and the
Committee of Public Safety during the French Revolution. It was the
same system of espionage, of denunciations often based on nothing
but private spite or revenge. Wholesale arrests of men and women
one had known as quiet citizens who had always kept apart from
political discussions or any kind of political organizations were
followed by deportation to the Lipari Islands where all trace of
them, as far as their families were concerned, effectually
disappeared. A reign of terror indeed! No! oh no! we could not
stand it for long. We, as foreigners, were not in danger of course.
Not at the moment; and it was not for ourselves or perhaps for my
English maid that we were afraid, but it soon became evident that
in a way every Italian subject was in danger, and we had a dear
devoted Italian chef who had been with us for over twelve years and
had been several times in England with us; he did not wear a black
shirt, was not member of any Fascist organization, nor did he ever
enter into any political discussion with the tradespeople in
Lerici; but he was in danger and he knew it. And we knew it, too;
and the danger was aggravated&mdash;one could not help knowing
it&mdash;time after time whenever a meeting between the two
dictators Mussolini and Hitler met at Berchtesgaden, Mussolini was
taking his cue&mdash;his orders, I should say&mdash;from Hitler.
With the exception of ruthless persecution of the Jews (there were
never many Jews in Italy) the dictatorship in Italy was exactly the
same as that in Germany.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in England the Fascist R&eacute;gime had still a
number of admirers who would gladly have exchanged good old Baldwin
for a Mussolini. I remember one summer when we were in London,
seeing a procession a mile long wending its way through the streets
and into Hyde Park. They were the English Fascists, with banners
flying and the name of Oswald Mosley was loudly cheered.</p>

<p>But for us the time had come to realize definitely that our
beloved Padula had been the great mistake of our life. We had had
some lovely times there. The autumns when avenues of blue hydrangea
and crimson oleander were in full bloom, the springs when copses of
olive trees were carpeted with violets and Roman hyacinths, and at
evening when the glow of fireflies scintillated against the velvety
darkness of shrubberies were indescribably beautiful. Nature was
indeed exquisite. Only man was vile. The ambition and self-love of
one man had transformed a gentle unsophisticated nation into a
churlish, spiteful lot of sneaks&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they
were&mdash;afraid to open their mouths, afraid of their own
shadows.</p>

<p>Never had I dreamed that the day would come when we would be
thankful&mdash;both of us&mdash;to get rid of what was going to be
such a peaceful little refuge from the social duties of Monte
Carlo, the inevitable interruptions from work. Yet, so it was. In
&rsquo;33 we were lucky enough to get a good offer for La Padula.
We took it gladly. Tearfully we took leave of that lovely corner of
God&rsquo;s earth: of Lerici and its tranquil little bay; of the
fleet of fishing boats with their golden sails; of the old romantic
castle and the distant Carrara heights gleaming white against the
translucent azure of the sky. Farewell to Italy&mdash;which we were
destined never to see again&mdash;and a sad farewell to our dear,
kind friends, Vice-Consul Stafford and his charming family, who had
helped to make our sojourn in Italy a thing of unfading happy
memories.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31" id=

</h2>

<p>I &lsquo;carried on&rsquo; with my literary work and with my
books. <i>The Divine Folly</i> and <i>No Greater Love</i> (the true
and mysterious Russian romance I have spoken of before) were
published during the few last years before the war, also a
&lsquo;Pimpernel&rsquo; book, <i>Sir Percy Leads the Band,</i> a
rather gay and happy account of one of my hero&rsquo;s most
successful adventures. The last years of that decade were otherwise
quite uneventful. Social life in Monte Carlo was much too hectic
for our taste and we withdrew from it as much as we possibly could
without giving offence. All the same we enjoyed the visit into the
Baie des Anges of H.M.S. <i>Devonshire</i>, and we had the pleasure
of entertaining her officers and her men in the Villa Bijou. This
was in March &rsquo;39. During that year I wrote the bulk of my
&lsquo;positively the last Pimpernel book&rsquo;:
<i>Mam&rsquo;zelle Guillotine</i>, of which more anon. This was
published in 1940.</p>

<p>I must confess in all humility that, just as in 1913 and
&rsquo;14 we two, who were so deeply absorbed in our work and so
happy in our home life, never saw the terrifying clouds that were
gathering over the entire civilized world. I suppose you would call
it utterly stupid and childish, but as a matter of fact we foresaw
<i>nothing.</i> We may take it that we believed in the might of the
British Empire to keep at bay the snarlings of the ravenous beasts
who threatened the peace and freedom of the world, and whenever we
thought seriously on the matter of their unveiled threats and
arrogant demands, it was with a feeling of confidence in the power
of the great British Commonwealth of Nations to see that justice
was done to those who were too weak to defend themselves against
unwarrantable aggression. Yes! we were among
those&mdash;unsophisticated perhaps and childish&mdash;who had
faith that right always makes might and that our beloved country
would do her duty as she understands it.</p>

<p>There were many who thought as we did. The world had hardly got
over the horrors of 1914-1918; was it likely that any nation would
be insane enough to throw herself into another conflict, more
devastating than anything that had gone before? That was what we
and so many of us felt. In &rsquo;37, &rsquo;38, and &rsquo;39 we
spent our usual happy summer in England with dear friends in
Norfolk, in Bucks, in Lincoln, in Scotland.</p>

<p>As in England, the feeling of educated classes in France was
strong against Mussolini&rsquo;s unwarranted aggression on
Ethiopia. I think, however, that this was more because every action
of Italy and its dictator was <i>ipso facto</i> denounced as
criminal&mdash;against all the dictates of humanity, than because
of any sympathy with the cause of the Emperor Haile Sailass&eacute;
and his people. Here in Monte Carlo the opinion of my English
friends varied in accordance with their political creed, die-hard
conservatives and the obstinate admirers of Mussolini. (&ldquo;If
only we could have a Mussolini in England!&rdquo; as some of them
continued to ejaculate) and especially retired army men of high
rank raked up all the old stories of slavery, of tyranny and of
torture prevalent at the time of Roger Casement&rsquo;s
anti-slavery campaign in the Belgian Congo. I had several letters
from English friends who were enthusiastic Mussolini-ites, giving
me proofs of Haile Sailass&eacute;&rsquo;s crimes against humanity
and those of his myrmidons. Though some of these were undoubtedly
exaggerated, they were probably true, but two wrongs will never
make a right, and Mussolini and Co. could easily have found another
way of gradually civilizing those wretched Ethiopians than by
devastating their homes and enslaving their race.</p>

<p>My French friends, on the other hand, shrugged their shoulders,
made sarcastic remarks about Wilson and the League of Nations, and
dismissed the Ethiopians from their thoughts. They were far too
troubled about their own socialistic government, about Monsieur
Blum, Monsieur Daladier &amp; Co. to bother about any exotic
Emperor and his reverses.</p>

<p>Presently, however, the Czecho-Slovak question and, later the
Polish one began to loom menacingly on the political horizon and
there were unpleasant rumours of probable German aggression . . .
of likely conflict . . . of French and British intervention . . .
of war in fact . . . and there was Austria . . . and the murder of
Schussnig . . . and many other rumours, all tending one way, the
likelihood, nay! the imminence of another European war, with France
and Great Britain in the forefront of a fight for justice and the
liberty of nations and the final destruction of German militarism
and tyranny.</p>

<p>One&rsquo;s French friends no longer shrugged their shoulders,
nor did they dismiss Czecho-Slovakia and Poland and Austria from
their thoughts as they had done in the case of Ethiopia. For them
it was nearer home this time. It was Europe. But anyhow France,
they declared, was not afraid. She was ready (as she had been in
1870) to the last button on her <i>fantassins&rsquo;</i> uniforms;
even though the educated classes mistrusted their socialist
government profoundly, they had their unwavering belief and trust
in their magnificent unbeatable army and in their wonderful Maginot
line, the indestructible barrier that guarded their frontier
against the hordes of Hun aggressors.</p>

<p>No! France was not afraid, but she was anxious. Great Britain
and Italy were her Allies. She was angry with Great Britain for the
leniency with which she had insisted that Germany should be treated
and for the economic help which she had extended to her after the
Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32" id=

</h2>

<p>On our return from our usual holiday in England in September,
1938, we found Monte Carlo in a state resembling panic. Italians of
the working class, always in the majority in Monaco, were dreading
and expecting that they would be called to the colours (which they
didn&rsquo;t mean to obey) and anyhow turned out of the
Principality and sent back to their own country which to so many
who had not yet vowed allegiance to the Fascist r&eacute;gime was
equivalent to a sentence of solitary confinement in the penal
settlement of the Lipari Islands, or even of death. They ran about
the place from house to house, from villas to apartments and hotels
clamouring for what money was due to them for work done in the
past. Some of them, middle-aged men in a good way of business or in
good positions, were quite &lsquo;dithery&rsquo;. Men-servants,
charwomen, and <i>femmes de chambre</i> left hastily in a state of
terror, ignoring notice and even wages and went off somewhere, I
know not where, mostly to the Pyrenees and the Basque country, I
believe. The trains were crowded with members of religious
communities, nuns and monks fleeing to Spain. Spain and Portugal
had, in fact, become the great objectives whence England might be
reached by aeroplane (dear, hospitable England!). We all thought
that those who ran away so helter-skelter were very silly and we
wondered whether England would be willing to shelter the entire
fleeing population of Europe.</p>

<p>Then came the great day when Neville Chamberlain made his noble
and great effort for peace by journeying over to Berchtesgaden to
interview Adolph Hitler. Here in this small Principality, with its
proclaimed neutrality, and its adherence to
&lsquo;unconquerable&rsquo; France, Chamberlain was the hero of the
hour, as Sir Edward Grey had been in 1914. They were the apostles
of peace, and Great Britain as always, the protector of the rights
of the entire civilized world. Peace? Well, of course nothing but
peace could come&mdash;everyone was certain sure of that&mdash;of
this friendly meeting between two sensible statesmen who were bound
to come to an understanding as soon as they meet and could talk
over those matters which after all were only a question of
misunderstandings between two great nations, both desiring that
justice, truth, and right should prevail. When Chamberlain returned
to England, everybody in France was convinced that he carried a
Treaty of Peace between Germany and Great Britain in his
pocket.</p>

<p>It is rather amusing to remember that a memorial to Neville
Chamberlain, expressing gratitude for his strenuous efforts toward
peace by going personally to confer with Hitler at Berchtesgaden,
was got up in Monte Carlo on the initiative of my Italian chef. It
was signed by all the employees of whatever nationality, who were
in the service of English and American residents and visitors and
it was sent to the British Prime Minister, who sent a charming
letter of acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Long before this, however, relations between France and Italy
had been very strained. I don&rsquo;t mean politically and
diplomatically&mdash;possibly not; as I say the French did not
worry much over the Ethiopians, and more bitter of late, not so
much among educated people and the better classes, but it was
<i>very</i> marked in the case of workpeople, where Italians are
always in the majority in the Principality. The French looked upon
the Italians with undisguised scorn. <i>Ces Italiens</i> was as
much a term of contempt as <i>ces vagabonds</i> or <i>ces
vauriens.</i> There was more than one instance, to my own
knowledge, of French workmen refusing to work in our villa because
we had several Italian servants in the house, and all of us English
residents were &lsquo;advised&rsquo;, not to say ordered, by the
local authorities to dismiss our Italian employees. However, we at
the Villa Bijou did nothing of the sort. Like so many others we
never anticipated that Italy would turn against her former
allies.</p>

<p>In &rsquo;39 we went to England as usual, intending to end our
summer holiday at Aix-les-Bains, which we did; and here we were
when Great Britain and France declared war on Germany over the
Polish question just as both nations did in 1914 over the Belgian
one. Even before this ominous day the peaceful little holiday
resort had prepared itself for the coming conflict. All the hotels,
with the exception of one or two were commandeered and fitted up as
hospitals. Street lamps were being &lsquo;camouflaged&rsquo; for
future black-out. The kind and considerate manager of
Barclay&rsquo;s Bank, Monsieur Cascon, advised us not to deposit
our ready money in the bank but to keep it by us as a
<i>moratorium</i> was threatened, but he promised to cash our
cheques on Monte Carlo, Monaco being nominally <i>pays neutre.</i>
(We certainly hoped that this would be so, but . . .)</p>

<p>The government had already commandeered a number of cars and
chauffeurs for transport. A day or two later telegrams and
telephones were only allowed on official business, and in the
evening we &lsquo;enjoyed&rsquo; our first &lsquo;black-out&rsquo;.
There was gorgeous moonlight over the lake: but all lights had to
be out by 10:30 by order of the police, so we all went to bed by
moonlight.</p>

<p>My Jack (then at work in Lausanne) was called up, and he, with
his wife and children, came to Aix to see us on their way to
England. He was, of course, in the reserve of officers.</p>

<p>The next two days saw the hounds of war unleashed&mdash;troops
of <i>chasseurs Alpins</i> marching towards the frontier and Aix on
a regular war footing. No more English papers or letters, and on
the 5th we had our first air-raid <i>alerte</i> at 3 a.m. The
&lsquo;all clear&rsquo; sirens went an hour later. Many visitors
had already left, though a number of our friends were still here.
We, of course, wanted to get home to Monte Carlo as soon as
possible, but the difficulties of travelling had become very acute.
Trains were overcrowded, the services drastically curtailed, and we
had no car. When we sold Padula we also got rid of our Italian car
since we were not allowed to bring our Fascist chauffeur into
France, and there was every likelihood of the car being confiscated
at the frontier. As a matter of fact we had intended to buy a small
French car and engage a French chauffeur in Monte Carlo. But
somehow we never did. Time seemed to fly away so rapidly, and we
were so hard at work that we hardly ever went outside Monte Carlo
where it was so easy just to hire a car whenever we wanted one. Now
we wished we had not been so thoughtless, for to hire a car to take
us from Aix to Monte Carlo was not only difficult, it was terribly
expensive. However, it had to be done and we finally got home in
October. Lyons, and one or two other localities which we passed on
the way, had already suffered enemy bombardments.</p>

<p>In Monte Carlo most of our friends were preparing to return to
England as soon as possible. Many had the fond belief that our
government would send a ship to convey us all back to where we
wanted to go; and our American friends had the same faith in their
own government. But nothing of the sort had happened yet. There was
general talk of compulsory evacuation of the entire Mediterranean
coast, including Monaco of course, though the small Principality
stood firmly on the ground of its status of proclaimed neutrality.
A few went so far as to hire a car to take them to Portugal, with
the intention of continuing their journey homeward by &rsquo;plane.
But cars were few and prices ruinous, and so the autumn and winter
months went by in conditions of nervous anxiety for many and of
grave anxiety of another sort for me.</p>

<p>My beloved husband&rsquo;s ill-health had taken a more serious
turn. Three doctors in consultation declared that an operation was
imperative. As a long and complicated journey to England was out of
the question, they advised Switzerland, and the eminent specialist,
Niehans, at Clarens near Montreux. Thither we went in April, 1940,
and returned in the beginning of June of that fateful year.
Travelling, though very long and wearisome for an invalid, was not
otherwise difficult, as far as papers and formalities on the
frontier were concerned. We were going into a part of Switzerland
that was whole-heartedly French in sentiment and pro-English. The
<i>Gazette de Lausanne</i> and <i>Journal de Gen&egrave;ve</i>
published daily glowing accounts of the doings of our Air Force.
<i>&rdquo;Vous verrez,&rdquo;</i> doctors and nurses often said to
me, <i>&rdquo;ce sera votre R.A.F. qui gagnera la
guerre.&rdquo;</i> We know now how right was that prophecy.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>On our return to Monte Carlo we found the bulk of the English
and American colony in a state of feverish activity. To get away
from here, to get back to England somehow, but above all to get
away from this coast which would be evacuated&mdash;must be
evacuated&mdash;to the last man before the R.A.F. had done its work
of terror and destruction. That was what everybody thought . . .
and most of them feared. Forcible evacuation and internment camps
for English men, women, and children was the bugbear.</p>

<p>Two days after our arrival here the blow fell. Italy stabbed her
old allies in the back. She declared war on England and France. Now
there was real panic in Monte Carlo. I wish our British colony had
shown up a little better on this occasion, but I must reluctantly
admit that they did not. Men of British nationality in good
positions at home or those who were in official or semi-official
positions in the Principality did not set a good example of
quietude nor were they in any way helpful to the helpless and the
weak. I daresay that they were worried to death by the crowds of
panic-stricken old ladies (of both sexes) who literally besieged
them in their homes and in their offices, asking for help and
advice, but they themselves were just as scared as those who
invaded their privacy and such advice as they gave was
non-committal and varied from day to day. Sometimes they would say:
&ldquo;Go! by any means you can command, but go as soon as you can
my train, by bus, lorry, anything . . .&rdquo; At others they would
be more cautious: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. Wait and see
what happens.&rdquo; As a matter of fact they knew no more than did
the rest of the terrorized alien population and they had themselves
to think of first and foremost . . . of themselves and their
families . . . the days of altruism no longer existed; every man
for himself was the order of the day. Never shall I forget the day,
when walking along the bridge opposite Monaco railway station, I
saw a crowd of close on a thousand men and women amongst whom were
several nuns, monks and priests and a number of workmen, old ladies
of English and other nationalities, charwomen and so on, all
pushing and jostling outside the door of the booking office.</p>

<p>As for the two of us and our devoted and loyal English maid, we
kept quite calm in the midst of all this turmoil. There was no
definite news of any English ship being sent by our Government to
take us away from this danger zone, but even if there were my
beloved husband&mdash;hardly yet recovered from a serious
operation&mdash;could not have borne the voyage at all; the doctors
both in Switzerland, and that brilliant diagnostician, Dr. Van
Tricht, said the one word &ldquo;Impossible&rdquo;. So we just
remained quietly at the Villa Bijou, hoping that the evacuation
order if it ever touched the Principality would spare us if only
because of my husband&rsquo;s state of health and because of his
age.</p>

<p>Well! the evacuation order did come. Was it a blunder on the
part of some minor official or a desire on the part of local
bigwigs to get rid of all &lsquo;enemy aliens&rsquo;, or merely a
misunderstanding as between the Sovereign Prince and his ministers?
I know not. Anyway, the order was promulgated for all except the
members of the <i>defense passive,</i> which meant doctors,
certificated nurses and able-bodied stretcher-bearers&mdash;and
with the exception of course of all Mon&eacute;gasques who desired
to remain in their homes; there are about 10,000 born
Mon&eacute;gasques who can claim to be <i>enfants du pays</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> of Mon&eacute;gasque parentage for four
generations).</p>

<p>And so that was that. Already the bulk of English and American
residents and visitors had left Monte Carlo. Some had gone to
Portugal by train or car, there to await the possibility of getting
to England or America by &rsquo;plane&mdash;others were content to
get as far as Cannes where there was no talk of evacuation as yet,
and where official or semi-official rumour had it that a British
ship was due to arrive in the harbour and take all British
nationals to England. The forcible evacuation of Monaco appeared as
an official order and everybody whom it touched had to go. Italy
had declared war on France, stabbing her old ally in the back, at
the moment when the Germans had broken the Maginot Line.
Already&mdash;it was definitely asserted&mdash;the Italians were
marching on Mentone. Nice was evidently their objective; they had
always coveted it and claimed it as their inalienable
right&mdash;as they did Savoy&mdash;and the poor little
Principality of Monaco was the only way through which their army
could pass to reach that objective.</p>

<p>Our Italian chef who had served us so faithfully and devotedly
for twenty years, who never took part or even mere interest in
politics was arrested by the French police without any warning, in
just what he stood up in, and with the pistol of a gendarme held
against his side, he was brutalized as if he were a criminal. We
tried to get in touch with the Mon&eacute;gasque authorities: the
Minister of State was a personal friend, the Sovereign Prince had
often dined with us and spent many a happy evening in the Villa
Bijou, but apparently there was nothing doing. Nobody wanted to
interfere. All that we gained was an assurance that we would be
kept <i>au fait</i> as to the place where our faithful servant
would be interned, and that presently we would be allowed to send
him his clothes and parcels of various comforts. We had really no
ground for complaint. Italy was, by her own initiative, at war with
France, and the internment of Italian nationals was in accordance
with the usages of civilized warfare.</p>

<p>And the evacuation was still in force. What could we do but obey
as quietly as we could this order against which seemingly there was
no appeal. Pets could not for the most part be left behind and
separation from them were some of the saddest moments on this day
of anxiety and sorrow. (Many of them were sent to the vet to be
quietly put to sleep.) Through the activity and kindness of a
Mon&eacute;gasque shopkeeper with whom we had dealt for years we
were able to hire a car to take us to Cannes. If the eagerly
awaited British cruiser did come, and there was such accommodation
on her as would make it possible for a very sick man to travel on
her . . . well! . . . perhaps . . . perhaps . . . If not, then it
might be possible to go thence somewhere inland into the country
where one might be allowed to remain in peace. . . .</p>

<p>In Cannes the rumours about a British cruiser still persisted.
Many declared that she was already sighted. . . anyway, she was
most certainly due to arrive. . . . But nothing happened for the
next two or three days except one or two air-raids when Italian
airmen dropped a few desultory bombs on the outskirts of the city,
doing very little damage. We still had letters from England
forwarded from Villa Bijou and on Sunday an earnest and very young
Toc H priest gave us a very nice service and Holy Communion in the
English church. He preached a patriotic and enthusiastic sermon,
and we sang &lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; with hearts full to
bursting. My English maid was with us and we all felt a little bit
happier and comforted.</p>

<p>But that same afternoon came the first inkling that Belgium had
laid down her arms and that France was seeking a separate
peace.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>It was Cannes now that was seething with excitement. Crowds of
people were pouring in from everywhere into the town. The long
promised cruiser&mdash;so it was definitely asserted&mdash;would be
in Cannes the next day to take British nationals to England.
Everyone had got the jitters owing to the French collapse, but no
details about the ship were available, not even a certainty about
her nationality. Most of our friends from Monte Carlo were going on
her, including our chaplain, Canon Tupper Carey, his substitute,
and the young and warlike Toc H preacher.</p>

<p>Well! two ships did come in ready to take British nationals on
board for ? destination. They were coal boats which had discharged
their cargo in Toulon, and were chartered by a private transport
agency. They had <i>no</i> passenger cabins whatever on board and
<i>no</i> sanitary accommodation save that provided for the crew!
All day they lay in the bay: a crowd of close on a thousand persons
were huddled on the quay pushing and jostling to get on board. The
ships, with between them some eight hundred passengers, left at 10
p.m. We did not wait to see them off.</p>

<p>The Headquarters of the British Legion had asked British
subjects to register their name and address with them, in case
another homebound ship might be available, but this, they said, was
very doubtful. We tried to do this the next day, but found a crowd
nearly as big as the one that went off in the two coal boats. Here
again it was a perfect pandemonium. Some irresponsible people from
Monte Carlo put it about that though the evacuation order was not
in force there, the place was impossible; there was no gas, they
said, no water, no electricity. This we did not believe and simply
made arrangements for returning to the Villa Bijou the next
day.</p>

<p>We found Monte Carlo perfectly normal, just as we expected. The
Principality stood firmly on its claim of neutrality, which was all
to the good. We had quite a good night, lulled to sleep by the
perpetual sound of heavy guns from the Mentone side or from the sea
or both, which reminded one of the four years at Snowfield when the
sound of heavy guns over from Flanders and Picardy never ceased day
or night.</p>

<p>The next day gunfire was much louder, apparently much nearer.
The Italians were shelling Mentone, and our local forts&mdash;the
T&ecirc;te de Chien and Mont Agel just over our
heads&mdash;responded to their gunfire. Fragments of shells were
dropping about, and many who were foolish enough to leave their
homes in order to hurry to one of the very inadequate shelters
devised by the municipality were hit, though none seriously. Many
aeroplanes were overhead and gunfire went on all day and through
the night, when matters were made more unpleasant by a terrific
thunderstorm which added to the din, and a deluge of almost
tropical rain.</p>

<p>This went on until dawn when gunfire ceased. The Italians had
occupied Mentone after four days desperate resistance on the part
of the French garrison.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>On July 10th, the B.B.C. announced that the two coal boats had
arrived in England after twenty days of unspeakable misery. We were
told subsequently that the announcement was a broadcast by Mr.
Somerset Maugham, who had been one of the passengers on board, but
I heard later that it was a most realistic description of his
experiences. There had been a great shortage of water for the
wretched passengers and they had to queue up for bully-beef. One of
them had died on the way and several were so ill and their minds
became so deranged that they had to be put on shore somewhere in
Portugal, whilst most of those who arrived in England were in a
state bordering on collapse; but, as I say, I was not listening-in
when the broadcast came over the air. I did, however, hear
subsequently by letter via Portugal, from several friends who had
suffered the ordeal without any serious consequences and have been
well and happy in England ever since. Nevertheless I thanked God
with a full heart that dear Dr. Van Tricht was so dead set against
my darling husband undertaking the arduous journey at his age and
in his very serious state of health as he undoubtedly never could
have borne the strain of such an ordeal.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Then came the day of mourning for France&mdash;mourning and
humiliation. Despite France&rsquo;s solemn undertaking not to seek
a separate peace, and General de Gaulle&rsquo;s heroic appeal to
the existing self-constituted Government, armistice with Germany
and Italy was asked for and signed. Hostilities ceased half an hour
after midnight of June 25th. The glorious French army had
surrendered and had fled across France in hopeless panic and
disorder. Close on two million prisoners were in German hands,
whilst our heroic forces suffered the terrible disaster of
Dunkerque.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33" id=
"Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33</b>
</h2>

<p>It is not in any way my purpose to write even a fragmentary
account of the events that followed.* *(See <i>La
V&eacute;rit&eacute; sur l&rsquo;Armistice</i> by Albert Kammerer,
<i>Ambassadeur de France.</i>) Authors and journalists who are
competent to do this have said or are going to say, everything that
is known of this terrible period of modern French history. They
will give you all the details, for your general information, piling
fact upon fact for many years to come. All I can do in my humble
way is to relate such events as affected our private life here and
that of our friends who were situated as we were&mdash;enemy aliens
in so-called neutral, but actually occupied, territory during the
first few years of the war.</p>

<p>The Germans now occupied the whole of France. They met with no
opposition. The self-constituted French Government, such as it was,
had, by command of the Germans, removed from Paris to Vichy with
Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain as <i>Chef de l&rsquo;Etat</i> and
Monsieur Laval as Prime Minister; P&eacute;tain the defeatist and
Laval the paid servant of Germany, P&eacute;tain whom the venal
Press in the pay of Hitler proclaimed the &lsquo;defender of
Verdun&rsquo; to whom Cl&eacute;menceau, then Prime Minister, had
put the question in 1917 when it looked as if heroic Verdun could
hold out no longer: &ldquo;What can we do now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask
for an Armistice,&rdquo; had been P&eacute;tain&rsquo;s reply.
Cl&eacute;menceau then sent for Foch and asked him the same
question: &ldquo;What can we do now&rdquo;
<i>&rdquo;Combattre,&rdquo;</i> was Foch&rsquo;s reply;
&ldquo;<i>toujours et encore combattre,&rdquo;</i> and it was Foch
who was the heroic defender of Verdun, and not P&eacute;tain the
defeatist.</p>

<p>Be that as it many, active German propaganda organized in France
by Laval and his clique made a tin-god of poor old P&eacute;tain.
He went about the country patting little children on the head, and
receiving bouquets and kisses from pretty girls, until he really
thought himself the hero that Laval and Co. proclaimed him to be.
And that propaganda was quite active and in a way efficient.
Photographs of the &lsquo;hero of Verdun&rsquo; were displayed in
the shop windows (some of them) decorated with tricolour ribbons.
That noble and patriotic soldier, General de Gaulle had indeed
raised his voice denouncing the treachery perpetrated against
France by the ignoble armistice brought about by German money and
fed by German propaganda.</p>

<p>The Press&mdash;such as it was&mdash;was both mealy-mouthed and
venal, and demonstrated without fear of contradiction that the true
welfare of France lay in close collaboration with Germany until the
final defeat of the Allies. The word Allies always appeared in the
Press in inverted commas those days: this, I suppose, was by way of
expressing contempt for &lsquo;the military idiots&rsquo; who were
opposed to the invincible might of Germany. To us it seemed
perfectly monstrous that such a vast number of better class and
presumably highly educated French men and women were
<i>collaborationistes</i>, as that infamous party came to be
called. In friendly collaboration with Germany (otherwise licking
the German boots) lay, according to them, the true salvation of
France. Here in Monte Carlo a certain number of our one-time French
friends would no longer speak to us. Americans who were not yet in
the war were tolerated, but we British were simply taboo.</p>

<p>The Italians had stayed their advance after Mentone, but they
had occupied the whole of Savoy. They sent a commission down to the
internment camp at Saint Cyprien where their nationals (including
my poor chef) were kept in durance by the French. Their liberation
was at once effected by their order and our loyal servant was
restored to us, much to our joy. He had had a terrible time in camp
and even his robust constitution had greatly suffered from
privations and cruel treatment and lack of food and shelter.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The few of us who were still here were left very much to
ourselves. We were not molested in any way, but we were
unofficially advised not to speak English in the streets, and not
to meet in restaurants more than four of us at one table. We were
also advised not to cross the frontier into France. But there was
no definite order about this and many went over day after day to
some favourite restaurant in Beausoleile where meals were decidedly
cheaper than in Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>The question of money began to loom unpleasantly ahead by now
for some of us, I am afraid. I am speaking of 1941. Our money at
home had been blocked for close on two years and many were driven
to selling little bits of jewellery to meet necessary expenses. But
I want to put it on the record that the Mon&eacute;gasque
Government was most kind and considerate to us Britishers and
repeatedly assured us that we were under its protection and could
count on its help in case of distress.</p>

<p>I think we all of us felt that this sensation of being
&lsquo;cut off&rsquo; from everything at home was more cruel to
bear than anything else. English and American papers were no longer
allowed to come through the post, and very soon even Swiss ones
failed us. Just for a few months the Press Department of our
Legation at Berne succeeded in getting some papers through to some
of us with &lsquo;British news and comments&rsquo;, but the French
censor soon put a stop to these. And all we had by way of news in
German controlled papers, was a welter of ridiculous lies and
garbled versions of what was going on in Egypt and in Greece. And
thus we were kept in complete ignorance of what the
French&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the Laval-P&eacute;tain clique were up to,
and what they meant to do. Would they end by turning definitely
against us and signing a treaty of alliance with Germany and Italy
and declaring war against England or what? Impossible to know. One
thing was certain, the <i>collaborationistes</i> were getting more
and more numerous, and hatred of the British was fanned to
devouring flames by the local papers, dirty rags all under German
control. There was the incident of Mers-el-Kebir, and that of
Dakar, and after a time the bombardments of French factories which
were manufacturing war material for the Germans. Every man and many
youngish women of whatever nationality living on this coast were
forced into <i>travail obligatoire</i> either at home or in Germany
under pain of . . . what? Death sometimes . And what could a man do
but submit when he had wife and children dependent upon him for
daily bread? German factories were set up all over France and our
brave R.A.F. were out to destroy them. But this brought many deaths
in its train, mourning and wide-spread sorrow, and the
<i>collaborationiste</i> Press saw to it that hatred of the English
grew into a passion for revenge. On August 13th, 1940,
<i>L&rsquo;Eclaireur de Nice,</i> the leading newspaper on the
Riviera published an article by its editor entitled
<i>&rdquo;Responsabilit&eacute;s Britanniques&rdquo;.</i> It is too
long for me to quote it <i>in extenso,</i> But a few extracts will
go to prove how intense was the hatred of the French for England
and everything English at this time. True, German propaganda was at
the back of it all, but it must be admitted that its seeds fell on
very willing&mdash;or shall I say well prepared?&mdash;ground.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One must recognize,&rdquo; the article declared,
&ldquo;that French instinct was never in favour of an alliance with
England. . . . It was just a political manuvre . . . one only need
recollect events like the Boer War and the incident of Fashoda or
St. Helena, or Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc. . . . With all of us who
remember 1914 - 1918 the memory of English egoism and our
army&rsquo;s contempt for English military ineptitude is still very
much alive. . . . At last we can speak openly of the tortuous ways
by which English politicians dragged France into war in 1939. . . .
But worst of all was the cowardly desertion of the British Army,
which fled to Dunkerque and to England, leaving us all alone to
fight the battle of France which began on June 5th when the German
army broke through the Maginot Line . . .&rdquo; and so on and so
on <i>ad lib.</i></p>

<p>But how intolerable was the sensation of living and constantly
rubbing shoulders with those who hated us, and our country so
virulently, and wrote and published such abominable lies.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>In the midst of all this trouble and anxiety I nevertheless
succeeded in completing my romance <i>Pride of Race,</i> which I
had begun in the winter of 1939-40, and for the publication of
which I had some time ago signed a contract with Messrs. Hodder and
Stoughton. There seemed to be the greatest
difficulty&mdash;<i>impossibility</i>, the post office here told
us&mdash;to send any typescript or MS. over to England. Luckily for
me a kind American friend, Commander Beehler of the U.S.
Navy&mdash;who still held his appointment here in the International
Hydrographic Bureau&mdash;suggested my entrusting the typescript to
him. The Bureau being International and America was still
non-belligerent then, and was in touch with the U.S.A.; and many
official papers and documents were still being sent over regularly,
and the Commander most kindly sent <i>Price of Race</i> along with
the next batch of documents to Washington from whence&mdash;he
assured me&mdash;it would be forwarded to London. And it was.</p>

<p><i>Pride of Race</i> was published in 1942. At first our
Government would not permit the publication of the book on the
ground of &lsquo;trading with a resident in enemy occupied
territory&rsquo;, but that kindest of friends, Lord Plender, put in
a word for me, and the ban was lifted.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>On August 11th we had at last the joy and comfort of a service
in our little church here. The chaplain of Beaulieu-sur-Mer, came
over and gave us Holy Communion for which our very diminished
English and American colonies were most grateful. Our faithful
organist, Capt. Welton, was still here and three or four ladies
sang the hymns lustily. But we were not allowed to sing &lsquo;God
Save the King&rsquo; in our little church. Every one of the English
chaplains on the Riviera from Mentone to Marseilles had gone away.
The only one who remained to look after our spiritual welfare, to
visit us if we were sick or to bury us when we died, was the
chaplain of Beaulieu-sur-mer, an elderly man who stuck to his post
and kept the flag of St. George flying. Travelling from one place
to another was always very difficult, and he had only one pair of
legs wherewith to do the journey, but he did it, as often as he
possibly could, going to Nice one day, to us another, to Vence, and
even as far as Cannes. In every case he had to make a start at 5
a.m. because there was only one train in the morning either way to
take him whither he wanted to go, and only one later in the day to
take him home again. The journey never took less than one hour. He
visited the sick and buried the dead whenever he was asked to come,
which was not infrequently. He came in all weathers, always in
crowded trains or auto-cars, sometimes obliged to stand all the
way, often having to wait in rain or snow for a &rsquo;bus that was
half an hour or even an hour late; he was over seventy years of
age. What an example of fortitude, of simple faith and spirit of
self-sacrifice! We were all of us very very grateful. There were
between eighty and ninety of us in Monte Carlo who supported him in
every way we could, and rather more in Nice and Cannes; but in his
chaplaincy of Beaulieu the English and American colony had dwindled
down to less than twenty.</p>

<p>Our own little set was also getting thinned out gradually. Week
by week one or other small party, able to afford the expense,
succeeded in getting through to Portugal by car, and ultimately got
to England by &rsquo;plane. One or two letters from them got
through by air, but many kind messages were never delivered. The
state of my darling&rsquo;s health made it quite impossible for us
to attempt the journey, and so, gradually but inevitably, we were
more and more definitely cut off from our friends in England, and
from everything English. This being &lsquo;cut off&rsquo; we both
found very hard to bear. It would have been much more so but for
the fact that there were two of us to bear it together. And we
still had our work. My husband, ill as he was, was always at his
beloved easel while the light lasted and I made a start on a new
book. A friend in Switzerland sent us English papers from time to
time&mdash;a month old, but still very welcome. Then one day
letters began do drop in via the Geneva Red Cross. Only messages of
not more than twenty-five words were allowed, but they were a boon
nevertheless.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>This state of affairs went on for a little while until food
became short. Milk, sugar, and cheese were scarce, and the bread
almost uneatable. There were queues in the market where often many
were &lsquo;sent empty away&rsquo;. My chef had to run all over the
town before he could get a few potatoes and a little piece of tough
meat. Bread rations were cut down to a minimum, and there were many
days when we could get no butter at all. Black market was now in
full swing and prices for such luxuriesas potatoes, butter, flour,
and so on, soared to impossible heights. Tea and pure coffee soon
became the sole prerogative of the rich. Good food&mdash;and plenty
of it&mdash;could always be got at certain restaurants which dealt
with the black market and charged their customers accordingly.
There were a number of rich French families living in Monte Carlo
now who had sought safety for themselves and security for their
money in the Principality, and there were a few old ladies of
British or American nationality who could afford to pay fancy
prices for their food; they entertained their friends lavishly at
luncheon or tea, and enjoyed life morning, noon, and night.</p>

<p>But we kept clear of all that social circle, nor did we worry
much about food. Our faithful chef did all he could for us, and
that was that. Somehow our hearts were too heavy to join in with
all the gaiety that found its vent in cocktail parties, in
champagne and in expensive luncheons. We played bridge now and then
by way of relaxation, and we liked sitting out of doors at the
Caf&eacute; de Paris, listening to little Lartigot&rsquo;s
excellent band playing for our special edification and at our
special request, the old tunes that we loved.</p>

<p>Dear friends in Switzerland or Portugal sent us parcels of food
from time to time: sardines, a bit of cheese, a little bacon, or
some tinned vegetables. This had been quite easy at first, but soon
the Swiss and the Portuguese Governments would not allow foodstuffs
to be sent out of their country except to their own nationals. I
had rather a curious&mdash;but oh! so kind&mdash;letter from the
<i>Unitarian Comit&eacute; de Secours</i> of Boston, U.S.A., an
institution quite unknown to me. The <i>Comit&eacute;</i> informed
that they were sending me the sum of 215 francs (equal to about
25s.), and that they would continue to send me a like sum every
month for my personal use. How this came about I have not the
slightest idea. I was not even a member of their community, but
wasn&rsquo;t it most wonderfully kind? And for the next few months
not only did the 215 francs turn up quite regularly but sometimes
it was accompanied by a present of chocolate or dried fruit, until
America became a belligerent, when all their money was at once
blocked as ours had been all along. But those letters and small
parcels that came to me from unknown and kind hands will always
dwell in my memory as something lovable and very beautiful I hope
the <i>Comit&eacute;</i> received all my letters of grateful thanks
which I sent by way of the Geneva Red Cross.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>A few letters were still coming through then from England via
Switzerland and Portugal, but they were two or even three months
old for the most part, and had been often cut about by the ruthless
scissors of the French Censor, pieces of the letters being cut
right out, even though everyone, both here and there, was most
careful not to say anything that might ruffle that autocratic
gentleman&rsquo;s placidity. So we did know a little of what was
happening. And there were still the Swiss papers now and again.
They told us many things.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>One piece of luck did come our way, however. Our radios were not
confiscated, and there was no order against listening in. It was
our great joy during these sad and lonely months. The radio calling
to us from London: &ldquo;This is London calling in the afternoon
edition of the B.B.C. London calling Europe. And here is the news
from the battle fronts.&rdquo; And one had the great satisfaction
that at any rate one was hearing was the <i>Truth</i>. Not
<i>all</i> the truth perhaps: there was much that was
withheld&mdash;but the Truth nevertheless. We heard all about the
Egyptian campaign, about victorious Wavell, about Tobruk and
Benghazi, and about the sad days in Greece.</p>

<p>We heard Winston Churchill&rsquo;s wonderful speeches which
always put heart into us even when he warned us against undue
optimism, even when he talked of distant 1944 and &rsquo;45 as the
earliest possible end of the war. And we heard that lovely message
which President Roosevelt sent to Winston Churchill when Great
Britain was left to fight all alone&mdash;for a whole
year&mdash;against that stupendous German army which had been in
preparation for twenty years and which had already subjugated
nearly the whole of Europe and enslaved her populations. America,
as we knew, was not yet ready to enter the war, but we had her
moral support. She was our friend. She trusted us. She believed in
us to the extent of looking upon us as the bulwark guarding her and
all those nations who thirsted for liberty and peace, against the
whole might of German military aggression. Thus we were lucky
enough to hear President Roosevelt&rsquo;s lovely message to Great
Britain in which he quoted Longfellow&rsquo;s lines:</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Sail on, O ship of State!<br>
Sail on, O Union strong and great.<br>
Humanity with all its fears,<br>
With all its hopes of future years<br>
Is hanging breathless on thy fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One felt that Longfellow, when he penned those words (on the
occasion of the launching of a ship) had actually in his mind a
great country like ours, fighting all alone, with &lsquo;humanity
hanging breathless on her fate&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And then came to us over the air those marvellous words spoken
by Winston Churchill to America when her President had said
definitely that she was not quite ready to enter the war but that
the whole of the U.S.A. was at work heart and soul to provide her
brave ally with all the material she required for carrying on.
&ldquo;Give us the tools,&rdquo; was Winston Churchill&rsquo;s
simple reply; &ldquo;and we will finish the job.&rdquo; And we did.
And I think&mdash;so will all the world one day&mdash;that those
few words were the most wonderful expression of undaunted courage
and devotion ever spoken by any statesman at a moment of crisis
such as the one Great Britain was then facing all alone.</p>

<p>Yes! We had wonderful compensations as against all the thinly
veiled hatred that surrounded us. Looking through a few old files
one day I came across that beautiful article entitled
&lsquo;England is Herself again&rsquo;, by Louis Bromfield, the
great American novelist, in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of December
30th, 1931. It gave me a lovely feeling of warmth in my heart, for
it seemed almost as if it had been written only yesterday. The
author was home from a visit to England and this is one of the
impressions which he put on record in that delightful article. He
called it: &lsquo;Greatness never lost&rsquo;, and went on to
say:</p>

<p class="note">For one individual who, like almost everyone has
again and again despaired of the world during these after-war
years, the visit to England was an exciting experience. I went away
taking with me some of the faith I found there. No matter whether
one is French or American, Russian or Turk, Chinese or Armenian, it
is good to believe that so great a nation as England with her
virtues and even with her faults shall not be lost for the World. I
left England knowing that she would have dignity and peace again.
Her greatness she has never lost.</p>

<p>The whole of the article was on these same beautiful lines. Yes!
there were compensations; but oh! the weariness of those months and
years!</p>

<p>In 1943 we were unduly shaken out of that quietude and that
awful feeling of uncertainty as to the future which had begun to
pall. The Italians marched into the Principality. They occupied the
whole of the Riviera at the command of their senior partner:
Germany. They came, very pleased with their mission and with
themselves. At once they made their presence felt. They were the
Fascist military authorities in occupation; theirs the power to
command, to enforce any regulations they chose to make. They
strutted about like turkey-cocks in a farmyard.</p>

<p>They began operations by summoning all foreigners of either sex
and less than seventy-five years of age to appear before them at
the Beaux Arts Theatre. Of course we all &lsquo;appeared&rsquo; at
the appointed time and the theatre was crammed with men, women and
children of every nationality. For a whole hour we sat facing the
stage, on which were three chairs, a table, a carafe of water and a
glass. The military authorities did not condescend to be punctual.
After sixty-five minutes of weary waiting a gentleman in gorgeous
field-grey uniform, his manly bosom a regular picture postcard of
ribbons, crosses, and medals stalked in, followed by an orderly and
a civilian who, we understood, was the interpreter. The gorgeous
gentleman spoke in Italian and the civilian interpreted.</p>

<p>We could not interfere in any way with the military authorities
whatever they chose to do. Any interference would be severely
punished . . . imprisonment . . . exile . . . death even. Well, it
was soon clear what the military authorities chose to do. Wholesale
arrests. The poor Jews first&mdash;the rich ones somehow seemed to
be immune. In the Principality (still supposedly neutral) they were
safe for the time being, but the poorer ones were living just a
yard or two over the border, <i>i.e.</i> in France. The
Italians&mdash;under pressure from Germany one could
suppose&mdash;had suddenly developed violent anti-Semitic
tendencies. Those wretched people were hauled out of their beds in
the middle of the night, the aged, the sick, the dying, not allowed
to pick up as much as a tooth-brush, bundled into lories, driven
away like cattle&mdash;whither? who could tell? Children dragged
away from their mother&rsquo;s arms, husbands from their wives;
child-bearing women. . . .</p>

<p>We in Monte Carlo were happily left in comparative peace and I
was able to do some work, <i>i.e.</i> to finish my latest romance,
<i>Will-o-the-Wisp</i> which had been contracted for by Messrs.
Hutchinson before the war. Naturally there was no chance of the MS.
or typescript being sent over to England. So I put my
<i>Will-o-the-Wisp</i> away, hoping for those happy times which
were so long in coming and I was left wondering if I would ever
write a romance again.</p>

<p>After the Jews it was the turn of the British and one or two
Americans. The American Army had landed in Morocco. They were now
belligerents, always our friends but now our allies, fighting with
us and at one with us. All of us were threatened with internment or
at least with exile in what was called <i>r&eacute;sidence
forc&eacute;e</i> somewhere in the hinterland of the Mediterranean
coast. But it always meant the breaking up of a home, leaving all
precious possessions at the mercy of one knew not what, of looting,
rioting, German terrorism. I didn&rsquo;t think that I had anything
to fear for myself or for my English maid, Julia Purkis, who was
under fifty, my loyal and devoted companion in the midst of all the
sorrow that was slowly but surely closing in about me now. I
interviewed the &lsquo;Military&rsquo; authorities till I was sick
with fatigue and with the shame of being such a humble and
persistent suppliant. I put my case before them: my age, the state
of my husband&rsquo;s health&mdash;which was becoming very
precarious&mdash;my dependence on the companionship of the one
woman who understood my anxiety and foresaw the inevitable. The
&lsquo;Authorities&rsquo; were most suave and mealy-mouthed. The
young officers knew me well by name. They had read and admired my
books. <i>&rdquo;Mais non, Madame la Baronne,&rdquo;</i> they said
<i>&rdquo;on ne vous l&rsquo;enl&eacute;vera pas&rdquo;</i> (We
won&rsquo;t take her away from you).</p>

<p>Every ten days or so representatives of the Fascist
authorities&mdash;an officer and two orderlies&mdash;called upon
me, questioned me, interviewed Julia Purkis, put ridiculous
questions to her: Who were her friends? With whom did she consort?
Where and in what way did she spend her time? The officer conducted
the interrogation, and the orderlies made notes in their books.
After a quarter of an hour of this they went away, still saying
suavely: <i>&rdquo;Ne craignez rien, Madame, on ne va pas vous
l&rsquo;enlever&rdquo;</i> (Do not fear, Madame, we will not take
her away from you).</p>

<p>Soon after this came the order from the Fascist military
authorities for all British nationals resident in France to clear
out of the Riviera. This affected our temporary chaplain of
Beaulieu, who was so devoted to us and to our Church; and also his
wife; also several friends who had homes in Mentone or Cap
d&rsquo;Ail or Beausoleil. They were given twenty-four hours in
which to pack up and go. This meant more breaking up of English
homes. Most of those thus evacuated went to Grenoble, which was
soon crowded with refugees. But there were others&mdash;married
couples, British families with little children who were sent into
<i>r&eacute;sidence forc&eacute;e</i>, or to somewhere in the
hinterland of the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>Some were sent to Vence, others to St. Martin V&eacute;subie;
but there were many men of British nationality who were relegated
to a prison camp. One or two Americans, among these my kind friend,
Commander Beehler, still holding his post as American
representative in the International Hydrographic Bureau. Outwardly
a hale and hearty man, a delightful musician, a charming, helpful
friend with a devoted young wife, he was a sufferer from
tuberculosis, not yet in a serious way, but needing care, and rest.
The Italian military authorities arrested him, hauled him out of
bed in the night in mid-winter and dragged him away in an open
lorry to a prison camp in Sospel, where he died within thirty-six
hours of his arrest from exposure and want of medical
attendance.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Younger people and others who were in good health had no cause
to grumble at <i>r&eacute;sidence forc&eacute;e.</i> St Martin
V&eacute;subie&mdash;up in the mountains&mdash;was really a
beautiful spot, very healthy, and there was good accommodation to
be had in one or two hotels, rather primitive, but clean on the
whole and even the chance of renting a cottage or a small
apartment. Of course everyone there was under supervision&mdash;in
a sense they were prisoners&mdash;they had to report to the
military commandant twice a day and were not allowed to wander out
beyond a very circumscribed limit. On the whole those who were
lucky enough to have a little bit of money did not have a bad time.
They played bridgeand had tea parties among themselves. But there
was a large cosmopolitan Jewish population there, very poor and
with a lot of children, trying to make the best of their miserable
lot and living in perpetual fear that German occupation would
follow the Italian. The latter did not seem to have been specially
unkind to them there, but the poor wretches knew quite well what
their fate would be once the Germans occupied the whole of
France.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Early in 1943 the light went out of my life. My darling passed
away and I was left in darkness and alone.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Epilogue" id=
"Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</b>
</h2>

<p>Then came the end of everything that for close on half a century
had meant the very breath of life to me, and all I felt that I
could do was to trail my spirit along like a bit of drift-wood
tossed about by the torrent of existing circumstances.</p>

<p>The war went on. Men, women, even children suffered as much as I
did. I know that . . . and I was sorry&mdash;oh! ever so sorry for
them . . . for nothing, not even sorrow seemed real to me during
those weeks, those months, those years that I supposed went on as
before . . . for time does not stand still.</p>

<p>Only two events during the next two years reached my
consciousness. I mean that I knew that they happened. One was the
arrest of my devoted English maid, Julia Purkis, my constant
companion who knew and who understood everything. In spite of the
many mealy-mouthed assurances that I had received from the Italian
Commando then in occupation, she was sent to Barcelonette in the
Basses Alpes, a twenty-four hours&rsquo; journey from Monte Carlo.
And then began my weekly pilgrimage up to Castelleretto, the G.H.Q.
of the Italian Army of Occupation on the heights above Monte Carlo,
in order to beg almost on my knees for the release of the one
companion in my loneliness. Let me admit at once that the Colonel
Commanding and all his officers were always full of kindness and
consideration for me. They knew me well by reputation, knew and
loved my books, would feel happy they said, if I presented each of
them with an autographed copy of <i>La Primula Rossa.</i> They
assured me that they were doing their utmost to obtain the release
of Miss Julia Purkis, for Captain Matteotti had himself journeyed
expressly to Rome for this purpose, for permission had to come from
Rome, and so on. So kind, so friendly always, and already then so
entirely pro-British.</p>

<p>Of Mussolini and the Fascist party, never a word, and already
one felt that Italy was learning her lesson, and was ready to make
amends for her adherence to the Axis Party, the enemies of
civilization and of liberty.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The second event which reached my consciousness&mdash;it could
not very well fail to do so&mdash;was the bombardment of Monte
Carlo. The bubble of the status of Monaco as a neutral state had
soon burst as soap bubbles are apt to do and the Germans occupied
the little Principality, turning every available locality into
armament works or ammunition dumps and forcing the population to
work for them both with their hands and with their brains in the
way of propaganda for a friendly <i>entente</i> with the army of
occupation.</p>

<p>The young women&mdash;heaven forgive them&mdash;were only too
ready to bring about this friendly <i>entente</i> with the German
soldiers as they had been with the Italians and learned to say
<i>Guten Tag</i> with as broad a smile as they had said <i>Bon
Giorno</i> before, and a large portion of the male population
worked in the local factory (once a brewery, now armament works).
But there were those valiant Frenchmen who braved arrest, possible
torture, and death and joined the maquis, the clandestine army,
ready to fight to the last for the liberation of their country from
those abominable Nazis. Well! subsequent events culminating in the
triumph of the Allied Forces proved the might and valour of this
nucleus of the mighty French Army, led by that great patriot
General de Gaulle. But in the meanwhile the Germans had ousted the
Italians from their comfortable quarters in Monte Carlo and took
their place in the occupation of the Principality, and our R.A.F.
were untiring in their efforts to make that occupation untenable.
The systematic bombing of Monaco went on throughout the summer of
1944. The damage caused was incalculable. Those of my readers who
know Monte Carlo will remember the Post Office and the
Etablissement Thermal and also the huge establishment &ldquo;Aux
Dames de France&rdquo; with the big garage in the rear and the
shops in the Rue Grimaldi. The Post Office and the Etablissement
Thermal, the latter with its marble staircases and bathing
amenities, were pounded into fragments of stone and marble chips
and a welter of twisted iron girders and derelict motor-cars,
whilst in the whole avenue and the Rue Grimaldi not a pane of glass
remained in shop or caf&eacute; window.</p>

<p>A small flotilla of German ships was in occupation of the port.
One of these when making for shelter in Monaco harbour was
torpedoed by one of our submarines. Its fragments were projected a
hundred feet in the air behind and above the Hermitage Hotel, and
finally deposited themselves in my garden. The damage in the garden
was devastating, but I did not realize that one piece had fallen on
my room until the middle of the night when a shower of rain came
through on to my bed. Temporary and inadequate repair was hastily
effected, but the bombardment of Monte Carlo went on day and night
after that. My small staff was wonderfully brave, and if they felt
&lsquo;panicky&rsquo; at all they tried not to show it.</p>

<p>At midnight on August 14th - 15th, a couple of bombs from our
R.A.F. once again damaged my roof. Both my English maid and I slept
on the top floor immediately below the corner where a bomb
exploded. We escaped death by a miracle, to the astonishment of the
architect who was sent by the Government to assess the damage done
to my house. As a matter of fact the villa, built some ninety years
ago, stood firm and solid&mdash;its walls are of stone, even the
inside ones are two feet thick, but they still bear the honourable
scars of that midnight attack.</p>

<p>It is rather amusing to put it on record that the morning after,
the commanding German Officer rang my bell and enquired whether
&ldquo;the Baroness had not been too frightened by the bombardment,
and was well.&rdquo; As the Americans would say: &ldquo;Can you
beat it?&rdquo;</p>
