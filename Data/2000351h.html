  <p>M. Legros, tailor-in-chief to His Majesty Louis XIV and to the Court of
    Paris and Versailles, bowed himself out of the room; with back bent nearly
    double, and knees trembling in the effort, he receded towards the door even
    whilst Monseigneur the Archbishop spoke a final and encouraging benediction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear, my good Monsieur Legros,&rdquo; pronounced Monseigneur
    with urbane kindness; &ldquo;your affairs shall come under the special notice
    of the Holy Father. Be of good cheer, right and justice are on your side.
    Solemn vows cannot be flouted even in these days of godlessness. Go in peace,
    my son; you are dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if the Holy Father&mdash;hem&mdash;I mean if Monseigneur would
    take cognizance of the fact&mdash;hem&mdash;that I will place&mdash;&rdquo; stammered
    M. Legros with some confusion. &ldquo;I mean, Monseigneur&mdash;that is&mdash;I
    am a man of substance&mdash;and if the sum of fifty thousand francs&mdash;or&mdash;or
    a hundred thousand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my son, what would you suggest?&rdquo; quoth Monseigneur with
    a slight lifting of elegantly-arched brows. &ldquo;The thought of money doth
    not enter into the decrees of the Holy Father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said M. Legros with
    ever-growing confusion. &ldquo;I only thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you thought, my son, of pleasing God by the bestowal of alms in
    these days of licentiousness and of evil luxury, then by all means do so
    in accordance with your substance&mdash;I will see to the proper distribution
    of those alms, good Master Legros&mdash;the two hundred thousand francs you
    speak of shall be worthily bestowed, our promise thereon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Legros did not think of protesting. The sum mentioned by Monseigneur
    was a heavy one in these days, when the working and trading classes had but
    little left for their own pleasures once the tax collector had passed their
    way. But the worthy tailor had made no idle boast when he said that he was
    a man of substance; he was well able to pay a goodly sum for the gratification
    of his most cherished desire.</p>
  <p>He received his final cong&eacute; almost on his knees, then he disappeared
    through the doorway. Lacqueys to the right of him, lacqueys to the left of
    him, lacqueys all the way along the carpeted stairs down to the massive front
    door, formed a living avenue through which M. Legros now passed with his
    back not yet fully straightened out after its many humble curvatures.</p>
  <p>Soon he reached the narrow, ill-ventilated street on which gave the great
    gates of Monseigneur the Archbishop&rsquo;s palace. Instinctively M. Legros
    gave a deep sigh of content and relief, inhaling the fresh autumnal air which
    could not altogether be excluded even from these close purlieus where roof
    almost met roof overhead, and evil-smelling gutters overflowed along the
    roughly-constructed pavements.</p>
  <p>The good master tailor had succeeded passing well in his momentous errand.
    Monseigneur had been overgracious, and two hundred thousand francs was after
    all only a small sum to come out of Rose Marie&rsquo;s ample marriage portion.
    M. Legros now walked with a brisk step along the right bank of the Seine,
    then crossing the Pont Neuf he found himself near the Ch&acirc;telet prison,
    and thence by narrow by-paths at his own front door in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne
    Com&eacute;die.</p>
  <p>Here he gave a sharp rap with the polished brass knocker, and within a very
    few seconds the door was opened and an anxious feminine voice hailed him
    from out the darkness of the narrow passage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh bien?&mdash;Monseigneur?&mdash;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Legros closed the door behind him with great deliberation, then he turned,
    stretched out both arms and, catching the speaker round the shoulders, imprinted
    two well-sounding kisses on a pair of fresh young cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; said the worthy bonhomme gaily, &ldquo;that Rose
    Marie, the fairest maid in France, shall be called Countess of Stowmaries
    before the year is out, for right and justice and indissoluble marriage vows
    are all on her side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A little gasp&mdash;which sounded almost like a hysterical sob&mdash;broke
    from the woman&rsquo;s throat. It seemed as if the news&mdash;evidently very
    anxiously expected&mdash;was overwhelmingly good. There was silence in the
    little passage for a moment, then the fresh voice, now quite cheerful and
    steady, said lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us go and tell maman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Together father and daughter went up the steep, slightly-winding stair which
    led to an upper story. Rose Marie, silent once more, felt as if her young
    heart would presently burst through her corselet, so rapidly did it beat
    with excitement and anticipation.</p>
  <p>She followed her father into the large, cheerful-looking room which gave
    on the first landing. Here a bright fire blazed in an open hearth; blue cotton
    curtains hung on each side of the single, narrow window, through which the
    last rays of this October day struggled faintly.</p>
  <p>A large iron stewpot, from which escaped a jet of savoury-smelling steam,
    stood invitingly upon the hob, and beside the hearth, wooden spoon in hand,
    her ample proportions carefully draped in a thick brown linen apron, stood
    Mme. Legros herself, the wife of one of the wealthiest men in the whole of
    Paris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh bien! Legros, &rsquo;tis good news then?&rdquo; she asked with
    cheerful optimism, whilst a benevolent smile shone all over her round face,
    red as an Eydam cheese and quite as shiny and greasy, for Madame had been
    cooking and she was mightily hot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The best, Maman,&rdquo; came in hilarious accents from her husband; &ldquo;our
    daughter shall be installed in her English castle before many moons are over.
    The Holy Father himself will interfere, and this&mdash;this&mdash;milor Stowmaries
    will have to obey at once&mdash;failing which &rsquo;twill be excommunication
    and nothing less than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Legros had thrown himself into the tall-backed chair, black with age
    and the smoke from many a previous stewpot, and had stretched out his legs
    before him, in order that his dutiful daughter Rose Marie might the more
    easily divest him of his high out-door boots.</p>
  <p>Kneeling before her father, she performed this little service for him with
    all the grace of loving girlhood, and he cocked his cropped head on one side
    and looked down at her with eyes in which merriment struggled with happy
    tears.</p>
  <p>She was so good to look at as she knelt thus on one knee, her fair hair&mdash;touched
    with the gold of the sun of her native Provence&mdash;falling in thick ringlets
    round her young face. She was so girlish and so pure, fresh as the hawthorn
    in May, and withal luscious to behold like a ripening fruit in June.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay!&rdquo; said M. Legros with mock gravity, as he put his
    now stockinged feet to the ground and rose with a great show of ceremony; &ldquo;this
    is no place for Madame la Comtesse of Stowmaries. She must not kneel at any
    man&rsquo;s feet, not even at those of her fond old father. Come to my arms,
    my girl,&rdquo; he added, once more resuming his seat, his voice breaking
    in the vain endeavour to seem flippant; &ldquo;sit here on my knee. Maman,
    for the Lord&rsquo;s sake put down that spoon, and sit down like a Christian
    and I&rsquo;ll tell you both all that Monseigneur said to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a happy little sigh Rose Marie jumped to her feet. Obviously her young
    heart was still too full for speech. She had said nothing, practically, since
    her first greeting to her father, since she had heard from him the good news&mdash;the
    confirmation of her hopes.</p>
  <p>Her cheeks were glowing until they quite ached with the throbbing of the
    veins beneath the delicate skin, and the palms of her hands felt cold and
    damp with suppressed nervousness and excitement.</p>
  <p>Obedient to her father&rsquo;s call, she came close to him and perched herself
    on his knee, whilst his arm sought her slender waist and clung to it with
    all the gentle firmness born of his fond paternal love, of his pride in the
    beauty and grace of his child.</p>
  <p>Mme. Legros&mdash;somewhat reluctantly&mdash;had pulled the stewpot further
    away from the fire, and put her wooden spoon aside. Then she sat down opposite
    her lord and her daughter and said blandly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Monseigneur was most affable,&rdquo; now began M. Legros, speaking
    with some pride at the recollection of his late reception in the Archbishop&rsquo;s
    palace, &ldquo;but from the first he bade me to be brief, so as I had rehearsed
    the whole scene in my mind over and over again, and knew exactly what I wished
    to say to His Greatness, I was able to put our case before him in the most
    direct, most straightforward way possible. Now if you will listen very attentively
    and not interrupt me I will tell you word for word just what passed between
    Monseigneur and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Armand,&rdquo; said Madame; &ldquo;I am burning with impatience
    and I&rsquo;ll promise not to interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As for Rose Marie, she said nothing, but from the expression in her eyes,
    it was obvious that she would listen attentively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monseigneur sat at his desk and he was pleased to tell me to be seated.
    Then he said: &lsquo;Commence, my son; I am all attention.&rsquo; He fixed
    his eyes upon me and I then began my narrative. &lsquo;My wife had a distant
    relative,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;married to an officer in the army of the
    English king. At a time of great pecuniary distress this fashionable lady
    bethought herself of her connection with the humble tailor of Paris and wrote
    to him an amiable letter suggesting a visit to his modest home.&rsquo; That
    was so, was it not, Maman?&rdquo; he asked, turning for confirmation to his
    buxom wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly so, Armand,&rdquo; she replied in assent; &ldquo;except that
    the fashionable lady was at pains not to tell us that her husband was in
    prison for debt over in England and that she herself was almost destitute&mdash;and
    to think that I was such a simpleton as not to guess at the truth when she
    arrived with her little boy, and he with his shoes all in holes and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Easy&mdash;easy, M&eacute;lanie,&rdquo;  rejoined M. Legros
    tartly. &ldquo;Am I telling you my adventures of this afternoon, or am I
    not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But of a truth thou art telling us, Armand,&rdquo; replied fat Mme.
    Legros blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I pray you to remember that I said I would not be interrupted,
    else I shall lose the thread of my narration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But thou didst ask me a question, Armand, and I did answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do not answer at such lengths, M&eacute;lanie,&rdquo; quoth
    the tailor sententiously, &ldquo;or I shall be an hour getting through my
    tale, and that savoury stew yonder will be completely spoilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harmony being thus restored under threat of so terrible a contingency, M.
    Legros now resumed his narrative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did tell Monseigneur,&rdquo; he said with reproachful emphasis, &ldquo;that
    at the time that Mistress Ang&eacute;lique Kestyon came on a visit to us
    in company with her small son, then aged six and a half years, but without
    nurse, serving or tiring woman of any kind, we were quite unaware of the
    distressful position in which she was, and in which she had left her lord
    and master over in England. I then explained to Monseigneur how Mistress
    Kestyon seemed over-pleased with the grace and beauty of our own child Rose
    Marie, who had just passed through her first birthday. She would insist on
    calling the wench Rosemary, pronouncing the name in an outlandish fashion,
    and saying that in England it stood for remembrance. A pretty conceit enough,
    seeing that our Rose Marie once seen would surely never be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And a vigorous pressure on Rose Marie&rsquo;s waist brought an additional
    glow to the girl&rsquo;s bright eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At this point,&rdquo; continued M. Legros, &ldquo;it pleased Monseigneur to show such marked interest in my story, that he appeared quite
    impatient and said with a show of irritation&mdash;which could but be flattering
    to me:&mdash;&lsquo;Yes! yes! my son, but there is no need to give me all
    these trifling details. I understand that you are rich, are of somewhat humble
    calling, and have a daughter, and that the English lady was poor, if high-born,
    and had a son. Ergo! the children were betrothed.&rsquo; Which, methinks
    showed vast penetration on the part of Monseigneur,&rdquo; added the worthy
    bonhomme na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;and gracious interest in my affairs. Whereupon,
    warming to my narrative, I exclaimed: &lsquo;Not only betrothed, Monseigneur,
    but married with the full rites and ceremonials of our Holy Church as by
    law prescribed. My wife and I&mdash;so please Your Greatness&mdash;thought
    of the child&rsquo;s future. It has pleased God to bless my work and to endow
    me with vast wealth which in the course of time will all pass to our Rose
    Marie. But here in France, the great gentlemen would always look askance
    at the daughter of the man who made their coats and breeches; not so in England
    where trade, they say, is held in high esteem, and in order that our child
    should one day be as great a lady as any one in the land and as noble as
    she is beautiful, we wedded her to a high and mighty well-born English gentleman,
    who was own great nephew to one of the most illustrious noblemen in that
    fog-ridden country&mdash;the Earl of Stowmaries, so he is called over there,
    Monseigneur!&rsquo; and you may be sure,&rdquo; continued M. Legros, &ldquo;that
    I mentioned this fact with no small measure of pride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what did His Greatness say to that?&rdquo; queried Mme.
    Legros, who would not curb her impatience, even for those few seconds whilst
    her man paused in order to take breath.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Monseigneur did not seem over-pleased at seeing me display
    quite so much pride in empty titles and meaningless earthly dignities,&rdquo; rejoined
    M. Legros lightly. &ldquo;His Greatness was pleased to rebuke me and to inform
    me that he himself was well acquainted with the distinguished English family
    who bears the name of Kestyon of Stowmaries. The Kestyons are all good Catholics
    and Monseigneur thought that this fact was of far greater importance than
    their worldly honours and their ancient lineage, and should have weighed
    much more heavily with us, Maman, when we chose a husband for our daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We should not have given Rose Marie to a Protestant, Armand; you
    should have told that to Monseigneur. No, not if he had been the King of
    England himself,&rdquo; retorted Mme. Legros indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King of England is as good a Catholic as any of us, so &rsquo;tis
    said,&rdquo; commented M. Legros, &ldquo;but this is a digression, and I
    pray you, M&eacute;lanie, not to interrupt me again. I felt that His Greatness
    had lapsed into a somewhat irritable mood against me, which no doubt I fully
    deserved, more especially as Monseigneur did not then know&mdash;but &rsquo;tis
    I am digressing now,&rdquo; resumed the good man after a slight hesitation. &ldquo;In
    less time than I can repeat it all, I had told Monseigneur how directly after
    the marriage ceremony had been performed, we found out how grossly we had
    been deceived, that le Capitaine Kestyon, the husband of Mistress Ang&eacute;lique,
    had been in a debtor&rsquo;s prison in London all the time that his wife
    was bragging to us about his high position and his aristocratic connections;
    we heard that the great Earl of Stowmaries not only refused to have anything
    to do with his nephew, who was a noted rogue and evil-doer, but that he had
    a son and three grandsons of his own, so that there were a goodly number
    of direct inheritors to his great title and vast estates. All this and more
    we heard after our darling child had been indissolubly tied to the son of
    the best-known scoundrel in the whole of England, and who moreover was penniless,
    deeply in debt, and spent the next ten years in extracting our hard-earned
    money from out our pockets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The recollection of those same ten years seemed to have even now a terrible
    effect on the temper of M. Legros. Indignation at the memories his own last
    words evoked seemed momentarily to choke him. He pulled a voluminous and
    highly-coloured handkerchief from the pocket of his surcoat and moped his
    perspiring forehead, for choler had made him warm.</p>
  <p>Mme. Legros&mdash;equally indignant in retrospect but impatient to hear
    Monseigneur&rsquo;s final pronouncement on the great subject&mdash;was nervously
    rapping a devil&rsquo;s tattoo on the table. Rose Marie&rsquo;s fair head
    had fallen forward on her breast. She had said nothing all along, but sat
    on her father&rsquo;s knee, listening with all her ears, for was not he talking
    about the people who would be her people henceforth, the land which would
    be her land, the man who of a truth was her lord and husband? But when Legros,
    with just indignation, recalled the deceits, the shifts, the mean, mercenary
    actions of those whose name she would bear through life, then the blush of
    excitement seemed to turn into one of shame, and two heavy tears fell from
    her eyes onto her tightly clasped hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father, Father!&rdquo; cried fat Mme. Legros in horror, &ldquo;cannot
    you see that you have made the child cry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then heaven punish me for a blundering ass,&rdquo; exclaimed Legros,
    with renewed cheerfulness. &ldquo;Nay! nay! my little cabbage, there&rsquo;s
    naught to cry for now; have I not said that all is well? Those ten years
    are past and done with and eight more lie on the top of them&mdash;and if
    Monseigneur showed some impatience both at my pride and at my subsequent
    indignation, he was vastly interested, I can tell you that, when he heard
    that the son and three grandsons of the great English nobleman were by the
    will of God wrecked while pleasure-cruising together off the coast of Spain
    and all four of them drowned, and that the old lord himself did not long
    survive the terrible catastrophe, which had swept four direct inheritors
    of his vast wealth and ancient name off the face of the earth and into the
    sea. His Greatness became quite excited&mdash;and vastly amiable to me: &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he
    said, &lsquo;then surely&mdash;you cannot mean&mdash;?&rsquo; You see Monseigneur
    was so interested he scarce could find his words. &lsquo;Yes, so please Your
    Greatness,&rsquo; quoth I with becoming dignity, &lsquo;the husband of our
    Rose Marie, the son of the capitaine who in life had been nought but a rogue,
    has inherited the title and the wealth of his great-uncle. He is now styled
    by the English the Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, Baron of Edbrooke and
    of Saumaresque, and he has many other titles besides, and one of the richest
    men in the whole of England!&rsquo; &lsquo;Mais, comment donc!&rsquo; exclaims
    Monseigneur, most affably, and you&rsquo;ll both believe me, an you will,
    but I give you my word that His Greatness took my hand and shook it, so pleased
    did he seem with what I had told him. &lsquo;We must see the lovely Comtesse
    of Stowmaries!&mdash;Eighteen years ago, did you say, my son? and she was
    a baby then! The decrees of God are marvellous, of a truth!&mdash;And your
    Rose Marie a great English lady now, eh?&mdash;with a quantity of money and
    a great love for the Church!&mdash;By the Mass, my son, we must arrange for
    a solemn Te Deum to be sung at St. Etienne, before the beautiful comtesse
    leaves the sunny shores of France for her fog-wrapped home across the sea!&rsquo; Nay!
    but His Greatness said much more than that. He spoke of the various forms
    which our thank-offering might take, the donations which would be most acceptable
    to God on this occasion; he mentioned the amount of money which would most
    adequately express the full meed of our gratitude to Providence, by being
    given to the Church, and I most solemnly assure you that he simply laughed
    at the very thought of the Earl of Stowmaries contemplating the non-fulfilment
    of his marriage vows. I pointed out to His Greatness that the young man seemed
    inclined to repudiate the sacred bond. We had not seen him since the ceremony
    eighteen years ago, and after our final refusal to further help his parents
    with money or substance, we had even ceased to correspond. His parents had
    gone to live in some far, very far-off land across the ocean, where I believe
    cannibals and such like folk do dwell. They had taken the boy with them,
    of course. We thought the young man dead, or if alive then as great a rogue
    as his father, and mourned that our only child was either a girl-widow, or
    the wife of a reprobate. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis eighteen years,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;since
    those marriage vows were spoken.&rsquo; &lsquo;Were they fifty,&rsquo; retorted
    His Greatness, &lsquo;they would still be sacred. The Catholic Church would
    scorn to tie a tie which caprice of man could tear asunder. Nay! nay!&rsquo; he
    added with sublime eloquence, &lsquo;have no fear on this matter, my son.
    Unless the Earl of Stowmaries chooses to abjure the faith of his fathers,
    and thereby cause his own eternal damnation, he cannot undo the knot which
    by the will of his parents&mdash;he being a minor at the time&mdash;tied
    him indissolubly to your daughter.&rsquo; Thus spoke His Greatness, Monseigneur
    the Archbishop of Paris,&rdquo; concluded M. Legros, with becoming solemnity, &ldquo;and
    in such words will the message be conveyed to the man who by all laws human
    and divine is the husband of Rose Marie Dieudonn&eacute;e Legros, our only
    and dearly loved child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the small room now. The fast-gathering twilight had
    gradually softened all sharp outlines, covering every nook and cranny with
    a mantle of gloom and leaving the dying embers of the fire to throw a warm
    glow over the group of these homely folk: fat Mme. Legros in cooking apron
    of coarse linen, her round, moist face pale with excitement, the sleeves
    of her worsted gown rolled back over her shapely arms; the kindly tailor
    with rubicund face gleaming with pride and paternal love, one arm still encircling
    the cherished daughter whose future had been mapped out by him on such glorious
    lines, and she, the girl&mdash;a mere child, fair and slender, with great,
    innocent eyes which mirrored the pure, na&iuml;ve soul within, eyes which
    still looked the outer world boldly in the face, which had learned neither
    to shrink in terror, nor yet to waver in deceit, a child with rosy, moist
    lips which had not yet tasted the sweet and bitter savour of a passionate
    kiss.</p>
  <p>The silence became almost oppressive, for Mme. Legros dared not speak again,
    lest she irritate the mightily clever man whom God had pleased to give her
    as husband, and Rose Marie was silent because, unknown even to herself, in
    the far-off land of Shadows, the Fates who sit and spin the threads of life
    had taken in their grim and relentless hands the first ravellings of her
    own.</p>
  <p>Vaguely now, for her ears were buzzing, she heard her father speak again,
    talking of Monseigneur&rsquo;s graciousness, of the intervention of the French
    ambassador at the Court of the King of England, of an appeal to the Holy
    Father who would command that the great English milor shall acknowledge as
    his sole and lawful wife, Rose Marie Legros, the daughter of the Court tailor
    of Paris.</p>
  <p>It was so strange&mdash;almost uncanny, this intervention of great and clever
    gentlemen, of Monseigneur the Archbishop of Paris, whom hitherto she had
    only seen at a great distance passing through the streets in his glass coach
    or celebrating High Mass at the great altar in Notre Dame, of the King of
    England, whom she had once seen at a pageant in Versailles, actually talking
    to young King Louis himself, the greatest man in the whole world and most
    wonderful of all, of the Holy Father, second only on earth to le bon Dieu
    Himself&mdash;all, all of these great and marvellous people troubling about
    her, Rose Marie.</p>
  <p>For the moment she could not bear to think of it all, and she supposed that
    she must outwardly have looked as strange as she felt herself to be from
    within, for maman suggested that the child was overwrought and must go to
    her room, where presently she should partake of fricass&eacute;e of chicken
    and a glass of good red wine with a little clove and cinnamon in it, the
    panacea, in good Mme. Legros&rsquo; estimation, for every ailment of body,
    mind or heart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</b></h2>
  <p>Rose Marie hardly knew how she reached the tiny room up under the sloping
    roof, which room was her very own.</p>
  <p>She only realised that she longed to be alone to think matters out all by
    herself, and then to indulge in a long and happy cry.</p>
  <p>Oh, yes! she was quite, quite sure that she was very happy, and that it
    was because of this great happiness which filled her heart to bursting, that
    she felt so very much inclined to cry.</p>
  <p>Presently maman came in with the red wine and the fricass&eacute;e and was
    horrified to find the child in tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My pigeon, my little cabbage, but what ails thee, my jewel?&rdquo;  ejaculated
    the good old soul, as she hastily put down the platter and bottle which she
    was carrying and went to kneel beside the narrow bed in the wall, from the
    depths of which came ominous sounds of a girl sobbing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, Maman, nothing!&rdquo; said Rose Marie, smiling at her mother&rsquo;s
    anxiety and hastily endeavouring to dry her tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;&rdquo; grumbled Mme. Legros, &ldquo;one
    does not cry for nothing, my child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am vastly silly, Maman, for doing it&mdash;but I assure you
    that it is nothing&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;The young voice broke in renewed sobs, and two arms were stretched
    forth from out the bed and sought the mother&rsquo;s kindly shoulder, whereon
    a strangely overburdened childish heart could sob itself out in perfect peace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There! there! my little cabbage,&rdquo; said Mme. Legros, trying
    with tender pattings of the soft fair hair to soothe this well-nigh hysterical
    outburst, &ldquo;of a truth, thou hast been overwrought, and it was not right
    for father to speak of all this before thee. Thou didst not know that the
    young English lord had endeavoured to break his marriage vows, and that thy
    father and I have been working hard in order to bring influence to bear upon
    the rogue. Fortunately now we have succeeded, with the help of Monseigneur,
    so there is no need to cry, my cabbage, is there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Maman, it is not that,&rdquo; said the girl more quietly; &ldquo;I
    cannot quite explain to you what it is that made me cry&mdash;for I have
    known all along that milor&mdash;now that he is a milor and passing rich&mdash;was
    anxious to forget us humble folk, who helped his parents in their need&mdash;I
    have felt the shame of that before now, and it never made me cry. But to-day&mdash;somehow&mdash;Maman,
    darling,&rdquo;  she added, sitting up quite straight in bed and looking
    at her mother with enquiring eyes, whilst her fine brow was puckered in a
    deep frown of thought, &ldquo;somehow I feel&mdash;I cannot quite explain
    how it is&mdash;I feel as if my old life was finished&mdash;quite, quite
    finished&mdash;as if nothing would ever be quite the same again&mdash;my
    little room here, the pink curtains, that chair over there&mdash;they do
    not seem the same&mdash;not quite, quite the same&mdash;Maman, cherie, I
    suppose you don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the great childish eyes sought anxiously the mother&rsquo;s face, longing
    for comprehension, for the explanation of an unaccountable mystery.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No, my pigeon, I confess I do not understand,&rdquo; quoth
    worthy Mme. Legros drily, &ldquo;for I do not see&mdash;nor would any sensible
    person admit&mdash;that a great English milor just because he is thy husband&mdash;can
    from all that distance, from the other side of the sea, change thy room and
    thy chair, nor yet thy curtains, though the latter, I will say, sorely need
    washing at the present moment,&rdquo; she added with sublime irrelevance.</p>
  <p>The girl sighed. Maman for once did not understand. Nor of a truth did she
    understand herself. She had tried to explain it all but had signally failed&mdash;had
    only succeeded in suggesting something which of course was supremely silly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell thee how it is, Rose Marie,&rdquo; resumed Mme. Legros
    with firm decision, &ldquo;thy stomach is in a disturbed condition, and a
    cup of cold camomile tea thou shalt drink to-morrow before rising. I&rsquo;ll
    see to the making of it at once,&mdash;for it must be brewed over-night to
    be truly efficacious,&mdash;and come back and give thee thy supper a little
    later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mme. Legros struggled back to her feet, happy to have found in a prospective
    cup of camomile tea a happy solution for Rose Marie&rsquo;s curious mood.
    She took up the platter again, for the fricass&eacute;e must be kept hot,
    and the child must eat some supper a little later on. The good woman&rsquo;s
    heart was filled with that cheerful optimism which persistently seeks the
    good side of every eventuality and nearly always finds it. In this case Mme.
    Legros failed to see that anything but good could come out of the present
    position. That same wonderful optimism of hers had not been altogether proof
    against the events of the past years, when she first began to realise that
    the marriage which she&mdash;more so than her husband&mdash;had planned in
    conjunction with Mistress Ang&eacute;lique Kestyon, was destined to prove
    a bar to her daughter&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
  <p>In those far-off days eighteen years ago, Mme. Legros had still fostered
    in her homely bosom the&mdash;since then&mdash;aborted seeds of social ambition.
    Well-connected on her mother&rsquo;s side, with a good English family, she
    had wedded the Paris tailor for pecuniary rather than for sentimental reasons,
    and she had a sufficiency of sound common sense to understand that as a tradesman&rsquo;s
    wife she could not in these days of arbitrary class distinction aspire to
    remain within that same social circle to which her connections and parentage
    would otherwise have entitled her. But though the seeds of ambition lay dormant
    in the homely soil of her husband&rsquo;s back shop, they were not then altogether
    destroyed.</p>
  <p>M&eacute;lanie de Boutillier had been well past her youth when she married
    Armand Legros; when her baby girl was born, and the mother with justifiable
    pride realised that the child was passing fair, those same seeds once more
    began to germinate. The visit of the English relative&mdash;high-born, well-connected
    and accompanied by a boy not yet seven years of age, brought them to final
    perfection. What M&eacute;lanie de Boutillier had failed to obtain, Rose
    Marie Legros should possess in measureless plenty, and little Rupert Kestyon,
    great nephew of an English milor, should be the one to shower the golden
    gifts on her.</p>
  <p>All these schemes seemed at first so easy of accomplishment. It had been
    useless afterwards to cry over undue haste; at the time it seemed right,
    fitting and proper. Times then were troublous in England; Mistress Ang&eacute;lique
    Kestyon feared the democratic spirit there. It seems that the English were
    actually fighting against their king, and that the fate of the great noblemen
    in the country was in consequence somewhat uncertain; but only temporarily,
    of course, for King Charles Stuart would soon overcome his enemies and duly
    crush the rebellious traitors who had taken up arms against him. In the meanwhile
    the children would grow up, and anon when the Court of England had resumed
    its former splendour, Rupert Kestyon, the dearly-loved relative of the powerful
    Earl of Stowmaries, would introduce his beautiful bride to the charmed inner
    circle of English aristocracy.</p>
  <p>It all seemed so clear&mdash;so simple&mdash;as if, of a truth, the match
    and its glorious consequences had been specially designed by Providence for
    the glorification and social exaltation of Rose Marie Legros. Surely no one
    in those days would have thought that any blame could be attached to the
    parents for hurrying on the marriage ceremony between the two children, whose
    united ages fell short of a decade.</p>
  <p>The catastrophe came afterwards when the tale of deceit and of fraud was
    gradually unfolded. Then came the requests for money, the long voyage to
    America, the knowledge that milor Stowmaries not only had no love for these
    relatives of his, but had finally and irrevocably refused to help them in
    their distress, unless they took ship for a far distant colony and never
    troubled him with sight of their faces again.</p>
  <p>Good Armand Legros, who adored his daughter, was quite broken-hearted. Madame
    tried to remain hopeful against these overwhelming odds&mdash;always thinking
    that&mdash;though it had certainly pleased God to try the Legros family very
    severely for the moment&mdash;something would inevitably turn up which would
    be for the best.</p>
  <p>The immediate result of that unvarying optimism was that she continued Rose
    Marie&rsquo;s education on the same lines as she had originally intended,
    as if the girl-wife was indeed destined anon to grace the Court of the King
    of England. The child was taught the English language by one of the many
    impoverished English gentlemen who had settled in France after the murder
    of their king. She learned to write and to read, to spell and to dance. She
    was taught to play on the virginals and to sing whilst playing a thorough-bass
    on the harpsichord. Nay! her knowledge, so &rsquo;twas said, extended even
    as far as geography and the Copernican system.</p>
  <p>Her mother kept her apart from girls of her own age, unless these belonged
    to one of those few families where learning was esteemed. She was never allowed
    to forget that some day she would leave her father&rsquo;s shop and be a
    great lady in England.</p>
  <p>Whilst Mme. Legros and the kindly bonhomme Armand gradually drifted in their
    middle age to the bourgeois manners and customs of their time and station,
    they jealously fostered in their only child that sense of elegance and refinement
    which mayhap she had inherited from one of her remote ancestors, or mayhap
    had received as a special gift from the fairy godmother who presided at her
    birth.</p>
  <p>Mme. Legros cooked and scoured, Master Armand made surcoats and breeches,
    but Rose Marie was never allowed to spoil her hands with scrubbing, or to
    waste her time presiding over the stewpot. Her father had bought her a pair
    of gloves; these she always wore when she went out, and she always had stockings
    and leather shoes on her feet. As the girl grew up, she gradually assimilated
    to herself more and more this idea that she was to be a great lady. She never
    doubted her future for a moment. Her father from sheer fondness, her mother
    from positive conviction, kept the certitude alive within her.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;But it became quite impossible to keep from the girl&rsquo;s growing
    intelligence all knowledge of the Kestyon&rsquo;s misdeeds. The worthy tailor
    who was passing rich kept but a very small house, in which the one living
    room, situate just above the shop, was the family meeting ground. Rose Marie
    could not be kept out of the room every time her father and mother talked
    over the freshly-discovered deceits and frauds practised by their new relations.</p>
  <p>We must suppose that the subject thus became such a familiar one with the
    child-wife from the moment when she first began to comprehend it, that it
    never acquired any horror or even shame for her. Mistress Ang&eacute;lique
    Kestyon had grossly deceived papa and maman; they were not so rich or so
    grand just now as they had represented themselves to be, but it would all
    come right in the end&mdash;maman at least was quite sure of that.</p>
  <p>If&mdash;as time went on and Rose Marie from a child became a girl&mdash;that
    pleasing optimism somewhat gave way, this was no doubt due to too much book
    learning. Rose Marie was very fond of books, and books we all know have a
    tendency to destroy the innocent belief in the goodness of this world. This
    at least was Papa Legros&rsquo; opinion.</p>
  <p>Mme. Legros spoke less and less on the subject. She hoped.</p>
  <p>She hoped resolutely and persistently, whilst the Kestyons from distant
    Virginia begged repeatedly for money. She went on hoping even whilst urging
    her husband to cut off further supplies, after ten years of this perpetual
    sponging. She still hoped whilst no news whatever came from the emigrants
    and when the rumour reached her that young Rupert Kestyon had died out there.</p>
  <p>At this point, however, her optimism took a fresh turn. She hoped that the
    rumour was true, and that Rose Marie was now free to wed some other equally
    high-born but more reliable gentleman. She continued to hope despite the
    difficulty of proving that the young man had really died, and Monseigneur
    the Archbishop&rsquo;s refusal to grant permission for a second marriage.</p>
  <p>Then when the news filtered through from England as far as the back shop
    in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne Com&eacute;die that Rupert Kestyon was not
    only alive but had&mdash;by a wonderful, almost miraculous series of events&mdash;inherited
    the title and estates of his deceased kinsman and was now of a truth by the
    will of God and the law of his country milor of Stowmaries, and one of the
    greatest gentleman in the whole of England, Mme. Legros&rsquo; optimism found
    its crowning glory in its justification.</p>
  <p>That the young milor seemed disinclined to acknowledge the daughter of the
    Paris tailor as his wife and that he seemed to be taking serious steps to
    have the marriage annulled, were but trifling matters which never upset Mme.
    Legros&rsquo; equanimity.</p>
  <p>She was quite sure that the marriage could not be annulled without special
    dispensation from the Holy Father himself, and equally sure that that dispensation
    would never be granted. She had perfect faith not only in the sacred indissolubility
    of the marriage tie, but in the happy future of Rose Marie.</p>
  <p>When Monseigneur the Archbishop of Paris granted her Armand a special audience,
    whereat the tailor had begged permission to lay the family case before His
    Greatness, Mme. Legros never for a moment doubted the happy issue of that
    interview: and when her man came home and told his satisfactory tale, maman
    was in no way astonished.</p>
  <p>Her optimism had been justified: that was all.</p>
  <p>But what did astonish the good soul was the fact that the child&mdash;Rose
    Marie&mdash;sat crying in her bed, whereas she should have been singing and
    laughing all about the place.</p>
  <p>Therefore, maman, with commendable forethought, prescribed cold camomile
    tea as a remedy against what was obviously but a sharp attack of megrims.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</b></h2>
  <p>And in the narrow bed built within the wall in the tiny room, wherein a
    tallow candle placed on a central table threw only very feeble rays, the
    girl Rose Marie lay dreaming.</p>
  <p>She&mdash;Rose Marie&mdash;the daughter of Papa Legros&mdash;as he was uniformly
    called in the neighbourhood&mdash;she was now a great lady, by the will of
    God and the decree of the Holy Father himself. She would have a glass coach
    like the ladies whom she had so often seen driving about in Versailles, and
    sit in it, dressed in the latest fashion and holding a fan in her hand, which
    would be encased in a lace mitten.</p>
  <p>At this point in her dreams Rose Marie sat up in bed, very straight and
    dignified, with her little hands folded over the cotton coverlet, and she
    bent her young head to right and to left, like one saluting a number of passers-by.
    A nod accompanied by an encouraging smile indicated the greeting to a supposed
    friend, whilst a condescending nod and a haughty stare suggested the presence
    of an acquaintance of somewhat low degree.</p>
  <p>Thus Rose Marie had seen the ladies behave in their coaches in Versailles.
    She had seen Maria Mancini bow serenely to her admirers, and the Queen Mother
    bestow the stony stare on her detractors. She had watched, wondered and admired,
    but never had she tried to imitate until now&mdash;now that her smile would
    be appreciated by many, her frown be of consequence to others.</p>
  <p>Up to now it had not mattered. Though her father was reputed to be wealthy,
    he was only a tailor, who had to bow and scrape and wallow before the great
    gentlemen of the Court. Aye! and had more than once been soundly thrashed
    because of the misfit of a pair of Court breeches.</p>
  <p>And Rose Marie had oft sighed for greatness, for the gilded coach and a
    seat at the opera, for silken dresses, flowers, patches and rouge. She was
    only a child with an acutely developed sense of sympathy for everything that
    was dainty and refined, everything that smelt sweetly and was soft and tender
    to the touch.</p>
  <p>Thus she went on dreaming her dream in content, never doubting for a moment
    that happiness lay closely linked with this sudden accession to grandeur.
    The fact that her lawful lord and husband had shown a desire to break his
    marriage vows, and to take unto himself some other wife more equal to him
    in rank and breeding than the humble tailor&rsquo;s daughter, troubled Rose
    Marie not at all. With sublime faith in the workings of Providence, she put
    her husband&rsquo;s reluctance to acknowledge her down to his ignorance of
    herself.</p>
  <p>He had never seen her since the day of the ceremony, eighteen years ago.
    She was a baby in arms then, whilst now&mdash;</p>
  <p>Rose Marie drew in her breath and listened. Maman was evidently not yet
    coming up. All was still on this upper floor of the house. Rose Marie put
    her feet to the ground and rose from her bed. She picked up the candle from
    the table and tripped across the room to where&mdash;on the whitewashed wall
    opposite&mdash;there hung a small gilt-framed mirror.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Into this she peeped, holding the candle well above her head. Her
    face wore neither the look of vanity, nor even that of satisfaction: rather
    was it a look of the closest possible scrutiny. Rose Marie turned her head
    to right and left again, but not&mdash;this time&mdash;in order to enact
    a private comedy, but in order to convince herself in her own mind that her
    cheeks had indeed that peach-like bloom, which her overfond father had so
    oft proclaimed, and that her hair was sufficiently brilliant in colour to
    be called golden, and yet not too vivid to be called &ldquo;roux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We may take it that this scrutiny, which lasted nearly twenty minutes, was
    of a satisfactory character, for presently, with a happy little sigh, and
    heaving breast, Rose Marie tripped lightly back to her narrow bed in the
    wall, and squeezed herself well within the further dark angle, to which the
    flickering light of the tallow candle had no access.</p>
  <p>This she did because she had heard maman&rsquo;s step on the stairs, and
    because her own cheeks now were of a flaming red.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="Part2"></a>Part 2</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;My Lord is sad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Lord is weary!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;!!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A pause. Mistress Julia Peyton, you understand, was waxing impatient. Can
    you wonder? She was not accustomed to moodiness on the part of her courtiers;
    to a certain becoming diffidence mayhap, to tongue-tiedness&mdash;if we may
    be allowed so to call it&mdash;on the part of her young adorers fresh from
    their country homes, fledglings scarce free from the gentle trammels of their
    mother&rsquo;s apron strings, to humility in the presence of so much beauty,
    grace and wit as she was wont to display when taken with the desire to please,
    to all that yes, yes and a thousand times yes, the adorable Julia was fully
    accustomed. But to silence on the part of the wittiest gentleman about town,
    to moodiness akin to ill-humour on the part of the most gallant young rake
    this side of Westminster&mdash;no! no! and a thousand times no! Mistress
    Julia would have none of it.</p>
  <p>Her daintily-shod foot beat a quick measure against the carpets, her fingers
    delicately tipped with rouge played a devil&rsquo;s tattoo on the polished
    top of the tiny marqueterie table beside her, and her small teeth, white
    and even as those of a kitten, tore impatiently at her under lip.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Still Lord Stowmaries paid no heed to these obvious signs of a coming
    storm. He lolled in an armchair opposite the imperious beauty, his chin was
    resting in his hand, his brow was puckered, and oh! most portentous outward
    indication of troubles within! his cravat looked soiled and crumpled, as
    if an angry hand had fidgeted its immaculate whiteness away.</p>
  <p>At last Mistress Julia found herself quite unable to control her annoyance
    any longer. Granted that Lord Stowmaries was the richest, most promising &ldquo;parti&rdquo; that
    had ever come her way; that he was young, good-looking, owned half the county
    of Hertford, and one of the oldest names in England, and that, moreover,
    he was of sufficiently amiable disposition to be fashioned into a model husband
    by and by&mdash; granted all that, say I, had not all these advantages, I pray
    you to admit, caused the fair Julia to hide her ill-humour for close on half
    an hour, whilst the young man frowned and sighed, gave curt answers to her
    most charming sallies, and had failed to notice that a filmy handkerchief,
    lace-edged and delicately perfumed, had been dropped on that veriest exact
    spot of the carpet which was most conveniently situated for sinking on one
    knee within a few inches of the most adorable foot in London?</p>
  <p>But now the irascible beauty was at the end of her tether. She rose&mdash;wrathfully
    kicking aside that same handkerchief which her surly visitor had failed to
    notice&mdash;and took three quick steps in the direction of the bell-pull.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, my lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I pray you to excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she stretched out her hand in a gesture intended to express the full
    measure of her wrath.</p>
  <p>Lord Stowmaries roused himself from his unpleasant torpor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;To excuse you, fair one?&rdquo;  he murmured in the tone of
    a man who has just wakened from slumber, and is still unaware of what has
    been going on around him whilst he slept.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, my good lord,&rdquo; she replied with a shrill note of sarcasm
    very apparent in the voice which so many men had compared to that of a nightingale. &ldquo;I
    fain must tear myself away from the delights of your delectable company&mdash;though
    I confess &rsquo;twere passing easy to find more entertaining talk than yours
    has been this last half-hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you be cruel to me now, Mistress?&rdquo; he said with a deep
    and mournful sigh, &ldquo;now, when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, when what?&rdquo; she retorted still pettishly, though a little
    mollified by his obvious distress.</p>
  <p>She turned back towards him, and presently placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said resolutely, &ldquo;either you tell me now
    and at once what ails you this afternoon, or I pray you leave me, for in
    your present mood, by my faith, your room were more enjoyable than your company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took that pretty hand which still lingered on his shoulder, and pressing
    it for a few lingering seconds between both his, he finally conveyed its
    perfumed whiteness to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send me away,&rdquo; he pleaded pathetically; &ldquo;I
    am the most miserable of mortals, and if you closed your doors against me
    now, you would be sending your most faithful adorer straight to perdition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tut, man!&rdquo; she rejoined impatiently, &ldquo;you talk like a
    gaby. In the name of Heaven, tell me what ails you, or I vow you&rsquo;ll
    send me into my grave with choler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have been trying to tell you, Mistress, this past half-hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Lud help me, I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s about a woman,&rdquo; she concluded with firm decision.</p>
  <p>He gave no reply. The conclusion was obvious.</p>
  <p>The fair Julia frowned. This was threatening to become serious. It was no
    mere question of moodiness then, of ill-humour anon to be forgiven and dissipated
    with a smile.</p>
  <p>There was a woman at the bottom of my lord Stowmaries&rsquo; ill-humour.
    A woman who had the power to obtrude her personality between his mental vision
    and the daintiest apparition that had ever turned a man&rsquo;s brain dizzy
    with delight. A woman in fact who might prove to be an obstacle to the realisation
    of Mistress Julia Peyton&rsquo;s most cherished dreams.</p>
  <p>All thoughts of anger, of petulance, of bell-pulls and peremptory cong&eacute;s
    fled from the beauty&rsquo;s mind. She sat down again opposite the young
    man; she rested her elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands; she looked
    serious, sympathetic, interested, anything you like. A sufficiency of moisture
    rose to her eyes to render them soft and lustrous, appealing and irresistible.
    Her lips parted and quivered just sufficiently to express deep emotion held
    courageously in check, whilst from beneath the little lace cap one or two
    rebellious curls free from powder, golden in colour, and silky in texture,
    were unaccountably allowed to escape.</p>
  <p>Thus equipped for the coming struggle, she repeated her question, not peremptorily
    this time, but gently and in a voice that trembled slightly with the intensity
    of sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What ails my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing short of despair,&rdquo; he replied, whilst his eyes rested
    with a kind of mournful abnegation on the enchanting picture so tantalisingly
    near to him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it quite hopeless, then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An entanglement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. A marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Outwardly she made no sign. Mistress Julia was not one of those simpering
    women who faint, or scream, or gasp at moments of mental or moral crises.
    I will grant you that the colour left her cheek, and that her fingers for
    one brief instant were tightly clutched&mdash;no longer gracefully interlaced&mdash;under
    her chin. But this was in order to suppress emotion, not to make a show of
    it.</p>
  <p>There was only a very momentary pause, the while she now, with deliberate
    carelessness, brushed a rebellious curl back into its place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A marriage, my good lord,&rdquo; she said lightly; &ldquo;nay! you
    must be jesting&mdash;or else mayhap I have misunderstood.&mdash;A marriage
    to render you moody?&mdash;Whose marriage could that be?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine, Mistress&mdash;my marriage,&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Stowmaries,
    now in tones of truly tragical despair; &ldquo;curse the fate that brought
    it about, the parents who willed it, the necessity which forced them to it,
    and which hath wrecked my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress Julia now made no further attempt to hide her fears. Obviously
    the young man was not jesting. The tone of true misery in his voice was quite
    unmistakable. It was the suddenness of the blow which hurt her so. This fall
    from the pinnacle of her golden dreams. For weeks and months now she had
    never thought of herself in the future as other than the Countess of Stowmaries,
    chatelaine of Maries Castle, the leader of society both in London and in
    Newmarket, by virtue of her husband&rsquo;s wealth and position, of her own
    beauty, tact and grace.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;She had even with meticulous care so reorganised her mind and memory,
    that she could now eliminate from them all recollections of the more humble
    past&mdash;the home at Norwich, the yeoman father, kindly but absorbed in
    the daily struggle for existence, the busy, somewhat vulgar mother, the sordid
    existence peculiar to impoverished smaller gentry; then the early marriage
    with Squire Peyton. It had seemed brilliant then, for the Squire, though
    past his youth, had a fine house, and quite a few serving men&mdash;but no
    position&mdash;he never came to London and Mistress Julia&rsquo;s knowledge
    of Court and society was akin to that which children possess of fairies or
    of sprites.</p>
  <p>But Squire Peyton it appears had more money than he had owned to in his
    lifetime. He had been something of a miser apparently, for even his young
    widow was surprised when at his death&mdash;which occurred if you remember
    some twenty-four months ago&mdash;she found herself possessed of quite a
    pleasing fortune.</p>
  <p>This was the beginning of Mistress Julia&rsquo;s golden dreams, of her longings
    towards a more brilliant future, which a lucky second marriage could easily
    now secure for her. The thousand pounds a year which she possessed enabled
    her to take a small house in Holborn Row, and to lay herself out to cut a
    passable figure in London society. Not among the Court set, of course, but
    there were all the young idlers about town, glad enough to be presented to
    a young and attractive widow, endowed with some wealth of her own, and an
    inordinate desire to please.</p>
  <p>The first few idlers soon attracted others, and gradually the pretty widow&rsquo;s
    circle of acquaintances widened. If that circle was chiefly composed of men,
    who shall blame the pretty widow?</p>
  <p>It was a husband she wanted, and not female companionship. Lord Swannes,
    if you remember, paid her his court, also Sir Jeremiah Harfleet, and it was
    well known that my lord of Craye&mdash;like the true poet that he was&mdash;was
    consumed with love of her. But as soon as Mistress Julia realised that richly-feathered
    birds were only too willing to fly into her snares, she aimed for higher
    game. A golden eagle was what she wanted to bring down.</p>
  <p>And was not the young Earl of Stowmaries the veritable prince of golden
    eagles?</p>
  <p>He came and saw and she conquered in a trice. Her beauty, which was unquestionable,
    and an inexhaustible fund of <i>verve</i> and high-spirited chatter which
    easily passed for wit were attractive to most men, and Lord Stowmaries, somewhat
    blas&eacute; already by the more simpering advances of the Court damsels,
    found a certain freshness in this young widow who had not yet shaken off
    the breezy vulgarity of her East Anglian home, and whose artless conversation,
    wholly innocent of elegance, was more amusing than the stilted &ldquo;Ohs!&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Luds!&rdquo; of
    the high-born ladies of his own rank.</p>
  <p>The golden eagle seemed overwilling to allow the matrimonial snare set by
    the fair Julia to close in around him: she was already over-sure of him,
    and though she did not frequent the assemblies and salons where congregated
    his lordship&rsquo;s many friends, she was fully aware that her name was
    being constantly coupled with that of the Earl of Stowmaries.</p>
  <p>But now she saw that she had missed her aim, that the glorious bird no longer
    flew within her reach, but was a prisoner in some one else&rsquo;s cage,
    fettered beyond her powers of liberation.</p>
  <p>But still Mistress Julia with persistence worthy a better cause refused
    to give up all hope.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me all about it, my lord,&rdquo; she said as quietly as
    she could. &ldquo;It had been better had you spoken before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have been a fool, Mistress,&rdquo; he replied dully, &ldquo;yet
    more sinned against than sinning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not tell me that you are actually married?&rdquo; she
    insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did not tell me so,&rdquo; she retorted hotly, &ldquo;but came
    here, courting me, speaking of love to me&mdash;of marriage&mdash;God help
    you! when the very word was a sacrilege since you were not free&mdash;Oh!
    the perfidy of it all!&mdash;and you speak of being more sinned against than
    sinning. &rsquo;Tis the pillory you deserve, my lord, for thus shaming a
    woman first and then breaking her heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was quite sincere in her vehemence, for self-control had now quite deserted
    her, and the wrong and humiliation which she had been made to endure, rose
    up before her like cruel monsters that mocked and jeered at her annihilated
    hopes and her vanished dreams. Her voice rose in a crescendo of shrill tones,
    only to sink again under the strength of choking sobs. Despair, shame and
    bitter reproach rang through every word which she uttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you rightly say, Mistress,&rdquo; murmured the young man, &ldquo;God
    help me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the details, man&mdash;the details&mdash;&rdquo; she rejoined
    impatiently; &ldquo;cannot you see that I am consumed with anxiety&mdash;the
    woman?&mdash;who is she?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her name is Rose Marie,&rdquo; he replied in the same dull, even
    tones, like a schoolboy reciting a lesson which he hath learned, but does
    not understand; &ldquo;she is the daughter of a certain M. Legros, who is
    tailor to His Majesty the King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tailor!&rdquo; she gasped, incredulous now, hopeful once more that
    the young man was mayhap suffering from megrims and had seen unpleasant visions,
    which had no life or reality in them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tailor&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only too true,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;I had no choice in the
    matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who had?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My parents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; she retorted scornfully, &ldquo;and you a man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I was not a man then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was in my seventh year!&rdquo; he exclaimed pathetically.</p>
  <p>There was a slight pause, during which the swiftly-risen hope a few moments
    ago once more died away. Then she said drily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she?&mdash;this&mdash;this Rose or Mary&mdash;daughter of a tailor&mdash;how
    old was she when you married her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In her second year, I think,&rdquo; he replied meekly. &ldquo;I just
    remember quite vaguely that after the ceremony she was carried screaming
    and kicking out of the church. That was the last I saw of my wife from that
    day to this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My great-uncle, the late Lord Stowmaries, shipped my father, mother
    and myself off to Virginia soon after that. My father had been something
    of a wastrel all his life and a thorn in the flesh of the old miser. The
    second time that he was locked up in a debtor&rsquo;s prison, Lord Stowmaries
    paid up for him on the condition that he went off to Virginia at once with
    my mother and myself, and never showed his face in England again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm! I remember hearing something of this when you, my lord, came
    into your title. But these&mdash;these&mdash;tailor people&mdash;who were
    they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Madame Legros was a distant connection of my mother&rsquo;s
    who, I suppose, married the tailor for the same reason that I&mdash;an unfortunate
    lad without a will of my own&mdash;was made to marry the tailor&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is rich&mdash;of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Legros, the tailor, owns millions, I believe, and Rose Marie is his
    only child. It was the first time that my poor father, Captain Kestyon, found
    himself actually in prison and unable to pay his debts. The Earl of Stowmaries&mdash;a
    wicked old miser, if ever there was one&mdash;refused to come to his rescue.
    My mother was practically penniless then; she had no one to whom she could
    turn for succour except the cousin over in Paris, who had always been kind
    to her, who was passing rich, burning with social ambition, and glad enough
    to have the high-born English lady beneath her bourgeois roof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that same burning social ambition caused the worthy tailor to
    consent to a marriage between his baby daughter and the scion of one of the
    grandest families in England,&rdquo; commented Mistress Julia calmly. &ldquo;It
    were all so simple&mdash;if only you had had the manhood to tell me all this
    ere now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought that miserable marriage forever forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;was it likely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had heard nothing of the Legros for many years,&rdquo; he said
    dejectedly. &ldquo;My father had died out in the Colony: my mother and I
    continued to live there on a meagre pittance which that miserly old reprobate&mdash;my
    great-uncle&mdash;grudgingly bestowed upon us. This was scarce sufficient
    for our wants, let alone for enabling us to save enough money to pay our
    passage home. At first my mother was in the habit of asking for and obtaining
    help from the Legros!&mdash;you understand? she never would have consented
    to the connection,&rdquo;  added the young man with na&iuml;ve cynicism, &ldquo;had
    she not intended to derive profit therefrom, so whenever an English or a
    French ship touched the coast my poor mother would contrive to send a pathetic
    letter to be delivered in Paris, at the house of the king&rsquo;s tailor.
    But after a while answers to these missives became more and more rare, soon
    they ceased altogether, and it is now eight years since the last remittance
    came&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worthy tailor and his wife were getting tired of the aristocratic
    connection,&rdquo; commented Mistress Julia drily; &ldquo;no doubt they too
    had intended to derive profit therefrom and none came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was I not right, Mistress, in thinking that ill-considered marriage
    forgotten?&rdquo; quoth Lord Stowmaries with more vehemence than he had displayed
    in the actual recital of the sordid tale; &ldquo;was I not justified in thinking
    that the Legros had by now bitterly regretted the union of their only child
    to the penniless son of a spendthrift father? Tell me,&rdquo; he reiterated
    hotly, &ldquo;was I not justified?&mdash;I thought that they had forgotten&mdash;that
    they had regretted&mdash;that Rose Marie had found a husband more fitted
    to her lowly station and to her upbringing&mdash;and that her parents would
    only be too glad to think that I too had forgotten&mdash;or that I was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a slight pause. Mistress Julia&rsquo;s white brow was puckered
    into a deep frown of thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my lord,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve told me
    the past&mdash;and though the history be not pretty, it is past and done
    with, and I take it that your concern now is rather with the present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! sigh me not such doleful sighs, man!&rdquo; she exclaimed with
    angry impatience, &ldquo;but in the name of all the saints get on with your
    tale. What has happened? The Legros have found out that little Rupert Kestyon
    hath now become Earl of Stowmaries and one of the richest peers in the kingdom&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    it&mdash;is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Briefly, that is it, Mistress. They demand that their daughter be
    instated in her position and the full dignities and rights to which her marriage
    entitle her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Failing which?&rdquo; she asked curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! scandal! disgrace! they will apply to the Holy Father&mdash;the
    orders would then come direct from Rome&mdash;I could not disobey under pain
    of excommunication&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such tyranny!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Kestyons have been Catholics for five hundred years,&rdquo; said
    the young man simply, whilst a touch of dignity&mdash;the first since he
    began to relate his miserable tale&mdash;now crept into his attitude. &ldquo;We
    do not call the dictates of the Holy Father in question, nor do we name them
    tyranny. They are irrevocable in matters such as these&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely&mdash;a sum of money&mdash;&rdquo; she hazarded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Legros have more of that commodity than I have. But it is not
    a question of money. Believe me, fair Mistress,&rdquo; he said in tones which
    once more revealed the sorrow of his heart, &ldquo;I have thought on the
    matter in all its bearings&mdash;I have even broached the subject to the
    Duke of York,&rdquo; he added after an imperceptible moment of hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah? and what said His Highness?&rdquo; asked Mistress Julia with
    that quick inward catching of her breath which the mentioning of exalted
    personages was ever wont to call forth in her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! His Highness only spoke of the sanctity of the marriage tie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas not likely he would talk otherwise. &rsquo;Tis said that
    his bigotry grows daily upon him&mdash;and that he only awaits a favourable
    moment to embrace openly the Catholic Faith&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty was of the same opinion, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah? You spoke to His Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it not my duty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap&mdash;mayhap&mdash;and what did His Majesty say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! he was pleased to take the matter more lightly&mdash;but then
    there is the Queen Mother&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who else? I pray you, who else?&rdquo; said Mistress Julia now with
    renewed acerbity. &ldquo;His Majesty, His Royal Highness, the Queen&mdash;half
    London, to boot&mdash;to know of my discomfiture and shame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice again broke in a sob, she buried her face in her hands, and tears
    which mayhap had more affinity to anger than to sorrow escaped freely from
    between her fingers. In a moment the young man was at her feet. Gone was
    his apathy, his sullenness now. He was on one knee and his two arms encircled
    the quivering shoulders of the fair, enraged one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress, Mistress,&rdquo; he entreated, whilst his eager lips sought
    the close proximity of her shell-like ear; &ldquo;Julia, my beloved, in the
    name of the Holy Virgin, I pray you dry your tears. You break my heart, fair
    one. You&mdash;O God!&rdquo; he added vehemently, &ldquo;am I not the most
    miserable of men? What sin have I committed that such a wretched fate should
    overwhelm me? I love you and I have made you cry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my lord,&rdquo; whispered Julia through her tears, &ldquo;an
    you loved me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused with well-calculated artfulness, whilst he murmured with pathetic
    and tender reproach:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An I loved you! Is not my heart bound to your dainty feet? my soul
    fettered by the glance of your eyes? Do you think, Mistress, that I can ever
    bear to contemplate the future now, when for days, nay! weeks and months,
    ever since I first beheld your exquisite loveliness, I have ever pictured
    myself only as your slave, ever thought of you only as my wife? That old
    castle over in Hertfordshire, once so inimical to me, I have learnt to love
    it of late because I thought you would be its mistress; I treasured every
    tree because your eyes would behold their beauty; I guarded with jealous
    care every footpath in the park because I hoped that some day soon your fairy
    feet would wander there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress Julia seemed inclined to weep yet more copiously. No doubt the
    ardently-whispered words of my lord Stowmaries caused her to realise more
    vividly all that she had hoped for, all that was lost to her now.</p>
  <p>Oh! was it not maddening? Had ever woman been called upon to endure quite
    so bitter a disappointment?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the shame of it all, my lord,&rdquo; she said brokenly, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo; she
    whispered with tenderness, &ldquo;I too had thought of a future beside a
    man whom I had learned to&mdash;to love. I suffer as you do, my lord&mdash;and&mdash;besides
    that, the awful shame. Your favours to me, my lord, have caused much bitter
    gall in the hearts of the envious&mdash;my humiliation will enable them to
    exult&mdash;to jeer at my discomfiture&mdash;to throw scandalous aspersions
    at my conduct&mdash;I shall of a truth be disgraced, sneered at&mdash;ruined&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let any one dare&mdash;&rdquo; muttered the young man fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! how will you stop them? &rsquo;Tis the women who will dare the
    most. Oh! if you loved me, my lord, as you say you do, if your protestations
    are not mere empty words, you would not allow this unmerited disgrace to
    fall upon me thus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Who shall say what tortuous thoughts rose in Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s mind
    at this moment? Is there aught in the world quite so cruel as a woman baffled?
    Think on it, how she had been fooled. The very intensity of the young man&rsquo;s
    passion, which had been revealed to her in its fulness now that he knew that
    an insuperable barrier stood between him and the fulfilment of his desires,
    showed her but too plainly how near she had been to her goal.</p>
  <p>At times&mdash;ere this&mdash;she had dreaded and doubted. The brilliancy
    of his position, his wealth and high dignity had caused her sometimes a pang
    of fear lest he did not think her sufficiently his equal to raise her to
    his own high rank. At such moments she had redoubled her efforts, had schemed
    and had striven, despite the fact that her efforts in that direction had&mdash;as
    she well knew&mdash;not escaped the prying eyes of the malevolent. What cared
    she then for their sneers so long as she succeeded?</p>
  <p>And now with success fully in sight, she had failed&mdash;hopelessly, ridiculously&mdash;ignominiously
    failed.</p>
  <p>Oh! how she hated that unknown woman, that low-born bourgeoise, who had
    robbed her of her prize! She hated the woman, she hated the family, the Parisian
    tailor and his scheming wife. God help her, she even hated the unfortunate
    young deceiver who was clinging passionately to her knees.</p>
  <p>She pushed him roughly aside, springing to her feet, unable to sit still,
    and began pacing up and down the small room, the tiny dainty cage wherein
    she had hoped to complete the work of ensnaring the golden bird.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julia!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He too jumped to his feet. Once more he tried to embrace the quivering shoulders,
    to imprison the nervous, restless fingers, to capture the trembling lips.
    But she would no longer yield. Of what use were yielding now?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay! I pray you, leave me,&rdquo; she said petulantly. &ldquo;Of
    what purpose are your protestations, my lord&mdash;they are but a further
    outrage. Indeed, I pray you, go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more she turned to the bell-pull, and took the heavy silken cord in
    her hand, the outward sign of his dismissal. Some chivalrous instinct in
    him made him loth to force his company on her any longer. But his glowering
    eyes, fierce and sullen, sought to read her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When may I come back?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>But we may be allowed to suppose that something in her accent, in her attitude
    of hesitancy, gave the lie to the cruel word, for he rejoined immediately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were the use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vow,&rdquo; he said with grim earnestness, &ldquo;that if you dismiss
    me now, without the hope of seeing you again, I&rsquo;ll straight to the
    river, and seek oblivion in death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere the act of a coward!&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap. But Fate has dealt overharshly with me. I cannot face life
    if you turn in bitterness from me. Heaven only knows how I can face it at
    all without you&mdash;but your forgiveness may help me to live; it would
    keep me back from the lasting disgrace of a suicide&rsquo;s grave, from eternal
    damnation. Will you let me come to-morrow? Will you give me your forgiveness
    then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He tried to draw near her again, but she put out her hand and drew resolutely
    back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap&mdash;mayhap,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;I know not&mdash;but
    not now, my lord&mdash;I entreat you to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rang the bell quickly, as if half afraid of herself, lest she might
    yield, after all. Mistress Julia knew but little of love&mdash;perhaps until
    this moment she had never realised that she cared for this young man, quite
    apart from the position and wealth which he would be able to give her. But
    now, somehow, she felt intensely sorry for him, and there was quite a small
    measure of unselfishness in her grief at this irrevocable turn of events.
    The glance which she finally turned upon him softened the cruelty of his
    dismissal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come and say good-bye to-morrow,&rdquo; she murmured. Then she raised
    a finger to her lips. &ldquo;Sh!&mdash;sh!&mdash;sh!&rdquo; she whispered
    scarce above her breath; &ldquo;say nothing more now&mdash;I could not bear
    it. But come and say good-bye to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The serving man&rsquo;s steps were heard the other side of the door. He
    was coming in answer to the bell.</p>
  <p>Lord Stowmaries dropped on one knee. He contrived to capture a feebly-resisting
    little hand and to impress a kiss upon the rouge-tipped fingers.</p>
  <p>Then after a final low bow, he turned and walked out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</b></h2>
  <p>Mistress Julia Peyton waited for a few moments until the opening and shutting
    of the outer door proclaimed the fact that young Lord Stowmaries had really
    and definitely gone.</p>
  <p>Then she went to the little <i>secr&eacute;taire</i> which stood in an angle
    of the room, drew forth a sheet of paper, took a heavy quill pen in her hand,
    and feverishly&mdash;though very laboriously&mdash;began to write.</p>
  <p>It was a difficult task which the fair lady had set herself to do, for neither
    writing nor spelling were among her accomplishments, being deemed unnecessary
    and not pertaining to the arts of pleasing. But still she worked away, with
    hand cramped round the rebellious quill, dainty fingers stained with the
    evil-smelling black liquid, and her brow puckered with the intensity of mental
    effort, until she had succeeded in putting on paper just what she wished
    to say:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;<i>To siR john Ayloff at His resedence in lincoln&rsquo;s
  inn Filds.</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Honord Sir cosin:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This to Tell yo That i wish to speke with
  yo This da and At ons opon a Matter of life and Deth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;yr obedt Servt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Julia
  Peyton.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A goodly number of blots appeared upon this missive as well as upon Mistress
    Julia&rsquo;s brocaded kirtle, before she had finished. But once the letter
    duly signed, she folded and sealed it, then once more rang the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take this to the house of Sir John Ayloffe at once,&rdquo; she said
    peremptorily to her serving man who appeared at the door, &ldquo;and if he
    be within bring him hither without delay. If he be from home, seek him at
    the Coffee Tavern in Holborn Bars, or at the sign of the Three Bears in the
    Strand. But do not come back until you&rsquo;ve found Sir John.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave the letter to the man, and, as the latter with a brief word indicative
    of obedience and understanding prepared to go, she added curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if you do not find Sir John and bring him hither within half
    an hour, you may leave my service without notice or character, but with twenty
    blows of the stick across your back. You understand? Now you may go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then&mdash;as the man finally retired&mdash;Mistress Julia was left alone
    to face the problem as to how best she could curb her impatience until the
    arrival of Sir John.</p>
  <p>Her threat would lend wings to her messenger&rsquo;s feet, for her service
    was reckoned a good one, owing to the many lavish gifts and unconsidered
    trifles which fell from the liberal hands of Mistress Julia&rsquo;s courtiers,
    whilst her old henchman&mdash;a burly East Anglian relict of former days
    in Norfolk&mdash;loved to wield a heavy stick over the backs of his younger
    subordinates.</p>
  <p>If Sir John Ayloffe was at home, he could be here in ten minutes; if he
    had gone to the Coffee Tavern in Holborn Bars, then in twenty; but if the
    messenger had to push on as far as the Strand, then the full half-hour must
    elapse ere the arrival of Sir John.</p>
  <p>And if he came, what should she say to him? Of all her many adorers, Sir
    John was the only one who had never spoken of matrimony. A distant connection
    of the late Squire Peyton&rsquo;s, he it was who had launched the young widow
    on her social career in London and thus enabled her to enter on her great
    matrimonial venture.</p>
  <p>Sir John Ayloffe, who in his early youth had been vastly busy in dissipating
    the fortune left to him by a thrifty father, was chiefly occupied now that
    he had reached middle age in finding the means to live with outward decency,
    if not always with strict honesty. Among these means gambling and betting
    were of course in the forefront. These vices were not only avowable, they
    were thought gentlemanly and altogether elegant.</p>
  <p>But how to gamble and bet without cheating is a difficult problem which
    Sir John Ayloffe never really succeeded in solving. So far chance had favoured
    him. His various little transactions at the hazard tables or betting rings
    had gone off with a certain amount of luck and not too much publicity.</p>
  <p>He had managed to keep up his membership at Culpeper&rsquo;s and other fashionable
    clubs, and had not up to the present been threatened with expulsion from
    Newmarket. He was still a welcome guest at the Coffee Taverns where the young
    bloods congregated, and at the Three Bears in the Strand, the resort of the
    most fashionable young rakes of the day.</p>
  <p>But one or two dark, ugly-looking clouds began to hover on his financial
    horizon, and there was a time&mdash;some eighteen months ago&mdash;when Sir
    John Ayloffe had serious thoughts of a long voyage abroad for the benefit
    of his health.</p>
  <p>This was just before he received the intimation that his cousin&mdash;old
    Squire Peyton&mdash;had left a young and pretty widow, who was burning with
    the desire not to allow her many charms to be buried in oblivion in a tumble-down
    Norfolk manor.</p>
  <p>Although Mistress Julia Peyton knew little if anything of spelling and other
    book lore, her knowledge of human&mdash;or rather masculine&mdash;nature
    was vast and accurate. After half an hour&rsquo;s conversation with her newly-found
    kinsman, she had gauged the use which she could make of him and of his impecuniousness
    to a nicety.</p>
  <p>He was over-ready, on the other hand, to respond to her wishes. The bargain
    was quickly struck, with cards on the table, and the calling of a spade by
    its own proper appellation.</p>
  <p>Mistress Julia Peyton was calculated to do credit to any London kinsman
    who chose to introduce his most aristocratic friends into her house. And
    remember, Sir John Ayloffe had plenty of these, and was to receive a goodly
    sum from the young widow for every such introduction. Such matters were not
    difficult to arrange at a time when money was scarce and love of display
    great. The fair Julia lost nothing by the business. Her house, thanks to
    Sir John, was well frequented by the pleasure-loving set of London.</p>
  <p>Then there loomed ahead the final and great project: the marriage of Mistress
    Julia! and herein Sir John&rsquo;s cooperation was indeed to be well paid.
    From one thousand pounds, up to five, was to be his guerdon, according as
    his fair kinswoman&rsquo;s second husband was a wealthy baronet, a newly-created
    peer, or the bearer of one of those ancient names and high dignities or titles
    which gave him entr&eacute;es at Court, privileges of every sort and kind,
    which his wife would naturally share with him.</p>
  <p>When the brigantine <i>Speedwell</i> went down off the Spanish coast with
    all on board, the late Earl of Stowmaries lost at one fell swoop his only
    son and heir, and the latter&rsquo;s three young boys, who were all on a
    pleasure cruise on the ill-fated vessel. The old man did not survive the
    terrible shock of that appalling catastrophe. He died within six months of
    the memorable tragedy, and Rupert Kestyon&mdash;the son of the impecunious
    spendthrift who was lying forgotten in a far-off grave in a distant colony&mdash;became
    Earl of Stowmaries, one of the wealthiest peers in England.</p>
  <p>In a moment he became the most noted young buck of the Court of the Restoration,
    the cynosure of every feminine eye. He was young, well looking, and his romantic
    upbringing in the far-off colony founded by his co-religionists, made him
    a vastly interesting personality.</p>
  <p>Mistress Julia, as soon as she heard his name, his prestige, and his history,
    began to dream of him&mdash;and of herself as Countess of Stowmaries. Once
    more Cousin John was appealed to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six thousand pounds for you, Cousin, the day on which I become Countess
    of Stowmaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only the introduction was needed. Mistress Julia, past-mistress by now in
    the art of pleasing, would undertake to do the rest.</p>
  <p>Young Lord Stowmaries was a member of Culpeper&rsquo;s. Sir John Ayloffe
    contrived to attract his attention, and one day to bring him to the house
    of the fascinating widow.</p>
  <p>Sir John had done his work. So had the beautiful Julia. It was Chance who
    had played an uneven game, wherein the two gamblers, handicapped by their
    ignorance of past events, had lost the winning hand.</p>
  <p>And it was because she felt that Cousin John had almost as much at stake
    in the game as she had, that Mistress Julia Peyton sent for her partner,
    when Chance dealt what seemed a mortal blow to her dearest hope and scheme.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6</b></h2>
  <p>Less than twenty minutes after the despatch of her missive&mdash;twenty
    minutes which seemed to Julia more like twenty cycles of immeasurable time&mdash;Sir
    John Ayloffe was announced.</p>
  <p>He entered very composedly. Having been formally announced by the servant,
    he waited with easy patience that the man should close the doors and leave
    him alone with his fair cousin.</p>
  <p>He scarcely touched her fingers with his lips and she said quickly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas kind to come at once. You were at home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waiting for this summons,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you knew?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since last evening!&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>He was of a tall, somewhat fleshy build, the face&mdash;good-looking enough&mdash;rendered
    heavy by many dissipations and nights of vigil and pleasure. His eyes were
    very prominent, surrounded by thick lids, furtive and quick in expression
    like those of a fox on the alert. The heavy features&mdash;nose, chin and
    lips&mdash;were, so &rsquo;twas said, an inheritance from a Jewish ancestress,
    the daughter of a rich Levantine merchant, brought into England by one of
    the Ayloffes who graced this country in the days of Richard III.</p>
  <p>It was the money of this same ancestress which had enriched the impoverished
    family, and had at the same time sown the seeds of that love of luxury and
    display which had ruined the present bearer of the ancient name. From that
    same Oriental ancestress Sir John Ayloffe had no doubt inherited his cleverness
    at striking a bargain as well as his taste for showy apparel. He was always
    dressed in the latest fashion, and had already adopted the new modes lately
    imported from France, the long vest tied in with a gaily coloured sash, the
    shorter surcoat with its rows of gilded buttons, and oh! wonder of wonders,
    the huge French periwig, with its many curls which none knew better than
    did Sir John how to toss and to wallow when he bowed.</p>
  <p>His fat fingers were covered with rings, and the buckles on his shoes glittered
    with shiny stones.</p>
  <p>Julia, quivering with eagerness and excitement which she took no pains to
    conceal, now dragged Sir John down to a settee beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You knew that my lord of Stowmaries was a married man, and that I
    have been fooled beyond the powers of belief!&rdquo; she ejaculated, whilst
    her angry eyes searched his furtive ones, in a vain endeavour to read his
    thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard my lord&rsquo;s miserable story from his own lips last night,&rdquo;  reiterated
    Sir John.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! He told it then over the supper table, between two bumpers of
    wine, to a set of boon companions as drunken, as dissolute as himself? Man!
    man! why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; she cried almost hysterically, for
    she had suffered a great deal to-day, her nerves were overwrought and threatening
    to give way in the face of this new and horrible vision conjured up by her
    own excited imagination. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you describe the whole scene
    to me&mdash;the laughter which the tale evoked, the sneers directed against
    the unfortunate woman who has been so hideously fooled?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ayloffe listened to the tirade with the patience of a man who has had many
    dealings with the gentle if somewhat highly-strung sex. He patted her twitching
    fingers with his own soft, pulpy palm, and waited until her paroxysm of weeping
    had calmed down, then he said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, dear coz, the scene as it occurred round the most exclusive
    table at the Three Bears, in no way bears resemblance to the horrible picture
    which your fevered fancy has conjured up. My lord of Stowmaries told his
    pitiable tale in the midst of awed and sympathetic silence, broken only by
    brief exclamations of friendship and pity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my name was not mentioned?&rdquo; she asked, mollified but still
    incredulous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not save in the deepest respect,&rdquo; he replied, whilst a line
    of sarcasm quickly repressed rose to his fleshy lips. &ldquo;How could you
    suppose the reverse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, mayhap, since women were not present. But they will hear
    of it, too, to-day or to-morrow. The story is bound to leak out. My lord
    of Stowmaries&rsquo; attentions to me were known all over the town&mdash;and
    to-day or to-morrow people will talk, will laugh and jeer. Oh! I cannot bear
    it,&rdquo; she added with renewed vehemence; &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I
    verily believe &rsquo;twill drive me mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose and resumed her agitated walk up and down the small room, her clenched
    fists beating one against the other, her trembling lips murmuring with irritating
    persistency.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot bear it&mdash;I cannot bear it. The ridicule&mdash;the ridicule
    will kill me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly she paused in her restlessness, stood in front of Sir John and
    let her tear-dimmed eyes rest on his thick-set face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; she said deliberately, &ldquo;you must find a way
    out of this impasse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must find a way out of it,&rdquo; she reiterated firmly.</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, and said drily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fair Mistress, you may as well ask me to reconcile the Pope of Rome
    and all the hierarchy of the Catholic Church to the idea of flouting the
    sacrament of marriage, by declaring that its bonds are no longer indissoluble.
    The past few centuries have taught us that in Rome they are none too ready
    to do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of such vast schemes,&rdquo; said Julia in tones
    as dry as his had been. &ldquo;I was not thinking either of corrupting the
    Roman Church, or of persuading one of her adherents to rebel against her.
    My lord of Stowmaries has already explained to me,&rdquo; she continued with
    bitter sarcasm, &ldquo;that against the Pope&rsquo;s decision there would
    be no appeal&mdash;he himself would not wish to appeal against it. His love
    for me is apparently not so boundless as I had fondly imagined, its limits
    meseems are traced in Rome. He has given me to understand that his wife&rsquo;s
    people&mdash;those&mdash;those tailors of Paris&mdash;actually hold a promise
    from the Pope that a command will be issued ordering that their daughter
    be installed and acknowledged as Countess of Stowmaries and that without
    any undue delay. Failing which, excommunication for my lord, scandal, disgrace.
    Bah! I know not!&mdash;these Romanists are servile under such tyranny&mdash;and
    we know that not only the Duke of York, but the king himself is at one with
    the Catholics just now. No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;that sort of thing is
    not to be thought on, Cousin, but there are other ways&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her eyes, restless, searching, half-fearful, tried to fix the glance of
    his own. But his shifted uneasily, now responding to her questioning look,
    anon trying to avoid it, as if dreading to comprehend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Other ways, other ways!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;of a truth there
    are many such&mdash;but none of which you, fair Cousin, would care to take
    the risk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;There are no risks
    which I would not run, in order to free the man I love from the trammels
    of an undesired marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cousin John said nothing in reply. His eyes, still furtive in expression,
    were no longer restless. They were fixed upon the beautiful face before him,
    the luminous eyes, the daintily-curved mouth, the rounded chin&mdash;a transparent
    and exquisite mask which scarcely concealed now the strange and tortuous
    thoughts which chased one another behind that white brow, smooth as that
    of a child.</p>
  <p>She held his gaze, willing that he should read those thoughts, wishing him
    to divine them; in fact, to save her the humiliation of framing them into
    words. But as he seemed disinclined to speak, she reiterated with slow and
    deliberate emphasis:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are no risks, Cousin, which I would not run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nobly said,&rdquo; he remarked, without attempting this
    time to conceal the sarcastic smile which played round his sensuous lips. &ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s
    fish! the man whom you have honoured with such sublime devotion is lucky
    beyond compare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A truce on your sneers, Sir John,&rdquo; she retorted imperiously; &ldquo;you
    said that there were several ways whereby that hateful marriage could be
    annulled. What are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir John Ayloffe glanced down the length of his elegant surcoat; with careful
    hand he smoothed out a wrinkle which had appeared in the well-fitting breeches
    just above his knee, he readjusted the set of his fringed scarf, and of his
    lace-edged cravat. All this took time and kept Mistress Julia on tenter hooks,
    the while she felt as if her temples would burst from their throbbing.</p>

  <p>Then, at last, Cousin John looked up at her again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poison,&rdquo; he said drily; &ldquo;an Italian stiletto an you prefer
    that method. An hired assassin in any event&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shudder ran down her spine. Had she really harboured these thoughts herself,
    and had Cousin John merely put her wild imaginings into words? Thus crudely
    put they horrified her&mdash;for the moment&mdash;and she looked down almost
    with loathing on the man who accompanied each grim suggestion with a leer,
    which caused his thick lips to part and to disclose a row of large, uneven
    teeth stained with tobacco juice and giving his face a cruel expression like
    that of a hyena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, there are always means, fair Cousin,&rdquo; continued Sir
    John with pleasing urbanity; &ldquo;it is only a question of money&mdash;and
    of the risks which one is prepared to run. Beyond that, I believe, that the
    task, though difficult, can be accomplished in Paris. There are some amiable
    gentry there ever ready to do your bidding, whatever it may be, provided
    you are generous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She passed the gossamer handkerchief over her dry lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had not thought of crime,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had you not?&rdquo; he said blandly. &ldquo;Yet &rsquo;tis the most
    easy solution of the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there are others,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again she paused, then continued, speaking very low, scarce above a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would help me, of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could certainly go over to Paris,&rdquo; he said with marked hesitation,  &ldquo;always
    providing I were plentifully supplied with money&mdash;a voyage of reconnaissance,
    you understand&mdash;nothing more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which means that you will not help me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The risks are too great, Cousin&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would not care to run them, in order to be of service to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frankly&mdash;no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And suppose, Cousin John,&rdquo; she now said more quietly, once
    more sitting down beside him, &ldquo;supposing, I say for the sake of argument,
    that I were to come to you and tell you that I will give half of my fortune
    to the man who will at this juncture so ordinate matters that my marriage
    with the Earl of Stowmaries once more becomes not only feasible, but inevitable.
    What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;also for the sake of argument,&rdquo; he rejoined blandly, &ldquo;I
    would ask you, fair Cousin, of what your fortune consists.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Squire Peyton left me &pound;20,000 and the principal is still intact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deposited&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bulk of it with Mr. Brooke the goldsmith. He pays me six per
    cent. per year thereon. It hath sufficed for my needs. No one&mdash;except
    you, Cousin, now&mdash;knows the extent of this fortune. Half of it will
    suffice me for pin money, once I am Countess of Stowmaries. My lord would
    marry me&mdash;if he were free&mdash;an I had not a groat to my name, nor
    more than one gown to my back. Ten thousand pounds shall be yours, Cousin,
    if you can bring this about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call it &pound;12,000, Mistress, and it shall be done,&rdquo; he
    said cynically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How will you do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let that be my secret for the nonce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you no advance, remember,&rdquo; she said quickly,
    for she had seen the swift glitter of joy in his eyes, at the first mention
    of money, and she knew full well that she could not count on the most elementary
    feelings of honesty on the part of this unscrupulous gambler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I can do nothing,&rdquo; he concluded decisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only this, fair Cousin, that putting aside the question&mdash;a somewhat
    humiliating one for me, you must admit&mdash;that your refusal to place certain
    funds in advance in my hands, implies a singular and&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;an
    ill-considered want of trust on your part; putting this question aside, I
    say, you must understand that nothing in this present world can be accomplished
    without money, and I am reduced to my last shilling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said that &pound;10,000 shall be yours the day that my
    marriage with Lord Stowmaries is irrevocably settled?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&pound;12,000,&rdquo; he corrected suavely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then, &pound;12,000. We&rsquo;ll have the bond duly writ
    out and signed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you, fair Cousin, will immediately place in my hands a first
    instalment of &pound;2,000.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Failing which?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As I have had the honour to tell you, I can do nothing. This is my
    last word, fair Cousin,&rdquo; he added, seeing that Mistress Julia still
    seemed inclined to hesitate.</p>
  <p>There was silence in the little room for a few seconds, a silence all complete
    save for the solemn ticking of a little French clock over the hearth. Sir
    John Ayloffe lounging on the settee with one firm leg clad in the new-fashioned
    tight breeches stretched out at full length, the other doubled inwards, so
    that the satin shimmered and crackled over his knee, his jewelled hands toying
    with the lace cravat, or with the dark curls of his periwig, looked now the
    picture of supreme indifference.</p>

  <p>It almost seemed as if &pound;12,000 more or less in his vest pocket would
    affect him not at all. But the fleshy lids had half-closed over the prominent
    eyes, and from beneath their folds he was watching the fair young widow,
    who made no attempt to hide her hesitancy and her perturbation.</p>
  <p>He knew quite well that his personality, the weight of his whole individuality,
    would win against her prudence in the end. He was fully aware that among
    the crowd of her several adorers, she had no one to whom she could confide
    her present troubles, no one whose aid she could with so much surety invoke.
    Few were so resourceful, none quite so unscrupulous, as Sir John Ayloffe
    where his own interests were at stake.</p>
  <p>That &pound;12,000 which was to be his price would mean the final ending
    of his shiftless career. He felt himself getting older every day, and the
    thought of what the morrow might bring&mdash;a morrow when he would no longer
    be active and alert, neither amusing nor interesting to those whose company
    was a necessity to his livelihood&mdash;that thought was embittering his
    present life, until at times he wondered whether a self-inflicted sword thrust
    to end a miserable existence were not the most desirable contingency after
    all.</p>
  <p>How he would earn that &pound;12,000 he did not know as yet. His secret
    was that he did not know. But he had lived for the past twenty years in sublime
    ignorance of the various shifts which he might be put to from day to day,
    and he knew that he could trust to his imagination to find a means now, when
    the result would mean security in old age, peace from that eternal war against
    chance&mdash;almost a fortune in these days when money was scarce after the
    great turmoil of civil war.</p>
  <p>Therefore, though he said no more, though he assumed an indifference which
    he was very far from feeling, he not only watched Mistress Julia, but with
    every nerve within him, with all the magnetism of his powerful personality,
    he willed her to accede to his wishes.</p>
  <p>She, feeling this subtle influence in the same manner as in ages to come
    mediums were destined to feel the influence of hypnotic power, she gradually
    yielded to his unspoken desire&mdash;yielded to him whilst believing that
    she held the threads of her own destiny, and that the final decision only
    rested with her.</p>
  <p>Then she rose and went to that same little bureau in the angle of the room,
    at which just an hour ago she had penned so laboriously the missive which
    had summoned Sir John Ayloffe hither. This time, as she sat down to it, she
    took from beneath her kerchief a small key which was fastened round her neck
    by a silk ribbon. With this she opened one of the drawers of the bureau,
    and after another moment of final hesitation she deliberately took a packet
    from the drawer.</p>
  <p>The packet was tied up with green cord; this she untied with a hand that
    trembled somewhat with feverish excitement. Having selected a paper from
    among a number of others, she once more fastened the green cord, replaced
    the packet in the drawer, locked the latter and replaced the key in the folds
    of her gown.</p>
  <p>Then paper in hand she turned back to the settee whereon lolled Sir John
    Ayloffe, and holding the paper out to him, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is an order requesting Master Brooke, goldsmith, of Minchin
    Lane, to hand over to you on my behalf the sum of &pound;2,000.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir John roused himself from his well-studied apathy. He took the paper
    from Mistress Julia&rsquo;s hand, looked at it very carefully, then folded
    it and prepared to slip it in his breast pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, Cousin,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;that if I find that
    you have deceived me in this, that you have deliberately robbed me of this &pound;2,000
    without having any intention or power to help me in my need, that, in such
    a case you will lose the only friend you have in the world. I will turn my
    back on you for ever; you shall never darken the threshold of my door, and
    if I saw you in want or in a debtor&rsquo;s prison, I would not pay one farthing
    to help you in your need. You believe that, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe that a woman thwarted is capable of anything,&rdquo; he
    retorted with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There I think you are right, Cousin,&rdquo; she assented, whilst
    a look of determination which assorted strangely with her otherwise impulsive
    ways marred for a moment the childlike prettiness of her face. &ldquo;You
    would find me very hard and unforgiving, if you cheated me of my hopes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very hard, I doubt not,&rdquo; he said blandly. &ldquo;Did I not
    see a while ago, fair Cousin, your gentle soul taking in with scarce a thought
    of horror my first suggestion of poison or hired assassin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush, man! prate not so lightly of these things. Bah!&rdquo; she
    added with some of her former vehemence, &ldquo;there are other things that
    kill besides poison or stilettos&mdash;things that hurt worse than death&mdash;things
    that no Countess of Stowmaries could endure and live. You have your &pound;2,000,
    man&mdash;go&mdash;go and think&mdash;a fortune an you succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir John Ayloffe smiled. The lady had at last shown to him&mdash;mayhap
    without meaning to do so&mdash;the real desire of her heart. She had also
    set his active brain athinking. As she said, it would be a fortune if he
    succeeded.</p>

  <p>He had placed the valuable paper carefully away in his breast pocket; he
    tapped this pocket gently to feel that it was secure. Then&mdash;as obviously
    the interview must now come to an end&mdash;he rose to go.</p>
  <p>Vague thoughts were already floating in his mind, and when she too rose
    to bid him farewell, and her fevered eyes found his and held them, he responded
    with a look of distinct encouragement.</p>
  <p>Long after Cousin John&rsquo;s footsteps had ceased to echo along the short
    flagged corridor, Mistress Julia Peyton sat musing, whilst a sigh of content
    and of hope ever and anon escaped her lips. Her face was quite serene, her
    expression one of anticipation rather than of trouble. Never for a moment
    did a pang of conscience trouble her. Remember, that the unknown Countess
    of Stowmaries&mdash;the daughter of the Paris tailor&mdash;was but a shadowy
    personality to her. Less than two hours ago, Mistress Julia was not aware
    of her existence.</p>
  <p>Was it wrong then to wish her out of the way? With commendable satisfaction,
    the outraged beauty realised that she felt no direct wish for any bodily
    harm to come to her successful rival. And pray, how many women would have
    had such scruples? A certain feeling of self-righteousness eased Mistress
    Julia&rsquo;s soul at the thought.</p>
  <p>No. She wished the real and only Countess of Stowmaries no bodily harm.
    She had made Cousin John understand that, she hoped. Crime might mean remorse,
    which would be unpleasant, also fear of discovery. Mistress Julia hoped now
    that she had made Cousin John understand quite clearly that she wanted neither
    poison nor hired assassin for the end which she had in view&mdash;not at
    first at any rate&mdash;later on, mayhap&mdash;if other schemes had failed&mdash;</p>
  <p>There are things which hurt worse than death&mdash;and Mistress Julia had
    placed in the hands of an unscrupulous gambler the means whereby such things
    could easily be brought about.</p>
  <p>If such things be crimes, they certainly were not of the kind which troubled
    Mistress Julia&rsquo;s conscience.</p>
  <p>Having settled these abstract points to her own satisfaction, she adjourned
    to her tiring-room and rang for her maid. She told the wench to prepare that
    new butter-coloured satin gown with the pink rosebuds broidered thereon&mdash;a
    vastly becoming gown for setting off the fair Julia&rsquo;s style of beauty&mdash;and
    also the colverteen pinner which had the advantage of making any woman look
    demure. She had her hair redressed in the newest fashion with immense taure
    and puffs which made her small head look wide and her tiny face more childlike
    and innocent than ever.</p>
  <p>She meant to finish the day at the King&rsquo;s Playhouse, there to witness
    a vastly diverting comedy by the late Master Shakespeare. She wished to see
    and to be seen by His Majesty, by the Duke of York, and all London society.
    Knowing that her name would be in everybody&rsquo;s mouth, she wished to
    appear radiant with beauty and good spirits, and in no way concerned with
    the ugly rumours anent the tailor&rsquo;s daughter over in Paris, and the
    ridiculous cock and bull story that my lord of Stowmaries was other than
    engaged to wed Mistress Julia Peyton ere the London season had fully run
    its course.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</b></h2>
  <p>You know the place well enough, or failing yourself&mdash;if so be that
    you are less than three-score years and ten&mdash;then your father would
    remember it well.</p>
  <p>It was situate in the Strand until that time, close to its junction with
    Fleet Street and within a pebble&rsquo;s throw from St. Clements. A tall
    narrow building, raftered and gabled, the timbers painted a dark chocolate
    colour, with alternate lines of a luscious creamy tint rendered mellow with
    the dirt and smoke of London. It stood on that selfsame spot two hundred
    and more years ago, when it was the favourite resort of that band of young
    rakes who adorned the Court of the Merry Monarch.</p>
  <p>It were somewhat difficult to say why my lord of Craye, or Sir Anthony Wykeham,
    or the Earl of Stowmaries had chosen this very unprepossessing tavern for
    their evening assemblies. The exterior, as your father could tell you, was
    certainly not inviting, for the gables were all askew, the stories low and
    widening one over another, all awry as if ready to fall, the front door,
    too, was cracked from corner to corner, nor were the public rooms much more
    alluring. In the coffee room the window with its small panes of bottle glass
    hardly allowed any daylight to filter in; the floor had once been neatly
    covered in bricks, but now most of these were broken in half, with pieces
    of them missing, showing little three-cornered holes which suggested dirt-grubbing
    insects and storehouses of dust.</p>
  <p>There were other disadvantages, too, about the place, which should have
    scared off any fastidious young man however bent on pleasure he might be,
    but we have it on M. Misson&rsquo;s own authority&mdash;and he was no great
    admirer of things English and speaks somewhat ill-naturedly of everything
    he saw during his voyage&mdash;that the cellars at the sign of the Three
    Bears were exceedingly well stocked with Spanish and Rhenish wines and even
    with French brandies which were heady and vastly pleasing to the palate first
    and to the temper afterwards.</p>
  <p>We are also told by that same highly-critical French traveller that Mistress
    Janet Foorde, wife of the landlord of the Three Bears, could turn out a better
    supper than any other cook in London, and fashioned a lamprey pie, or a <i>fricass&eacute;e</i> of
    rabbits and chickens, in such a delicious manner that once eaten it could
    never be forgotten.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, we know it for a fact that in this year of grace 1678
    the Tavern in the Strand at the sign of the Three Bears was, every evening
    after the hour of eight, frequented by the very &eacute;lite of London society.
    Supper was served in one of the smaller rooms at a table around which sat
    those same gentlemen who in the earlier part of the day had graced His Majesty&rsquo;s
    levee, or the Court of the unhappy Queen, or that narrow circle which stood
    as a phalanx round the person of the unpopular Duke of York.</p>
  <p>The assembly purported to be political. There was more than a mere suggestion
    of Roman Catholic discontent freely expressed around that congenial board,
    and it was well known that on more than one occasion the King himself had
    been present at these gatherings&mdash;incognito, of course&mdash;his identity
    known only to his own intimate friends.</p>
  <p>But the discussion of the political and social position of Roman Catholics
    in England, was, we must admit, not the primary object of the nightly reunions
    in the private room at the Three Bears. Supper after the play in the King&rsquo;s
    House came first, then dice, hazard or the more fashionable game of Spanish
    ombre, all well interlarded with the chief gossip and scandals of the day.</p>
  <p>Reputations for beauty, wit or morals were made or marred around that table
    in the small room; the latest fashions were discussed, which to adopt and
    which to reject. The young fops fresh from the Grand Tour here recounted
    their impressions, displayed&mdash;for approval or disfavour&mdash;the latest
    modes from Paris, the new surcoats, the monstrous periwigs, the very latest
    notion in lace cravats.</p>
  <p>Here, too, the young rakes aired their&mdash;oft scandalous&mdash;literary
    efforts, bonsmots unfit for ladies&rsquo; ears were invented and retailed,
    and we all know that my lord of Rochester never thought of publishing verse
    or prose without first submitting it to the censorship of the select party
    at the Three Bears.</p>
  <p>We may take it that Sir John Ayloffe&mdash;despite the vicissitudes of fortune
    which had brought him to the pass of empty pockets and of unavowable shifts&mdash;was
    still a <i>persona grata</i> at the nightly assemblies of the distinguished
    tavern, for some few hours after his interview with his beautiful kinswoman
    on this memorable evening of February 8th, 1678, we see him turning his footsteps
    unhesitatingly in the direction of the &ldquo;Three Bears&rdquo; in the Strand.</p>
  <p>Closely wrapped in his cloak, for the wind blew bitter gusts, he bent his
    head against the driving rain as he walked. The rickety door of the tavern
    stood invitingly open and as one accustomed to the place Sir John with quickened
    steps entered the narrow passage.</p>
  <p>Immediately his nostrils were greeted with the pungent odour of onions and
    of boiling fat, and his ears with loud shouts of merriment, which raised
    a boisterous echo in the tumble-down building and seemed to make the walls
    totter on their insecure foundation.</p>
  <p>This hilarious noise, wherein songs, sung in hoarse voices very much out
    of tune, mingled with violent outbursts of prolonged laughter and with volleys
    of full-toned oaths, proceeded from behind a door on the cracked panels of
    which the ten letters of the word Coffee Room tumbled one against the other,
    like a row of drunken men.</p>
  <p>For a moment Sir John paused just outside that door, bending his ear to
    listen in an attitude of deep attention, like one trying to catch one special
    sound from out that confused babel which went on within.</p>
  <p>The passage in which he stood had been wholly dark but for the dim, uncertain
    light which came from a brass lanthorn suspended from the blackened ceiling
    just above his head. Sir John waited a second or two, until a loud and merry
    shout of laughter rose above the bibulous din. It was the laughter which
    comes from a young and lusty throat, the laughter of careless irresponsibility
    and of thoughtless debauchery.</p>
  <p>It seemed to be also the sound for which Sir John had been waiting in the
    ill-lighted passage outside, for now he threw up his head and flung his cloak
    back with a gesture of satisfaction, whilst a strange laugh, which had but
    little of merriment in it and a great deal of contempt, broke from his lips
    as an echo to the light-hearted gaiety beyond.</p>

  <p>Sir John now continued his way, past the Coffee Room to a door beyond the
    stairway at the extreme end of the passage. This he threw open without further
    ceremony and found himself in that small room of the tavern, wherein Master
    Foorde&mdash;the host&mdash;served his more distinguished guests. As a rule
    merriment and noise, equal at least to that which obtained in the public
    coffee room, reigned in this private sanctum: many would have said that the
    great and courtly gentlemen who foregathered here indulged usually in carouses
    and drunken orgies which would have put the more plebeian merrimakers to
    shame.</p>
  <p>But to-night, at the moment that Ayloffe entered the room, a kind of sullen
    silence reigned therein. Through the thick haze of tobacco smoke which hung
    like a grey pall above the feebly flickering light of some half dozen tallow
    candles, the newcomer could perceive four faces&mdash;flushed with wine and
    heavy meats, dimly outlined against the full greyness of drab-coloured walls,
    and dark oak wainscotting.</p>
  <p>The candles themselves guttering in their sockets threw forth fillets of
    thick grimy smoke which mingled with the fumes of tobacco, and helped to
    cast fantastic and trembling shadows on fine cloth surcoats and vests of
    broidered silk. From the coffee room immediately adjoining the parlour came&mdash;echoing
    faintly through the thick timbered walls&mdash;the shouts of laughter, the
    loudly-uttered oaths, the ribald songs of the merry company, and at intervals,
    against the tiny panes of the small casement window the dull patter of the
    rain or the occasional distant call of the watchman challenging an evening
    prowler.</p>
  <p>In the furthest angle of the room, my lord Rochester seated in the chair
    of honour had apparently been reading aloud to this moody company, the expressions
    of his latest poetic fancy. He was in the act of rolling up his manuscript
    and tying it up with a length of rose-coloured ribbon, but his face usually
    so self-satisfied and so gay bore an expression of keen discontent.</p>
  <p>As a rule his poems&mdash;highly prized by the king and the ladies&mdash;were
    listened to here among the circle of his intimates with the greatest delight
    and oft with noisy appreciation. But on this occasion he had been quite unable
    to hold the attention of his audience, and even whilst he read his most impassioned
    verses he could not help but notice that all eyes were fixed on the young
    Earl of Stowmaries, who sat with his head resting in his hand, leaning forward
    half across the table in an attitude of the deepest dejection.</p>
  <p>The young man had arrived late, only joining the convivial party when supper
    was already at an end, and Mistress Foorde had removed the remains of the
    finest venison pie which she had ever concocted.</p>
  <p>He had taken his place at the table after a curt and sullen nod to the company
    who had greeted him most sympathetically. He had declared himself unable
    to eat, but had ordered a bottle of strong sherry and also a bottle of brandy,
    which expensive liquid&mdash;so &rsquo;twas said afterwards by some of the
    company present&mdash;he freely mixed with sherry and drank very plentifully.</p>
  <p>The story of his unfortunate early marriage and of his hopeless passion
    for Mistress Julia Peyton had somehow or other leaked out, and before his
    arrival had been freely discussed in a facetious and irresponsible spirit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Rowley liked the tale, and was vastly amused thereby,&rdquo; Lord
    Rochester had said, thus unceremoniously referring to the merry King of England. &ldquo;I
    told it him in all its bearings, and he laughed immoderately at thought of
    a tailor&rsquo;s wench being actually married to my lord of Stowmaries, and
    expecting to be presented at Court. But after that first outburst of hilarity
    he looked very grave and said that the matter must presently be arranged
    to the satisfaction of all those concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how can that be done?&rdquo; queried Sir Anthony Wykeham, who
    was a strict Catholic and liked not this light talk of breaking marriage
    vows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! money will do a great deal nowadays,&rdquo; sighed Sir Knaith
    Bullock, a young Irishman but scantily blessed with the commodity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; quoth my lord Rochester with easy bonhomme, &ldquo;I
    am on the side of the angels. Mistress Julia Peyton is the most beautiful
    woman in London. She at any rate would be worthy to become chatelaine of
    Maries Castle and to be our hostess in the many feasts to be given there
    to my lord of Stowmaries&rsquo; friends. As for a tailor&rsquo;s daughter!&mdash;Bah!&mdash;gentlemen,
    I ask you, can we see ourselves being entertained by a tailor&rsquo;s daughter?
    She would feed us on pottage and small beer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A roar of laughter greeted this expos&eacute; of the situation. Lord Rochester
    had of a truth voiced the opinion of the majority.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; protested Sir Anthony Wykeham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush man,&rdquo; interrupted my lord with scant ceremony. &ldquo;I
    know what you would say. The marriage sacrament and all that&mdash;Odd&rsquo;s
    fish! we are none of us heathens, and ye Papists are not the only ones, by
    my faith! who know how to keep vows. But there are other ways of unravelling
    an undesired tangle&mdash;and old Rowley had no thought of suggesting irreligious
    measures&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said one of the others suddenly, &ldquo;I hear Stow
    maries&rsquo;  voice outside. I fancy he&rsquo;ll not be in a mood for jesting
    over the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was at this point that Stowmaries had entered the room. There was no
    doubt that he looked excessively glum, and the first attempts at treating
    his disappointed love in a hilarious manner were met with such obvious moodiness,
    that gradually the subject was dropped, and the company, who at supper had
    been fairly numerous, soon began to dwindle away, each seeking in turn more
    cheerful society than that of this sober young man who seemed determined
    to look at his own future life in its very blackest aspect.</p>
  <p>Only Lord Rochester remained awhile longer for he wanted an audience for
    his latest poem, also Sir Anthony Wykeham&mdash;an intimate friend of my
    lord Stowmaries&mdash;and Sir Knaith Bullock, an irresponsible youth who
    seemed to scent an adventure in the romantic child-marriage, and vaguely
    hoped to find sport therein.</p>
  <p>These three gentlemen with Lord Stowmaries himself formed the little group
    around the table of the private parlour at the &ldquo;Three Bears&rdquo; at
    the moment that Sir John Ayloffe entered it.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8</b></h2>
  <p>With a quick glance thrown on each of the four faces, shrewd Sir John had
    quickly appraised the mood of this small clique. Stowmaries in sullen rage
    against the whole world because of this thwarting of his most cherished desire,
    Rochester and the Irishman, flippant and eager for sport, with Wykeham as
    the sobering influence, the self-constituted guardian of religious obligations.</p>
  <p>It was also obvious to this keen observer of other people&rsquo;s moods
    that there would be no need for circumlocution. Though silence reigned in
    the room, the subject of Stowmaries&rsquo; marriage was uppermost in the
    minds of his friends.</p>
  <p>Sir John therefore, having thrown aside his hat and cloak, went boldly up
    to the table and greeting the others with easy familiarity, he placed one
    fleshy hand on Stowmaries&rsquo; shoulder and said abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush man! be not so downhearted. My faith on it! have I not seen
    worse plights even than yours? Yet from which a man of daring and resource
    soon found a means of extricating himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The interruption was a welcome one, for though Sir John Ayloffe was no longer
    very popular with the gilded clique of young and noble rakes, since he was
    known to be at his last resources and was oft in sore straits to pay his
    gaming debts, nevertheless at this moment his lusty, cheery voice helped
    to dissipate the gloom which was such an unusual atmosphere for these ribald
    pleasure-seekers to breathe, and one or two voices with obvious signs of
    relief cordially invited the newcomer to sit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you, too, know our friend&rsquo;s melancholy story?&rdquo; queried
    Lord Rochester as he pushed with hospitable intent a mug of wine in the direction
    of Ayloffe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the latter. &ldquo;Mistress Julia Peyton is my
    kinswoman.  &rsquo;Tis from her I heard the tale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowmaries&rsquo; frown grew even darker than before. He liked not the suggestion
    thus implied, the more than obvious hint of this second sentimental complication
    in his life.</p>
  <p>Sir John, in the meanwhile, had selected a chair, which was less rickety
    than most, and sat down deliberately in such a position that not one of the
    flickering and uncertain rays of candle light touched his face or illumined
    its expression.</p>
  <p>He took the cup of wine offered him by my lord Rochester and drank it down
    slowly and at one draught, the while a few ribald remarks flew across the
    table. Ayloffe&rsquo;s advent seemed certainly to have brought a new atmosphere
    into the room. Despite Stowmaries&rsquo; frown and Wykeham&rsquo;s protests,
    Rochester and Sir Knaith took up the lighter side of the past events; they
    refused to appreciate the solemnity of the subject or the serious obligations
    resulting from that solemn sacrament of matrimony performed between children
    over eighteen years ago.</p>
  <p>Sir John waited patiently whilst a volley of somewhat coarse jests was fired
    at the gloomy hero of the romantic adventure, and until he saw that Stowmaries
    was on the verge of losing his temper, and Wykeham on the point of quarrelling
    with Bullock.</p>
  <p>Then he pushed the empty cup away from him and leaning forward across the
    table, he broke in quietly: &ldquo;Nay Sir Anthony,&rdquo; he said with pleasing
    urbanity, &ldquo;we all know what you would say. &lsquo;Sdeath! an I mistake
    not you have harped on that string passing often in the last hour or so,
    and we all know too that Lord Stowmaries is not desirous of seeing it snap.
    But I maintain that if a gentleman is placed in so terrible a predicament
    as is my lord, then it is the duty of all his friends to try and effect an
    honourable rescue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The earnestness with which he spoke had silenced the jocose as well as the
    moody tongues. But Sir Anthony Wykeham now protested hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The sacrament of marriage
    cannot be set aside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only under certain conditions,&rdquo; corrected Sir John.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks this is braggart&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; muttered young Bullock
    who had no love for the older man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How will you do it?&rdquo; queried Stowmaries with moody hopelessness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With his tongue chiefly,&rdquo; sneered the Irishman.</p>
  <p>But Ayloffe seemed in no way abashed by the hostility, which his statement
    had evoked; he returned the sarcastic or angry glances levelled at him with
    a stare of assurance.</p>
  <p>Leaning heavily upon the table, his prominent eyes fixed boldly on the over-excited
    faces before him, he looked a strange contrast to the small, chattering crowd
    which was grouped around him. Unlike the others, he had supped soberly at
    home and drunk little or no wine; his head was clear, his tongue glib, and
    the only uncertainty apparent in his demeanour was that with which from time
    to time he seemed to be listening to the noise in the next room; then a look
    of vague doubt would suddenly overshadow his steady gaze and cause a more
    furtive, more anxious look to creep into his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, gentlemen,&rdquo; he resumed after a slight pause vaguely smiling
    in a condescending manner like one who tells an obvious fact to a child, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    no braggart&rsquo;s talk to speak of saving a friend from the most dire calamity
    that can befall any man. I repeat most emphatically that this can be done,
    effectually and easily and without interfering with any of those religious
    scruples which do my lord of Stowmaries and his friend here so much honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke so quietly, so confidently and with such an air of certitude that
    instinctively the sneering tongues ceased to aim their shafts at him and
    four pairs of eyes were now fixed upon the speaker, who with a calm gesture
    of indifference was readjusting the lace of his cravat.</p>
  <p>He waited thus for awhile like the true entertainer who husbands his effects;
    he waited until the circle round him drew closer and closer, until four pairs
    of elbows rested on the table and flagons and mugs were impatiently pushed
    aside.</p>
  <p>Sir Anthony Wykeham was the last to hold aloof, but even he said at last
    with a distinct ring of excitement in his voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell us more fully what you mean, man! Cannot you see that Stowmaries
    is devoured with impatience?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An impatience which I am over-anxious to relieve,&rdquo; rejoined
    Ayloffe imperturbably, &ldquo;but firstly let me ask Lord Stowmaries himself&mdash;who
    I assert is a wealthy man&mdash;whether he would not give a good tenth of
    his fortune to be conveniently rid of an unwelcome wife, without hindrance
    to his belief or conscience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would give half my fortune, good Sir John,&rdquo; sighed Stowmaries
    dolefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half is too much, good my lord,&rdquo; responded Sir John blandly. &ldquo;Popular
    rumour deems your lordship worth some four hundred thousand pounds in solid
    cash, besides the rent rolls of half Hertfordshire. Methinks one fourth of
    that should purchase the freedom which you seek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you minded to earn that fortune, Sir John?&rdquo; asked the other
    not without a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my lord, I am neither young enough, nor sufficiently well-favoured
    for that desirable task,&rdquo; retorted Sir John imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have looks or favours to do with it all? Odd&rsquo;s fish!&rdquo;  growled
    Stowmaries more vehemently, and bringing a clenched fist crashing down upon
    the table so that mugs and bottles rattled, &ldquo;meseems that you, Sir
    John, are trying to fool me, God help me! are even trying to bring ridicule
    upon my sorrow! By the Mass, sir, if that be so, you&rsquo;ll not find me
    in a mood to be trifled with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good my lord, I pray you to calm your temper. Am I a man to trifle
    with your feelings? Have I not professed myself to be your friend? am I not
    the kinsman of the lady whom you have honoured with your addresses? On mine
    honour I have her welfare at heart even more so than yours. Can you wonder
    that I should wish to see you wed her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shrewd Sir John had played a trump card. There was no denying the logic
    of his statement. He had owned to having much at stake, yet had done so with
    no lack of dignity. With a certain graciousness not altogether free as yet
    from his original surliness, Lord Stowmaries owned himself in the wrong.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must pardon my evil temper, Sir John,&rdquo; he said with a self-deprecating
    sigh, &ldquo;for I am vastly troubled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This brief interlude had but whetted the curiosity of the others. From Sir
    John&rsquo;s manner and mode of speech it was fully evident now that his
    was no empty talk, but that he had assuredly come here this night, with some
    definite plan for what he termed the welfare of his kinswoman, which no doubt
    he had much at heart.</p>
  <p>The idea pleased these young pleasure-seekers more and more; they cared
    of a truth but little for the troubles of their friends, but there was now
    a twinkle in Ayloffe&rsquo;s eyes which vaguely suggested to them the thought
    of intrigue, mayhap of some adventure, quite unavowable, possibly highly
    scandalous, which would have that unknown tailor&rsquo;s daughter for its
    victim.</p>
  <p>Such adventures were the delight of the merry monarch who now sat upon the
    English throne, whose advent had been so earnestly desired, whose personality
    had been so ardently worshipped. He it was who set the fashion for those
    gallant episodes which were the boast and delectation of men and the shame
    and the sorrow of women. But for him and the example set by him I doubt if
    Sir John Ayloffe would ever have thought of formulating proposals which should
    have put his present companions to the blush, and which carried subsequently
    in their train agonies of remorse and of disgrace, wounded honour and more
    than one broken heart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9</b></h2>
  <p>Sir John Ayloffe leaned back in his chair, and satisfied that he once more
    held the close attention of the company, he resumed pleasantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you, good my lord, and all of you gallant gentlemen grant me
    five minutes wherein to place before you the situation as it at present stands?
    Here is my lord of Stowmaries tied by so-called indissoluble marriage vows
    to a bride whom he doth not desire for wife, and whom he last saw borne away
    kicking and screaming in the arms of a waiting wench. And there over in Paris
    is the daughter of a worthy tailor, a girl born in a back shop, presumably
    ill-favoured and certainly vulgar, but who has pretensions of being Countess
    of Stowmaries <i>de facto</i> as well as <i>de jure</i>. She it was who eighteen
    years ago was as aforesaid borne away kicking and screaming in the arms of
    a waiting wench. She was then not much more than twelve months of age, and
    has not since that moment seen my lord of Stowmaries here, our gracious,
    if&mdash;momentarily&mdash;somewhat troubled friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sneering grunt from Sir Knaith Bullock, a groan from Stowmaries and a
    murmur of assent from the others were audible whilst Sir John paused for
    breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Catholic Church for which we all have deep respect,&rdquo;  continued
    Ayloffe, &ldquo;doth not allow that the bonds of matrimony thus contracted
    eighteen years ago shall be severed just because my lord of Stowmaries doth
    not happen for the moment to have a desire for the tailor&rsquo;s daughter;
    she having done naught to merit repudiation, since her being carried away
    kicking and screaming from the presence of her lord when her age had not
    reached fifteen months, doth not constitute a serious offence in the eyes
    of the law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We know all that, man, we know all that,&rdquo; quoth Stowmaries
    moodily, &ldquo;and by the Mass you repeat yourself like a country parson
    in the pulpit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gently, good my lord,&rdquo; rejoined Ayloffe imperturbably. &ldquo;What
    I have to say is a somewhat delicate matter. I am dealing with a Countess
    of Stowmaries&mdash;and if you did not accept my scheme&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused and shrugged his shoulders in token of self-deprecation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may not after all meet with your favour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out with it, man&mdash;out with it,&rdquo; came, partly gaily, wholly
    impatiently from every side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis simple enough,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;but were easier
    to say an you, gentlemen, would help me by guessing&mdash;My lord of Stowmaries
    hath not seen his bride, nor was he seen by her, since she was little more
    than a year old&mdash;that is so, my lord, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; assented Stowmaries curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impressions at that age are not lasting. Infantile memory doth not
    hold an image. We may assume that if the tailor&rsquo;s daughter were placed
    in the presence of&mdash;er&mdash;of any gentleman of noble bearing, she
    would not know if he were her lord&mdash;or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence around the table now. Neither assent nor dissent followed
    Ayloffe&rsquo;s last words. On the face of the young Irishman curiosity still
    remained impressed. The suggestion so slightly hinted at had not yet reached
    his inner consciousness; on that of Lord Rochester comprehension had just
    begun to dawn, a sense of astonishment plainly struggled with one of doubt.
    But Sir Anthony Wykeham almost imperceptibly drew his chair somewhat away
    from the table.</p>
  <p>Lord Stowmaries in the meanwhile kept his eyes steadily fixed on those of
    Sir John. They expressed neither doubt nor astonishment, only intense excitement,
    an obvious desire to hear that hint more fully explained. It was his hoarse
    mutter &ldquo;Go on! curse you&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you go on?&rdquo; that
    first broke the momentary silence which had fallen over the small assembly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; rejoined Ayloffe blandly, &ldquo;I see that you, at least,
    my lord, have already taken me. Is not my scheme vastly simple? The tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter awaits her lord. He comes. She falls into his arms, and after the
    usual festivities in the back shop of her estimable parents, the bridegroom
    takes his bride home to far-off England. But mark what hath occurred&mdash;it
    was not my lord of Stowmaries who had gone to claim his bride, but some other
    man who prompted by his passion for the tailor&rsquo;s beautiful daughter,
    a passion&mdash;we might even suppose&mdash;encouraged by the lady herself,
    had impersonated the bridegroom and snatched the golden prize despite my
    lord of Stowmaries and the most solemn vows of matrimony contracted eighteen
    years ago. Imagine the result: the shame, the crying scandal! My lord of
    Stowmaries is of a surety no longer bound to acknowledge a wife whose very
    name will have become a byword for every gossip to peck at, and whose virtue
    hath already been the toy of an adventurer as unscrupulous as he was daring.
    Not the Catholic Church, not the law of England, nor the decree of the Pope
    would enforce the original marriage vows after that. I give you my word,
    gentlemen, that my lord of Stowmaries will be granted leave by every high
    tribunal, spiritual or temporal, to repudiate the wench who had thus disgraced
    his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir John Ayloffe had long finished speaking and silence still reigned all
    around him. Even the noise in the next room seemed for the moment unaccountably
    to have ceased. Folk say that when such silences occur in merry company,
    angels fly across the room, and the flutter of their wings can distinctly
    be heard. What angels then were these who haunted the private room of the &ldquo;Three
    Bears&rdquo; now? What record of ignominy and dishonour did they mark upon
    the tablets of infinity when with gentle flutter of wings they passed silently
    by? To the credit of all these gentlemen here present be it said, that their
    first feeling was one of shame, when they fully understood the dastardly
    suggestion which Sir John was making to one of themselves; but the shame
    was not acute enough to produce horrified repudiation.</p>
  <p>Sir Anthony Wykeham certainly still held aloof, but Stowmaries had not winced.
    That he understood the suggestion to the full, there could be no doubt. His
    face had flushed to the roots of his hair, his fingers were fidgeting nervously
    against one another and excitement verging on intoxication caused his eyes
    to glow with an unnatural inward fire. His thoughts had flown straight back
    to the prettily furnished parlour in Holborn Row, to Mistress Julia Peyton&rsquo;s
    violet eyes and the exquisite scent of her white hands when he had pressed
    them to his lips. His love for her&mdash;call it passion or desire an you
    will&mdash;had grown in intensity as the obstacle which separated him from
    her had seemed more and more insurmountable. In the past few hours that same
    passion had reached a stage of fever heat, impatient at control, chafing
    at impotence and longing for satisfaction with all the strength of thwarted
    desire.</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon, Earl of Stowmaries and Riveaulx, had been brought up in
    the hard school of colonial life; in his boyhood he had been denied every
    kind of pleasure and luxury in which the sense of youth revels, through what
    he called an unjust Fate; then suddenly he had seen himself thrown in the
    very lap of Fortune, his every desire satisfied and his every whim made law.
    The change was sudden enough to throw off its balance a more firm character
    than that of the son of Captain Kestyon&mdash;spendthrift, profligate, a
    rogue from temperament. Like his father&rsquo;s, Rupert&rsquo;s was essentially
    a weak nature. He had never attempted to fight Fate, when Fate was against
    him. When Fortune smiled, he took everything she offered him without attempt
    at restraint;&mdash;and the jade had become very lavish with her gifts to
    the young outcast who awhile ago had often enough been obliged to tighten
    his belt against the gnawing pangs of hunger.</p>
  <p>He had found friends, followers, sycophants; had been favoured by royalty
    and smiled on by beauty, but Mistress Peyton was the first passion in his
    life. He had flirted with her for months, made easy love to her for weeks,
    but he had not realised that he loved her until twenty-four hours ago when
    he knew that she was lost to him.</p>
  <p>The knowledge that here was the chief desire of his heart, and that this
    desire he could not gratify, despite his position, his personality and his
    wealth, almost unhinged his mind. It was two years now since he had exercised
    any self-denial. He had lost all knowledge of that useful art, and was determined
    not to learn it again.</p>
  <p>The day on which he heard that through an appalling catastrophe, which had
    swept his kindred into the sea and broken the heart of an old man, he, Rupert
    Kestyon, the penniless son of a spendthrift father, had become rich, influential,
    one of the greatest gentlemen in the kingdom, he had said with a sigh of
    genuine satisfaction: &ldquo;Now I mean to live!&rdquo; and with him living
    meant solely the gratification of his every wish. Now he saw his greatest
    wish in all the world born only to be thwarted.</p>
  <p>It was monstrous, unthinkable! But from that wholesome fear of ecclesiastical
    authority peculiar in those days to men of his creed, he would have rebelled.
    Respect for the Church to which he belonged, dread of a scandal which might
    tarnish the great name he bore, and undermine his pleasant position alone
    caused him to be submissive.</p>
  <p>He was not clever enough to find out a means of freeing himself from irksome
    bonds, and had drained the cup of despair to its bitter dregs without thinking
    or even hoping for an issue out of his misery.</p>
  <p>But now a man spoke&mdash;a man whom in his saner moments he heartily despised,
    whom he knew to be shiftless, unscrupulous, a born gambler&mdash;but yet
    a man who showed him a way out of the quagmire of despair into a possible
    haven of hope.</p>
  <p>He had not been long in catching Ayloffe&rsquo;s meaning. Whilst the others
    doubted he had already seen the possibilities of success. His bride had never
    seen him since consciousness grew into her brain; her parents&rsquo; only
    recollections of himself dated back eighteen years! Why indeed should not
    some other man impersonate the bridegroom, carry the bride away and thus
    forever after leave on her fair maiden name a stain which would render her
    unfit to be acknowledged as the wife of any honourable gentleman?</p>

  <p>How simple it all seemed!</p>
  <p>Unlike his friends here present, Stowmaries saw no shame in the scheme&mdash;no
    shame, let us say to himself! Disgrace to the woman&mdash;yes! but he did
    not know her, and he hated the very thought of her! Disgrace perhaps to the
    scoundrel who would undertake the ignoble treachery! but to the Earl of Stowmaries
    who would sit quietly at home whilst the roguery was being carried on by
    others?&mdash;&rsquo;Sblood! who would suggest such a ridiculous idea?</p>
  <p>His eyes wandered round the table. Sir Anthony Wykeham was no longer frowning
    and Lord Rochester had laughed&mdash;a little nervously perhaps&mdash;but
    no one had actually protested.</p>
  <p>There was no gainsaying the fact that Ayloffe was a rogue to suggest so
    profligate a scheme, but profligacy was all the rage now and vastly pleased
    the King.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Gad, a mad notion!&mdash;But a right merry one!&rdquo; quoth Sir
    Knaith Bullock, himself a rogue and as full of dare-devil schemes as an egg
    is full of meat.</p>
  <p>The remark loudly spoken and accompanied by a blasphemous oath and the loud
    banging of a clenched fist against the table, eased the tension finally.
    Even Wykeham began to laugh. Not one of these young men here had wanted to
    feel ashamed, rather did each one desire to seem a vast deal worse than his
    neighbour. It was no good allowing the recollections of early lessons in
    chivalry to mar the enjoyment of the present merry life; not even if those
    lessons had been taught by a father who had died fighting for King and cause.</p>
  <p>Let the ball of pleasure be set rolling; that ball partly made up of love
    of devilry, partly of ennui seeking for amusement and of contempt for woman&rsquo;s
    virtue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere rare sport!&rdquo; said Rochester.</p>

  <p>Sport! The word acted like magic and shame was completely vanquished by
    the pleasing sense of excitement.</p>
  <p>Bah! what was the virtue, the fair name, the happiness of a tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter worth, in the face of the vastly pleasing entertainment she herself
    would provide for her betters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An ignoble trick to play on a woman,&rdquo; murmured Wykeham.</p>
  <p>But his protest had become very feeble. He saw nothing in the suggestion
    that shocked his religious scruples, for the rest he cared but little. The
    victim was only a tailor&rsquo;s daughter after all, and Stowmaries&mdash;his
    friend&mdash;would not be the one to repudiate his marriage vows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! a tailor&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo; was the gist of the argument
    in favour of the scheme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She shall have full compensation,&rdquo; quoth my lord Stowmaries
    somewhat tonelessly, for his throat felt parched and his tongue seemed to
    be several sizes too large for his mouth.</p>
  <p>He drank down a large bumper full of sherry into which Ayloffe had unobtrusively
    thrown a dash of raw brandy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten, gentlemen,&rdquo; now said gallant Sir John lustily, &ldquo;that
    my lord of Stowmaries will give seventy thousand pounds to the friend who
    will help him in his need. A fortune methinks, which should tempt any young
    gallant in search of romantic adventure and a pretty wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the details, man! the details!&rdquo; came from every side, &ldquo;surely
    you have thought of them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And of the risks!&rdquo; suggested Lord Rochester, who was practical,
    and who had oft suffered because of his gallant adventures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are no risks, gentlemen,&rdquo; quoth Sir John Ayloffe, &ldquo;not
    to us at any rate, nor yet to my lord Stowmaries. As for the tailor and his
    family, believe me they will be so covered with ridicule, that they will
    not cause his lordship a moment&rsquo;s anxiety. Just think on it! To give
    away one&rsquo;s daughter to a man who is not her husband! to greet him with
    festivities and merrimaking, to kill the fatted calf in honour of the man
    who brings dishonour into one&rsquo;s home! Nay! Nay! The breeches-maker
    of Paris will have cause to keep silent after the adventure. The maid perchance
    will retire into a convent, and the gallant adventurer can brave the world
    in comfort with seventy thousand pounds in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo! Well said!&mdash;But the details?&mdash;how will you work,
    it, Ayloffe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obviously the scheme was commending itself more and more to these over-heated
    brains. There were no shame-faced looks round the table now. Stowmaries did
    not speak; his excitement was too keen to find vent in words, and he was
    shrewd enough to realise at once that Ayloffe did not mean to give away the
    details of his plans to this trio of young addle-pated rakes.</p>
  <p>But cries of &ldquo;The details, man, the details!&rdquo; became more and
    more insistent. Sir John, glass in hand, at last rose in response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The details are simple enough, gentlemen, and now that I have your
    approbation, I will be quick enough in working them out. In the meanwhile
    let us drink to the gallant adventurer who must help us in our scheme. We
    do not yet know his name, who he is or whence he comes; the fairy Prince
    who will free my lord Stowmaries from irksome bondage and the tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter from the fetters of a respectable home. What we do know is that
    this Prince must be young, else he could not pass for milor of Stowmaries,
    he must be well-favoured, else the lady might fight shy of him; but he may
    be as poor as the proverbial church mouse, since seventy thousand pounds,
    and the fortune of the richest tailor in Paris are jointly to be his. Come,
    gentlemen, will you take my toast?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Loud banging of pewter mugs against the deal table greeted this merry sally.
    The young men jumped to their feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To him! To the unknown!&rdquo; they shouted laughing with one accord.
    There were loud calls for Master Foorde, and confused orders for more Spanish
    wine. Sir John called for brandy, and anon when the worthy hosteler filled
    the bumpers all round the table, Ayloffe followed him adding brandy here
    and there to the wine, laughingly insistent, praising the quality of the
    liquor for inducing to gaiety and all the elegant qualities of amiable drunkenness
    so fashionable in a gentleman of the period.</p>
  <p>He was quite clever enough not to make any further direct allusions to the
    scheme, the realisation of which meant the transference of twelve thousand
    pounds from Mistress Julia Peyton&rsquo;s pocket into his own. So far he
    had gained the first stake in the game which he had set himself to play,
    and was content for the moment merely to addle still further the heads of
    these young reprobates by wild talks of adventure, and sly allusions to the
    delights of coming scandal, mixed with sweeping sarcasm directed at feminine
    virtue in general and the morals of the Paris bourgeoisie in particular.</p>
  <p>He knew well enough that Stowmaries was at one with him by now, but that
    he never would have succeeded in persuading the young man to enter into such
    villainous schemes, if he had been alone with him.</p>
  <p>Away from the glamour of his rakish friends, of the atmosphere of the tavern,
    of the smell of wine and tobacco, Stowmaries&rsquo; better nature and the
    inherited instincts of honour would have rebelled against the roguery. Any
    of these young men here present would individually have repudiated the monstrous
    proposal whilst collectively they were over-ready to trample on any nascent
    idea of chivalry, each one ashamed to be called squeamish or Puritanical
    by the other. There was nothing really depraved in these young men, only
    a desire to outdo each other in profligacy, in a show of anti-Puritanism,
    the immediate outcome of the enforced restraint of the past generation.</p>
  <p>Ayloffe knew this, and, therefore, he had chosen the supper hour, and the
    presence of a select number of the worst rakes in London&mdash;Rochester
    and Bullock&mdash;for testing Stowmaries&rsquo; willingness to enter into
    his own villainous scheme. He wanted the support of confused brains, of rowdy
    excitement, of shouts and of laughter to drown the preliminary call of conscience.
    This once smothered, would probably never lift a warning voice again, and
    details could be comfortably settled in private later on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe me, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said gaily, &ldquo;that that tailor&rsquo;s
    minx will thank us all on her knees for the entertainment which we will provide
    for her. Odd&rsquo;s fish and I mistake not she hath but little stomach for
    becoming an honourable British matron, and you may be sure that &rsquo;tis
    only her parents who force her into an unwelcome marriage. We shall be the
    rescuers of beauty in distress, and will provide the wench with such an adventure
    as will draw the eyes of half Europe upon her and give her that notoriety
    which all women prize far beyond those virtues which are only vaunted by
    the old and ugly ones of their own sex. A bumper on it, gentlemen! I pledge
    the tailor&rsquo;s minx, ill-favoured though she be&mdash;my word on that!
    she&rsquo;ll become the talk of London&mdash;I drink to her adventure&mdash;and
    to the bold man who will share in it&mdash;By my halidame, were I but twenty
    years younger, I&rsquo;d apply for the post myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ayloffe&rsquo;s irresponsible talk, and the heady wines mixed with alcohol
    completed the work of destruction. Lord Stowmaries and his friends contrived
    within the next hour or so to lose more self-respect than their fathers had
    gained in a lifetime through sublime adherence to a forlorn cause.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</b></h2>
  <p>I think that we shall have to accept Sir Anthony Wykeham&rsquo;s account
    of how the proceedings finally terminated. He avers that by the time the
    church clock of St. Clement&rsquo;s had struck the hour of ten, Sir John
    Ayloffe was the only man present in that small private room who could at
    all be called sober.</p>
  <p>At that hour my lord of Rochester it seems lay right across the table with
    flushed face hidden in the bend of the elbow, snoring lustily at intervals
    and at others lifting a heavy head in order to hurl a bibulous remark at
    impassive Sir John or over-excited Stowmaries: Sir Knaith Bullock had quite
    frankly exchanged the rickety incertitude of Master Foorde&rsquo;s chairs
    for the more solid level of the floor, where after sundry struggles with
    a tiresome cravat and a persistently wry perruque he lay amidst the straw
    and the unsavoury postprandial debris that littered it, in comfort and security.</p>
  <p>Wykeham, according to his own account, had lapsed into somnolent sulkiness,
    vaguely listening to the ribald jests and coarse oaths uttered by the others,
    and to the monotonous murmur of Sir John&rsquo;s voice as he explained the
    details of his scheme to Stowmaries.</p>
  <p>The latter had certainly drunk more brandy than was good for the clearness
    of his brain. Excitement, too, had wrought upon his blood, with the result
    that the events of this night took on the garb of some over-vivid dream:
    but, as soon as he realised that his perceptions were becoming too confused
    to take in Ayloffe&rsquo;s varied suggestions, he made a vigorous effort
    to regain possession of himself. He called for a bowl of iced water, and
    dashed its contents into his face and across his eyes. After that he steadily
    refused to drink any more, nor did Sir John press him any further.</p>
  <p>The insinuating poison had done its work: there was no fear now that Stowmaries
    would wish to draw back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you draw your chair nearer, my lord,&rdquo; said Ayloffe after
    awhile when of a truth he saw that the rest of the company was quite helpless, &ldquo;these
    gentlemen are not like to disturb us now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With unaccountable reluctance Stowmaries did as the older man bade him,
    and presently the two men withdrew altogether from out the circle of dim
    light thrown by the guttering tallow candles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your lordship, I take it then, agrees with the broad basis of my
    scheme,&rdquo; said Ayloffe, speaking quite low, only just above a whisper. &ldquo;You
    are anxious to free yourself from this undesired marriage, and you think
    that my suggestion is one which will most easily help you to accomplish this
    purpose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; assented Stowmaries readily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; continued Ayloffe, &ldquo;your lordship
    is prepared to pay the sum of seventy thousand pounds to the man who will
    impersonate your lordship in the house of M. Legros, merchant tailor of Paris,
    who will&mdash;in your name and person&mdash;claim the Legros girl as his
    wife, and go through the necessary civil and religious ceremonies that will
    ratify the original marriage; and, finally, who will undertake not to reveal
    his own identity to the tailor&rsquo;s daughter until you, my lord, will
    grant him leave. For these services,&rdquo; concluded Sir John with emphasis, &ldquo;is
    your lordship prepared to pay the vast sum of seventy thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; replied Stowmaries in an excited whisper,
    which rendered his voice hoarse and his tongue stiff and parched. &ldquo;More
    than that and money down: fifty thousand pounds on that day that he signs
    and seals the bargain with me, and starts on his errand for Paris, and a
    further seventy thousand on the day that the tailor&rsquo;s daughter leaves
    her parents&rsquo; home in his company. A hundred and twenty thousand pounds!
    mine honour! my life upon it. But where in the name of Hell will you find
    the man to take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By way of an immediate reply, Sir John placed a warning finger to his mouth,
    then rose and beckoning to the other to follow him, he went to the door which
    divided the private parlour from the public Coffee Room, and throwing it
    open he pointed to the rowdy company who sat assembled each side of the oblong
    trestle table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amongst that crowd,&rdquo; he whispered with an insinuating smile.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11</b></h2>
  <p>At first when Sir John Ayloffe threw open the door of the public room, Stowmaries
    was only conscious of an almost Satanic din; he certainly could see nothing
    through the dense cloud of smoke which filled every corner of the long, narrow
    hall.</p>
  <p>Gradually, however, his eyes, still dimmed from recent libations and acute
    excitement, became accustomed to this haze-covered gloom, whilst his ears
    distinguished isolated sounds, drunken songs, loud oaths or hoarse laughter
    from out the deafening roar which surged towards him like the noise of breakers
    against a rock.</p>
  <p>A narrow deal table ran from end to end of the room, from the main door
    at the top to the small latticed window at the bottom. The floor was strewn
    with rushes on which sprawled recumbent figures in various stages of drunken
    sleep, in the very midst of a litter of debris, broken glasses, overthrown
    mugs, patches of spilt wine or ale, bones and remnants of pastry and of bread&mdash;all
    evil-smelling and unspeakably dirty. On the table itself the remnants of
    pies and cooked meats, and a forest of empty mugs and bottles. One by one
    the tallow candles which had been placed at intervals throughout the whole
    length of the table had thrown up their last flicker of feeble light, had
    spluttered their last with a hissing sound and finally died out in a column
    of grimy smoke.</p>
  <p>There were but some half dozen or so left now, which threw uncertain yellow
    gleams through the thick veil of tobacco fumes, on the prostrate figures
    that sprawled across the table, on overthrown goblets and jugs, on all the
    unsavoury debris&mdash;remnants of the past orgy.</p>
  <p>The rest of the room was in darkness, and through the gloom the figure of
    a young man, with flushed face and dark brown hair innocent of perruque,
    moved backwards and forwards to the rhythmic cadence of a boisterous chorus
    of song.</p>
  <p>The draught from the badly-fastened window wafted the strips of cotton which
    hung in lieu of curtains, straight into the room, with a swishing, moaning
    sound around which&mdash;soft though it was&mdash;could be heard like a long
    drawn-out sigh of pain, in the pauses of lusty laughter and of ribald song.</p>
  <p>The storm outside seemed to have ceased, for, as the curtains blew away
    from the window the pale, ghost-like streaks of moonbeams searched the darkness
    of that end of the room and found here a fold of satin tattered and frayed,
    there a broken paste buckle, or rusty sword hilt on which to play its weird
    gamut of faint and ghoulish rays.</p>
  <p>The noise was incessant, merriment mixed with quarrelsome oaths, lively
    songs alternating with hoarse shouts. All those who were not snoring babbled
    incoherently, swore or sang; Irish brogue mingling with broad Yorkshire tones,
    round Scotch oaths striking against Gaelic ones, whilst from time to time,
    a noisome word loudly flung from end to end of the table like a filthy rag
    would rouse one of the sleepers and spur him to respond to the challenge
    with vile blasphemy.</p>
  <p>At times the clink of a sword would cut sharply through the buzzing air,
    the beginnings of a quarrel, a volley of vituperations, a pewter mug or half-empty
    bottle thrown right across the table scattering its contents over tattered
    coats and already much-stained vests: then the hoarse admonitions of the
    peacemakers, the first refrain of a song by way of a diversion, more lively,
    more out of tune than before, and laughter and jests once more reigned supreme.</p>
  <p>Stowmaries gazed on this scene, the while he still felt that somnolent feeling
    of being in a dream, enveloping his senses. He heard the noise and saw the
    figures swaying to and fro, moving on unsteady legs, in and out of the narrow
    circles of yellow light like gnomes dancing the figures of a saraband, in
    the anteroom of Hell.</p>
  <p>The figure of the young man at the extreme end of the room fascinated him.
    He could not discern the face clearly, only as a flushed mask with the pale
    moonbeams touching the dark hair with their ghostly rays.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis your cousin Michael,&rdquo; whispered Ayloffe close to
    his ear.</p>
  <p>Stowmaries gave a sudden start. He understood now why Sir John had shown
    him this scene, the picture of this rowdy crowd composed of the ne&rsquo;er-do-well,
    unclassed profligates who had flooded the country ever since the Restoration,
    hurrying back to England from Flanders or from Spain, under the guise of
    Royalist loyalty which had suffered exile for the great cause, and was now
    eager and ready for reward.</p>
  <p>Boisterous, unscrupulous, disrespecters of persons and of dignity, they
    traded on the people&rsquo;s avowed dislike of the canting Puritans who had
    ruled in England for so long. Jeering, mocking and carousing they filled
    London with their noise, the open scandal of their lives, the disgrace of
    their conduct.</p>
  <p>By day they paraded the streets loudly singing licentious songs, dressed
    in the rags and tatters of cavalier accoutrements long since thrown away,
    seeking the peaceful citizen with the Puritan leanings, who chanced to find
    himself in their way and holding him up to ridicule, the butt of their uncontrolled
    merriment.</p>
  <p>By night they filled the taverns and coffee houses of the city and only
    the small hours of the morning witnessed their final retirement into the
    small brothels of evil repute where alone they could obtain lodgings.</p>
  <p>There were hundreds of these men about the London streets during the few
    years which followed the Restoration. The great plague had decimated them
    somewhat, the fire of 1666 had scattered some of them broadcast, but in this
    present year there were still a goodly number of them about. They were the
    terror of the night watchmen and the despair of the ill-organised and inefficient
    police-patrols, and rendered the lesser streets of the city well-nigh impassable
    to quiet citizens and to decent women.</p>
  <p>And it was amongst these men that Michael Kestyon was most often to be found;
    shouting with them by day, drinking and gambling with them by night. Michael
    Kestyon, cousin to my lord of Stowmaries and like him descended from those
    who in medi&aelig;val days had writ their name largely on the pages of history:
    Michael, the ne&rsquo;er-do-well, the wastrel, the profligate: Michael the
    idler who strove in such company to forget that he had been born a gentleman,
    and that he held a claim to the title and estates of Stowmaries which many
    thought was passing just.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12</b></h2>
  <p>For Michael Kestyon was a man with a grievance. A just grievance enough
    since many held that he and not his cousin Rupert should have been the present
    Earl of Stowmaries.</p>
  <p>But possession in those far-off days was even more absolutely an integral
    part of the law than it is now. Rupert Kestyon was <i>de facto</i> established
    at Maries Castle, whilst Michael had to begin life by selling his sword or
    his skin to the highest bidder, and all because his father and grandfather
    before him had been either very supine or hideously neglectful of their own
    respective son&rsquo;s interests to enforce the decree of King Edward III
    anent the family succession.</p>
  <p>That the decree existed no one attempted to deny; it was embodied in a document
    which with other family archives was actually in the possession of Michael
    Kestyon the pretender. These papers in fact were the only inheritance bequeathed
    to him by his father, besides a legacy of hatred and covetousness against
    the usurpers of the name and fortune of Stowmaries. But ye shall judge if
    the reigning earls were usurpers or not.</p>
  <p>It seems that in those distant days when Edward III reigned over England
    and France, the then Lady of Stowmaries presented her lord with twin boys,
    born within an hour of another. Fine boys they were, so tradition hath it,
    well grown and sturdy and as like to one another as two peas lying in the
    same pod.</p>
  <p>The fond mother as she gazed proudly upon these children&mdash;who of a
    truth were each endowed with a powerful pair of lungs&mdash;little guessed
    the mischief which their joint arrival would cause in the ancient and noble
    family of Kestyon.</p>
  <p>According to the laws of military tenure, the eldest of these two boys&mdash;older
    remember than his own brother only by a short hour or so&mdash;should have
    been held to be the heir to the titles, dignities, lands and appurtenances
    held in fief direct by the Lord of Stowmaries from his suzerain liege Lord
    Edward III by the Grace of God King of England and of France.</p>
  <p>But as evil chance&mdash;presided over by some imp of mischief&mdash;would
    have it, the twins&mdash;when scarce a few hours old&mdash;being placed by
    my lady&rsquo;s tiring-woman side by side in the bed, presently took to vigorous
    quarrelling. My lady thereupon was much perturbed and her women were all
    hastily summoned to her bedside, so that they might administer such soothing
    draughts as were usual under the circumstances.</p>
  <p>When my lady was once more restored to her former quietude she asked for
    her boys, requesting that the eldest be first placed in her arms.</p>
  <p>Alas! the mischief was done! The tiring-woman could not remember which child
    she had lain on the right side of the bed, and which on the left, nor could
    her astuteness combined with the adoring mother&rsquo;s searching eyes state
    positively afterwards which boy was heir to the barony of Stowmaries, and
    which the mere younger son.</p>

  <p>Imagine the confusion which ensued. Stories of innumerable quarrels between
    the brothers as they grew up to boyhood&rsquo;s estate have been handed down
    to their posterity. The father himself was at a loss what to do. He had a
    great love for both his boys, and not knowing which was the elder and which
    the younger son, he had a vast fear of doing an injustice either to the one
    or to the other.</p>
  <p>What could he do but ask the advice and ascertain the wishes of his suzerain
    liege? This we are told he did as soon as the children had reached the mature
    age of ten and owed military service to their lord.</p>
  <p>King Edward III we all know was a model of justice and of sound common sense.
    He declared it impossible that either of the boys should be deprived of what
    might be his lawful inheritance. Therefore, by a special decree signed by
    his own hand manual, he declared that on the death of his faithful cousin,
    the Baron of Stowmaries, the title, estates in fief or military tenure and
    other lands and appurtenances thereof should devolve jointly on the twin
    sons of the said lord, and that the first born child in the next generation
    should then once more reunite in his own person the titles and estates of
    Stowmaries.</p>
  <p>Moreover the King decreed that if at any future time, a Lady of Stowmaries
    should take it into her gracious head to present her lord with twins, this
    same rule of succession should apply.</p>
  <p>Thus said His Majesty King Edward III, and my lord of Stowmaries was thereby
    satisfied. The brothers were henceforth brought up as joint heirs of one
    of the finest baronies in the Kingdom and we hear nothing more of family
    feuds or dissensions.</p>
  <p>That the twins eventually did jointly succeed to their father&rsquo;s title
    and estates we know from the records anent the twin Barons of Stowmaries
    who fought under the banner of John of Gaunt in the days of Richard II; and
    from the fact that King Henry IV in 1410 created the then Baron of Stowmaries,
    Earl of Stowmaries and Riveaulx we may infer that one of those turbulent
    twins did have a son who succeeded alone to his father and uncle, and once
    more united in his own person all dignities and lands belonging to the ancient
    family.</p>
  <p>Thus the carelessness of a tiring-wench had for the time being no further
    serious consequences on the fortunes of the Kestyons. For some generations
    to come it seemed that the ladies of Stowmaries had no predilection for twins.
    But in the year 1552, so the family archives tell us, the wife of John, Earl
    of Stowmaries&mdash;Grand Master of the Ceremonies to King Edward VI&mdash;presented
    her lord with a sturdy pair of boys.</p>
  <p>As like to one another as the proverbial peas were these two new scions
    of the ancient family of Kestyon, and mightily proud of them was their fond
    mother, but there never was any confusion as to their identity. One of them&mdash;Rupert&mdash;was
    born fully two hours before his brother Michael, and was ever after looked
    upon as his father&rsquo;s heir. Nor, on the death of the Earl, did any one
    seem to have thought of disputing his sole right to the title and estates
    of Stowmaries.</p>
  <p>Rupert succeeded his father and in his turn was succeeded by his son. But
    what we do know as a certain fact is that Michael, the younger twin, had
    a son born to him a full year before his elder brother took unto himself
    a wife, and that if the decree of King Edward III had been duly enforced
    by law, Rupert and Michael should have been joint Earls of Stowmaries and
    it should have been Michael&rsquo;s son&mdash;the first born in the next
    generation&mdash; who should have united the title and estates in his own
    person.</p>
  <p>Why Michael did not endeavour to enforce the ancient decree of Edward III
    we shall never know: there are neither letters nor other documents to explain
    this supineness, which is all the more inexplicable since it affected the
    future of his own son even more than his own.</p>
  <p>We are concerned with the present generation. With Rupert, Earl of Stowmaries,
    the direct descendant of the older twin, and with Michael Kestyon, the grandson
    of the younger.</p>
  <p>Such as I have related is the true history of the grievance which this Michael
    nurtured against his cousin whom he deemed an usurper, and against all his
    peers, kinsmen and fellow gentlemen for the injustice which they abetted
    by admitting that usurper as one of themselves.</p>
  <p>But unlike his father and grandfather before him Michael was not content
    to see any one else in possession of the family title and estates, which
    of a truth should have been his. From his father he had inherited among other
    family archives the medi&aelig;val document embodying the decree of Edward
    III and bearing that monarch&rsquo;s signature. How and wherefore this had
    remained as an heirloom in this branch of the family, tradition does not
    tell us. The fact seems to suggest that the younger twin&mdash;Michael&mdash;may
    have had some intention of enforcing his son&rsquo;s claim at a future time&mdash;an
    intention, mayhap, frustrated by death.</p>
  <p>The man whom Lord Stowmaries saw at this moment, with flushed face and unsteady
    voice singing ribald songs to the accompaniment of boisterous laughter, chink
    of dice and sword, and blasphemous oaths, had at one time taken up his own
    cause with ardent and heart-whole enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>At the age when boyhood first yields to maturity, Michael had lost his father
    and thereupon had begun to fight for his rights, with all the strength of
    a turbulent nature, full of instincts of luxury and driven to penury through
    flagrant injustice. He had spent some of the best years of his life, in a
    perpetual appeal to the King and to his peers to try his cause and if necessary
    to find it just. But the King was not fond of settling important questions
    himself and the Lords&rsquo; House of Parliament was overbusy re-establishing
    a number of its own lapsed privileges to bother about a claimant with empty
    pockets.</p>
  <p>Driven from pillar to post, Michael appealed to Common Law, to Chancery
    and to equity, setting up divers pleas in order to bring his case within
    the jurisdiction of these respective Courts. He spent all his substance in
    lawyer&rsquo;s fees, in sworn documents, in meeting constant demands for
    bribery, the while his kinsman sat comfortably enthroned at Maries Castle
    paying no heed to a claim, the justice of which one attempted to deny yet
    which no one was able legally to enforce.</p>
  <p>Gradually as his pockets grew more and more empty, as constant rebuffs took
    the edge off his optimism, Michael carried on the fight with less and less
    hope if with unabated doggedness.</p>
  <p>In the intervals he had sold his sword and his skin to the highest bidder,
    to Italy or Flanders, to the Emperor or to the King of France. He had led
    the life of the adventurer, who knows not from day to day whence will come
    the rations for the morrow, of the soldier of fortune who has neither kindred
    nor home.</p>
  <p>His mother whom he adored&mdash;in his own turbulent passionate way&mdash;spent
    a life of humble penury in a remote Kentish village. To this lowly abode
    of peace Michael returned from time to time from his far-off wanderings in
    Sicily or Spain; here he would spend some few days in worshipping his mother,
    until the agony of seeing her patient and serene within measurable sight
    of starvation drove him frantic from out her doors.</p>
  <p>Then he would rush back to London and once more haunt the Courts and the
    purlieus of Whitehall, swallowing his outbursts of pride in vain supplications
    for a fresh hearing, in a mad desire to see the King, in licking the dust
    before the feet of those who might help him to further his cause.</p>
  <p>At those times self-deprecation would render him moody; his pleasure-loving
    nature was swamped beneath the heavy pall of a mother&rsquo;s want, a mother&rsquo;s
    sorrow and misery. He despised himself for being unable to lift her out of
    such humiliating penury. She who should be Countess of Stowmaries, one of
    the greatest ladies in the land, scrubbed her own floors and oft lacked a
    meal, the while her son, the able-bodied and reckless adventurer, was eating
    out his heart with the shame of his own impotence.</p>
  <p>But what he could not accomplish whilst the scanty means left to him by
    his father were still at his command, he was totally unable to obtain now
    that he had not one stiver to offer to those who might have helped him but
    whose palms seemed forever to be in want of grease.</p>
  <p>Blood-money abroad had also become more meagre. The King of France and the
    Emperor had their own standing armies now, and had less need of mercenary
    troops than of yore. Michael who in battle sought wounds as another would
    seek cheap glory, was given but twenty crowns for a sword thrust which he
    received at Fehrbellin whilst fighting for the Elector of Brandenburg.</p>
  <p>He nearly died of the thrust, and afterwards of starvation, for he sent
    the twenty crowns to his mother, and being considered too enfeebled for active
    service, he could not immediately obtain further enlistment.</p>
  <p>This was but one of the many episodes which had helped to make Michael Kestyon
    what he now was. A bitter sense of wrong gnawed at his heartstrings, the
    while he strove to hide his better nature beneath the mask of boisterous
    gaiety, of a licentious life and reckless gambling.</p>
  <p>The buffetings of law officials, the corrupt practises of second rate attorneys,
    the constant demands on his scanty purse now made up the sum total of his
    dealings with humanity, when he was not actually in the company of adventurers
    more profligate, more dissolute than himself.</p>
  <p>He saw the better world&mdash;that world which was composed of his own kindred&mdash;turned,
    as if in arms against him. Not a friend to give him help save at a price
    which he could not afford to pay. It was money and always money: money which
    he could not get, and without which he saw the last chance of getting a hearing
    for his case vanishing beyond his reach.</p>
  <p>The descent from those early boyish days full of idealism and of hope, down
    to the lowest rung of the social ladder, to the companionship of gamesters
    and of drunkards, had been overcertain and none too slow. Accustomed to the
    revelries of camp life, to that light-hearted gaiety so full of exuberance
    to-day and oft the precursor of a bloody death on the morrow, Michael found
    the England of the Restoration a mercenary and inhospitable spot.</p>
  <p>Among his own kind, mockery of his vain endeavours; among the others&mdash;the
    wastrels&mdash;a life of boisterous merrimaking which at any rate made for
    forgetfulness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</b></h2>
  <p>In response to Ayloffe&rsquo;s whisper, Stowmaries had asked hurriedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The older man nodded, and Stowmaries gazed long and searchingly upon his
    cousin, vaguely wondering if Sir John&rsquo;s astuteness had pointed in the
    right direction, if indeed this were the man most likely to lend himself
    for a large sum of money to the furtherance of an ignoble scheme.</p>
  <p>Stowmaries saw before him a man&mdash;still in the prime of life but on
    whom dissipation, sleeplessness by night and starvation by day had already
    boldly writ their impress; a man like unto himself in feature, a distinct
    family resemblance being noticeable between the two cousins, but in Michael
    Kestyon&mdash;the reckless adventurer&mdash;the evenly placid expression
    born of a contented life had long ago yielded to the wild, hunted look, the
    mirror of a turbulent soul. He wore a surcoat which was obviously of rich
    cloth though the many vicissitudes of camp life had left severe imprints
    upon its once immaculate surface: beneath this coat there peeped out innocent
    of vest, the shirt, which once had been wrought by loving fingers, of fine
    linen and delicate stitchery, but now presented the appearance of a miscellaneous
    collection of tatters and darns with here and there a dark stain on it, which
    spoke of more than one sword thrust in the breast, of the miseries of that
    life of fighting and of toil, of aches and pains and of ill-tended wounds.</p>
  <p>The rest of Michael&rsquo;s attire was in keeping with the surcoat and the
    shirt: the faded silk sash long since deprived of tassels, the collar free
    from starch, the breeches a veritable motley of patchwork, and the high boots
    of untanned leather, stained a dark greenish brown from exposure to constant
    damp.</p>
  <p>This then was the man who was most like to sell himself for so much money,
    and Stowmaries noting the squalor of Michael&rsquo;s attire, the dissipated
    yet wearied look in his face, ceased to wonder how it came that Sir John
    had thought of this wastrel, and in his mind fully approved of the choice.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Michael Kestyon caught sight of the two men standing under the
    lintel of the door. He greeted them at once with a shout of welcome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My worthy coz!&rdquo; he said gaily, &ldquo;and if I mistake not &rsquo;tis
    gallant Sir John Ayloffe, the finest rogue that ever graced a court. Gentlemen!&rdquo; he
    continued mocking, and advancing with mincing and unsteady steps towards
    the two men, &ldquo;pray tell us&mdash;though by the Mass I call you right
    welcome&mdash;what procures this humble abode the honour of such distinguished
    company?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst the young man spoke, most of his companions had ceased both song
    and laughter; several faces&mdash;all flushed with heady liquor&mdash;were
    turned towards the door, whilst glances wherein suspicion fought with the
    confusing fumes of alcohol, were directed on the newcomers.</p>
  <p>But Sir John Ayloffe with determined good humour had returned Michael&rsquo;s
    greeting with easy bonhomie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, friend Michael,&rdquo; he said, the while he prudently closed
    the door behind him and Stowmaries, lest the noise in the coffee room awaken
    his sleeping friends, &ldquo;your amiable cousin and I myself were tired
    of the sober assembly in the parlour and had desire for more merry company.
    I hope your call of welcome was no mere empty word, and that of a truth we
    may join your hospitable board.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With much gravity Michael surveyed Ayloffe and Stowmaries up and down, from
    the diamond buckles on their shoes to the elaborate curls of their gigantic
    perruques; then he turned to his friends, who had followed his every movement
    with that solemn attention peculiar to the drunkard, which tries yet fails
    to comprehend what is going on before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What say you, gentlemen?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall we admit these
    noble rogues to our table? My cousin here, as you see, has but lately emerged
    from the surveillance of his keeper, he inhabited a monkey garden for a considerable
    time, and hath collected a vast amount of hair on his head from the shavings
    of his many companions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A terrific and prolonged shout of laughter shook the very walls of the room,
    the while Stowmaries, who suddenly had became pale with rage, placed a quivering
    hand on the hilt of his sword.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Insolent beggar!&mdash;&rdquo; he murmured in a hoarse voice, which,
    however, was completely drowned in the bibulous noise which had greeted Michael&rsquo;s
    impertinent sally and which rose and fell in a continuous roar for some considerable
    time, the while Michael himself, satisfied at the effect which he had produced,
    struck up the refrain of a drinking song.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the name of the lady whom you honour with your love, good my lord,&rdquo; whispered
    Ayloffe close to Stowmaries&rsquo; ear and with impressive earnestness, &ldquo;I
    entreat you to keep your temper. We have need of this wastrel for the success
    of our scheme, and a quarrel would of a surety ruin it completely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael Kestyon now turned to his cousin once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you take your seats, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said pointing with
    unsteady gesture to a couple of empty chairs placed at the head of the table, &ldquo;though
    you may not be aware of it, my friends here have shown a desire for the continuance
    of your presence amongst us. Had they not desired it they would have shown
    their disapproval by various hints more or less gentle, such as the throwing
    of a pewter mug at you or the elevation of their toe to the level of your
    majestic persons. But as it is ye may rest assured, ye are welcome here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, good Michael,&rdquo; said Ayloffe pleasantly, as in
    response to Michael&rsquo;s invitation he now advanced further into the room
    and took his seat at the head of the board, followed by Stowmaries who was
    making vain attempts to conceal his contempt of the proceedings, and to master
    his ill-humour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; continued Sir John addressing with gracious familiarity
    the united company present, &ldquo;I know not what we have done to deserve
    your favours. Believe me, we came as suppliants desiring to be entertained
    by the most noted merrimakers in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael with the same mock gravity once more resumed his place at the table
    close beside Sir John Ayloffe. He drew two mugs towards him and from a gigantic
    pewter jug, he poured out full measures of a thick red liquid, which had
    the appearance of spiced wine.</p>
  <p>The beverage certainly exhaled a remarkable methylic odour, which from the
    nostrils seemed to strike straight into the brain making the blood seethe
    in the head and the eyes glow as with the heat of running fire. Moreover
    the mugs which Michael had filled, and then pushed towards the newcomers
    were not over clean. Even Sir John had much ado to keep his outward show
    of geniality and to mask his friend&rsquo;s more and more marked impatience
    and disgust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the Mass, merry sirs,&rdquo; quoth Michael with boisterous hilarity,  &ldquo;an
    you really desire to be of our company we will grant you admittance. But
    first must ye pledge us in a full bumper of this nectar, concocted by good
    Master Foorde for the complete undoing of his most favoured guests. We drink
    to you, gentlemen, brother rogues an you please. If you are saints do not
    drink. The liquid will poison you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To you all, brother rogues,&rdquo; came in lusty accents from Sir
    John Ayloffe as he jumped to his feet, bumper in hand, &ldquo;and may you
    accept us as two of the worst rogues that ever graced your hospitable board.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He quaffed the sickly, very heady liquid at one draught. He had kept himself
    uncommonly sober throughout the evening and the potion he knew could not
    do him a great deal of harm. He had a solid head and was not unused to the
    rough concoctions made up of cheap wines, of alcohol and sundry spices wherewith
    these noisy louts were wont still further to addle their over-confused pates.</p>
  <p>Stowmaries would have demurred, despite the warning look thrown at him from
    beneath Sir John&rsquo;s heavy lids, but, looking up, he saw Michael&rsquo;s
    deep-set eyes fixed upon him with a measure of amusement not altogether free
    from sarcasm which vastly irritated him and without attempting to hide his
    disgust he raised the heavy mug with a gesture of recklessness and contempt
    and he too drank it down at one draught.</p>
  <p>There were loud shouts of approval at this, and the occasion was further
    improved by more drinking and the singing of various snatches culled from
    the most noted and most licentious songs.</p>
  <p>But Michael was now examining Sir John Ayloffe very attentively. The latter
    having drunk expressed distinct appreciation of the beverage, and even made
    pretence, as he once more resumed his seat, of asking for more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are looking at me with strange persistence, good Michael,&rdquo; he
    said at last with unalterable blandness, as he returned the younger man&rsquo;s
    questioning gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May not a cat look at a king,&rdquo; retorted the other lightly, &ldquo;or
    a beggar gaze on the exalted personality of Sir John Ayloffe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By all means, and welcome. But, on my faith, my personality is in
    no wise exalted, therefore, I may be permitted to ask again what is the cause
    of your flattering attention?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curiosity,&rdquo; replied Michael curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curiosity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I was wondering in my mind why you are here to-night, and why
    you have brought mine estimable if somewhat weak-minded cousin with you here,
    in the very midst of the most evil-reputed crowd in London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; protested Sir John gallantly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not the
    most evil-reputed crowd by any means. We, who are accustomed to the profligate
    life of a gentleman, look over leniently on the innocent if somewhat flashy
    debaucheries of these pleasure-lovers here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet are we no mere pleasure lovers, Sir John,&rdquo; said Michael
    with a sudden air of seriousness which contrasted strangely with his flushed
    face and his slovenly and ragged attire. &ldquo;You see here before you the
    very scum of humanity, the bits of flotsam and jetsam which the tide of fortune
    throws upon the shores of life; tattered rags of manhood, shattered lives,
    disappointed hopes! This room is full of these wreckages, like morsels of
    poisonous seaweed or of empty shells that litter the earth and make it foul
    with their noisome putrefaction. Elegant gentlemen like you and my fair cousin
    here should not join in this m&ecirc;l&eacute;e wherein crime falls against
    crime, and moral foulness pollutes the air. We are rogues here, sir, all
    of us,&rdquo; he added bringing his hand open-palmed crashing down upon the
    table, &ldquo;rogues that have long ago ceased to blush, rogues that shrink
    neither before crime nor before shame. Rogues! rogues! all of us&mdash;not
    born so remember, but made rogues because of some one else&rsquo;s crime,
    some one else&rsquo;s shame!&mdash;but damned rogues for all that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drank another bumper full of spiced wine! He had spoken loudly and hoarsely
    with wrathful eyes gazing straight ahead before him, as if striving through
    the foul smoke and vitiated air of this den of thieves to perceive that nook
    in a Kentish village, where in a tumble-down, miserable cottage, a woman
    who should have been Countess of Stowmaries was often on her knees scrubbing
    the tiled floors.</p>
  <p>But Stowmaries&rsquo;s laugh, loud and almost malignant, broke the trend
    of Michael&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, ay! Well said!&rdquo; he shouted as loudly, as hilariously as
    had done the others. &ldquo;Well said, Michael, for you at least, an rumour
    doth not lie, are a damned rogue for all that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! Nay!&rdquo; interposed Ayloffe with mild amiability, &ldquo;you
    do your cousin Michael a grave injustice. I know that my lord of Rochester
    would back me up in what I say. All these gentlemen here are rogues but in
    name. They shout and they sing, they parade the streets and make merry, but
    they are, of a truth, of a right good sort, and if only a pleasing turn of
    fortune came their way, they would all become peaceful citizens in a trice
    and forswear all their deeds of profligacy, of which they are often cordially
    ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas Michael&rsquo;s turn to laugh. He threw back his head so that
    the muscles of his neck stood out like cords, and he laughed loudly and immoderately,
    with a laugh that had absolutely no mirth in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ashamed of our roguery,&rdquo; he said at last, when that outburst
    had ceased and he was once more leaning forward across the table with dark,
    glowing eyes wandering from one flushed face to another. &ldquo;Hark at him,
    gentlemen! Sir John Ayloffe here would make saints of us! Hark ye, sir,&rdquo; he
    continued bringing his excited face close to that of Sir John, &ldquo;I for
    one delight in mine own roguery. I am what I am, do you hear? what the buffetings
    of Fate and the injustice of man have made me. The more my mealy-mouthed
    cousin here exults in his courtliness and in his honour, the more do I glory
    in mine own disgrace. If <i>that</i> is honour,&rdquo; he said pointing with
    a trembling hand at Stowmaries who despite his brave attire cut but a sorry
    figure at the present moment, for he felt supremely ill at ease, &ldquo;then
    am I content to be a rogue. The greater the villainy, the prouder am I to
    accomplish it, and if I am to go to Hell for it, then let my damnation be
    on the head of those who have driven me thither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowmaries shrugged his shoulders in moody contempt. Sir John looked like
    one profoundly impressed at an unforeseen aspect of affairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; growled one of the men sulkily, &ldquo;pay me for
    it and I&rsquo;ll stick a knife into any person you list.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was an elderly man with a red face and straggly white hair. He had been
    a scholar once, drunkenness and an inordinate love of gambling had made him
    what he now was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For ten golden sovereigns I&rsquo;d poison the King!&rdquo; quoth
    another thickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For less than that I&rsquo;d sell my soul!&rdquo; added another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou canst not sell what thou hast not got,&rdquo; comes in a quick
    reply from the further end of the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you, friend Michael, what would you do for a fortune?&rdquo; asked
    Sir John returning Michael&rsquo;s gaze with a firm, earnest look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask the devil to spare my cousin here!&rdquo; replied Michael
    flippantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would not play the part of an hired assassin, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I hated any one well enough, I&rsquo;d kill him without pay,&rdquo;  retorted
    the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or abduct a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An she pleased me, I&rsquo;d not want money to tell her so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then meseems,&rdquo; sighed Sir John with a deprecating shrug of
    the shoulders, &ldquo;that I have come to the wrong man with mine offer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no offer,&rdquo; quoth Michael curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay! of a fortune,&rdquo; rejoined the other calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a serious one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As serious as mine own presence here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have come here prepared to make me an offer?&rdquo; reiterated
    the young man now, with contemptuous incredulity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The offer of a fortune,&rdquo; reiterated Ayloffe quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One hundred and twenty thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One hundred&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And twenty thousand pounds,&rdquo; repeated Sir John with slow emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&mdash;&rsquo;tis a stupid and a purposeless lie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Michael striving to look indifferent leaned back in his chair, then
    fell forward again with elbows resting heavily on the table the while his
    eyes glowing with the excitement of heady liquor and the vague suggestion
    only half expressed searched the face of the older man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who would give a ne&rsquo;er-do-well one hundred and twenty thousand
    pounds?&rdquo; he reiterated in an unsteady voice, &ldquo;and for what purpose?
    Are you fooling me, Sir John?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On my solemn word of honour, no!&rdquo; asserted the latter calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then for what purpose?&rdquo; repeated Michael, whilst a sneer which
    looked almost evil for a moment quite distorted his face. &ldquo;Am I to
    murder some offending stranger in the dark? bribe the King&rsquo;s physician
    to poison him, or turn informant against my cousin&rsquo;s co-religionists
    in England as is the fashion nowadays? Well! tell me what it is? Have I not
    told you that I am rogue enough to accomplish mine own damnation&mdash;at
    a price.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good Michael, you mistake my meaning. I propose no roguery unworthy
    a gentleman. An you&rsquo;ll accept my offer you&rsquo;d have no cause to
    regret it, for you&rsquo;d be a rich, happy and contented man to the last
    day of your life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;An it were so simple as that, man,&rdquo; quoth Michael drily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
    have no need to offer a fortune to a rogue in order to get what you want.
    As for the rest, methinks that most rogueries are unworthy a gentleman. But
    then you see I am no gentleman, else I were not here now, and probably had
    long ere this flung my glove in your face. So out with it&mdash;you offer
    me one hundred and twenty thousand pounds&mdash;for what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively for the last five minutes or so as their conversation drew
    into more serious channels, the two men had gradually dropped their voices,
    speaking almost in a whisper. They had drawn their chairs closely together
    to the corner of the table, with Lord Stowmaries between them, silent and
    attentive.</p>
  <p>Sir John at this stage was sitting close to the end of the table, the full
    length of which stretched out on his right. He raised his head now and gave
    a quick glance at the rest of the assembly.</p>
  <p>Those of the revellers who were not wholly incapable, either sprawling across
    the table, or lying prone upon the floor, had drawn up their chairs in groups.
    The rattle of dice in boxes was distinctly audible above the snoring of the
    sleepers, also muttered curses from the gamblers who were losing and the
    clink of brass money passing from hand to hand. Satisfied that the attention
    of the company had long since wandered away from himself and Michael, he
    once more turned to the young man and said quietly in response to that impatient: &ldquo;For
    what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For marrying the pretty daughter of an amiable Paris bourgeois, the
    wench being over-ready to fall into your arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael made no movement but he studied Sir John&rsquo;s face, as if he
    thought that the man was not completely sane, or had succumbed to the fumes
    of spiced wine.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he murmured quite bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must I repeat my words?&rdquo; said Sir John imperturbably. &ldquo;There
    is a wench over in Paris, as pure and good as the day on which she lisped
    her first Ave Maria at her mother&rsquo;s knee. For certain simple reasons
    which you will hear anon, a husband must be found for her within the next
    fourteen days. An you&rsquo;ll be that happy man there will be fifty thousand
    pounds for you as soon as you agree to the bargain, and seventy more on the
    day that you bring home the bride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! that sounds simple enough. But now tell me the hitch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The hitch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. The hitch which forces you to ask a blackguard like myself to
    do the work for you. Why do you not become the happy man yourself for instance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I am not young enough, nor yet well-favoured. The first fifty
    thousand pounds will help to make of you the most dashing gallant in the
    two kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why a blackguard?&rdquo; persisted Michael with cutting sarcasm.
    He felt agitated, even strangely excited. He was shrewd enough to see that
    Sir John was not fooling him, that there was more than a mere undercurrent
    of seriousness in this extraordinary offer made across this common supper
    table. His fingers were beating an incessant tattoo upon the boards, and
    his eyes restless, keen as those of a wild beast scenting a trap, searched
    the face of his interlocutor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why a blackguard if the wench is a saint as you say, why a blackguard?&rdquo; he
    insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A blackguard? Perish the thought!&rdquo; said Sir John lightly. &ldquo;Nay!
    the reason why your personality com mended itself to me and to my lord of
    Stowmaries was because you are a gentleman, despite the many vicissitudes
    of an adverse Fate, and that you would render the girl happy and proud to
    be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! my worthy cousin is a party to this game?&rdquo; queried Michael
    with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, man,&rdquo; he added with almost savage impatience, &ldquo;why
    cannot you speak up like a man? Cards on the table, by the Mass, or my hand
    will come in contact with your mealy mouth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He checked himself, angry at his own outburst of rage which he had been
    unable to control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said that I am on my way to Hell,&rdquo; he added more
    quietly, &ldquo;why should you hesitate to show me a short cut?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cards on the table, friend Michael, since you&rsquo;ll have it so,&rdquo; now
    said Ayloffe in a quiet impressive whisper, &ldquo;bear that one hundred
    and twenty thousand pounds in your mind all the while you listen to me. The
    wench over in Paris was made to go through a marriage ceremony with your
    cousin here, eighteen years ago, when she was a babe in arms and he a mere
    lad, unable to defend himself against this encroachment on his future liberty.
    Since then my lord of Stowmaries has never met his bride, nor did her parents&mdash;worthy
    yet mercenary tradespeople of Paris&mdash;desire him to see their daughter.
    He was poor Rupert Kestyon then, an undesirable son-in-law if ever there
    was one: they would have broken the marriage then, only the Church would
    not allow it. Then my lord became what he now is, rich, influential, desirable,
    and promptly the Paris shopkeepers changed their tactics. They demanded that
    your cousin shall acknowledge and take to his heart and home a woman whom
    he has never seen, whom he can never love; for the affection of his heart,
    of his whole manhood is pledged to another whom he adores. In his despair
    my lord hath come to me and I am proud to be his friend. I would help him
    to regain that liberty which an untoward Fate hath fettered. Is not my lord
    a wholly innocent victim? He did not ask to wed&mdash;for long he was spurned
    as one unworthy. Now because he is rich, he is to be made the tool of rapacious
    bourgeois, who would see their daughter Countess of Stowmaries. They have
    invoked the aid of the Church who spurred by their gold hath threatened anathema
    and excommunication on my lord. The King&mdash;sorely inclined to Catholicism&mdash;will
    not hear of breaking marriage vows which he calls solemn, and which under
    such circumstances sensible men cannot fail to call a farce. My lord hath
    come to me and I have thought of a scheme&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So far Michael had listened with unswerving attention to this long expos&eacute; delivered
    by Sir John in clear, even voice that was hardly raised above a whisper.
    He had listened, his head resting in his right hand, his left lying clenched
    and motionless on the table. But now he interrupted Ayloffe&rsquo;s placid
    flow of eloquence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You need not tell me your scheme, man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have
    guessed it already. I know now why you had need of a rogue for the furtherance
    of your project. I, Michael Kestyon, am to go to Paris and there impersonate
    my love-sick cousin, carry away the bride by that trick, and thus forever
    so shame her, that a dissolution of that child-marriage will readily be granted
    by Church and State.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that for the sum of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, friend
    Michael! one hundred and twenty thousand pounds&mdash;a fortune that would
    tempt a King!&rdquo; added Sir John earnestly.</p>
  <p>Michael made no comment, and there was thus an instant&rsquo;s silence at
    this end of the table where sat the three men: only a second or two mayhap
    during which a blasphemous oath uttered at the further end of the room seemed
    in some strange and occult way to mark the descent of a soul one step further
    down on its way to Hell. One instant during which the tempter watched the
    tempted, and from the giddy heights of future satisfied ambition showed him
    the world conquered at the paltry price of momentary dishonour.</p>
  <p>One fitful ray of a ghoulish moon searched, through a narrow slit between
    swishing curtains, the fleshy face of Ayloffe, the descendant of the Hebrew
    bondswoman; the thickly-lidded eyes fixed like those of some poison-giving
    reptile upon the trapped victim. It played weird and ghost-like upon the
    dull scarlet of his cloak, and made strange shadows beneath his heavy brows,
    giving him an eerie, satanic expression, which Stowmaries&mdash;whose brain
    was on fire&mdash;was quick to note.</p>
  <p>He shuddered and instinctively drew away. But Michael Keyston who had not
    stirred a muscle, who had scarce breathed during that moment&rsquo;s solemn
    pause, now leaned forward and said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the sum of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, I will do
    what you wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then noting that the look of satisfaction on Stowmaries&rsquo; face was
    not wholly unmixed with contempt, he added with a quick return to his flippant
    mood:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Cousin, look not so loftily from adown the giddy heights of
    supposed integrity. &rsquo;Tis useless at this stage to despise the hand
    that will help you in your need. Methinks that my share in the intrigue is
    no more unavowable than your own. &rsquo;Tis you are married to the lady
    and owe her protection, yet you offer money to further treachery against
    her. Now I have never seen the wench and am no traitor to her since I do
    not know her. I owe her no allegiance; she is but one woman out of a million
    to me. Have you never tried to win a woman by trickery, good Coz?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke lightly, even gaily, only Sir John&mdash;the keen observer of his
    fellowmen&mdash;noted that the laugh which accompanied this tirade had a
    hollow ring in it, also that Michael after he had spoken drank down one after
    another two large goblets full of wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not let us split hairs, gentlemen, over the meaning of a word,&rdquo;  said
    Ayloffe pleasantly. &ldquo;Friend Michael, my hand on it. I devised the scheme,
    and confess that my thoughts flew to you for its accomplishment.&rdquo; He
    put out his hand, but Michael seemed to ignore the gesture. With a shrug
    of the shoulders indicating good-tempered toleration, the other continued
    glibly, &ldquo;Let us own to it, gentlemen, we are all rogues, every one
    of us here present; I, who made the proposal, my lord of Stowmaries who pays
    the piper, and Michael who takes a fortune in exchange for a trick. Bah,
    gentlemen, &rsquo;tis but a merry jest, and, on my honour, no harm can come
    to any one. Is not Michael Kestyon henceforth rich, as well as highly-connected
    and amiable of mien. By Gad the practised hand of his future father-in-law
    together with that of a court barber, would soon turn him into the most gallant
    gentleman in the two kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A truce on this nonsense,&rdquo; interposed Michael with a quick
    return to his impatient mood. &ldquo;Tell me what you expect me to do, and
    I&rsquo;ll do it; but there&rsquo;s no cause for such empty talk. I am being
    paid to act and not to listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be serious, old sobersides,&rdquo; quoth Sir John with
    imperturbable good humour, &ldquo;and think of the best schemes to bring
    our scheme to a successful issue. My lord of Stowmaries, have I your leave
    to place the details of our plan before our friend here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Scarce waiting for the impatient assent of the other, Ayloffe continued,
    speaking directly to Michael:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Firstly, then: to-morrow as soon as the shopkeepers have taken down
    their shutters you shall go to the King&rsquo;s tailor in Holborn and there
    order yourself various suits of clothes, befitting the many occasions when
    you shall have need of them in Paris and on your honeymoon. Once the bargain
    sealed between us, by word of honour as between gentlemen, your gracious
    cousin will place fifty thousand pounds in your hands. You will be a rich
    man to-morrow, friend Michael, and can attire yourself in accordance with
    your whim. From the tailor&rsquo;s in Holborn you had best proceed to the
    barber&rsquo;s in Fleet Street, who will provide you with the most fashionable
    perruques&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know all that, man,&rdquo; interrupted Michael with ever-growing
    impatience. &ldquo;I know that the monkey hath to be tricked out for parade.
    When I have been made to look like a fool in motley garb, what further shall
    I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hie over to France as soon as may be; for already at
    break of day to-morrow you&mdash;in your temporary name of Earl of Stowmaries&mdash;will
    write a letter to M. Legros, merchant tailor of Paris apprising him of your
    intentions no longer to disobey the decrees of the Church, or the dictates
    of your own heart, which of a truth has ever been true to your baby bride;
    also you will tell him of your desire to proceed forthwith to Paris in order
    to claim your wife, to have the marriage ceremony of eighteen years ago formally
    ratified and finally to bring her back in state and solemnity to her new
    home in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I to write all these lies myself?&rdquo; asked Michael.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I&rsquo;ll constitute myself your secretary,&rdquo; replied
    Ayloffe, &ldquo;you need only to sign &lsquo;Stowmaries.&rsquo; As I mistake
    not, &rsquo;tis a name you would gladly sign always, &rsquo;twill not come
    amiss for once. You may have to sign papers over there, &rsquo;twere better
    that your handwriting be known at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When do I start for Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What say you to a fortnight&rsquo;s hence from this day? &rsquo;Twill
    give you ample time for the completion of your toilet. An you will allow
    me I will provide you with a retinue worthy of your rank. It must be composed
    of men whom we can trust, and men who do not know my lord of Stowmaries by
    sight and are not like to guess that something is amiss. Three will be sufficient.
    I will engage them at the last, so that there may be no fear of our secret
    reaching their knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clothes, men, money,&rdquo; quoth Michael, &ldquo;methinks, Sir John,
    you have thought of everything. Once I am in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will act as judgment guides you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And no doubt seventy thousand pounds is a good guide to judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael&rsquo;s somewhat defiant manner seemed completely to have vanished.
    He appeared to be yielding himself quite freely to the delights of the promised
    adventure; at least this was what good Sir John hoped whilst congratulating
    himself on the remarkable attainment of his fondly-cherished desire.</p>
  <p>But remember that this same good Sir John was no superficial observer of
    human nature. He was not altogether deceived by Michael&rsquo;s outward show
    of flippancy. That excitement had got hold of the adventurer&rsquo;s imagination
    was undoubted and probably the obstinacy of an untamed nature would prevent
    his drawing back from a promise once given.</p>
  <p>At the same time the glint of excitement in Michael&rsquo;s eyes had but
    little genuine merriment in it. It was more like the unnatural fire produced
    by fever-heated blood.</p>
  <p>It was the money which had tempted Michael&mdash;so concluded Ayloffe in
    his own mind. The money which mayhap would help the claimant to bring forward
    his cause once again into the light of day. Money which would mean bribes,
    high enough to tempt corrupt judges or even&mdash;who knows&mdash;a pleasure-loving
    King.</p>
  <p>What Michael thought of the adventure itself, what it cost him to acquiesce
    in it with an outward show of careless gaiety even the astute Sir John could
    not have said: he himself had achieved his own ends and personally he cared
    little what Michael felt so long as the young man fulfilled his share of
    the ignoble contract.</p>
  <p>Was it so ignoble after all? Sir John with a smile of self-contempt found
    himself wondering in his mind whether any one would indeed be the loser by
    it. Stowmaries? certainly not!&mdash;he could well afford to pay twice a
    hundred thousand pounds for the gratification of his most ardent desire:
    his freedom to marry the woman whom he loved. Michael?&mdash;of a truth Michael
    would lose a little more self-respect than he had already done, but then
    he must have so little left&mdash;and he would become passing rich.</p>
  <p>As for the tailor&rsquo;s wench, bah!&mdash;one husband was as good as another,
    concluded Sir John with a splendid cynicism, and if Michael Kestyon was not
    actually Earl of Stowmaries, by Gad he was mighty near to it, and&mdash;who
    knows?&mdash;with one hundred and twenty thousand pounds in his pocket might
    yet oust his cousin from that enviable state.</p>
  <p>And he&mdash;Sir John Ayloffe&mdash;gambler on his beam ends, would henceforth
    look forward to a comfortable old age with Mistress Julia Peyton&rsquo;s
    twelve thousand pounds carefully placed at interest so that there might be
    no temptation to dribble it away.</p>
  <p>All was for the best in the best possible world!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</b></h2>
  <p>But there was one more card which Ayloffe, the gambler, desired to play
    ere he lost sight momentarily of the man who was to be his tool in the carving
    of their respective fortunes.</p>
  <p>He now rose from the table and went up to the door which gave on the private
    parlour. This he opened and looked in. Just as he had anticipated, there
    was but little change in the attitude of the three gentlemen whom he had
    left in the room.</p>
  <p>Sir Anthony Wykeham still sat moodily leaning back in his chair, a shade
    more confused in his brain than he had been before, his eyes more shifty
    and uncertain in expression. A couple of empty bottles in front of him mutely
    explained the reason for this gradual change in the emphatic moraliser of
    a while ago.</p>
  <p>Sir Knaith Bullock was still lying on the floor, in the midst of the straw
    which with idle hands he had gradually heaped up all round him, so that he
    seemed reclining in a nest. But he was not asleep now; he was singing chorus
    to the songs of my lord Rochester, who&mdash;frankly tipsy&mdash;made as
    much noise and sang as thoroughly out of tune as any of the plebeian revellers
    in the coffee room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Sir John!&rdquo; he shouted lustily, &ldquo;where in the devil&rsquo;s
    name have you and Stowmaries been hiding yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His tongue was thick and the words fell inarticulately from his quivering
    lips. Sir Knaith Bullock rolled over in the straw in order to have a good
    view of the intruder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where the devil&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;Stowmaries?&rdquo; he babbled
    as incoherently as his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have been busy finding an alternative husband for the tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter,&rdquo; said Sir John gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And have you found one?&rdquo; queried Wykeham with vague, somnolent
    eyes fixed upon the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay! that we have! And I pray you gentlemen to join the merry company
    in the coffee room and to pledge the bold adventurer in a monster goblet
    of wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Egad!&mdash;you&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;that&mdash;hic!&mdash;&rdquo; hiccupped
    Bullock who had rolled right over in the straw and now looked like a giant
    and frowzy dog with prickly wisps standing out of his perruque and sticking
    to his surcoat and velvet breeches. He contrived to work himself about until
    he got onto his feet, whereupon he stood there tottering and swaying the
    while his bleary eyes tried to take in what was going on around him.</p>
  <p>A great shout issuing from the coffee room, great banging of mugs against
    the boards, loud laughter and the first verse of a song, roused Rochester
    from his apathy and Wykeham from his moodiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are passing roisterous over there!&rdquo; remarked the latter,
    gazing covetously toward the open door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are toasting the gallant adventurer,&rdquo; said Sir John; &ldquo;I
    pray you, gentlemen, come and join us. Let us drink to the future husband
    of the tailor&rsquo;s daughter, the future possessor of one hundred and twenty
    thousand pounds in solid cash and of my lord Stowmaries&rsquo; eternal gratitude.
    Let us drink to Michael Kestyon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Michael&mdash;Kesh&mdash;Keshtyon is it?&rdquo; babbled Sir Knaith.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The damned blackguard&mdash;&rdquo;  murmured Wykeham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say hurrah for Michael Kestyon!&rdquo; roared my lord Rochester
    lustily, &ldquo;the beggar hath pluck. By Gad! won&rsquo;t old Rowley laugh
    at the adventure? Would I&rsquo;d had the impudence to go through with it
    myself!&mdash;I say hurrah for Michael Kestyon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lurched forward in the wake of Sir John who had once more turned towards
    the coffee room, and closely followed by the others, all four men shouting: &ldquo;Hurrah
    for Michael Kestyon! Hurrah for the tailor&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Their advent was greeted by more vigorous shouting, more singing and cries
    of: &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; which issued from out the darkness. For by now
    only one last tallow candle was left spluttering and dripping, its feeble
    yellow rays illumining but one narrow circle of light wherein the remnant
    of a pie, an overturned bottle and a pool of red wine, stood out as the sole
    objects actually visible in the room.</p>
  <p>In this total darkness, the noise of hoarse shouts, of cries for &ldquo;Michael
    Kestyon!&rdquo; of blasphemies and of oaths sounded weird and satanic, like
    a babel of ghouls exulting in the realms of the night.</p>
  <p>Sir John paused at the door. He had wished to see Michael Kestyon commit
    himself finally before these other three gentlemen, who were almost partners
    in the conspiracy. He wanted to see the bond sealed with the word of honour
    of the rogue who&mdash;as Ayloffe well knew&mdash;would never break a pledge
    once given.</p>
  <p>Therefore, he called loudly to Michael, and listened for the cheery tones
    of his voice. But no response came, only from out the gloom a curt answer
    from Stowmaries:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;tis no use calling for Michael! He hath gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15</b></h2>
  <p>Michael in the meanwhile was running through the deserted streets like a
    man possessed. Cloakless and hatless he ran, bending his head to the gusts
    of wind which tore down the narrow byways in the neighbourhood of the Strand.</p>
  <p>Fitful clouds chased one another over his head, obscuring the moon, and
    from time to time descending in sharp showers of icy rain.</p>
  <p>But Michael loved the wind and cared naught for the wet. The rags he wore
    were soon soaked through, but he did not attempt to take shelter beneath
    the various yawning archways which he passed from time to time; on the contrary
    he liked the cold douches of these winter showers which seemed to cool his
    head, burning with inward fever.</p>
  <p>Michael Kestyon, the gambler, the adventurer, the wastrel, had begun the
    fight against his own soul.</p>
  <p>For the space of a few seconds, there in the over-heated tavern room in
    the midst of all those drunkards, those profligates&mdash;scums of humanity&mdash;dying
    honour had called out in its agony: &ldquo;Wilt sell me for gold?&rdquo; but
    Michael had laughed out loud and long, and smothered those warning cries
    with the recklessness of the soldier of fortune who stakes his all on the
    winning card.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;His claim, his rights! His and those of that patient old soul dying
    of want in a lonely cottage, the while she should be living in the lap of
    luxury and of ease.</p>
  <p>She was dying of want, of actual hard, bitter starvation. Michael knew it
    and could do naught to help, and in the midst of the dissolute life of the
    town had vainly striven to forget that even at the cost of his life&rsquo;s
    blood, which he would have given gladly drop by drop, he could not purchase
    for her a soft bed on which she would finally go to her eternal sleep.</p>
  <p>His claim! His rights! Her happiness! The happiness of the one being in
    the whole wide world who had clung to him, who loved him for what he was
    and did not despise him for what he had become: this he could purchase for
    one hundred and twenty thousand pounds.</p>
  <p>Had not Sir John Ayloffe himself said that &rsquo;twas a fortune which would
    tempt a king.</p>
  <p>The lawyers had told Michael that only money was wanted to bring his claim
    before the Lords&rsquo; House of Parliament now, and once publicly debated,
    justice could not stand against it.</p>
  <p>Michael had oft laughed at those two words, &ldquo;Only money!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only money! and when he sought and got a sword thrust that nearly killed
    him, he was given twenty crowns as blood-money. He reckoned at this rate
    that his miserable body would have to be as full of holes as a sieve, before
    he obtained enough money wherewith to satisfy the first lawyer who would
    condescend once more to take up his case.</p>
  <p>But now all that&mdash;lawyers&rsquo; fees, fees for a first hearing, for
    a second and for a third, for pleadings, interrogatories and affidavits,
    for petitions to the King and for briberies to obtain a private audience&mdash;all
    that would be within his reach.</p>
  <p>The price? A woman&rsquo;s honour and his own self-respect.</p>
  <p>Once&mdash;very long ago, these would have mattered to him a great deal;
    in those days he had believed in men&rsquo;s honour and in women&rsquo;s
    virtue.</p>
  <p>But now? He had lost so much self-respect already&mdash;what mattered if
    a few more shreds of it went the way of all his other ideals.</p>
  <p>He had once boldly said that he would give his life&rsquo;s blood drop by
    drop, endure every agony, undergo every torture to see his mother installed
    at Maries Castle, her rightful and proper place.</p>
  <p>Well, that had been easy to say! These things were not asked of him, and
    he had gone through so much, suffered often so terribly from hunger, wounds
    and fatigue that the sacrifice of his life or the endurance of most bitter
    tortures would have been an easy sacrifice. He was hard and tough&mdash;what
    nerves he had had been jarred beyond all sensibility long ago.</p>
  <p>But now something was asked of him. Fate had spoken in no uncertain accents.
    She had said: &ldquo;Make a sacrifice of thine honour, and thy most cherished
    wish will be gratified!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If those former bold words&mdash;offers of blood and life&mdash;were not
    the talk of a weak-kneed braggart, then, Michael Kestyon, thou shouldst not
    hesitate!</p>
  <p>Dost prize those paltry remnants of self-respect so highly that thou wouldst
    see thy mother starve ere thou sell them?</p>
  <p>Starve, remember, starve!&mdash;in the direct, absolute, unmitigated sense
    of the word. If thou canst not provide her with the necessities of life,
    she must starve sooner or later, in a month, in a year, in two mayhap, that
    would depend how charitably inclined the neighbours happened to be. But starve
    she must, if thou, her son, dost naught for her.</p>
  <p>And Fate had whispered: &ldquo;Money, power, justice await thee, at the
    price of thy self-respect and the honour of a woman who is a stranger to
    thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The subtle temptation had entered into Michael&rsquo;s heart like an insinuating
    poison which killed every objection, every argument, every moral rebellion
    in his soul. And the temptation assailed him just at this time when his whole
    being ached with the constant buffetings of life, when he longed with all
    the maddening strength of defiant impotence to hit right and left at the
    world which had derided him, to begin again a new life of action, of combat,
    of lofty aspirations.</p>
  <p>Try and pity him, for the temptation was over-great; pity him because Fate
    had struck him one blow after another, each more and more difficult to bear
    since his soul, his mind, his entire self had scarcely time to recover from
    one before the next came crashing down, leaving him with one hope the less,
    one more ideal shattered, one more misery to bear.</p>
  <p>One hundred and twenty thousand pounds!&mdash;Michael kept repeating the
    half dozen wonderful words to himself over and over again as he walked.</p>
  <p>Thus tottering, buffeted by the wind, drunk with the magic of the thought
    which the words evoked, he reached his lodgings at last.</p>
  <p>He rapped loudly at a low door with his knuckles, but had to wait some time
    before it was opened. A gnome-like figure wrapped in a tattered dressing
    gown and wearing a cotton night-cap appeared in the doorway. It was difficult
    to distinguish if the figure was that of man or woman. In brown and wrinkled
    hands it held a guttering tallow dip which threw a trembling light on the
    dank walls of the narrow passage and feebly illumined the approach to the
    rickety stairs beyond.</p>
  <p>Michael paid no heed to the muttered grumblings of the creature, but walked
    straight past it along the passage, and then up the creaky stairs which led
    to the garret above. As he reached the several landings he nearly fell over
    various prostrate bundles made up of human rags from out of which issued
    sleepy oaths, as Michael&rsquo;s foot stumbled against them.</p>
  <p>His own garret was not much better than those open landings across which
    he had tottered and fumbled in the dark. Here the roof sloped down to the
    tiny dormer window, innocent of curtains, and made up of some half dozen
    tiny panes, mostly cracked and covered with thick coatings of grime.</p>
  <p>Along the low wall opposite the window a row of ragged bundles&mdash;human
    only in shape&mdash;and similar to those which encumbered the landings, told
    their tale of misery and of degradation. There were some half dozen of these
    bundles lying all of a row against the wall. They were Michael&rsquo;s room
    companions, the wreckages of man and womankind, with whom he had lived now
    for close on eighteen months.</p>
  <p>Snores and drunken oaths, blasphemy too and noisome words spoken in sleep
    came from these bundles, greeting Michael&rsquo;s somewhat stormy entrance
    into this den.</p>
  <p>He shut the rickety door behind him, and made his way to the little window,
    through which the light of some street lanthorn opposite came shyly peeping
    through.</p>
  <p>Michael threw the casement open, allowing that feeble light to enter more
    fully, then he turned and surveyed his surroundings,&mdash;those bundles
    along the floor, the wooden boards across which a crowd of vermin were scrampering
    out of sight, the two chairs, innocent of seats, the wooden packing case
    in lieu of table, the walls dank and grey, covered with obscene writing scribbled
    with shaky fingers dipped in grime!</p>
  <p>Michael looked at it all, as if he had never seen it before. In an angle
    of the room was the straw paillasse still empty which awaited him, and around
    which the dying instincts of gentle birth had caused him to erect a kind
    of unseen barrier between that corner and the rest of the room. Here the
    floor was clean, the straw was fresh; above the paillasse the wall had been
    carefully wiped clean and rubbed over with lime, and on an overturned wooden
    case beside the miserable bed there were one or two books, and a small metal
    crucifix which profane fingers had apparently never dared to touch.</p>
  <p>But these very trifling attempts at cleanliness were the only luxury which
    had come within Michael&rsquo;s reach, ever since he came home from that
    last campaign in Brandenburg and sent his last crown to his mother in Kent.
    And remember that such garrets, such degrading propinquity, such misery and
    such dirt represented the only kind of life which London offered in those
    days to the poor, to the outcast and the homeless. There was nothing else
    except the gutter itself.</p>
  <p>Michael stood in the centre of this garret and looked upon the picture&mdash;his
    life! His life such as it had been for the past eighteen months, such as
    it would continue to be until he became too old and too feeble to drag himself
    up from that straw paillasse in the corner. Then he would lie there sick
    and starving until he was taken away feet foremost down the rickety stairway
    to the paupers&rsquo; graveyard out beyond St. Paul&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;With arms akimbo, hands resting on his hips and feet firmly planted
    on the dust-covered floor, Michael looked and laughed; not bitterly or mirthlessly.
    Bitterness had gone&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;at sight of the picture.
    He laughed, mocking himself for the few scruples which had assailed him awhile
    ago, for having conjured up&mdash;yes! conjured up himself&mdash;those phantoms
    of honour which accused him of selling his self-respect.</p>
  <p>Was this self-respect, this den of rogues, this herd of miserable ne&rsquo;er-do-wells,
    these filthy walls, this life of misery, of wretchedness, of shifts&mdash;growing
    day by day more unavowable for obtaining bread for the morrow? Was this manhood
    to stand against such odds? Was this honour to endure such a life?</p>
  <p>Bah! if it was, then far better sell it for the price of oak boards sufficient
    to make two coffins: one for the man, the other for the old woman living
    the same life and enduring the same misery.</p>
  <p>Michael turned back to the window and with a brusque, impatient gesture
    tore open the second casement. A gust of wind found its way into the musty
    corners of the garret and scattered the vitiated air, the while the moon
    emerging triumphantly from her long imprisonment behind the clouds searched
    with bluish and ghostly rays the grey walls opposite, the drunken sleepers
    on the floor, the vermin scuttling between those litters of straw more fit
    for cattle than for human beings.</p>
  <p>The blustering wind, as it tore at the rickety casements roused some of
    the sleepers from their dreams. Volleys of oaths were flung at Michael, but
    he heard nothing now. He leaned out of the narrow window&mdash;as far out
    as he could&mdash;and looked on the forest of chimney stacks, the irregular
    roofs and tall spires of this great and heartless city.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;How peacefully she lay beneath the cool kiss of the moon! Invisible
    arms seemed to be stretched out toward the lonely watcher bidding him to
    come and conquer.</p>
  <p>There was no longer any compunction in Michael&rsquo;s heart, and certainly
    no shame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; he said speaking to those unseen shadows, &ldquo;and
    what I do, I do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The freshness of the air came as a bath of moral cleanliness to his soul;
    he felt an excitement, too, akin to that of a war horse when scenting the
    coming battle. To Michael now the whole transaction&mdash;to which on the
    morrow he would affix the seal of his pledged word&mdash;was but a mighty
    combat wherein a powerful weapon would be placed in his hand.</p>
  <p>He would at last be able to hit right and left, to be even with that world
    which had buffeted him, which had scorned his efforts, but allowed his mother
    to starve.</p>
  <p>Aye! He was a turbulent soul; a soul created to fight and not to endure.</p>
  <p>And if at moments during that lonely watch above the chimney stacks and
    roofs of London there came floating to his mind the thought of the girl who
    was nothing to him, the stranger whom he would so bitterly wrong, then with
    a proud toss of the head, a joy which literally lighted up his whole being,
    he would send an unspoken challenge up to those swiftly-flying clouds which
    tended southwards, towards Paris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go tell her!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;that whoever she may be Michael
    Kestyon will serve her with gratitude and love all the days of his life.
    On his knees will he worship her, and devote his life to her happiness. And,&rdquo; he
    added mentally, whilst a quiver of excitement shook his broad shoulders, &ldquo;tell
    her that an she desires to be Countess of Stowmaries, even that desire Michael
    Kestyon will gratify, for he will make her that&mdash;tell her&mdash;tell
    her that before next December&rsquo;s snows cover the earth there will be
    two Countesses of Stowmaries in England: Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s mother and
    Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not attempt to go and rest on his miserable couch, but leant for
    hours up against the window watching the moon slowly drawing its peaceful
    course along the dark firmament, seeing the fleecy, silvered clouds fly madly
    across the sky, lashed by the wind into fantastic shapes of witches&rsquo;  heads
    and of lurid beasts. He watched the roofs and towers of many churches as
    gradually they were wrapped in the mist-laden mantle of approaching dawn.</p>
  <p>He watched until far away above chimney stacks and pointed steeples a feeble
    rosy glow precursed the rising sun. He was too weary now to think any more,
    too weary to dream, too weary he thought even to live.</p>
  <p>And through the gathering mist it seemed to him that the ghostly spectres
    of his tumultuous past came to him enwrapped in white palls, monstrous and
    majestic, towering above mighty London, and that walking slowly in their
    wake, tottering and shy was his mother, enfeebled by starvation and the wretchedness
    of her life. She held out emaciated arms to him in a mute appeal for help,
    whilst the ghosts of the past spoke with unseen lips of all that he had suffered,
    of the great sorrows and the tiny pin-pricks.</p>
  <p>And with every word they uttered his soul sank more and more to rest, and
    even as his aching head sank down upon his outstretched arms, and his eyes
    closed in a dreamless sleep, his lips murmured with final defiance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a man! and what I do, I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b></h2>
  <p>In the meanwhile my lord of Stowmaries had been allowed to spend a happy
    hour in the tiny withdrawing room at Holborn Row, kneeling at Mistress Julia
    Peyton&rsquo;s feet.</p>
  <p>He had been so excited, so full of Sir John&rsquo;s proposals and their
    more than probable success that like Michael Kestyon he had no desire for
    rest. He had soon wearied of the crowd in the coffee room, and presently
    had allowed Ayloffe to lead him out into the streets.</p>
  <p>Instinctively his footsteps turned in the direction of Holborn Row, the
    while he lent a somewhat inattentive ear to what Sir John was saying to him.
    Ayloffe was talking of the details of his scheme; of the payment of the money
    to Michael on the morrow, if the latter finally pledged himself to the bargain;
    fifty thousand pounds then, and a further seventy on the day that the tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter left her home in her husband&rsquo;s company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must be as good as our word, my lord,&rdquo; said the astute Sir
    John. &ldquo;A word misplaced, the faintest suggestion of withdrawal on any
    point might upset Michael&rsquo;s curious temper and turn his acquiescence
    into obstinate refusal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ayloffe had no doubt of Stowmaries&rsquo; integrity, only the sum was such
    a vast one&mdash;and the worthy baronet was so unaccustomed to the handling
    of thousands&mdash;that he could not help dreading the fact that the young
    man had mayhap overestimated his power of paying away such large sums at
    such short intervals, and that, when the time came for disbursement, a hitch
    might occur which would rouse Michael&rsquo;s antagonism and upset the perfectly-laid
    scheme once and for all.</p>
  <p>Stowmaries, however, seemed to attach very slight importance to this question
    of money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a man of my word,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I have no wish
    to draw back. What I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What cared he if it cost him twice one hundred thousand pounds, if indeed
    he were free to wed the beautiful Julia?</p>
  <p>He was over-eager to be at her feet now and showed marked impatience to
    rid himself of Ayloffe&rsquo;s company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My hand on it, Sir John,&rdquo; he said, halting at the corner of
    Holborn Row, for he did not want the older man to see whither he was going,
    the while the latter was well aware that my lord was on his way to Mistress
    Peyton&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;My hand on it; and to-morrow Michael Kestyon
    shall have his fifty thousand pounds, if he finally agrees to do what we
    want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This he must do in the presence of witnesses&mdash;my lord of Rochester
    or Sir Knaith Bullock would favour us as much. Yet have I no fear that the
    rogue will play us false, &rsquo;tis the money he wants, and fifty thousand
    were not enough to tempt him; &rsquo;tis that further seventy that he&rsquo;ll
    crave for most.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Stowmaries, impatiently anxious to get
    away, now that he had perceived&mdash;as he thought&mdash;a light in one
    of the windows of his fair Julia&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;He shall have that,
    too. The money is at interest with Master Vivish the diamond merchant. I
    can get it at any time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We promised it to Michael on the day that the tailor&rsquo;s daughter
    leaves her father&rsquo;s home,&rdquo; urged the over-prudent Sir John.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On that day he shall have it,&rdquo; rejoined the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then your lordship would have to journey to France in order to fulfil
    that promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll to France then,&rdquo; retorted the young man who had
    come to the end of his tether, &ldquo;an you&rsquo;ll go to Hell now and
    leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ayloffe laughed good-humouredly. Usually prone to quarrel he was determined
    to keep his temper to-night; and as he felt that nothing further would be
    gained now by talking whilst Stowmaries was so obviously waiting to be rid
    of him, he said nothing more, but gave his friend a cordial Good-night and
    turned on his heel in the direction of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.</p>
  <p>Stowmaries&mdash;as soon as the other was out of sight&mdash;walked down
    Holborn Row, and had soon reached the familiar door.</p>
  <p>In response to his loud knocking the East Anglian serving-man came to open
    it. With the stolidity peculiar to his race, he showed no surprise at the
    untimely visitor, and with solemn imperturbability held out his furrowed
    hand even before Stowmaries had produced the small piece of silver which
    alone would induce the old man to permit that visitor to enter.</p>
  <p>The piece of silver being deemed sufficient to overcome the man&rsquo;s
    scruples, he shuffled along the flagged passage without uttering a word,
    leaving Stowmaries to follow as he liked, and presently he threw open the
    door which gave on the small parlour.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Though it was close on midnight, Mistress Peyton was not abed. She
    had been to the Playhouse, and was still attired in that beautiful cream-coloured
    brocade which had been the envy of the feminine portion of the audience there;
    but though she was tired after the many and varied emotions of that eventful
    day, yet she felt that she could not have slept. Her proposals to Sir John
    Ayloffe, the schemes which she well knew that the gambler would concoct,
    the possibility or probability of ultimate success, harassed her nerves and
    fired her brain.</p>
  <p>She had spent the last two hours in that narrow room, now pacing up and
    down like a caged rodent, now throwing herself down in a chair in an agony
    of restlessness.</p>
  <p>The advent of my lord Stowmaries occurred in the nick of time, for she was
    on the verge of hysterics.</p>
  <p>He knelt at her feet, adoring and excited. He told her all that had occurred
    during that momentous evening, humbly begging her pardon for having betrayed
    the secret of their mutual love, his own passion and his despair, to some
    of his most intimate friends.</p>
  <p>Mistress Julia whose flushed face when my lord entered might have been caused
    by shyness at his stormy entrance, or by anger at the untimeliness of his
    visit, looked adorable in her obvious agitation. She chided him gently for
    his impetuosity, and for disclosing her tender secret to those who mayhap
    would sneer at her hopeless love.</p>
  <p>Then my lord told her of Sir John Ayloffe&rsquo;s scheme, the proposed public
    disgrace of the tailor&rsquo;s daughter which would render the dissolution
    of the child-marriage not only probable but certain. Mistress Julia looked
    quite sad and shed sympathetic tears; she was so sorry, so very sorry for
    the poor dear child.</p>
  <p>But when she heard that my lord had actually promised one hundred and twenty
    thousand pounds to his cousin Michael Kestyon for rendering him this service,
    the fair Julia frowned and checked an angry exclamation which had risen to
    her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sum seems overvast,&rdquo; she remarked with affected indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bribe had to be heavy, Mistress,&rdquo; replied my lord. &ldquo;Michael
    was the only man who could help us. He might have refused for less. It had
    to be a fortune worth a gentleman&rsquo;s while to accept. Michael is a gentleman
    despite his roguery, and we were asking him to do a mighty villainous action.
    He had to be well paid for it,&rdquo; repeated the young man decisively, &ldquo;methinks
    that for less he would have refused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress Peyton allowed the subject to drop for the moment and her lover
    to wander back into the realms of dithyrambic utterances, of vows and of
    sighs. But anon she recurred to the question of the money, showing a desire
    to know how and when it would be paid over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow when we have Michael&rsquo;s final acquiescence,&rdquo; said
    Stowmaries, eager to dismiss this question, &ldquo;I will hand over fifty
    thousand pounds to him, and another seventy thousand the day on which Rose
    Marie Legros leaves her father&rsquo;s shop in company with mine adventurous
    cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You talk lightly of such vast sums, my lord,&rdquo; said Julia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would I not give my fortune to win you?&rdquo; he rejoined.</p>
  <p>She continued for a long time afterwards to listen shyly and adorably to
    my lord&rsquo;s continued protestations, and when these became too violent,
    she rang for her tiring-wench and with many charmingly-timid blushes dismissed
    her adorer, promising to receive him again on the morrow.</p>
  <p>He went away quite happy, vowing that he would gladly have given not only
    his entire fortune, but also his family estates and titles to Michael for
    enabling him to regain his freedom and to marry the most adorable woman in
    the whole world.</p>
  <p>But Mistress Julia Peyton was not quite so content as all that. After my
    lord&rsquo;s departure, she went up to her sleeping room and exchanging her
    stiff brocade for a loose and easy wrap, she sat down in order to think various
    matters out.</p>
  <p>Agitation and restlessness had gone from her, but not the frown of disapproval.</p>
  <p>Her impetuous lover had been a fool, and Sir John a traitor to have allowed
    such monstrous promises to be made to Michael Kestyon. Surely her own kinsman
    should have known that her ardent love for my lord of Stowmaries consisted
    in the main of an overmastering desire to become a countess. Now with one
    hundred and twenty thousand pounds in Michael&rsquo;s hands and given that
    claimant&rsquo;s obstinate temperament and determination to carry his cause
    through, was there not a grave danger that the wretch would win his case
    after all and that my lord would presently have to yield his title and estates
    to the cousin whom he had so needlessly rendered rich?</p>
  <p>It was monstrous, silly and childish! Sir John of course must have been
    well under the influence of liquor ere he allowed such a bargain, without
    realising the danger which threatened his kinswoman&rsquo;s ambitious desires.</p>
  <p>She was mightily angry with Sir John, who should have been more shrewd,
    and could not understand how it was that so astute and so unscrupulous a
    schemer had overlooked the eventuality which she herself had foreseen in
    a flash.</p>
  <p>The first fifty thousand, well and good!&mdash;Julia sup posed that so vast
    a sum would certainly be required to bribe even a broken-down gentleman to
    enter into Ayloffe&rsquo;s dishonourable schemes.</p>
  <p>But the further seventy thousand, was unnecessary, she felt sure of that
    and moreover it was dangerous.</p>
  <p>Would it not be the most bitter irony of which Fate was capable if the tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter became Countess of Stowmaries after all?</p>
  <p>Such a thing had become possible now, nay, probable, thanks to the blunder
    made by Sir John. As for my lord, he seemed unaware of the danger&mdash;he
    was too fond of laughing at Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s pretensions, and was
    ever inclined to dismiss them as puerile and beneath contempt; mayhap, too,
    that he was fatuous enough to think that even without wealth or title his
    adored one would become his.</p>
  <p>But the adored one had no such intention.</p>
  <p>Like unto the adventurer himself up in that squalid garret above the roofs
    of London, Mistress Peyton could not rest that night. Her active mind was
    troubled with plans of how to undo the blunders of the past hour.</p>
  <p>And whilst Michael dreamed of future glory, of power and of wealth, Julia
    racked her woman&rsquo;s brain to find a means to bring him back to the dust.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="Part3"></a>Part 3</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, my cabbage, I do not find that plain gown becoming, of a
    verity thou must remember that thou art an English Countess and must henceforth
    adorn thy person with proper grandeur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And worthy Mme. Legros, whilst vainly trying to express disapproval, gazed
    with obvious admiration at the dainty apparition before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let be, Maman, let be!&rdquo; interposed Papa Legros soothingly, &ldquo;the
    chit is well enough as she is. When she is over there in England, she may
    well look grand and stately; for the present she is still a tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter and I&rsquo;ll challenge the world to produce a daintier bale of
    goods. <i>Par ma foi!</i> were I not thy father, my pigeon, I were tempted
    to envy that profligate young scoundrel, thy noble lord and husband. &rsquo;Tis
    a mightily succulent morsel he will bite into the nonce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rose Marie striving to hide the confusion, which her kind father&rsquo;s
    broad allusion caused in her sensitive young heart, buried her face in the
    bouquet of snowdrops which she held in her hand.</p>
  <p>No wonder that her adoring parents were proud of her. She looked a picture
    on this cold winter&rsquo;s morning, standing there in her little room beneath
    the eaves, clad in pure white like the snow which lay thick on the narrow
    window sill and along the streets of Paris.</p>
  <p>She had fashioned her gown herself, of white grogram with a beautiful openwork
    lace pinner and delicate kerchief demurely folded across her young bosom.
    Her fair hair was dressed in small curls all over her small head, her neck
    was bare, as were her arms and hands, and in colour as delicate as the snowdrops
    which she carried.</p>
  <p>The spring was still in its infancy and snowdrops were very scarce; worthy
    M. Legros had paid a vast sum of money in order that Rose Marie should carry
    a bouquet when first she met her lord.</p>
  <p>All white she looked&mdash;almost like a little snow image, only that her
    cheeks glowed with the excitement in her blood, and her bosom rose and fell
    with unwonted rapidity beneath the filmy folds of her muslin kerchief.</p>
  <p>My lord of Stowmaries had arrived in Paris the evening before, and had sent
    one of his serving-men round to say that he would come and pay his respects
    before midday.</p>
  <p>Oh! there seemed no laggardness about him now. The influence of Monseigneur
    the Archbishop and no doubt his own better nature had prevailed at last,
    and since a fortnight ago when his letter arrived announcing his coming,
    he seemed to have lost no time in useless preparations.</p>
  <p>Now he was here in Paris and Rose Marie had put on her pretty gown in order
    to receive him. She did so mightily desire to please him, for she on her
    side was quite ready to give him that respectful love which husbands demand
    of their wives. Mme. Legros had fussed round the child all the morning, and
    though she grumbled at the simplicity of the gown, she could not help but
    admire the exquisite picture of innocent girlhood which her daughter presented
    with such charming unconsciousness.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie had been singularly silent all the while that she dressed. She
    was very anxious to be beautiful, and thought that this could not be accomplished
    without much care and trouble. This she bestowed ungrudgingly on every curl
    as she twisted and pinned it up, on every fold of her kerchief, on the tying
    of her shoe.</p>
  <p>She had taken over two hours in completing her toilet, selecting with scrupulous
    care each article of dainty underlinen, which her own fingers had embroidered
    months ago, in anticipation of this great day: the white stockings, the silken
    garters, the beribboned shift and petticoat.</p>
  <p>When she was ready, she called to maman to come and inspect, and oh! to
    criticise if there were any fault to find, which maman of a surety would
    detect. Mme. Legros determined not to let affection blind her, had turned
    the snow-white apparition round and round, seeking for defects, where none
    existed, readjusting a curl here, a ribbon there, and finally calling to
    good M. Legros to come and give his verdict on the picture.</p>
  <p>But good M. Legros was far too adoring to do aught but admire. So now Rose
    Marie, if not quite free from doubt, was at any rate satisfied that everything
    which could be done to render her beautiful and desirable, had of a truth
    been done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had best go down, Maman,&rdquo; said Legros at last, when he had
    finished feasting his eyes on the beauty of his daughter, &ldquo;and make
    ready to receive milor. The child had best remain up here, and not enter
    the parlour until her lord is there, ready to greet her as she advances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The worthy tailor was more agitated than he cared to own. He felt fussy
    and could not manage to sit still. It still lacked nearly an hour to midday,
    and he was ready and over-ready to receive milor. He bustled maman out of
    the room, then ran back to have a final look at Rose Marie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep calm, my treasure,&rdquo; he said agitatedly, &ldquo;<i>par
      Dieu</i>! There&rsquo;s no need for excitement. Thou art not the first
      and only bride who has ever been claimed by an unknown husband. &rsquo;Tis
      milor, no doubt, who feels flustered. He has been in the wrong and comes
      to make amends. Not a very pleasant position for a proud English lord,
      eh, my pigeon? But thou art within thy rights, and wilt receive him with
      becoming dignity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With gentle, insinuating gestures Rose Marie contrived to lead her father
    out of the room, and finally to close the door behind him.</p>
  <p>Time was hurrying on and she did so want to be alone and to think. This
    was the end of the old life, the beginning of the new: the new with all its
    hopes, its fears, its mysteries. She had put it very pertinently to her mother
    when she said that nothing, nothing would ever be quite the same again.</p>
  <p>Now that dear Papa Legros&rsquo; heavy footsteps had died down the steep
    staircase, Rose Marie could sit by the open window and just think of it all,
    for the last time, before these mysteries of the new life were revealed to
    her.</p>
  <p>I think that what struck her as most curious in the future was the idea
    that she would never be quite alone again. For she had&mdash;despite the
    loving care of adoring parents&mdash;been very much alone. We must remember
    that there is never complete harmony between the young and the old. The former
    live for the future, the latter for the present, oft times only for the past.
    Papa and Maman Legros found their joy in seeing Rose Marie grow up and live,
    like some beautiful flower, carefully tended, guarded against the tearing
    winds of life, nourished, fed and caressed. But Rose Marie thought she cherished
    her parents, dreamed of the time when she would be a woman with another home,
    with other affections, with other kindred. Therefore she was lonely even
    in the midst of her happy home. There was a great deal that Rose Marie did
    not understand in life, but there was an infinity which maman would never
    comprehend.</p>
  <p>Would this newcomer, this stranger understand better than maman, she wondered.
    Would he know what ailed her when in the very midst of joy she suddenly felt
    inclined to cry? Would he then know just the right word to say, the right
    word to soothe her, and to fit in with her mood?</p>
  <p>There were other thoughts that flew through Rose Marie&rsquo;s mind during
    this, the last lonely hour of her girlhood, but these she would not allow
    to linger in her mind, for they caused her cheeks to blush, and her heart
    to beat with sudden, nameless fear. She had seen the girls and boys of Paris
    wandering arm in arm in the woods of Fontainebleau, she had seen a fair head
    leaning against a dark head, and lips meeting lips in a furtive kiss, and
    now in her innocent heart she wondered what it felt like thus to be kissed.</p>
  <p>Hush!&mdash;sh!&mdash;sh!&mdash;No, no! Maman was not there to see the quick
    blush which at the thought rose to the girlish cheek. Maman would not understand.
    She would say gaily: &ldquo;<i>Pardi</i> my cabbage! but thy husband shall
    kiss thee of a truth and right lustily on thy fresh cheeks or thy budding
    mouth. A good, round, sounding kiss an he loves thee, which of course he
    will!&rdquo; And the girls, too, in the woods at Fontainebleau, they usually
    laughed after that furtive kiss snatched behind some tree, when they thought
    that no one was looking.</p>
  <p>But Rose Marie did not think that she would laugh when my lord kissed her.
    It seemed to her so strange that girls should make light of such wondrous
    moments in their lives. Rose Marie thought that when my lord kissed her she
    would probably cry, not in grief, oh, no! but with a strange exultant joy
    because of his love for her.</p>
  <p>And that was what she hoped that he would understand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18</b></h2>
  <p>But good M. Legros could not contrive to sit still.</p>
  <p>He had gone down into the parlour and worried maman, until, poor soul, she
    had put milk into the metheglin, in mistake for ale, and had to brew the
    mixture all over again, quite a quantity of good Spanish wine having been
    completely spoilt, owing to the fidgety temper of her lord.</p>
  <p>He hung round her whilst she evolved the fresh bowl of posset, and made
    her so nervous that in desperation, fearing that more waste of expensive
    liquid would ensue, she ran upstairs loudly calling to Rose Marie to come
    down and help keep papa quiet by engaging him in a game of cribbage.</p>
  <p>Therefore it was that when with loud clatter of hoofs on the rough pavement
    of the Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne Com&eacute;die, my lord and his retinue drew
    rein outside the tailor&rsquo;s shop, Rose Marie was sitting in the room
    above playing cribbage with her father.</p>
  <p>She heard the noise of the horses, the brief word of command as the small
    party halted, but not for all the treasures of this world could she at this
    moment have risen in order to peep out of the window and thus get a glimpse
    of her future husband.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Papa rose in great agitation. Maman ceased fussing round the room
    and there was silence for a time, the while no doubt my lord dismounted.
    Then M. and Mme. Legros went out of the room in order to welcome the distinguished
    guest. But Rose Marie sat quite still, with her trembling fingers clasped
    tightly round the tiny bouquet of snowdrops. Through the window behind her
    the spring sun peeped in, pale and tender, and searching the remote corner
    of the homely parlour found the dainty, white-clad figure of the girl and
    touching her fair hair with the magic of its kiss turned it into an aureole
    of gold.</p>
  <p>The door opened and Michael entered. Thus he saw her for the first time&mdash;she,
    the woman whom he had been paid to wrong.</p>
  <p>He realised this the moment he saw her. In all the whirl of riotous thought
    which had assailed him during the past three weeks since that night which
    he had spent in self-communion, the impression of the woman had never been
    a lasting one. He had never thought of her as a distinct personality, as
    a creature of flesh and blood with thoughts and feelings mayhap as deep as
    his own.</p>
  <p>To his mind so far she had only been a tool, a sexless means to his ends:
    and this man who had such a passionate attachment for his mother, such a
    sense of her worth and importance, had given but a very cursory thought to
    her who was to become his wife by a trick.</p>
  <p>In this we must do him justice, that he did not dream of wronging the woman,
    who was the channel which Fortune had selected for her welcome course towards
    him. His cousin Stowmaries would of course repudiate her, that was understood.
    Undoubtedly he would be allowed to do this: but he&mdash;Michael Kestyon&mdash;would
    atone for his kinsman&rsquo;s villainy, he would keep, honour and respect
    her as his wife and the future mother of his children, and make her&mdash;by
    the will of God, the King and the Lords&rsquo; House of Parliament, and by
    the power of his newly acquired wealth&mdash;Countess of Stowmaries despite
    the rogues who had planned to oust her from that place.</p>
  <p>Because of all these good resolutions, Michael had therefore anticipated
    his meeting with his future wife with perfect equanimity. I do not think
    that during the many preparations for his journey which he had to see to
    in the past three weeks, he ever tried even for a moment to picture to himself
    what she would be like.</p>
  <p>Now she stood before him, in the full charm of her innocent girlhood, clad
    all in white, with her little hands clasping that bunch of flowers, the pale
    rays of an April sun touching her fair hair with gold. Her blue eyes were
    raised shyly to him just for an instant as she rose to meet him. He thought
    her elegant and pretty, stately, too, in her prim white gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was born to be a great lady,&rdquo; he thought to himself with
    an inward chuckle, &ldquo;and by Gad I&rsquo;ll make her one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In his mind&mdash;which seemed all in a whirl now&mdash;he compared her
    to Mistress Julia Peyton, and thought his cousin a mighty fool for preferring
    the latter.</p>
  <p>He bowed very low as Rose Marie advanced and at an encouraging word from
    maman, she placed her hand on his, and he kissed the tips of her ice-cold
    fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A snow-maiden, by my faith!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Michael,
    thou rogue! Thou&rsquo;lt of a surety have to infuse warmth into those pale
    cheeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She felt almost paralyzed with shyness, and very angry with herself for
    seeming so gauche and stupid. The while she curtsied to my lord in the most
    approved and primmest of fashions, the little bouquet of snowdrops escaped
    her trembling fingers. My lord stooped and picked it up, and she held out
    her hand for it, but he met her swift and timid glance with a bold challenge,
    and raised the bouquet to his lips before he hid it in the folds of his surcoat.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie thought her future lord picturesque in his elegant accoutrements;
    the fine cloth of his coat, of a dull shade of red, the cut of his garments,
    the delicate bit of lace at throat and wrist set off the massive strength
    of his figure: she was not quite sure if he were really handsome, for there
    was a curious look in his eyes, especially when they met hers which she had
    never seen in any man before, and a strange setting of mouth and jaw which
    did not suggest the love-sick husband.</p>
  <p>But she liked his easy bearing as he talked to maman with an easy familiarity
    that proclaimed high birth and gentle breeding. He had declined for himself
    Mme. Legros&rsquo; offers of refreshment in the shape of mead or aromatic
    wines, but accepted gratefully when she offered to take mugs of steaming
    ale out to his men.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie felt as if this were all a dream, and as if she would wake anon
    in her narrow bed behind the cotton curtains in her room under the eaves.
    She took several furtive glances at her future lord, and felt not a little
    piqued that he took so little heed of her. After that first hand kiss, and
    that quick flash of his deep-set eyes, when he hid her bouquet in his coat,
    she had not caught him once looking at her&mdash;was it because he did not
    think her fair?</p>
  <p>Papa talked incessantly, and presently maman came back, and in that same
    vague dream-like way Rose Marie seemed to hear them talking about the wedding
    ceremony. My lord seemed impatient and anxious to get through the necessary
    formalities prescribed by the Church, and then to take his bride away with
    him to England as quickly as possible. Obviously she was not to be left alone
    with her future husband just now; and though in her young heart, she had
    looked forward to the moment when she would be alone with my lord, she now
    felt relieved at the thought that it was not to be.</p>
  <p>Poor Rose Marie was bitterly disappointed. It had all been so very, very
    different&mdash;this first meeting&mdash;to what she had anticipated. She
    felt very angry with herself indeed for being so childish and so timid&mdash;no
    doubt by now my lord had set her down as a silly goose quite unfit to be
    a great English lady. At this thought she felt tears of shame welling to
    her eyes, and was infinitely relieved when maman took hold of her hand and
    led her out of the room.</p>
  <p>She bowed to my lord, and then held her head very erect as she walked past
    him to the door; she wanted to look proud and defiant now, for she had felt
    those strange deep-set eyes of his fixed upon her with an expression she
    could not define.</p>
  <p>And when she was alone in her room, she went straight to the image of the
    Virgin Mary which hung against the wall close to her narrow bed. She knelt
    on the prie-dieu beneath it, and she begged the Holy Mother of God to teach
    her not to be rebellious, and to be ready to obey her lord in all things,
    to give him love and respect, &ldquo;And O holy Mary, Mother of God!&rdquo; she
    added with a pitiful little sigh, &ldquo;if it be in your power to make my
    lord love me, then I humbly pray you tell him so to do; and whisper to me
    from on high what I must do to please him and to find favour in his sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;My cabbage,&rdquo; said Maman Legros in that decisive tone, which
    she only assumed on great occasions, and which then no one dreamed of contradicting, &ldquo;what
    thou dost ask is entirely out of the question. It is not seemly for a maiden
    to be left alone in company with her lord. Why! every one down the street
    would know of it&mdash;thy father&rsquo;s &rsquo;prentices would make mock
    of thee&mdash;and thy reputation would be as surely gone as is thistle-down
    after a gale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Maman,&rdquo; hazarded Rose Marie, bold for the first time in
    her life, in the face of maman&rsquo;s stern refusal, &ldquo;my lord is not
    my future husband. He <i>is</i> my husband, and surely I have the right to
    talk to him alone sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rose Marie, thou talkest like a goose, that cackles without understanding,&rdquo; replied
    maman sternly, &ldquo;though my lord is thy husband by law and by the will
    of the Church, he will not be thy true lord until the day after to-morrow,
    when thou wilt ratify thy vows to love, honour and humbly obey him, which
    vows I, thy mother, took in thy name eighteen years ago. Before thou hast
    spoken them with thine own lips, after High Mass on Wednesday, thou dost
    an unseemly and unmaiden-like act in wishing to be alone in his company.
    Truly thy guardian angel must be veiling his face with the shame of thee
    at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;But Rose Marie refused to look upon the troubles of her guardian angel
    with proper compunction. She still felt rebellious and argumentative; but
    she changed her tactics. The sly young damsel realised that she had taken
    maman the wrong way and that she would gain nothing by controversy. She,
    therefore, brought forth her other weapons of attack, certain methods of
    pressure on the parental will which hitherto she had never known to fail.</p>
  <p>She commenced proceedings by allowing her blue eyes to be veiled in tears,
    then seeing that maman turned her face away so as not to be forced to look
    on those pathetic dewdrops the rogue went close up to her mother and kneeling
    beside her put two loving arms round the old woman&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maman!&rdquo; she whispered with quivering lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no use,&rdquo; retorted maman obdurately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only one very tiny, short quarter of an hour, Maman <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>&mdash;after
    dinner&mdash;when papa goes downstairs to set the afternoon work to the &rsquo;prenticess&mdash;you
    could be busy in the kitchen&mdash;accidentally&mdash;just for one quarter
    of an hour&mdash;Maman <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The pleading voice was hard to resist. Maman tried to steel her heart and
    obstinately turned away from those liquid eyes, drowned in tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But in the name of the Holy Virgin, child,&rdquo; she said gruffly, &ldquo;what
    is there that thou wouldst say to my lord, that thou canst not do in thy
    mother&rsquo;s presence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not what I would say, Maman&mdash;&rdquo; rejoined Rose
    Marie in a soft murmur quite close to maman&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to hear him speak to me, Maman <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>&mdash;oh,
    I am sure that he will say naught that is unseemly&mdash;he is too proud
    and too rigid for that&mdash;but, when you and papa are in the room he never,
    never speaks to me at all&mdash;I have oft wondered if he thought me a goose.
    When he comes, he greets me of a truth as if I were a queen, he kisses my
    hand&mdash;and bows in the most correct manner&mdash;then, when I sing to
    him and play on the harpsichord, he praises my voice, and coldly thanks me
    for the entertainment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis right and proper conduct on the part of a great gentleman,&rdquo; retorted
    maman hotly, &ldquo;thou wouldst not have him kiss thee, as if thou wert
    a kitchen wench.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Rose Marie did not commit herself into saying what she did wish in this
    matter, but continued with seeming irrelevance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I go out of the room, after the frigid and stately adieux which
    my lord bestows upon me, I oft hear his ringing, merry voice echoing up the
    stairs, right through the walls to my room. I hear papa and you laughing,
    in obvious response to his sallies&mdash;and once&mdash;it was yesterday&mdash;I
    stayed peeping over the bannister until my lord departed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very unseemly behaviour,&rdquo; growled maman whilst an obvious blush
    rose to her fat cheeks, and her little, beady eyes seemed to twinkle at a
    certain recollection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw my lord take thee in his arms, Maman,&rdquo; continued Rose
    Marie with stern reproach, &ldquo;and he imprinted two such kisses on thy
    cheeks that literally raised the echoes in the house and must have been heard
    in the &rsquo;prenticess&rsquo;  shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maman made great efforts to preserve her gravity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if he did&mdash;I am old enough
    to be his mother&mdash;and would it had pleased God to give me a son like
    him! Those merry eyes give joy to my heart when I look into them, and he
    has such funny ways with him&mdash;such amusing sallies&mdash;why not later
    than yesterday, he said, speaking of Mme. Renaud, the cobbler&rsquo;s wife
    down the street, that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maman caught Rose Marie&rsquo;s blue eyes fixed eagerly upon her&mdash;there
    were no tears in them now&mdash;only excitement and curiosity&mdash;Maman
    promptly checked her own flow of eloquence and suddenly resumed her gruff,
    stern voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that is naught for thee, my pigeon&mdash;and now, enough of this
    talk&mdash;the <i>pot-au-feu</i> will be boiling over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She wore a great air of finality now and would have risen but for Rose Marie&rsquo;s
    clinging arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maman darling,&rdquo; pleaded the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; retorted Mme. Legros decisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One little, tiny, very, very short quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want so to know what he would say when we are alone&mdash;he could
    not sit before me mute as a carp, and stiff as papa&rsquo;s wooden measure.
    I want to hear his merry voice myself. I want to see&mdash;what he looks
    like&mdash;when he laughs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; reiterated maman for the third time.</p>
  <p>But even as she spoke the word, she looked down upon the beautiful upturned
    head, the glowing eyes, the quivering lips parted in earnest pleading, and
    like the thistle-down in a gale, which she herself had quoted, the worthy
    old woman&rsquo;s resistance fell away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth thou&rsquo;rt a rogue,&rdquo; she said more gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes, Maman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy father would not hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He need not know. When he goes down after dinner&mdash;to set the
    work for the &rsquo;prenticess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maman hesitated one moment longer, but that final hesitation was useless
    by now. The fortress had yielded to the powerful weapons of the loved one
    in tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. And Rose Marie jumped to her feet with
    a little cry of triumph. &ldquo;But remember,&rdquo; continued maman with
    stern, upraised finger, &ldquo;it shall be ten minutes and no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20</b></h2>
  <p>Thus it was that this day, after maman had cleared the debris of dinner,
    and papa went downstairs to set the &rsquo;prenticess to their afternoon&rsquo;s
    work, that no sooner had Rose Marie sat down to her harpsichord and begun
    to sing:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Arr&ecirc;tez, jeune berg&egrave;re<br>
    Un amant vous fait-il peur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>then maman gave a slight cry of surprise, and jumped to her feet exclaiming:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! I had forgot the <i>pot-au-feu</i>&mdash;it must be
    boiling over,&rdquo; and incontinently ran out of the room.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie continued her song. She was sitting with her back to the light,
    and my lord straight in front of her: and as her young voice rose and fell
    to the simple cadence of the old song, she was able to throw many a veiled
    look in his direction.</p>
  <p>At first when maman ran away, he had made a movement as if he would follow
    her, then seeing that Rose Marie remained at the harpsichord, he seemed to
    think that mayhap courtesy compelled him to remain with her. He sat down
    again in the high-backed arm chair and rested his head in his hand. Every
    time that Rose Marie looked up she caught his deep-set eyes fixed upon her.
    Strangely enough the look in them seemed quite sad&mdash;indeed if it were
    possible in one so rich and in so high-born a gentleman&mdash;Rose Marie
    would almost have imagined that my lord&rsquo;s whole attitude was one which
    made appeal to her tenderness and even to her pity.</p>
  <p>Then when the last note of her song died away in a soft murmur, my lord
    rose and came up to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a sweet voice you have, Rose Marie,&rdquo; he said in that even,
    gentle voice with which he usually addressed her and which seemed to her
    veiled with studied coldness, &ldquo;and &rsquo;tis a tender song which you
    sang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It pleases me, my lord, that it should find favour with you,&rdquo; she
    replied demurely, the while she allowed her long lashes to veil the light
    of excitement which danced in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! who am I that you should try to please me, dear heart?&rdquo; he
    said a trifle sadly, &ldquo;rather is it I who with my whole mind and soul
    and strength should strive to make you happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That were not very difficult, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She would then and there have liked to give her excitement fuller rein,
    to jump up, to clasp her hands together and to look up into his grave face
    and say: &ldquo;Only, only be kind and gentle to me, give me as much love
    as ever you can&mdash;I am prepared to be the truest, most devoted, most
    loving wife that e&rsquo;er strove to be a joy to her lord. Give me sunshine,
    and gaiety and laughter, and what meed of love you are able to give.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she did not quite dare to say and do all that, for maman&rsquo;s admonitions
    were still fresh in her mind, and her guardian angel would of a surety have
    had to veil his face again before this unseemly behaviour on the part of
    his turbulent charge.</p>

  <p>Therefore she added somewhat tamely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have been taught to be easily contented, and meseems that by honouring
    me with your love, you, my lord, would be doing all that God doth ask of
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though she had spoken lightly, almost flippantly, for her heart was glad,
    and her mind free from any presage of sorrow, his face, which all along had
    been passing grave now looked deeply troubled at her words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doing all that God doth ask of me,&rdquo; he exclaimed with sudden
    vehemence, whilst a tone of bitterness, which she could not understand, rang
    through his usually clear and fresh voice. &ldquo;Nay, little snowdrop, therein
    you wrong divine justice&mdash;if indeed there be one. Dear heart, were I
    from this time forth to shed drop by drop all the blood of my veins, were
    I to give my life inch by inch, my flesh piece by piece to secure your happiness,
    even then I would not be doing all that God would ask of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had turned from her and while he spoke he paced up and down the narrow
    room like some untamed creature fretful of its cage; then he broke into a
    laugh&mdash;not the merry laugh which she had so oft heard ringing through
    the house, but a harsh outburst of passionate sarcasm, which had an undercurrent
    in it of deep and hidden sorrow. Rose Marie felt a wealth of pity surging
    in her heart, when she heard that mirthless laugh. Yet was it not passing
    strange that she, an humble tradesman&rsquo;s daughter, with no knowledge
    of that great world in which lived my lord, that she should thus dare to
    pity this noble, high-born and rich English gentleman? But she could not
    combat the feeling and her innocent blue eyes watching his restless movements,
    and that troubled look on his face, were filled with the tears of womanly
    compassion.</p>
  <p>She looked divinely pretty thus, sitting at the harpsichord, one delicate
    hand idly resting on the ivory keys, from which almost unconsciously she
    had just evoked one sweet and melancholy chord from out the soul of the old
    instrument, like a long-drawn-out sigh of unspoken sorrow. Her young bosom
    rose and fell beneath the folds of the primly folded kerchief, and her upturned
    face showed the white column of her throat round which nestled a string of
    pearls, large and translucent&mdash;his bridal gift to her.</p>
  <p>He paused beside her, and in his expressive face the signs of a great inward
    combat became strangely visible. Then he knelt down, close to her, and with
    a curious gesture half masterful and half appealing he took both her hands
    and imprisoned them in his own. He looked straight into those tear-dimmed
    eyes, with a questioning look that seemed to probe the very depths of her
    soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord you are troubled,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, little snowdrop,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;deeply troubled at
    sight of the exquisite purity which speaks to me with such mute eloquence
    from out the depths of your blue eyes. How dare I, miserable wretch, drag
    you from out that secluded garden of innocence wherein you have grown to
    such perfect beauty. How dare I with impious hand guide you toward that great
    outer world which lies so far beyond the glorious land of your girlish dreams?
    It is a world, dear heart, wherein great monsters dwell, pollution, sin and
    evil and that canker of corruption which will inevitably mar the calyx of
    the snowdrop and cause her white petals to droop at its touch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no fear of that great world, my lord,&rdquo; she rejoined
    simply, &ldquo;since I will enter it in your company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, you must not talk like that, dear heart,&rdquo; he said with
    strange persistence, &ldquo;you must not trust me so. What do you know of
    me or of my life? You so young, so pure, so exquisite, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused and pushing her hands away with a rough, impetuous movement he
    jumped to his feet and once more resumed his restless wanderings up and down
    the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever wandered, little one, in the forests round Cluny,&rdquo;  he
    asked with one of those sudden transitions in voice and manner which puzzled
    her so, &ldquo;and paused beside that pool which the country folk about there
    call the Lake of Sighs? Yes, I see from your telltale eyes that you do remember
    it. Well then, you must oft have seen it lying silent and stagnant beneath
    the shades of the overhanging willows, whilst on its smooth, dark surface
    water lilies as white as snowdrops rear their stately heads in June. You
    should see these in the spring tall and majestic, with graceful upright stems
    and fragrant, wide-open buds, which seem to invite with a kind of cold aloofness
    the rough caresses and kisses of the bee. Tall and majestic like you, dear
    heart, pure and coldly innocent like your soul&mdash;the spring, coy and
    cool, smiles and passes by, leaving those lilies to face the scorching breath
    of awakened summer. Have you stood beside the Lake of Sighs, little one,
    when dying a summer draws out her last sigh of agony? When rank weeds and
    poisonous plants begin to grow apace from out the slimy ooze which encircles
    the pool, and throw out sinewy, death-dealing arms along its peaceful surface?
    Then noisome trails of slugs and grime skim the once pure waters of the pond
    and rank growths of coarse weeds cover the slender stems of the lilies, and
    drag them down, down until the stately flowers, weighted with mud-scattering
    rain bend their proud heads to the mire, the while in their slimy hovels,
    loathsome toads croak their chorus in unison. The world to which I must take
    you, little snow drop, is just such another pool, you the lily and I the
    weed&mdash;and men and women the loud-voiced croakers who are always ready
    to proclaim triumphantly the pollution of a work of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst he spoke he halted opposite to her and looking down into her face
    he studied every line of it, watching for the first look of horror which
    would mar its perfect peace. He was conscious of a strange desire to see
    her afraid of him, to feel that at his words her innocence would rebel, that
    if after what he had said he attempted to touch her, she would shrink away
    in unexplainable horror.</p>
  <p>Now that he was alone with her for the first time, and could study at leisure
    every line of her graceful form, the perfect shell which contained a perfect
    soul, the first poisoned fangs of remorse fastened themselves into his heart,
    and impatient of the monster&rsquo;s attack, he strove to smother it, and
    thus longed to see her less trustful, less innocent, even&mdash;God help
    him&mdash;less pure!</p>
  <p>Already he was searching for justification for that great wrong which he
    was about to commit, nay which he did commit with every word of gentleness
    which he spoke to her, with every moment that he spent in her company. Therefore
    he tried to make his voice harsh and rough, he did not want the child&rsquo;s
    regard, her trust, her allegiance. He would have had her ambitious, sordid
    and grasping for in this he could satisfy her by and bye, when he had all
    the promised riches in his hands, and had made her Countess of Stowmaries.
    He would have had her look on him as a necessary means to her own ends, as
    a man who would at best be wholly indifferent to her, or if that could not
    be, then as a man whom she would hate.</p>
  <p>But in spite of all he said, in spite of his harsh words, and strange imageries,
    the meaning of which she scarce understood, yet almost feared to guess,
    her face remained perfectly calm, and her eyes&mdash;still tender and compassionate&mdash;met
    his in absolute, childlike serenity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of entering that world, my lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with
    you to guide me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a brave snowdrop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nay, you foolish little
    daughter of the frosts, you&rsquo;ll want an angel to guard you and to stand &rsquo;twixt
    you and me. I begin to think that cold ice-maiden though you be, you must
    at some time of your brief terrestrial existence have offended the God who
    made you, since He has thought fit to punish you so severely by giving you
    for husband the most abandoned sinner that ever defiled His earth. Or was
    it in a former existence, dear heart, when you dwelt amidst the snows that
    you roused the ire of devils to such an extent that they swore to be revenged
    on you, once you were a woman and could understand and feel. &rsquo;Twas
    a cowardly revenge of a surety, for there were other men&mdash;less vile,
    less corrupt, less contemptible than he in whose hand you so trustfully place
    yours. God forgive me, but meseems that I do feel tempted to draw aside the
    veil of ignorance which lies before your blue eyes, and to show you pictures
    of evil and of wretchedness from which your calm soul would shrink in horror,
    and even your serene virginity would recoil in fear. See the abandoned wretch
    that I am! I would rouse terror in those eyes&mdash;which hitherto have been
    the blue and opaque windows through which a placid soul hath gazed upon the
    devilries of mankind&mdash;and gazing hath not seen. Dear heart, how will
    you bear it, this first contact with pollution, and with sin; my hand to
    guide you, my finger to be the one to point the hideous way?&mdash;Broad
    the priests call it, and an easy descent to Hell, lined with the grinning
    faces of monstrous ghouls, one of which is called drunkenness, the other
    licentiousness, whilst blasphemy is the constant companion of both&mdash;and
    right and left from the road itself stand those hideous booths where poverty
    and degradation shrink out of sight in the dark hours of the evening gloom,
    and where hovers&mdash;like a gigantic bat with black and loathsome wings
    outspread and claw-like feet that grip and tear&mdash;that cruel Titan, called
    Remorse. Little snowdrop, snow-white and so pure, how will you trust after
    that, the hand that would guide you still further on the way, the voice that
    in its agony of shame would yet murmur in your ears promises of a turning
    out of the hideous road, a turning which leads to happiness and peace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice broke in a sigh which was almost a sob. Gradually as he spoke
    he had drawn nearer to her, until his knee touched the ground, and his head
    was bowed in his hands. But had he looked at her face even now he would not
    on any line of it have seen the slightest sign of the fear which he wished
    to evoke, nor of the loathing which he would have conjured up, yet would
    dread to see.</p>
  <p>Only her eyes as pure, as childlike as before, were veiled in the tears
    of infinite pity. There was silence for awhile in the little parlour, her
    hands had fallen away from the keys of the harpsichord. Only the old clock
    ticked solemnly on, marking the brief minutes wherein these two souls met
    each other in this their first communion. Then as she did not speak, his
    whole soul recoiled at thought of losing her and a great dread seized him,
    lest after all she had understood, and in understanding, turned away from
    him in fear.</p>
  <p>And humbly, gently, not daring to look up, and murmuring scarce above a
    whisper, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little snowdrop, would you trust me still?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And whilst despite iron will, obstinacy and pride hot tears would surge
    to his eyes and sear his aching lids, he suddenly felt a light touch, soft
  and cool as a snowflake, a tiny hand resting upon his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I trusted you ere this, my lord,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;trusted
    and honoured you, mayhap a little feared you as my lord and master. But now,
    methinks that a great sorrow lies buried in your heart&mdash;you choose to
    call it sin&mdash;mayhap it is&mdash;that I do not know&mdash;I am a woman&mdash;soon
    to be your wife, but never your judge, my lord. And if you have sinned, then
    you stand nearer to me, who am so far from that perfection which, alas! you
    see in me. If I feared you before, my lord&mdash;meseems that I could love
    you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Michael Kestyon, with a life of insubordination behind him, a life of
    debauchery, of loneliness and lovelessness, it seemed as if some unknown
    Heaven had opened and he had his first vision of what paradise might be.
    A paradise wherein voices of angels spoke to him of love, and cool white
    hands, cold as snowflakes yet infinitely gentle, led him towards that open
    door. That tiny snowflake fell from his shoulder onto his own burning hands,
    and to his vague astonishment it did not melt at the contact, but lay there
    cool and soft, mayhap a little trembling, having suddenly changed into some
    fairy bird.</p>
  <p>Michael pressed his hot forehead against it, his eyes and then his lips.
    His whole soul cried out mutely now in a passionate longing for happiness.
    Womanly tenderness, womanly pity awaited him in that paradise, the door of
    which stood open, and if honour long since dormant called out loudly against
    treachery and against a trick, who shall pronounce judgment on this man,
    if he had not the strength at this moment to respond to that call?</p>
  <p>With his own hands now, with one word spoken by his own lips, he could shut
    against himself those glorious gates of Heaven, and deliberately turn his
    back on that brief vision of paradise, and walk once more down that hideous
  path which leads straight to Hell.</p>
  <p>There were but the two courses open to him. The one was to take this trusting,
    loving woman to his heart, to guard and keep her in happiness and peace,
    whilst showering on her all the gifts which her weaker nature might desire.
    He was rich now, would be richer still, he could satisfy her ambition, and
    by constant love and tender care, he could win her heart and her inner self
    in time, even though he had won her person by a trick.</p>
  <p>The other course was the rugged path to which the inexorable hand of almost
    barbaric honour pointed relentlessly, to tell her all and to lose her forever.
    To throw back in his kinsman&rsquo;s face the price of this girl&rsquo;s
    innocence, and then to go back to that life in London, the drinking booths,
    the degrading hovels, the propinquity of abandoned reprobates as despicable
    as he had been himself before he met her.</p>
  <p>Pity him if you can!&mdash;judge him not if you&rsquo;ve never been tempted
    to chose &rsquo;twixt life and living death, &rsquo;twixt happiness and degradation, &rsquo;twixt
    the hand of an angel and the gripping tentacles of devils.</p>
  <p>Pity him for he was only a man, with a burning thirst for happiness, a mad
    longing for love and for peace.</p>
  <p>Michael Kestyon kissed the little hand which had confirmed the promise of
    love spoken by the girl&rsquo;s pure lips. He looked up then and met her
    eyes. Heaven alone knows what he would have said or done the next moment.
    The Fates who in their distant, rock-bound cavern spin the threads of destiny
    decreed that these two people should &mdash;ere another word was spoken between
    them&mdash;be incontinently hurled from out the realms of romance wherein
    they had wandered hand in hand for over ten minutes.</p>
  <p>For that&mdash;as we know&mdash;was the time limit set by maman, for allowing
    her daughter to be alone in the company of my lord. And Michael had only
    just time to free the small imprisoned hand so that it might wander back
    to the keys of the harpsichord ere Mme. Legros&mdash;rubicund, fussy and
    prosy&mdash;made irruption into the room.</p>
  <p>Thus it was that for Michael Kestyon the gates of paradise remained for
    the nonce invitingly open, nor did the Fates give him another chance to close
    them against his own happiness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21</b></h2>
  <p>The old, majestic Church of St. Gervais had been made quite gay with flowers.
    Good M. Legros was passing rich, thank God! He could gratify his only child&rsquo;s
    every whim&mdash;however trivial&mdash;on this her wedding day.</p>
  <p>She had expressed a great desire to see the church quite full of flowers&mdash;as
    many flowers as it could hold, and Papa Legros had spent&mdash;so the gossips
    said&mdash;enough money in indulging this wish as would have kept a dozen
    poor families in comfort for a dozen years.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas mid April and there were white roses from the King&rsquo;s conservatories
    in Versailles, white hyacinths from Fontainebleau and white violas from the
    walled-in gardens at Blois, there were white violets and snowdrops and sweet-scented
    narcissi. They lay everywhere in heavy fragrant bunches and wreaths fashioned
    by loving hands, untutored in the art of decoration. The high altar groaned
    beneath the weight of huge brass pots wherein old-fashioned stocks reared
    their sweet-scented heads. The Virgin in her niche, the saints upon their
    altars almost disappeared beneath their monster crowns of violets and of
    roses.</p>
  <p>The central nave was filled with a motley crowd, attired in holiday clothes,
    come to see the tailor&rsquo;s daughter wedded to the English milor. A few
    simple folk there were&mdash;gaffers and cronies who had watched Rose Marie
    as she grew up in her father&rsquo;s back shop, and who came with shaking
    heads and ominous murmurs to see the last of the poor child, who of a surety
    would be drowned when she sailed upon the sea or if she did survive that
    calamity, would certainly be most unhappy in a land of evil-doers, and of
    cruel, red-haired, large-toothed men. But there were others, too, mere idlers
    these, who had never before set eyes on an English milor, and were curious
    to know if what was said of these English were true, namely that they were
    big as giants and like them ferocious, with fangs instead of teeth, and fists
    as heavy as bullocks.</p>
  <p>Under one of the arches, quite close to the chancel, special places had
    been reserved and chairs covered with red cloth. Here a small group of gaily-dressed
    ladies and gentlemen had assembled, gilded butterflies flown from out their
    silken nets over in the St. Germain quarter and even from the Louvre and
    Versailles; gentlemen of the court and of His Majesty&rsquo;s bedchamber
    with their ladies in stiff brocaded paniers and silken skirts which made
    a soft swishing sound as the wearers turned to right or left to lend an ear
    to the whisperings of a gallant or to murmur a word of scandal in that of
    a friend.</p>
  <p>They had crossed the river and wandered into this abandoned quarter of the
    city from idle curiosity. Rumours had reached the Court that the Earl of
    Stowmaries, one of the richest young gallants of London, had come to wed
    the daughter of the Paris breeches-maker, a man well-known to all. His Majesty
    had deigned to seem interested, Mme. de Montespan expressed a desire to see
    this milor, whom gossip had reported as handsome and had endowed with the
    romantic history of early life spent in distant lands, where he was kept
    in poverty and exiled by a rapacious kinsman, who robbed him of his inheritance.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Gossip as a rule had mingled truth with fiction, but the marquise
    was interested and brought her brilliantly decked-out sycophants in her train&mdash;gentlemen
    and ladies who sunned themselves in the sunshine of her graces,&mdash;to
    witness the ceremony of St. Gervais. From this group beneath the archway
    came the constant murmur of fluttering fans, the rustle of silks, the creaking
    of chairs on the flag-stones of the floor&mdash;also at times a giggle quickly
    suppressed, a cry of astonishment or amusement held in check only by the
    solemnity of the surroundings.</p>
  <p>The atmosphere was waxing oppressive, despite the cold April breeze which
    found its way into the edifice through the chinks of many cracked window
    panes. The scent of the poet&rsquo;s narcissus, heavy and intoxicating, filled
    nostrils and brain with its overpowering savour; the roses already inclined
    to droop added their faded fragrance to the air, mingling, too, with the
    penetrating odour of white Roman hyacinths and the pungent smell of primroses
    and of violas, whilst through it all the heavy fumes of incense rose upwards
    to the high-vaulted roof and wrapped the statues of saints, the small side
    altars and tall embroidered banners in their mystery-creating clouds.</p>
  <p>Monseigneur the Archbishop of Paris had just entered, robed in gorgeous
    cope and mitre and followed by the clergy of St. Gervais and the band of
    acolytes clad in scarlet and white. Behind heavy curtains, a band of skilled
    musicians from His Majesty&rsquo;s own opera house were playing an Introit
    from one of M. Lulli&rsquo;s most exquisite scores.</p>
  <p>All necks were craned to catch sight of the man and woman who were kneeling
    on crimson cushions at the foot of the chancel steps.</p>
  <p>The bride could scarce be seen though her figure looked dainty in her simple
    white gown; but her golden head was hidden beneath a filmy veil of delicate
    Mechlin lace, which fell right over her face and far back to the edge of
    her gown.</p>
  <p>But every one could see milor well, for his dark head towered above those
    of the spectators. And he held his head very erect, some folk thinking that
    on this occasion a man should look less proud and certainly less defiant.
    He was gorgeously clad in surcoat and vest of delicate ivory-tinted silk,
    with exquisite embroideries of gold and silver which the gaffers thought
    must have cost a mint of money. But then English milors were all so rich,
    and this one&mdash;so &rsquo;twas said&mdash;was one of the richest amongst
    all; he certainly was one of the most handsome. Goodly to look at was the
    verdict of the women, with his dark hair innocent of those monstrous perruques
    which the <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> of Paris and Versailles had lately
    affected. He wore neither beard nor moustache and every one could see what
    a firm, strong mouth and jaw he had&mdash;an obstinate one murmured some
    of the ladies, a masterful one, sighed the others.</p>
  <p>Mme. de Montespan enthroned on a velvet-covered armchair made vain attempts
    to draw his dark, deep-set eyes to hers.</p>
  <p>But milor looked straight before him, and his arms were crossed over his
    broad chest. When Monseigneur kneeled at the foot of the altar and began
    to recite the first verse of the Introibe, milor knelt too, beside his bride,
    and buried his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>M. and Mme. Legros clad in their Sunday best, knelt quite close to the bridal
    pair. Maman in rich puce-coloured brocade, her scanty locks hidden beneath
    a remarkable confection of lace was frequently mopping her eyes, the while
    M. Legros, master tailor to the Court of Paris, tried to conceal the inordinate
    pride which he felt at seeing his only child wedded to so great a lord.</p>
  <p>Now Monseigneur bent his broad shoulders and sotto voce murmured the Confiteor.
    Rose Marie in the innocence of her heart prayed to the Virgin to make her
    quite, quite perfect, as good as my lord thought her to be, lest he be deceived
    and disappointed in her. She had not spoken to him alone again after that
    happy yet sad quarter of an hour when she had seen his proud head bent before
    her, and felt that unutterable pity for him, which so quickly then became
    unutterable love.</p>
  <p>That his self-accusations were only the result of an over-sensitive conscience
    she firmly believed, and if in his early youth my lord had sinned as other
    young men sin from thoughtlessness and want of a guiding hand, who was she
    that she should judge him, now that he had honoured her with his love?</p>
  <p>And as Monseigneur at the altar read the Holy Gospel wherein the Good God
    himself enjoins man and woman to cleave to one another, Rose Marie&rsquo;s
    whole heart went out to the man by her side, and the magnetism of her enthusiastic
    sacrifice of her whole self to him drew his dark eyes down to hers.</p>
  <p>Michael, as in a dream, saw the exquisite white-clad figure close to him;
    never&mdash;he thought&mdash;had he beheld aught so lovely, so pure, so worthy
    of love. Then looking from her to the great altar before him, he saw through
    the moving clouds of incense phantom figures and objects from out his past.</p>
  <p>There in that dark recess, beside the niche of that mitred saint, faces
    of men who had sneered at his misfortunes, the men of law who had plundered
    him, and a forest of outstretched palms, oily and smooth awaiting the bribes.
    There again high up in the groined roof, his companions in those far-off
    days in Flanders, faces red with the excesses of the day, hands soiled with
    the evil deeds of night; the miserable camp followers in the wake of a starving
    mercenary army, dissolute men and intemperate women; and all around him the
    poor, miserable scum of London, the men with whom he had herded, beasts like
    himself, no more human since wretchedness had killed all manhood in that
    perpetual, that degrading search after forgetfulness.</p>
  <p>All these monsters and ghoulish phantoms grinned at Michael now, polluting
    the sacred edifice with their imaginary presence. They floated corpse-like
    on the shifting clouds of the ever-rising incense and taunted Michael with
    their grinning faces, daring him now to turn from the broad path of happiness
    whither the snow-white hand of an ignorant girl was so trustingly leading
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Follow the path of honour, follow truth and loyalty now, Michael,
    and to-morrow thou&rsquo;lt be one of us again: one with the grinning and
    dishonest sceptics, one with the profligate crowd of mercenary soldiers,
    one with the flotsam and jetsam of criminal London, the drunkards, the roisterers,
    God&rsquo;s damned upon earth. Truth leads the way to perdition, follow truth
    now, Michael, an you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as, up high on the altar steps, Monseigneur now held up for the adoration
    of the multitude the sacred mysteries which no brain of man can understand,
    Michael bowing his head and looking within himself with searching, conscience-stricken
    eyes, saw nothing but loyalty to the girl who was thus unwittingly snatching
    him from out the yawning abyss of misery and degradation, of humiliation
    for himself and starvation for his mother.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Anon Monseigneur whispered the Pater Noster, and after that he turned
    and with hand upheld, three fingers pointing upwards to the mystery-hidden
    vault, he pronounced the solemn benediction on Michael Kestyon and Rose Marie
    his wife. Not a sound stirred in the vast and ancient church, save the voice
    of the Archbishop as it rose high above the chancel, and the blessing spoken
    by him seemed to descend with unseen wings on the bowed heads of the two
    young people whom so strange a fate was linking together.</p>
  <p>To her&mdash;the girl&mdash;it was a Sacrament&mdash;this confirmation of
    the vows spoken in her name when she was too young even to lisp them; for
    him it was the word of honour of a man who throughout a rough life had never
    succeeded in burying honour out of sight.</p>
  <p>Both pronounced their vows without thought of ever rebelling against them.
    Both pronounced the solemn &ldquo;I will&rdquo; with fervour as well as gladness.
    The assistants almost held their breath. Instinctive awe had silenced every
    chattering tongue, stilled every careless laugh.</p>
  <p>My lord&rsquo;s voice rang out clear and distinct in the midst of that hushed
    reverence, and more than one fair dame accustomed to the insipid gallantries
    of the Court of Versailles sighed for the latent and rugged passion which
    rang out through that firm &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rose Marie&rsquo;s young heart gave a great leap for joy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He loves me,&rdquo; she whispered exultantly to herself, despite
    the solemnity of the moment, the sacredness of her surroundings, &ldquo;he
    loves me, he loves me. I can tell it by the sound of his voice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she had to press her bouquet of roses to her lips to suppress the little
    cry of joy which almost escaped her throat. Perhaps she did not altogether
    understand at this moment what she herself meant when she thought &ldquo;he
    loves me!&rdquo; Mayhap some of those ladies in the stiff brocades, who cast
    admiring glances at my lord knew and guessed much more of what went on in
    his mind than did the simple tradesman&rsquo;s daughter with the innocent
    mind and the pure heart of childhood still undefiled within her.</p>
  <p>And now Monseigneur came right down the altar steps and my lord and Rose
    Marie had to rise, and to pass through the wrought-iron gates of the rood
    screen, then pause, standing just below the communion rail. Monseigneur stood
    there awaiting them, and the good cur&eacute; of St. Gervais was near him
    holding a jewelled salver whereon rested two circlets of gold. My lord took
    one of these between his fingers and some one whispered in Rose Marie&rsquo;s
    ear to hold out her hand.</p>
  <p>From far away came in sweet muffled sounds the opening bars of Lulli&rsquo;s
    Beati Omnes exquisitely played on the string instruments. All round Rose
    Marie&rsquo;s feet lay a carpet of white roses which sent their last dying
    fragrance into the air. She felt my lord&rsquo;s strong hand grasping her
    own and the tiny band of gold being slipped on her finger&mdash;the sign
    of her bondage to her lord; she was so happy that she could have cried for
    joy, so happy that she longed to kiss that cold little circlet which now
    irrevocably bound her to him.</p>
  <p>She raised her eyes and saw his dark head bent just over her hand, and it
    seemed as if a magnetic fluid ran from his veins into hers, for she felt
    the passion which quivered in his pulse, and though she might not wholly
    understand it as yet, she nevertheless responded to it with all the strength
    of her young nature full of the joy of love and of life.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;May the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob
    be with you and remain with you always.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monseigneur had begun to speak the final prayer. Bride and bridegroom had
    partaken of the Sacrament together, and Monseigneur had declared that the
    other sacrament, that of matrimony, had indissolubly now renewed the ties
    which already bound them to one another since childhood. This was not a marriage,
    he said, but the repetition of solemn vows made in their name when they were
    too young to understand, the consecration by the Church of those bonds which
    she forged for them eighteen years ago.</p>
  <p>The solemn Amen was pronounced and sung; the King&rsquo;s musicians played
    the first bars of a stirring wedding march specially composed for this great
    occasion by Ma&icirc;tre Colasse of His Majesty&rsquo;s orchestra. There
    was a general movement amongst the spectators, a great sigh of excited satisfaction
    as Monseigneur having stood for a few moments whispering final admonitions
    to milor, now turned and walked with slow steps out through the chancel door.</p>
  <p>One by one the glittering group of gorgeously-clad priests and acolytes
    disappeared out through the narrow opening. The strains of the hidden orchestra
    swelled in glorious volume until they filled every corner of the vast building,
    like a p&aelig;an of triumph and of joy. There was a general frou-frou of
    silken skirts, a clink of swords, a scraping of chairs against the flagged
    floor, as my lord now led his young bride down the nave. He pressed her trembling
    hand against his side, the while he frowned&mdash;despite himself&mdash;at
    this crowd of peering faces, this sea of importunate looks which made him
    restive and impatient. He longed to take his snowdrop away with him, out
    of this indifferent throng, far, far away to some hidden nook among the Kentish
    hills, there where the lime trees were just beginning to unfold their delicate
    leaves of emerald tinged with gold, where lying on a carpet of primroses
    and violets, beneath a cool, grey sky, his burning head fanned by the cold,
    spring breezes, he could kneel at her feet and tell her that with her small
    icy tendrils she had already twined herself around his heart; that her blue
    eyes, cold and pure as those of a forget-me-not beside a brook, had taught
    the miserable reprobate his first lesson of love.</p>
  <p>Then when the pale tints of the limes turned to a more vivid green, when
    primroses had paled beneath the shadows of brilliant Lent lilies, then he
    would try his hand at the great miracle of which he dreamed, the transmutation
    of the white snowdrop into a glowing, crimson rose.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;By the Mass, but the blackguard bears himself bravely! And you, my
    lord, have no cause to be ashamed of your substitute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Lord Rochester who spoke. He, together with Lord Stowmaries and Sir
    John Ayloffe, was standing on the top of the steps beneath the ancient stone
    portcullis which surmounts the porch. They formed a compact little group,
    which gained distinction from the rest of the motley throng, by the sober
    cut of the English-made clothes, and by the drooping plumes of the hats&mdash;a
    fashion long since discarded in France.</p>
  <p>Michael Kestyon with his bride on his arm had just come out of the church.
    She, wrapped in cloak and hood&mdash;for the spring day was chilly and the
    east wind keen&mdash;looked little more for the moment than a small bundle
    of humanity desirous above all of escaping observation.</p>
  <p>But Michael for all the world looked the picture of the soldier of fortune,
    defiant and conscious of danger, ready to walk straight into that yawning
    abyss, at the bottom of which lurks a mysterious death, yet disdainful to
    evade it, too proud to halt, too obstinate to turn back.</p>
  <p>As he came out of the porch, a violent gust of wind caught the folds of
    his cloak, and lashed him in the face, whipping up the swiftly-coursing blood
    which the solemnity of the religious service, the drowsy influence of faded
    roses had lulled into temporary somnolence. The glare of the young April
    sun dazzled him, after the sombre, grey tones of the majestic chancel; the
    pupils of his eyes contracted to a pin&rsquo;s point, making the eyes themselves
    seem pale in colour, and tawny as those of a wild beast sweeping the desert
    with great savage orbs. There was altogether for the moment in the man&rsquo;s
    expression a strange look of dreamy aloofness. His eyes wandered over the
    crowd but obviously they recognised no individual face.</p>
  <p>No wonder that Lord Rochester&mdash;essentially a man himself and a despiser
    of the other sex&mdash;gazed with ungrudging admiration at this splendid
    blackguard, who bore the stamp of virility on every line of his massive frame,
    and who seemed to defy contempt and dare contumely to reach him. Looking
    at Michael now it seemed impossible to think that he could ever regret any
    action which he had set his mind to do. Compunction is for the weak who is
    led astray, who fears gibes and dreads humiliation, but this man had donned
    an armour of pride and of ruthless ambition which neither sneers nor contempt
    could ever penetrate.</p>
  <p>He might be a blackguard&mdash;he was one by every code of moral or religious
    civilisation, but in his most evil moments he was never paltry and never
    vile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I feel no longer any sorrow for the girl,&rdquo; continued Lord Rochester
    after awhile. &ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s fish! Were I a woman I would not complain
    at the bridegroom. And withal she looked vastly pleasing as a bride, and
    methinks Michael Kestyon, too, is overmuch in luck&rsquo;s way. What say
    you, Ayloffe? are you not grieved that you did not take the entire business
    on your own shoulders, rather than depute that good-looking young reprobate
    to earn a fortune and an exquisite bride to boot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John frowned. Some thought, such as the one expressed by Rochester,
    had mayhap crossed his own mind during the past three weeks&mdash;but this
    was not for other people to see. He, too, watched Michael&rsquo;s tall retreating
    figure, as he led Rose Marie down the stone steps, giving it ungrudging admiration
    and also the tribute of secret envy, until a crowd of friends and servants
    closed in round the bridal pair and hid them both from view.</p>
  <p>Then Sir John turned to his friends and said drily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord of Rochester is ever ready for a joke. I desired this scheme
    to succeed, and obviously the worthy tailor yonder would never have mistaken
    me for a man who was seven years old eighteen years ago. But I&rsquo;ll confess,
    an it&rsquo;ll please you, my lord and also my lord of Stowmaries, that I
    do deem Michael Kestyon a lucky dog. One hundred and twenty thousand pounds
    and such a bride! By Gad, had I been able to put back the hand of time some
    twenty years&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bride would have loathed you,&rdquo; retorted Stowmaries with
    an unpleasant snarl. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll fall in love with Michael and clear
    me of remorse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely my lord of Stowmaries is not troubled with any such unpleasantness?&rdquo; said
    Ayloffe imperturbably. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too late now to give way to remorse.
    By to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn, my lord, you&rsquo;ll be as free as air to wed
    whom you please. That simpering tailor&rsquo;s daughter will not have a rag
    of reputation left to her name, and you can repudiate her whenever you feel
    so inclined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that will be at once,&rdquo; replied Stowmaries, who, of a truth,
    was not experiencing the slightest pricks of conscience. The thought of this
    mock wedding which he had actually witnessed to-day had been dwelling in
    his mind for close upon a month. He had envisaged it from every point of
    view and had completely exonerated himself from blame in the matter. The
    image of his fair Julia had quite succeeded in screening from his mental
    vision all thought of the unfortunate girl whom he was thus condemning to
    disgrace and to shame, and whilst he steadily looked on Michael as a miserable
    blackguard he firmly believed that when once he had paid over the price of
    an innocent girl&rsquo;s betrayal he himself would remain absolutely free
    from blame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have made all enquiries,&rdquo; now continued Sir John drawing
    his two friends out of earshot of the crowd. &ldquo;I understand that there
    are to be rare doings to-day in Master the tailor&rsquo;s back shop&mdash;a
    banquet, dancing and I imagine a good deal of wine drinking and licentious
    entertainment. These French bourgeois have no knowledge of decency and Michael
    Kestyon, methinks, did not learn to be squeamish whilst herding with the
    scum of mercenary armies in Flanders and Brandenburg. At five o&rsquo;clock
    however a coach is to take the bridal pair as far as St. Denis&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment, then added with a cynical smile, almost cruel in its
    callousness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first stage of their journey to Havre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Rochester laughed loudly. He had all along only seen the humour of
    the adventure. A woman&rsquo;s reputation destroyed, a woman won by a trick,
    by Gad! these were of every-day occurrence in the life of a fashionable gentleman.
    Indeed he thought that both Stowmaries and Ayloffe were making far too much
    of the whole business, and though he, too, called Michael Kestyon a rogue,
    yet he admired him for his pluck and envied him for his good fortune.</p>
  <p>In his heart of hearts he much regretted that on the memorable night when
    the adventure was proposed, he had been too drunk to accept its terms or
    to enter the lists for it himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay then!&rdquo; he said lustily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all call on
    the turtle doves at St. Denis to-night, and whilst my lord of Stowmaries
    pays up like a man for all that he gains by Michael&rsquo;s roguery, Sir
    John Ayloffe and I will entertain the bride by hoodwinking her still further
    into the belief that she is of a truth Countess of Stowmaries forever and
    ever Amen, as the Archbishop told her this day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should be glad to get to St. Denis to-night,&rdquo; rejoined Stowmaries. &ldquo;I
    owe Michael seventy thousand pounds, which according to promise I should
    pay him to-day. The draft for it on Master Vivish the goldsmith is in my
    pocket now. The sooner I am rid of it the more pleased will I be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then will I at once and see about a coach,&rdquo; said Sir John. &ldquo;We
    can make a start at about six o&rsquo;clock, one hour after the dove hath
    flown out of the paternal cote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, old Daniel Pye will see about the coach,&rdquo; rejoined Stowmaries. &ldquo;He
    hath met a crony who speaks English and knows his way about Paris better
    than we do. He&rsquo;ll get us what we want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daniel Pye!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir John in astonishment. &ldquo;What
    doth my kinswoman&rsquo;s faithful henchman in this depraved city?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress Julia Peyton desired him to do certain commissions for her
    here in Paris. When she heard that I was making the journey she requested
    that I should allow her servant to travel in the company of my men, since
    he was unversed in foreign ways, and knew nothing of the French language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir John made no further comment, but he wondered vaguely in his mind as
    to why the fair Julia had sent old Pye over to Paris. The question of commissions
    was of course nonsense. Daniel could no more choose a length of silk or even
    of grogram, than he could trim a lace coif or fashion a pinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap my fair coz is jealous,&rdquo; was Sir John&rsquo;s mental
    comment and the conclusion to which he arrived with that convenient cynicism
    of his, with which he usually disposed of any problem wherein feminine motives
    or feminine actions played an important part. &ldquo;She hath mayhap deputed
    that old sinner, Daniel Pye, to watch over young Stowmaries and to make report
    in case the wiles of this wicked city make my lord forget his allegiance
    to herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus content with his own explanation of the circumstance, Sir John dismissed
    the old serving-man from his mind, but not without deciding to question Pye
    closely as soon as he had an opportunity so to do.</p>
  <p>Most of the crowd had dispersed by now. The bridal pair with good M. and
    Mme. Legros were being escorted by a merry crowd of &rsquo;prenticess, servants
    and friends as far as the worthy tailor&rsquo;s house in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne
    Com&eacute;die. This cort&egrave;ge had already turned the angle of the street,
    and the noise of laughter and of songs sung to the accompaniment of flute
    and <i>hautbois</i> was gradually dying away in the distance.</p>
  <p>The few laggards who remained behind were discussing the chief actors in
    the pageant which they had witnessed. Mme. de Montespan and her gaily chattering
    court were gossiping whilst waiting for their chaises.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Madame provokingly, &ldquo;are all these English
    milors as handsome as that? I vow our gallants of Versailles have much to
    learn from them, if indeed they all look like milor of Stowmaries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And while the gallants there present protested in dismay an ill-concealed
    jealousy, Madame&rsquo;s roving eyes had discovered the small group of Englishmen
    close by, and amongst them had recognised Lord Rochester.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, milor,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I pray you approach. I did
    not know you were in Paris! What brings you hither, I pray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Rochester, obedient to the call, had already advanced, and was duly
    allowed to kiss those finger tips whereon royal lips were ever wont to linger.
    Englishmen were in high favour with Madame for the next half hour at least.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why are you in Paris?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To catch a glimpse of the most beautiful woman in Europe,&rdquo;  replied
    my lord of Rochester with bold gallantry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll come see her in Versailles,&rdquo; she replied,
    drinking in the full measure of his flattering speech, the obvious falseness
    of which would not have deceived a child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, now that I have seen her!&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;I must
    hie me home to England again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So soon! Then why did you come? Nay!&rdquo; she added with mock severity, &ldquo;Do
    not repeat your pretty lie again. You could not imagine to see me in this
    old church to-day. I came out of curiosity, to see this strange, ill-assorted
    marriage. Tell me what makes the rich Earl of Stowmaries wed a tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was not always rich, nor always Earl of Stowmaries. The ceremony
    was not a marriage. It was a confirmation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you came to witness it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to take part in an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might have guessed. Who is the lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bride of half an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said Mme. de Montespan with a frown. &ldquo;Pray
    explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do even more than that, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; retorted
    Lord Rochester as he stepped a little to one side and disclosed the person
    of my lord of Stowmaries. &ldquo;I will with your permission present to you
    my friend the Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, the <i>only</i> Earl of Stowmaries
    whom I or His Majesty the King of England would ever acknowledge as such.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Marquise looked very bewildered, her great violet-hued eyes opened wide
    and wandered in puzzlement from the face of Lord Rochester to that of his
    friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The only Earl of Stowmaries!&rdquo; she exclaimed in astonishment. &ldquo;I
    vow milor that you have vastly puzzled me. Then who was that handsome young
    milor who just now swore to love the tailor&rsquo;s daughter, the while the
    hearts of two Duchesses, and one other Marquise besides myself were pining
    for his glance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My lord of Rochester, however, kept Madame on the tenter-hooks of expectation,
    whilst he affected the elaborate presentation of his friend which the etiquette
    of the time demanded. He introduced my lord of Stowmaries to Madame la Marquise
    de Montespan, and performed a like service for Sir John Ayloffe. Then only
    did he partly satisfy Madame&rsquo;s curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The young reprobate,&rdquo; he said airily, &ldquo;whom the most
    beautiful Marquise in Christendom has honoured with a glance of her Myosotis
    eyes is&mdash;well! just a young reprobate, whom my lord of Stowmaries here
    is paying handsomely to take an unwelcome bride from off his shoulders. My
    lord of Stowmaries was seven years old when he wedded the tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter&mdash;now he has other matrimonial views&mdash;also a handsome
    cousin who was not averse to stepping into his shoes for this occasion which
    we have all witnessed to-day. He&rsquo;ll be well paid&mdash;neither bride
    nor bridegroom will have much to complain of&mdash;the bridegroom was a wastrel
    ere my lord of Stowmaries proposed this adventure&mdash;and the bride is
    only a tailor&rsquo;s daughter. She will have a handsome husband, if Michael
    Kestyon chooses to acknowledge her&mdash;if not there is always the nunnery
    handy for those saintly women like herself who have made a temporary if not
    wholly voluntary diversion from the strict paths of decorum and virtue. Et
    puis voila!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mme. de Montespan had listened attentively to this tale so cynically told;
    her friends, too, had closed in round her. Every one was vastly interested
    and I assure you not the least in the world shocked. The Court of le Roi
    Soleil abounded in such adventures, the convents of France were filled with
    the grief-stricken victims of the dissolute idlers of the day. Lord Rochester&rsquo;s
    story evoked nothing but amusement, and Lord Stowmaries at once became the
    centre of an admiring little crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But par ma foi!&rdquo; commented Madame with a sigh not altogether
    free from envy, &ldquo;you English gentlemen are mighty blackguards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We do our best, Madame,&rdquo; rejoined Rochester lightly, &ldquo;to
    emulate our confr&egrave;res in France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty shall hear of your gallantries this very night. I pray
    you, Lord Rochester, do not leave us yet, nor you, my lord of Stowmaries,
    nor you, Sir Ayloffe. His Majesty would delight in your company. He so loves
    a bold adventure. And I am much mistaken he&rsquo;ll wish to see our handsome
    young reprobate, too&mdash;Michael Kestyon, did you say?&rdquo; she added,
    prettily mispronouncing the English vowels, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis an ugly name&mdash;but
    oh! he hath fine eyes and a manly bearing&mdash;and did he really do it for
    money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She called Lord Stowmaries to her side and closely questioned him, until
    she knew the entire discreditable story from beginning to end. Her amusement
    in the recital of the tale, her appreciation of the adorable wickedness which
    had prompted the scheme for the cruel hoodwinking of another woman, did much
    to dissipate once and for all any lingering thoughts of remorse which Stowmaries
    may still have been troubled with.</p>
  <p>Nothing would do but the imperious beauty&rsquo;s decree that after the
    call at St. Denis&mdash;which was the call of honour since it meant the paying
    of money for services rendered&mdash;the three English gentlemen must straightway
    back to Versailles, where they would be sure of a cordial welcome from His
    Majesty and from every lady and gentleman at his Court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; urged Madame, when at last she was installed in her chaise
    and was bidding farewell to her array of courtiers, &ldquo;if you can bring
    that adorable young blackguard with you, you&rsquo;ll earn a gratified smile
    from the lips of King Louis, and I&rsquo;ll promise not to do more than turn
    his head and make him forget that he was paid in order to wed the daughter
    of a tailor&mdash;brrr&mdash;the thought makes me shudder. The rogue is an
    Apollo, milors, else a Hercules&mdash;and has just that wicked look which
    makes us poor women tremble and which we adore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with this parting shot levelled at those who would have fought to the
    death for praise such as this, Madame ordered her serving-men to bear her
    away.</p>
  <p>Rochester, satisfied that he had sown the seeds of the most amusing and
    most comprehensive piece of scandal that had ever amused the jaded monarchs
    of two rival kingdoms, turned to his friends for final approval. Ayloffe
    was distinctly appreciative of the new move, but Stowmaries with that shiftiness
    peculiar to weak characters was not quite sure if it had been premature.</p>
  <p>Anyhow the draft for seventy thousand pounds on Master Vivish seemed to
    burn a hole in the pocket of his elegant surcoat. He was longing to be rid
    of all obligations in the matter, firmly convinced as he was when he had
    made Michael richer by one hundred and twenty thousand pounds and himself
    poorer by that vast sum, this tiresome feeling of uncertainty would leave
    him, and he could once more enjoy life in its full&mdash;life with the prospect
    of adorable Mistress Julia as a constant companion by his side.</p>
  <p>He and his friends walked back to the hostelry where they had put up for
    the night. There Stowmaries called for Daniel Pye in order to give him instructions
    about getting a coach ready for the trip to St. Denis.</p>
  <p>But it seems that Daniel had gone out earlier in the day and no one knew
    whither he had gone. But there was no difficulty about the coach. The amiable
    host of the uncomfortable little inn assured MM. les milors that one would
    be ready by half-past five of the clock and that the journey to St. Denis
    could be accomplished in something less than three hours.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23</b></h2>
  <p>The workshop of Master Legros, tailor-in-chief to His Majesty the King of
    France, had been transformed into a vast assembly-room. The big central tables
    whereon usually sat cross-legged the &rsquo;prenticess and stitchers, had
    been pushed to one side, right along the wall where it now groaned beneath
    the weight of pasties, and of pies, of a lamb roasted whole, of dishes of
    marrow bones, of prawns and of cheese, amongst which dishes and platters,
    the bottles of good Burgundy and of wine of Navarre, and the jugs of metheglin
    and hypocras reared their enticing heads.</p>
  <p>The centre of the room was given over to dancing. The wooden floor had been
    greased and polished until it had become slippery to the feet, whilst in
    a corner raised upon a wooden platform covered with crimson cloth a band
    of musicians were playing good lilting, swinging measures for a dance. None
    of your simpering minuets or slow-going pavanes for these young people; but
    something with a good lively tune in it, and plenty of noise and banging
    of the small drum and cymbal, so that a youngster could have a chance of
    gripping a wench well round the waist and of turning her round and round
    until she became so giddy, so breathless and so hot that she had to cry for
    mercy even at the price of a sounding kiss.</p>

  <p>For close upon an hour now the musicians had played the same rousing tune,
    and for close upon an hour indefatigable feet&mdash;some clad in shoe leather,
    others with hard bare soles beating the polished floor&mdash;had been raising
    up a mighty cloud of dust which settled on pasties and on cheese, on the
    big drum and on perspiring faces. Cheeks were crimson from the exertion,
    short hair and long hair, curly and straight hung limply over sweating, greasy
    foreheads. Pinners were getting awry, displaying more bosom than prudery
    would otherwise allow. To right and left surcoats and vests were being cast
    aside and flung across the room leaving bare arms and chests to view, or
    else a shirt more full of tatters than of stitches.</p>
  <p>Daylight still came streaming in for it was only four o&rsquo;clock and <i>les
      mari&eacute;s</i> would not be leaving for at least another hour. In the
      meanwhile M. Legros had much ado to keep the curious, the idle, the impertinent
      from his doorstep, for, look you! though the hospitable abode of the goodly
      tailor was open on this great occasion to all and sundry friends and acquaintances
      who wished to eat and drink and to make merry, yet there was no intention
      of permitting every shiftless vagabond to come and partake of the cheer.</p>
  <p>Good Papa Legros had planted two of his most stalwart assistants at the
    door, with orders to admit no one who did not bear a familiar face, and if
    any one prove importunate, why then the end of a whip-lash or even a stout
    stick should drive impudence away.</p>
  <p>Thus it was that when Master Daniel Pye&mdash;the faithful henchman of fair
    Mistress Peyton&mdash;presented himself at the tailor&rsquo;s shop in the
    Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne Com&eacute;die, he was incontinently refused admittance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I desire to speak with M. Legros, tailor to His Majesty the King
    of France,&rdquo; growled Daniel Pye in excessively bad French, for he knew
    nothing of the gibberish and had only learnt this phrase off by heart like
    a parrot that jabbers without understanding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then thou silly lout of a buffle-headed Englishman, thou&rsquo;lt
    have to wait with thy desire until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I desire to speak with M. Legros, tailor to His Majesty the King
    of France,&rdquo; repeated Pye mechanically. It was the only sentence which
    he knew, and he had been assured by his crony that the magic phrase would
    ope the doors for him without any difficulty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get thee gone, and come back to-morrow,&rdquo; retorted the stalwart
    sentinel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I desire to speak with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An thou&rsquo;lt not go at once,&rdquo; shouted the tailor&rsquo;s
    irascible cutter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee a taste of a French stick across
    thy English shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I desire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bang! came the stout stick crashing down on worthy Pye&rsquo;s broad back,
    quickly bent in order to check the strength of the blow.</p>
  <p>But he held his ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt go to Paris in company with my lord,&rdquo; the mistress
    had said to him peremptorily, &ldquo;and on the day on which the daughter
    of Master Legros, tailor-in-chief to His Majesty the King of France weds
    an English gentleman, thou&rsquo;lt to the house of that same Master Legros,
    and thou&rsquo;lt deliver him this letter&mdash;to him and to no one else&mdash;and
    without saying whence thou comest, nor who it was that sent thee. Thou&rsquo;lt
    go to him one hour after the religious ceremony of matrimony shall have been
    performed in the church and before the newly-wedded pair have quitted the
    bride&rsquo;s parental home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Daniel Pye had presented himself according to instructions. He had safely
    hidden in his breast pocket the letter which he was to deliver to the tailor
    of his Majesty the King of France, and to no one else. If he failed in the
    discharge of his duty, he knew that his fair mistress would punish him mercilessly,
    probably dismiss him from her service altogether and send him&mdash;old and
    unfit for other work&mdash;to starve in his remote East Anglian village.</p>
  <p>At best there were plenty of subordinates in Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s household
    who would only too gladly wield the lash on him who never spared it to others.
    Therefore Daniel Pye held his ground. The more blows he received, the more
    sure would he be of the indulgence of his own mistress. He had a tough hide,
    and after all is said and done, one does not die of a beating. So he bore
    the blows of the stick on his back, and the stinging swish of whipcord round
    his legs. He knew quite well that on occasions such as marriage-feasts or
    other merrimaking days, &rsquo;prenticess and young assistants would have
    their bit of fun.</p>
  <p>He had had his own many a time. So when his back ached overmuch, and his
    legs were more sore than he could stand, he gave up all further attempts
    to force his way into the house and beat a retreat in the rear of the good-natured
    crowd.</p>
  <p>He would, he thought, find a means to speak to Master Legros a little later
    on, when every one&rsquo;s attention would be more fully concentrated on
    merrimaking, and the door was not so closely guarded.</p>
  <p>When Papa Legros heard of the incident he was vastly amused, then he bethought
    himself that mayhap the persistent English lout had some command for him
    for some rich clothes on behalf of one or other of the elegant milors who
    were in Paris at this moment&mdash;friends of my Lord Stowmaries, mayhap.
    Master Legros was vastly perturbed, and sent one of his &rsquo;prenticess
    to search for the Englishman in the crowd, and to bring him hither forthwith.
    But Master Daniel Pye with that stolidity peculiar to his race had gone very
    quietly off to a neighbouring coffee house to nurse his sores, to drink mulled
    ale and to await events.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile within the house itself much time had been spent in eating
    and drinking, as the debris which at this hour littered Mme. Legros&rsquo;  kitchen
    could well testify. The banquet had lasted for nearly two hours and had gone
    on at intervals ever since. M. Legros had made a speech which had caused
    his fair young daughter to blush and made every one there clap mugs against
    the table and shout: &ldquo;Long live! long live!&rdquo; until the old rafters
    and beams shook with the mighty echo.</p>
  <p>One or two buxom maids of all work, with muscular, bare arms and streaming,
    red faces had since then brought in fresh relays of victuals, and any number
    of bottles of wine&mdash;quite enough for every &rsquo;prentices in the shop
    to get as drunk as any lord.</p>
  <p>The noise in the back shop was now incessant and the shouting of the dancers,
    the screams of the girls, the laughing and hooting of the boys, almost drowned
    the cymbal, <i>hautbois</i> and big drum. The intoxication of pleasure had
    whipped up the blood of all these youngsters. Ay! and of the sober folk,
    too, for behold Mme. Legros in her beautiful puce silk footing it with good
    M. Dumas, the shoesmith, and displaying a length of stockinged leg such as
    no decent matron should show except to her husband.</p>
  <p>But what would you? This is an occasion such as only occurs once in a lifetime:
    the marriage of an only daughter, and that to the handsomest, richest, most
    noble seigneur that ever dwelt at the Court of the King of England.</p>
  <p>Then <i>vogue la gal&egrave;re</i>! Let us dance and make merry! Dance until
    every sinew in the body aches and clothes slip off dripping shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mais va donc! vieille tortue!</i>&rdquo; shouted some of the young &rsquo;prenticess
    to the musicians as these poor wretches, perspiring profusely, straining
    their arms and puffing out their cheeks tried to keep up the measure to the
    required rapidity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est un enterrement par Dieu!</i>&rdquo; yelled another,
    as he whirled his partner round until both her little feet gave way and she
    and the indefatigable youth collapsed with a violent thud upon the hard floor.</p>
  <p>A terrific shout of laughter greeted the catastrophe. The musicians, in
    response to vigorous shouts, struck up the measure with renewed quickness.
    They blew and puffed at such a rate now that no foot of man could have kept
    up with the tune, at least not after an hour of this same exertion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assez! assez! not so fast morbleu!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the players evidently had resented the previous comments anent their
    slowness, and now would listen to no admonition in the contrary direction.
    Faster and faster they played, the exhausted, sweating &rsquo;prenticess tripped
    it with frantic efforts; the girls loudly clamoured for the music to stop.
    They were giddy, they were toweringly hot, the young men&rsquo;s breath almost
    burned their cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough! enough! <i>par tous les diables!</i> These musicians have
    the devil in them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The couples fell back one by one panting against the wall, only one pair
    remained in the centre now twirling and twisting in a cloud of dust. The
    girl&rsquo;s white skirts flew out all round her like a thousand wings which
    seemed to lift her off her feet. The man held her tightly, his strong arms
    twined round her as if he never would let her go again, but meant to dance
    and turn, to whirl her through space even to eternity.</p>
  <p>His head was bent for he was over-tall and towered above every one else
    in the room. He was a head taller than she was, but he looked straight down
    at her as he held her, straight into her eyes, those beautiful blue eyes
    of hers which he had thought so cold. They were dark now, almost as dark
    as his own, and flashed with curious purple lights, and deep velvety shadows;
    her lips were parted with the effort of breathing, they were red and full,
    and showed glimpses of small pearly teeth, and the red moist tongue between
    them.</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s heart gave a great bound of joy. This was no ice-maiden
    wrapped in a mantle of snow, the tips of whose chaste fingers he had hitherto
    hardly dared to touch with his lips. No! this was a living, breathing woman
    full of passion, full of the joy of life, a woman moreover who was ready
    to love him, to return passion for passion, and kiss for kiss.</p>
  <p>Ye gods! Michael, but thou&rsquo;rt a happy man!</p>
  <p>He held her close in his arms, for is not God&rsquo;s most glorious, most
    perfect creation upon earth a woman who is pure the while she burns with
    passion? And that priceless treasure was his. Fate had given her to him,
    Fate and his own damnable action.</p>
  <p>Nay, Michael, thou blackguard, if thine action be damnable, then by all
    the Saints in Heaven and by all the devils in Hell, do thou go and be damned,
    but hold this woman first.</p>

  <p>And wild, mad thoughts went coursing through his brain, thoughts of himself
    and of her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a man, and what I do, I do. With mine honour did I buy thee,
    with mine own humiliation and shame have I conquered thee. Thou who art no
    snow-maiden but living lava melting at my touch, thou whom I adore, for whom
    were it to be done again, I would lie and I would cheat, I would descend
    to Hell or conquer paradise. I am a man and what I do, I do! Perish honour,
    perish life itself and eternal salvation if to gain honour mean to forsake
    thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These were the tumultuous coursings of his excited brain the while he held
    her thus, swirling and whirling in his arms, swaying as a reed in the embrace
    of a blasting wind.</p>
  <p>The cloud of dust enveloped them, as, on the Brocken, the steam from unseen
    cauldrons envelops the witches in their revels. Through this haze Rose Marie
    saw nothing but his face and in it she read mayhap something that was passing
    in his mind, something of that passion which her mind as yet could not understand,
    even though her blood and heart were so ready to respond.</p>
  <p>But strangely enough she was not afraid. The child whose life boundary did
    not extend far beyond the walls of the parental home looked out on a limitless
    horizon of men&rsquo;s passions and men&rsquo;s sins, but even beyond that
    horizon the personality of the man to whom she had given her innocent love
    stood out clear and pure: the master to obey, the hero to worship. That she
    had roused a great love in him, she could not fail to see; of that she was
    proud, for her feminine instinct whispered that the greatness of his love
    transcended any sin which he ever might commit.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>How it all happened she never afterwards could say; but it was all so different
    to what had been prearranged by mother and father, and by all the friends.
    Rose Marie had not heard the pawing of horse&rsquo;s hoofs outside, nor yet
    the rumble of the coach. Truth to tell she was so lost in the wild dream
    of the moment that she had forgotten all about what was to come: the farewell
    to maman and papa, the noisy &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to friends, the conventional
    departure accompanied by shouts and cheers and showers of rose leaves which
    all richly-dowered brides have to experience.</p>
  <p>In her case, too, it had all been duly planned, but it happened so differently!</p>
  <p>She had been dancing with her lord, looking up like a fascinated bird into
    his face glowing with ardent love. Then the room began to spin round and
    round, she could see nothing very clearly, yet a delicious languor stole
    into her every limb, she closed her eyes, and gave herself over limp and
    motionless into his embrace. Suddenly she felt herself lifted off her feet
    and carried by strong protecting arms through door and passage, until the
    cold April wind struck her cheeks and forced her with the power of his frolicsome
    will to open her eyes once more. She saw as in a quick vision a rearing horse,
    two or three men in sad-coloured surcoats, one of whom clung to the horse&rsquo;s
    bridle, whilst the other held the stirrup, and then as a background of curious
    faces the crowd of street gaffers standing gaping round. Behind her the dense
    throng of &rsquo;prenticess and wenches, of friends and serving-maids pressed
    forward down the narrow passage, shouting, clamouring cheering to the echoes;
    in the forefront of these papa and maman half laughing, half crying, waving
    hands and mopping tears.</p>
  <p>But it was only a vision swift and sudden, for everything happened so quickly&mdash;and
    she was still so dizzy with the frantic whirl of the dance that she hardly
    remembered being lifted up on to the saddle and landed safely in the strong
    arms of her lord. The words of command had been so quickly spoken, my lord
    had jumped with such rapidity into the saddle, no wonder that she did not
    know exactly how she came to be where she was, clinging to him with all her
    might, and making herself very, very small lest she hindered him in the guiding
    of his horse.</p>
  <p>She knew exactly how to hold on, and how to sit, for she had oft sat thus
    ere now, on her father&rsquo;s saddle when he took her with him for a ride&mdash;he
    bent on some business errand, she enjoying the movement, and the fresh air
    as soon as the grime and smoke of Paris had been left behind.</p>
  <p>But no other ride had ever been quite like this one, for soon the horse
    settled down to an easy, swinging canter in the soft mud of the road, and
    there was an infinite sense of security in the clasp of the sinewy arm which
    held her so deliciously close.</p>
  <p>Just one slight shifting of her lissome body to settle herself more comfortably,
    one little movement which seemed to bring her yet a little nearer to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it well with you, my snowdrop?&rdquo; he asked, bending his head
    in a vain endeavour to catch sight of her face.</p>
  <p>He only could see the top of a small, fair head, from which the hood had
    slipped off, disclosing the wealth of quaint curls and puffs, the formal
    bridal coiffure since then somewhat disarranged.</p>
  <p>The wealth of curls shook in obvious assent, and presently a shy voice murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you call me snowdrop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I was an ignorant fool,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;when I
    first beheld you, a blind and senseless lout who did not distinguish the
    lovely crimson rose that hid so shyly within a borrowed mantle of ice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They call me Rose Marie,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rosemary to me,&rdquo; he said fervently, &ldquo;which is for remembrance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tu m&rsquo;aimes?&rdquo; she asked, but so softly that whilst she
    wondered if he would hear she almost hoped that the April breeze would fail
    to carry her words to his ear.</p>
  <p>Of course he did not reply. There is no answer to that exquisite question
    when it is asked by the loved one&rsquo;s lips, but his right arm tightened
    round her, until she felt almost crushed in the passionate embrace.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24</b></h2>
  <p>You all know that funny little inn at St. Denis, on what was then the main
    road between Paris and Havre; it stands sheltered against north and east
    winds by a towering bouquet of mighty oaks, which were there, believe me&mdash;though
    mayhap not quite so gnarled and so battered by storms of wind and thunder
    as they are now&mdash;in the April of that year 1678.</p>
  <p>The upper story gabled and raftered hung then as now quite askew above its
    lower companion, and the door even in those days was in perpetual warfare
    with its own arched lintel, and refused to meet it in a spirit of friendly
    propinquity. The Seine winds its turgid curves in the rear of the building
    with nothing between it and the outer walls only the tow path always ankle
    deep in mud.</p>
  <p>The view out and across the winding river is only interesting to the lover
    of colour and of space, for there are no romantic hills, no rugged crags
    or fir-crowned plateaus to delight the eye. Only a few melancholy acacias
    sigh and crackle in the wind and tall poplars rear their majestic heads up
    to the vast expanse of sky.</p>
  <p>Now elegant villas and well-trimmed gardens fill the space over which two
    hundred and forty years ago the eye wandered seeking in vain for signs of
    human habitation. Rank grass covered the earth, and close to the water&rsquo;s
    edge clumps of reeds gave shelter to water rats and birds.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Through the small dormer window just beneath the gable, Michael Kestyon
    looked out upon the melancholy landscape and found it exquisitely fair.</p>
  <p>The wind howled down the wide chimney and sighed drearily through the reeds,
    whereon the spring had not yet thrown her delicate tints of green; but Michael
    thought the sound divine, for it mingled in his ear with the tones of a fresh,
    young voice which had prattled gaily on throughout supper-time, of past and
    of future&mdash;not of the present, for that was sacred, too sacred even
    for her words.</p>
  <p>She was a little tired at first, when he lifted her off the saddle, and
    the amiable hostess of the ramshackle inn took charge of her and saw to her
    comforts. But after a little rest in her room, she came and joined him in
    the stuffy parlour, the window of which gave on that far horizon, beyond
    which lay the sea, England and home.</p>
  <p>She seemed a little scared when she found herself quite alone with him,
    without maman or papa to interrupt the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. She
    was so young, and oh! how tender and fragile she appeared to him, as she
    came forward a little timidly, with great, blue eyes opened wide, wherein
    her pure love fought with her timidity.</p>
  <p>Her whole appearance, her expression of face as she yielded her hand to
    him, and allowed him to draw her closer ever closer to his heart, made appeal
    to all that was best, most humbly reverent within him.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie was home to him, she was joy and she was peace, and he, the homeless,
    the joyless, the insubordinate wastrel, felt a wave of infinite tenderness,
    a tenderness which purified his love, and laid ardent passion to rest.</p>
  <p>He led her to the window, and throwing it wide open, he knelt down beside
    her there in the embrasure. She sat on the narrow window seat, looking out
    on that vast expanse of sky and land whereon the shadows of evening had
    thrown a veil of exquisite sadness and peace. The bare branches of the acacias
    as yet only tipped with tiny flecks of green moaned softly beneath the kiss
    of the breezes. Banks of clouds lashed into activity by the wind hurried
    swiftly past, out towards the unseen ocean, now obscuring the moon, now revealing
    her magic beauty, more transcendent and glorious after those brief spells
    of mystery conquered and of darkness subdued. Michael said very little. There
    was so little that he could say, which was not now a lie. He could not speak
    to her of his home, for home to him had been a miserable garret under the
    grimy roof of a house of disrepute, shared with others as miserable, as homeless
    as himself. He could not speak to her of friends, for of these he had none,
    only the depraved companions of a dissolute past, nor could he speak of kindred,
    unless he told her that it was because his mother was dying of hunger in
    a wretched hovel that he had spoken the mighty lie and taken payment for
    speaking it.</p>
  <p>I would not have you think that even now Michael felt any remorse for what
    he had done. He was not a man to act first and blush for his actions afterwards.
    He knew his action to be vile, but then he had known that ere he committed
    it, and knowing it had deliberately taken his course. Were it to be done
    all over again, he would do it; since she never could be his save by the
    great lie and the monstrous trick, then the lie must be spoken and the trick
    accomplished. For she meant love and purification; she meant the re-awakening
    of all that was holy in him and which the Creator infuses in every man be
    he cast into this world in a gutter or upon a throne.</p>
  <p>And he would make her happy, for he had gained her love, and a woman such
    as she hath but one love to give. She would never have loved Stowmaries,
    and not loving, she would have been unhappy. He had taken upon himself the
    outer shell of another man, and that was all; just another man&rsquo;s name,
    title and past history, nothing more. But it was his personality which had
    conquered her, his love which had roused hers. She loved&mdash;not an Earl
    of Stowmaries, the plighted husband of her babyhood. No! she loved him, Michael,
    the blackguard, the liar, the cheat an you will call him so; but she loved
    him, the man for all that.</p>
  <p>Therefore he felt no remorse, when he knelt beside her and during that exquisite
    hour of evening, when shadows flew across the moon, and the acacias whispered
    fairy tales of love and of brave deeds, he listened to her innocent prattle
    with a clear mind and a determined conscience, and the while she spoke to
    him of her simple past life, of her books and of her music, his ambition
    went galloping on into the land of romance.</p>
  <p>The title of Earl of Stowmaries which he had assumed, he could easily win
    now; the riches, the position, everything that could satisfy a woman&rsquo;s
    innocent vanity he would shower upon his snowdrop. She would have all that
    her parents wished for her, all and more, for she would have a husband who
    worshipped her, whose boundless love was built on the secure foundation of
    a great and lasting gratitude.</p>
  <p>It was in this same boundless gratitude that he kissed her hands now; those
    little hands which had been the exquisite channels through which had flown
    to him the pure waters of love and of happiness.</p>
  <p>How quaint she looked, with her fair hair almost wild round her little head.
    The dance first, then the ride through wind and space had loosened most of
    the puffs and curls from their prearranged places. That tired look round
    the eyes, the ring of dark tone which set off the pearly whiteness of her
    skin, the beads of moisture on her forehead, these gave her a strangely-pathetic
    air of frailty, which most specially appealed to Michael&rsquo;s rugged strength.</p>
  <p>Her white gown was torn here and there&mdash;Michael remembered catching
    his foot in it in the mazes of the dance&mdash;it was crumpled, too, and
    hung limply round her young figure, showing every delicate curve of the childlike
    form, every rounded outline of budding womanhood.</p>
  <p>Think you it was an easy task for Michael to keep his tempestuous passion
    in check, he who throughout his life had known no control save that of cruel
    necessity? Think you he did not long to take her in his arms, to cover those
    sweet lips with kisses, to frighten her with the overwhelming strength of
    his love and then to see fright slowly changing to trust and the scared look
    give way beneath the hot wave of passion.</p>
  <p>But with all that mad desire coursing through brain and blood, Michael knelt
    there at her feet, holding her hands, and listening to the flow of talk which
    like a cooling stream rippled in his ear. She asked him about England and
    about his home, and wanted to know if in springtime the white acacias were
    in bloom in Sussex, and if rosemary&mdash;her namesake&mdash;grew wild in
    the meadows.</p>
  <p>In the woods round Fontainebleau the ground was carpeted with anemones;
    were there such sweet white carpets in the English woods? Then she looked
    about her in the ugly, uninteresting little room and saw a broken-down harpsichord
    standing in a corner.</p>
  <p>She jumped up gay as a bird and ran to open it. There were several broken
    keys, and those that still were whole gave forth quaint, plaintive little
    sounds but she sang:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Si tu m&rsquo;aimais, tu serais roi de la terre!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>and he remained beside the window, with the cold breeze fanning his cheek,
    his head resting in his hand, and his eye piercing the gloomy corner of the
    room from whence came the heavenly song.</p>
  <p>Indeed! was he not king of all the world?</p>
  <p>Thus passed a delicious hour. Anon the coach&mdash;which originally should
    have brought the bridal pair hither, had not milor carried off the bride
    in such high-handed fashion&mdash;came lumbering up to the door.</p>
  <p>Prudent maman had despatched it off in the wake of the impetuous rider.
    It contained a bundle of clothes and change of linen for Rose Marie and had
    my lord&rsquo;s effects, too, in the boot.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie gave a little cry of delight when she realised maman&rsquo;s
    forethought, and then one of dismay for she suddenly became conscious of
    her disordered dress.</p>
  <p>The worthy hostess&mdash;fat, greasy and motherly, had entered, candle in
    hand, to announce the arrival of the coach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me and my man expected Monsieur and Madame to arrive in it,&rdquo; she
    explained volubly. &ldquo;Monsieur&rsquo;s servant came yesterday to bespeak
    the rooms and to arrange for the stabling. I was so surprised when Monsieur
    arrived on horseback, so much earlier, too, than we had anticipated&mdash;else
    I had had supper ready ere this, for Monsieur and Madame must surely be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But supper must be ready by now, good Madame Blond,&rdquo; said Rose
    Marie blushing to hear herself called &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; &ldquo;and I
    pray you have my effects taken to my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are there already, so please you, my pigeon,&rdquo; said the
    amiable old soul, &ldquo;and there is some water for washing your pretty
    face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And will supper be ready soon?&rdquo; she reiterated insistently
    for she was young and healthy, and had eaten very little for sheer excitement
    all day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While you smooth out your golden curls, <i>ma mignonne</i>, I&rsquo;ll
    dish up the soup. Nay! but Monsieur is in luck&rsquo;s way!&rdquo; she said,
    shaking her large round head. &ldquo;Madame is the comeliest bride we have
    seen at St. Denis for a long time past. And they all come this way, you know&mdash;away
    from the prying eyes of kindly friends. Me and my man are so discreet!&mdash;especially
    if the bride be so pretty and the bridegroom so good to look at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She would have babbled on a long time, despite Monsieur&rsquo;s look of
    fretful impatience, but fortunately just then the hissing sound of an overflowing
    soup-pot came ominously through the open door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Joseph, patron of good housewives, defend us!&rdquo; exclaimed
    Mme. Blond, making a dash for the door, &ldquo;the cro&ucirc;te-au-pot is
    boiling over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rose Marie made to follow her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Need you go, my snowdrop?&rdquo; he asked, loth to let her go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just to change my crumpled gown, and smooth my hair,&rdquo; she replied
    demurely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are so beautiful like this, I would not wish to see one single
    curl altered upon your head, or one fold changed upon your gown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was standing against the table, the fingers of one hand resting lightly
    upon the blackened oak, her head bent slightly forward the while her blue
    eyes half sought, half shrank from his gaze.</p>
  <p>He went up to her, and drew her to him. The desire was irresistible and
    she almost called for that first kiss by her beauty, her innocence, her perfect
    girlishness which was so ready to give all bliss and to taste all happiness.</p>
  <p>He kissed her fair hair, her eyes, her delicate cheeks now suffused with
    blushes. Then with a look he asked for her lips and she understood and yielded
    them to him with a glad little sigh of infinite trust.</p>
  <p>The hand of time marked these heavenly minutes; surely the angels looked
    down from their paradise in envy at this earthly heaven. Outside the wind
    sighed amid the branches of the acacias, wafting into the room something
    of the pungent odour of this spring air, of the opening buds of poplars and
    of beeches and the languorous odour of newly-awakened life.</p>
  <p>Gently she tried to disengage herself from his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must go now,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For a moment and I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let go, dear lord, for I would go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not till I&rsquo;ve had another kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Happiness and the springtime of the earth, joy and life and love dancing
    hand in hand with youth! O Time, why dost not stop at moments such as this?</p>
  <p>The sighing of the reeds on the river bank came as the sound of a fairy
    lullaby, the scent of the spring reached the girl&rsquo;s nostrils like an
    intoxicant vapour, which clouded her brain. The room was quite dark, and
    she could scarcely see his face, yet she felt that his eyes perpetually asked
    a question, to which she could only respond by closing her own:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tu m&rsquo;aimes?&rdquo; he whispered, and the heavy lids falling
    over ardent eyes made mute response to him.</p>
  <p>A confused sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs outside, of shouts and calls from
    within roused them both from their dream. She succeeded now in disengaging
    herself from his arms, and still whispering:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back!&rdquo; she retreated toward the door.</p>
  <p>Just as she reached it, the moon so long obscured burst forth in full glory
    from behind a bank of clouds, her rays came straight into the narrow room
    and lighted on the dainty figure of the girl standing with crumpled white
    dress and hair disarranged, cheeks rosy red and eyes full of promise and
    love against the dark background of the heavy oaken door.</p>
  <p>Michael looked upon her with longing, hungry eyes, drinking in every line
    of that delicately-moulded form, the graceful neck, the slender hands, the
    firm girlish shoulders on which the prim kerchief had become slightly disarranged.
    Then as she retreated further into the next room, she vanished from his sight;
    the door fell to behind her with a heavy, ominous sound, shutting out the
    radiant vision of Michael&rsquo;s cherished dream, leaving him on the other
    side of the heavenly portals, alone and desolate.</p>
  <p>Thus he saw her in full light, and lost her in the shadows. Something of
    the premonition of what was to come already held his heart as in a cold and
    cruel vice. When the door closed upon his dream, upon his Rose Marie, he
    knew by an unerring and torturing instinct that he would never, never see
    her quite as she had been just now. The Rose Marie who had left him was for
    remembrance.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25</b></h2>
  <p>The next moment the door which gave on the landing was thrown open, and
    Michael stood face to face with M. Legros.</p>
  <p>Thus premonition had come true. Thus would nothing remain of the past delicious
    hour only remembrance and bitter, bitter longing for what could never be.</p>
  <p>The light of the one candle fell full upon the unromantic figure of the
    good tailor, on his pallid face whereon beads of perspiration told their
    mute tale of anxiety and of fulsome wrath. His eyes, dilated and tawny in
    colour were fastened full upon the reprobate, demanding above all things
    to know if the outraged father had perchance arrived too late.</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s gay wedding clothes were torn and awry; mud covered his
    shoes and stockings for he had not even stopped to be booted and spurred.
    The old English serving-man who had vainly tried earlier in the day to gain
    speech with the master tailor, had reached the august presence at last, and
    had handed to M. Legros the letter which was to be given to him and to no
    one else. It was written in a bold, clear hand and in scholarly French for
    the better understanding of Monsieur the tailor to the king. Mistress Peyton
    having penned a few ill-scrawled, ill-spelt words had bethought herself of
    a young Huguenot clerk of French parentage who earned his living in London
    by the work of his pen; and being desirous above all that M. Legros should
    fully comprehend her letter, she caused it to be translated and writ clearly
    by that same young clerk, ere she finally entrusted it to Daniel Pye for
    delivery.</p>
  <p>Thus it was that that which was written in the letter did not fail to reach
    the understanding of good Papa Legros. It was a full and detailed account
    of the treachery which had been perpetrated on the tailor&rsquo;s daughter
    by one Michael Kestyon, who was naught but a dissolute profligate, a liar
    and a cheat, since his own cousin was Earl of Stowmaries, and no one else
    had any right to such title but he.</p>
  <p>Papa Legros did not trouble to ask many questions, and since the English
    lout knew not a word of French, the good tailor took no further heed of him.
    He spoke to no one, not even to his wife. The letter said something which
    must be verified at once&mdash;at once&mdash;before it was too late. He gave
    orders that no one&mdash;least of all Mme. Legros&mdash;was to be disturbed,
    the merrimaking was to go on, the dancing, the eating and drinking, the speech
    making and all.</p>
  <p>Then he slipped out by the back door and reached the small outbuilding where
    he kept a horse, which served him on occasions when he had to go to Versailles
    to try on a pair of breeches for His Majesty the King. It took good M. Legros
    no time to saddle his horse, and a ride of over three hours had no terrors
    for him beside the awful fear which gripped his paternal heart.</p>
  <p>Before he left his home he detached from a nail on the wall of the shed
    an enormous stick with heavy leather thong, with which he at times administered
    castigation to refractory or evil-minded &rsquo;prenticess.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Then he mounted his horse and rode away in the fast-gathering twilight.</p>
  <p>He knew his way to St. Denis and to the inn whither he wished to go. He
    put his horse to a gentle canter and it was just past nine o&rsquo;clock
    when he saw the light in the old tower of the Church of St. Denis.</p>
  <p>He was tired and stiff from riding, but he had sufficient control of himself
    to speak quietly to the host of the little inn, and to ask cheerfully of
    good Mme. Blond which room his daughter was occupying.</p>
  <p>The amiable old soul pointed the way up the stairs, then returned to her
    stock-pot with the cheerful comment that she would serve the soup in a few
    moments.</p>
  <p>Then Papa Legros went upstairs and pushing open the door stood face to face
    with Michael. With one hand he gripped the heavy stick with the stout leather
    thong on it, with the other he fumbled in the pocket of his surcoat until
    he found the letter again&mdash;the letter which was penned in such scholarly
    French by the Huguenot clerk, and which revealed such damnable treachery.</p>
  <p>But Papa Legros wanted above all to be fair. During the long, monotonous
    ride in the silence and darkness of this spring evening he had had time to
    collect his thoughts somewhat, to weigh the value of the anonymous writing,
    to think of milor as he had known him these past three weeks: gallant and
    plucky to a fault, proud, generous and brave; and now that he stood before
    the man, saw the noble bearing of the head, the fine dark eyes, the mouth
    that was so ready to smile or to speak gentle words, his terror fled from
    him, and though his voice still shook a little from the intensity of his
    emotion, he contrived to say quite quietly, as he held the crumpled letter
    out toward Michael:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord&mdash;you will forgive me&mdash;I know you will understand&mdash;but
    it is the child&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;my lord, will
    you read this letter and tell me if its contents are true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael took the paper from him quite mechanically, for of course he had
    guessed its contents, but mayhap he had a vague desire to know who it was
    that had so wantonly destroyed his happiness. He went to the table and drew
    the flickering candle a little nearer, then bent his tall figure to read
    that cruel letter.</p>
  <p>The handwriting told him nothing, but the tale was plainly told. The avenging
    angel of God was already standing with flaming sword at the gate of his paradise,
    forbidding him ever to enter. He looked up from the letter to that black
    door behind which she was; it almost seemed as if his aching eyes could pierce
    the solid oak. She was there behind the door and he could never, never again
    go to her, he could never, never again hold her in his arms.</p>
  <p>Heaven had vanished and at his feet now yawned merciless, illimitable Hell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; and the trembling voice of the outraged father broke
    in upon his thoughts, &ldquo;my lord, I still await your answer&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    not believe that nameless scrawl&mdash;I ask your word&mdash;only your solemn
    word, my lord, and all my fears will vanish. Swear to me, my lord, on the
    innocent head of my darling child that this letter holds nothing but calumnies
    and I&rsquo;ll believe you, my lord&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll swear it on her
    golden head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Do you know that hush that to the imagination seems to fall upon the whole
    world just when a human heart is about to break? Michael felt that hush all
    around him now; the April wind ceased its moaning in the boughs of the young
    acacia trees, the reeds by the river bank sighed no longer in the breeze,
    awakened nature just for one moment fell back into winter-like sleep, and
    a shadow&mdash;blacker and more dense than any that can fall from an angry
    heaven over the earth&mdash;descended on Michael&rsquo;s soul.</p>
  <p>To swear&mdash;as he had sworn this morning at the foot of the altar? To
    swear by that most sacred thing upon God&rsquo;s earth, her sweet head?&mdash;no!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you swear, my lord, that this letter is but vile calumny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Michael gave answer loudly and firmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is the truth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Less like a man than like an infuriated beast, the meek man&mdash;now an
    outraged father&mdash;literally sprang forward with upraised arm wielding
    the heavy dog-whip, ready to strike the miscreant in the face.</p>
  <p>The proud, defiant head, noble even now in its humiliation, was bent without
    a murmur. Michael made no movement to avert the blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not kill me instead?&rdquo; was all the protest which he
    made.</p>
  <p>Legros&rsquo; upraised hand fell nerveless by his side. He threw the stick
    away from him. He, poor soul, had never learned to control emotion, he had
    gone through no hard school wherein tears are jeered at, and sorrows unshared.
    He had never learned to be ashamed either of joy or of grief, and now, face
    to face with this man who had so deeply wronged him, and whom, despite his
    wrath, he was powerless to strike, he sank into a chair, and buried his face
    in his hands whilst a pitiful moan escaped his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The child&mdash;the poor child&mdash;how shall I ever tell her? The
    shame of it all&mdash;the cruelty&mdash;the shame&mdash;how shall I tell
    her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Time&rsquo;s callous hand marked these minutes of terrible soul-agony,
    just as awhile ago it had marked the fleeting moments of celestial joy. Michael
    was silent, the while he wondered almost senselessly&mdash;stupidly&mdash;if
    Hell could hold more awful agony than he was enduring now.</p>
  <p>Yet through it all his turbulent soul rebelled at the situation, the sentimental
    parleyings, the pitiful grief of the father and the enforced humility of
    his own attitude. He knew that he had lost his Rose Marie, that the parents
    would never give her to him now; the solid and indestructible wall of bourgeois
    integrity stood between him and those mad, glad dreams of triumph and of
    happiness.</p>
  <p>It was characteristic of the man that he never for a moment attempted to
    guess or to find out the channel through which his own misery had come to
    him. He certainly never suspected his cousin of treachery. Fate had dealt
    the blow cruelly and remorselessly and sent him back to a worse hell than
    he had ever known; a hell which Satan reserves for those he hates the most&mdash;the
    way to it leads past the entrance to heaven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good M. Legros,&rdquo; said Michael at last, striving to curb his
    impatience and to speak with gentleness, &ldquo;will you try and listen to
    me? Nay, you need not fear, &rsquo;tis not my purpose to plead justification,
    nor yet leniency&mdash;I wish that you could bring yourself to believe that
    though I wooed and won your daughter by what you think is naught but an abominable
    trick, I had one great thought above all others and that was that I would
    make her happy. This I do swear by the living God, and by what I hold dearer
    still, by the love which I bear to Rose Marie. And as there is a heaven above
    me, I would have made her happy, for I had gained her heart, and anon when
    the bonds of mine own boundless love had rivetted her still more closely
    to me, I should have taught her to forgive my venial sin of having entered
    heaven by a tortuous way. The name which I bear is mine own, the title which
    I have assumed is mine by right, I would have conquered it for myself and
    for her. You say that it is not to be&mdash;yet I swear to you that she will
    not be happy if you take her from me. This I know; if I did not I would go
    to her myself and tell her that I have lied to her. If despite what you know
    you will still confide her to me, you will never regret it to your dying
    day, for apart from the life of love and happiness which will be hers, I
    will lavish upon her all the treasures of satisfied ambition, far surpassing
    anything which you&mdash;her father&mdash;have ever wished for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Legros despite his grief which had completely overmastered him for awhile,
    raised his head in absolute astonishment. Surely these English were the most
    astounding people in all the world! Here was this man who of a truth had
    committed the most flagrant, most impudent act of trickery, that had ever
    been perpetrated within memory of living man&mdash;he had done this thing
    and been ignominiously found out. By all the laws of decent and seemly behaviour
    he should now be standing humble and ashamed before the man whom he had tried
    to injure. And yet what happened? Here he stood, in perfect calm and undisguised
    pride, not a muscle of his face twitched with emotion, and his neck was as
    stiff as if he were exulting in some noble deed.</p>
  <p>Had these English no sense of what was fitting? had they no heart? no feelings?
    no blood within their veins? The man&mdash;so help us the living God!&mdash;was
    actually suggesting that his trickery be condoned, that an innocent child
    be entrusted to him, who stood convicted of falsehood and of treachery! Good
    M. Legros&rsquo; Gallic blood boiled within him, overwhelming grief gave
    place to uncontrollable wrath. He rose to his feet, and pulled up his small
    stature to its uttermost height.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will make her happy!&rdquo; he thundered, throwing an infinity
    of withering scorn into every word. &ldquo;You&mdash;who like a prying jackal
    came to steal the fledgling from its nest? You who took money with one hand,
    the while you snatched a girl&rsquo;s honour with the other? With lying lips
    and soft, false words you stole our child&rsquo;s heart&mdash;even until
    father and mother were forgotten for the sake of the liar and the cheat who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael held up a quick warning hand, and instinctively the insults died
    on the other man&rsquo;s lips. Rose Marie&mdash;white as the clinging, crumpled
    gown which she had hastily refastened when anon she heard her father&rsquo;s
    voice raised in angered scorn&mdash;Rose Marie silent and still, and with
    great eyes fixed on Michael Kestyon, was standing in the doorway.</p>
  <p>At sight of her good M. Legros&rsquo; grief swept over him with renewed
    force. Once more he sank into a chair, and buried his face in his hands whilst
    a moan of painful soul-agony escaped his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The child!&mdash;the child! My God how to tell her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Rose Marie&rsquo;s voice came quite clear and distinct, there was no
    catch in her throat, nor tremor in the gentle tones as she said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! my dear father, an there is aught to tell&mdash;milor will best
    know how to say it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26</b></h2>
  <p>Papa Legros at first had been too dazed to protest. Truly his loving heart
    had been for hours on the rack at thought of the awful task which lay before
    him&mdash;the opening of his child&rsquo;s eyes to the monstrous trick played
    upon her by the man to whom her innocent heart had turned in perfect love
    and in perfect trust. He, the father, who worshipped this dainty, delicately-nurtured
    daughter, who had spent the past twenty years of an arduous life in trying
    to smooth away every unevenness from the child&rsquo;s pathway of life, now
    suddenly saw himself like unto the scarlet-clad executioner, rope and branding
    irons in hand, forced to bind his beloved one on the rack, and himself to
    apply the searing torture of sorrow and of shame to her soul.</p>
  <p>The child&rsquo;s calm words as she stood confronting the miscreant had
    almost brought relief. Why indeed should not the villain accomplish his own
    unmasking? Papa Legros hating the man who had done him and his child an infinite
    wrong, had a sufficiency of perception in him to realise, with that subtle
    cruelty of which the meek are alone capable, that he could not inflict more
    exquisite torture on his enemy than by forcing him to stand self-convicted
    before the child.</p>
  <p>Just for the moment&mdash;and truly he may be forgiven for it&mdash;all
    that was good and kind in the gentle nature of the tailor had been ousted
    by his wrath as a father and as a man. He had found himself unable to strike
    the liar just now; but he longed for the power to torture his very soul,
    to bring him to the dust in sorrow and humiliation, to see the proud head
    down in the mud of abject shame. Great God! did you not know that Papa Legros
    had learned to love this man like he would his own son, and that the grief
    which he felt was in part for Rose Marie and in part for the miscreant who
    had twined himself around his heartstrings, and whom he cherished the while
    he longed to chastise him with infinite cruelty?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father dear,&rdquo; said Rose Marie after a slight pause, &ldquo;will
    you not allow me to speak with milor alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not trust thee one second in his keeping, child, now I know
    him for what he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You need have no fear, dear,&rdquo; she rejoined calmly, &ldquo;and &rsquo;twere
    best methinks for us all if milor were to tell me himself all that I ought
    to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The candle flickered low, and Michael stood back amidst the shadow; thus
    the good tailor failed to see if his own shaft had gone home&mdash;if it
    had pierced that armour of stolid English indifference which the descendant
    of Gallic forebears found so difficult to comprehend.</p>
  <p>Certain it is that Michael raised no protest, and that not even a sigh escaped
    him as this final insult was hurled at him with the utmost refinement of
    vengeful cruelty.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie went up to her father and placed her small cool hands on his.
    Then with gentle persuasion she drew him up. He yielded to her, for vaguely
    at the bottom of his heart, he knew that he could trust the man whom he loved
    and hated, yet even now could not wholly despise. For one moment as father
    and daughter stood side by side, he took her in his arms and kissed her forehead.
    She rested against him cold and placid, and when he released her from his
    embrace she took his rough toil-worn hand and kissed it tenderly. Then with
    supreme yet irresistible gentleness she led him out of the room.</p>
  <p>As he passed close to Michael he held out the fateful letter to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will show her that,&rdquo; he almost commanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you wish it,&rdquo; replied the other, as he took the letter from
    him.</p>
  <p>A curious instinct prompted Michael to blow out the flickering light, just
    as Rose Marie, having closed the door behind her father, turned back into
    the room. He went up to her, but she retreated a step or two at his approach,
    and of her own accord went to the window seat, there where a brief hour ago
    she had sat with him in perfect communion and perfect happiness.</p>
  <p>The casement was still open, and the moon which had been so fitful throughout
    the evening poured her cold radiance straight on the dainty silhouette of
    the girl, just as she had done awhile ago, ere the gates of paradise were
    closed and the angels had ceased to sing their glad hosannas! Outside, the
    sighing of the reeds and the moaning of the wind in the young acacias made
    a sound as of innumerable feet of restless spirits stirring the dead leaves
    of an unforgettable past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That letter, milor,&rdquo; said Rose Marie, &ldquo;will you give
    it me&mdash;since my father hath so commanded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without a word he handed the paper to her, and when he saw that she could
    not read it&mdash;for the room was dark and the rays of the moon not sufficiently
    bright&mdash;he took out his tinder-box and relighted the guttering candle.
    Then as the wind blew the feeble flame hither and thither he shielded it
    with his hand, and held the candle so that she might read and yet not move
    from that window seat.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;She read the letter through to the end, and while she read he could
    see the top of her head bent down to the paper, and the wealth of those fair
    curls which he would never again be allowed to kiss.</p>
  <p>When she had finished reading, she looked up and he threw the candle far
    away out through the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you had lied to me,&rdquo; was all that she said; and she said
    it so calmly, so quietly, like the true snow maiden which she had once more
    become, now that he who alone had the power to turn the snow to living fire,
    was proved to be treacherous and false. Then she folded up the letter and
    slipped it under her kerchief.</p>
  <p>Stately and tall as the water lilies on the pond which he had once described
    to her&mdash;she drew up her slender figure and held her little head erect.
    She did not look in his direction but rose slowly and turned to go out of
    the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rose Marie,&rdquo; he called out to her in an involuntary moan of
    agony.</p>
  <p>Instinctively his hand went out to her as she passed, and clutched the crumpled
    wedding dress which seemed to wrap her in, now like a shroud. She tried to
    disengage her gown, but as he held it tight she desisted, standing there
    cold and impassive, a woman turned to ice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rose Marie!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;my own little snowdrop, will
    you be so unyielding now? Awhile ago do you remember, you yielded to the
    sweetness of a first kiss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet you lied to me,&rdquo; she said slowly, tonelessly, the while
    her eyes sought the distant horizon far away, where astride on the cold grey
    mists unreached by the tender light of the moon, her dreams of happiness
    were fleeting quickly away.</p>
  <p>He drew himself up and caught her to him with a masterful gesture of possession.
    He felt her body rigid and impassive at his touch, stiffening in a backward
    motion away from him behind that massive stone wall of awful finality which
    had so mercilessly risen between her and him. He felt that he was losing
    her, that she was slipping away from him&mdash;slipping&mdash;up, up to some
    cold and unresponsive heaven, peopled with stern angels, whose great white
    wings would soon enclose her and hide her from him forever. He felt that
    he was losing her, not with that same bitter-sweet sense of sadness as he
    did just now when the savour of her exquisite lips still clung to his own,
    and she retreated out of his sight like a perfect vision of beauty.</p>
  <p>Now an almost savage longing was in him not to let her go, to keep her to
    him at any cost, any sacrifice, even that of his own self-control. There
    was enough power in his own ardent love for her so to bind her to him that
    she could never, never leave him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My beautiful crimson rose,&rdquo; he murmured, drawing her closer,
    closer, even while he felt that with her whole gentle strength she opposed
    an icy calm to the warm glow of his passion, &ldquo;turn your dear eyes to
    me, just for one brief moment. Oh! think, think of the past few days when
    first our hearts, our souls, our entire beings met in perfect accord. Look
    at me, my dear, sweet soul, am I not the man to whom you have listened so
    oft, sitting at your harpsichord, the while he whispered to you the first
    words of love? Look, look, my dear, mine eyes, are they not the same?&mdash;my
    lips have they not met yours in one sublime, unforgettable kiss? You were
    a child, ere your soul met mine&mdash;now you are a woman, &rsquo;tis I who
    applied the magic fire to your heart, &rsquo;tis I who kindled the flame
    of your pure love; you are no longer a child now, Rose Marie, you are an
    exquisitely beautiful woman, and I love you with every fibre of my body,
    with every aspiration of my soul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet you lied to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And would lie again, would sin again a thousand times, since my sin
    gave you to me. Sweetheart, if I have sinned, yet have I expiated already&mdash;one
    cold look from your dear eyes hath caused me more acute agony than the damned
    can ever suffer in Hell. My love&mdash;my love&mdash;do you understand what
    you mean to me? Have you realised the exquisite gift&mdash;your perfect womanhood&mdash;which
    you would snatch from me? I was a wastrel, a thief, a miserable degraded
    wretch&mdash;awhile ago when I held you in my arms I was king of all the
    world. By my sin I won you! Great God, then is not my sin the greatest, grandest
    and most glorious deed ever accomplished by man&mdash;in order to gain a
    heaven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But with all his ardour, all his savage strength of will and of purpose,
    Michael was but bruising his heart against a solid stone wall. Perhaps if
    Rose Marie had been a little older, a little more sophisticated, a little
    more wearied in the ways of men, she might have yielded to the love of the
    man, and closed her eyes to the deeds of the sinner. Whatever else he had
    done, she would easily have forgiven&mdash;nay! she would never have judged&mdash;but
    it was the betrayal of her trust which turned her heart to stone. Of course
    she had not had time as yet to think. In the letter which he had given her
    she had read the awful account of that transaction wherein she appeared as
    a mere chattel tossed from one hand to another, paid for with money like
    a bale of goods.</p>
  <p>Oh! the shame of it! And he, to whom she had given her entire heart and
    soul, to whom she was ready to yield herself absolutely and completely had
    bought her at a price. Love? She no longer believed in it. If he had lied
    to her, then neither love nor purity nor manhood existed on God&rsquo;s earth&mdash;and
    this was no vale of tears but one of infinite shame.</p>
  <p>She looked down on him with just such a cold look in her eyes as he had
    compared to the infliction of the tortures of the damned. She knew that physically
    she would be too weak to resist him, and she would scorn to call out to her
    father. This she tried to convey to him by that cold look and by the perfect
    placidity of her demeanour.</p>
  <p>For one moment he was conscious of the wild desire to snatch his happiness
    from out the burning brand even now, and to take her in his arms and ride
    away with her into the land of forgetfulness. The wind in the trees seemed
    to call out to him not to let her go, and the reeds murmured as they bent
    their heavy heads that she would forgive everything after another kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rose Marie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something of what was passing in his mind must have reached her inner consciousness.
    She was quite woman enough to know that here was no ephemeral passion, no
    flame of desire extinguished as soon as born. He loved her and she loved
    him, that was as true, as incontestable as that&mdash;in her understanding&mdash;the
    treacherous act which he had committed now stood irremediably between them,
    whilst to his wild and rugged sense of the overwhelming grandeur of love,
    nothing could or should ever part him from her.</p>
  <p>In her eyes the betrayal was greater than the love which&mdash;in his&mdash;had
    by its very existence atoned for everything. But throughout her deeply resentful
    feeling of wrong done to her and hers there was mayhap an unconscious sense
    of weakness, a desire to bring forth a greater array of will power and set
    it up against the insinuating persuasion of his voice, the insidious magic
    of his touch. Certain it is that she felt suddenly compelled to break the
    rigid silence which throughout his impassioned pleading she had so deliberately
    imposed upon herself.</p>
  <p>Held in his nervy grip, she could not altogether withdraw from him, but
    her eyes, cold and calm sought his in the gloom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said quietly and firmly, &ldquo;since I know
    you by no other name, therefore still my lord to me, I would have you recall
    the day when sitting in my father&rsquo;s house, you whiled away an idle
    afternoon by telling a foolish maid the pretty allegory of water lilies growing
    on the weedy pond at Cluny, and of the slime which oozes from unclean things
    and pollutes the white petals of the flowers. &rsquo;Twas a pretty tale and
    no doubt it afforded you much amusement to see the look of puzzledom in the
    eyes of an ignorant tailor&rsquo;s wench. Well, my lord! the wench is no
    longer ignorant now&mdash;she understands the rude imagery, her eyes have
    seen such pollution, such miserable corruption as will forever leave them
    tainted with the villainy which they have seen. Whoever you are, sir, I know
    not&mdash;what other deeds of evil and disgrace you may have committed I
    care not&mdash;I only pray God that we may never meet again. You no doubt
    will find pleasures elsewhere, some other flower to pollute with your touch,
    some other heart to break. That you brought shame upon me, mayhap God will
    one day forgive you, I could perchance have forgiven you that had your sin
    rested there, but you tried to bring dishonour on my father&rsquo;s house.
    You did succeed in bringing sorrow and shame into it. My father and mother,
    who loved you almost as a son, will never again hold their heads high among
    their kind; a dishonoured daughter&mdash;for I am that now, for my true husband
    will cast me off as a woman unfit to be his mate&mdash;a dishonoured daughter
    is a lasting curse upon a house. That is your work, stranger, whoever you
    are; and this deed like unto the treachery which by a kiss brought the beloved
    Master to death upon the Cross, cries out to heaven for punishment; it is
    writ on the very front page in the book of the recording angel, and all the
    tears which you may shed, all the blood and all the atonement could not now
    wipe that front page clean. All this I do know, and yet one thing more: and
    that is that you do err when you speak of my love for you. To you who have
    lied, who with soft words and false pretences did enter my father&rsquo;s
    house and stole that which is most precious to us humble folk, our honour
    and the integrity of our name, to such as that, I gave no love. &rsquo;Tis
    true that I did love a man once&mdash;for one brief hour he lived in my heart
    but nowhere else. He was true and loyal, too proud to lie, too noble to steal.
    He has vanished like the mist, leaving no trace of his passage, for my heart
    wherein he dwelt is broken, and even his memory hath faded from my ken&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice died away like a long-drawn-out sigh, mingling with the murmur
    of the reeds and the moaning as of lost souls gliding through the branches
    of the acacias in their restless wandering through infinite space.</p>
  <p>The next moment she was gone, leaving in Michael&rsquo;s trembling hands
    a scrap of torn lace, a tiny shred of her gown.</p>
  <p>All that was left of her&mdash;and the savour of a bitter memory&mdash;rosemary
    for remembrance!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27</b></h2>
  <p>It was about an hour later that a hired coach brought three English gentlemen
    to the small inn at St. Denis.</p>
  <p>M. Blond was much perturbed. He was not accustomed to foreigners at any
    time and he held the English theoretically in abhorrence, and now here were
    four of these milors actually under his roof at one and the same time.</p>
  <p>The three who had last arrived in the coach from Paris carried matters off
    in a very high-handed fashion and seemed ready to throw money about in a
    manner which was highly satisfactory to the bedraggled and seedy married
    couple who&mdash;besides the landlord and his spouse&mdash;formed the sum
    total of the personnel at the Sign of &ldquo;Three Archangels&rdquo; in St.
    Denis.</p>
  <p>Sir John Ayloffe had assumed the leadership of the small party. He gave
    his own name to the landlord, and added that he and his two friends had come
    to pay their respects to my lord of Stowmaries, but lately arrived with his
    young bride.</p>
  <p>Now can you wonder at good M. Blond&rsquo;s perturbation? The incidents
    which had crowded in at the Sign of the &ldquo;Three Archangels&rdquo; in
    the past half hour were enough to furnish food for gossip for many a long
    evening to come. In point of fact M. and Mme. Blond had just started talking
    the whole sequence of events over from the beginning when the coach arrived
    with the three English milors, nor had the worthy couple had any chance of
    comparing impressions on these same mysterious events.</p>
  <p>Firstly there had been the extraordinary arrival of the bride and bridegroom,
    who of a truth had been expected, since relays for the next day&rsquo;s journey
    had been sent to the &ldquo;Three Archangels&rdquo; the day before, but they
    certainly had not been expected under such amazing circumstances, the English
    milor&rsquo;s horse covered with lather, and the bride in her wedding gown
    all crumpled and soiled, clinging to her newly-wedded husband in front of
    his saddle, and in a vastly uncomfortable position.</p>
  <p>This astonishing arrival of a bride and bridegroom who were reputed to be
    passing wealthy had of course vastly upset mine good host and his amiable
    wife. But then English milors were known to be eccentric, in fact most folk
    who had travelled in the fog-ridden country vowed that all the people there
    were more or less mad. &rsquo;Twas but lately that they had cut off the head
    of their king and set up a low-born soldier to rule them. No wonder that
    King Louis&mdash;whom <i>le bon Dieu</i> preserve!&mdash;was greatly angered
    with these English, and only forgave them when they returned to their senses
    and once more acknowledged the authority of him who was their king by right
    divine.</p>
  <p>Worthy Monsieur Blond had explained all these matters to his buxom wife
    in an off-hand yet comprehensive manner, the while the latter made haste
    to hurry on the preparations for supper, for the pretty bride and the English
    milor&mdash;deeply in love with one another though they were, as any one
    who looked could see&mdash;had shown a very sensible and laudable desire
    to have some of Mme. Blond&rsquo;s excellent cro&ucirc;te-au-pot to warm
    the cockles of their young hearts.</p>

  <p>The second incident on this eventful evening was of minor importance, and
    tended greatly to minimise the eccentricity of that romantic arrival. The
    coach which should have brought the bridal pair to the &ldquo;Three Archangels&rdquo; did
    come in due time&mdash;even whilst Mme. Blond was preparing her bit of fricandeau
    garnished with fresh winter cabbage, which was to be the second course at
    the bridal supper.</p>
  <p>The thoughtful mother of the love-sick bride had had the good sense to send
    her daughter&rsquo;s effects along, and all recollection of the curious arrival
    on horseback was forgotten before the prosy advent of boxes and bundles of
    clothes.</p>
  <p>Mme. Blond, moreover, became fully satisfied that everything was right as
    right could be, when she went upstairs to announce the arrival of the coach.
    The bride&rsquo;s pretty face was as pink as the eglantine in June, and her
    eyes brighter than the full moon outside, whilst milor&mdash;ah, well, Mme.
    Blond had seen many a man in love in her day, Blond himself had not been
    backward when he was courting her&mdash;but never, never, had she seen a
    man so gloating on the sight of his young wife, as that eccentric mad milor
    had done, the while the pretty dear was prosily asking for supper.</p>
  <p>All then had been for the best at nine of the clock that evening, but mark
    ye, what happened after that. Less than ten minutes later a rider&mdash;obviously
    half exhausted from a long and wearying journey&mdash;drew rein outside the &ldquo;Three
    Archangels.&rdquo; M. Blond who more than once had been in Paris, had no
    difficulty in recognising in the belated traveller Master Legros, tailor
    in chief to His Majesty the King, and the father of the pretty bride upstairs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Master Legros undoubtedly did not look like himself, though he did
    try to assume a jaunty air as he asked to be shown the room wherein his daughter
    and milor would presently be supping.</p>
  <p>It seemed a fairly simple incident at the time, this late arrival here of
    the bride&rsquo;s father, though Mme. Blond in thinking over the matter afterwards
    distinctly remembered that the fact did strike her as odd. What should good
    M. Legros be doing at St. Denis at this tardy hour, when most good citizens
    should be in bed, and when he had given his paternal blessing to the young
    couple fully four hours ago?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor&rsquo;s best suit of clothes had not been finished in time
    for the departure, and Maitre Legros brought it along himself,&rdquo; suggested
    M. Blond placidly.</p>
  <p>But he scratched his dark poll while he made this suggestion knowing it
    to be nonsense.</p>
  <p>Mme. Blond&rsquo;s premonitions proved to be correct. Half an hour elapsed,
    the while she and Blond took turns on the upstairs landing to try and hear
    something of what was going on inside that room, wherein awhile ago the turtle
    doves had been cooing so prettily. The cro&ucirc;te-au-pot had been ready
    ages ago but no one had asked for it. No sound penetrated through the heavy
    oaken doors; only once had Mme. Blond heard a voice raised in what seemed
    most terrible anger. She then fled incontinently back to her kitchen.</p>
  <p>A quarter of an hour later M. Legros gave orders that the coach which had
    brought his daughter&rsquo;s effects an hour previously, be got ready at
    once, and that those horses be put to it that had been sent down the day
    before with a view to the continuance of the journey to Havre. He gave no
    explanation, of course, nor answered any of the discreet questions put to
    him by Mme. Blond. He tried to swallow some hot soup, but gave up the attempt
    after the third spoonful; he looked as white as a sheet, and trembled like
    a poplar leaf in the breeze. Presently the young bride came down the stairs.
    She still wore her wedding gown under her thick dark cloak. Mme. Blond noticed
    how crumpled it looked and that a great piece of the beautiful lace was torn
    off.</p>
  <p>But she wore her hood closely wrapped round her head, so neither Monsieur
    nor Madame could see anything of her face; nor did she speak any words, save
    a short &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; to Mme. Blond, and this she said in a curious,
    husky voice as if her throat were choked.</p>
  <p>Maitre Legros paid lavishly for everything. The bride&rsquo;s boxes and
    bundles were once more stowed away in the boot of the coach; then she and
    her father stepped into the vehicle, the postillion cracked his whip, there
    was a scraping of iron hoofs on the rough paving stones, a clanking of chains,
    a shout or two and the lumbering coach turned out toward the highroad and
    was quickly lost to sight in the gloom.</p>
  <p>After that nothing!</p>
  <p>Not a sound came from the room where the English milor had remained alone.
    Mme. Blond at her wits&rsquo; ends what to do or how to interpret the remarkable
    series of incidents which had occurred beneath her roof, had thought of knocking
    at milor&rsquo;s door and asking him if he would have some supper.</p>
  <p>Her mind&mdash;which as her good man was wont to say&mdash;was ever inclined
    to romance, had seen horrible visions of a bleeding corpse lying prone upon
    the parlour floor. Suicide must have followed this forcible abduction by
    an infuriated father, of the ardently worshipped bride.</p>

  <p>Great was her astonishment, perhaps also her disappointment, when in answer
    to a peremptory &ldquo;Come in&rdquo; she went into the room and saw milor
    standing there by the open window looking out upon the moonlit landscape
    for all the world as if nothing had happened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There he was,&rdquo; she explained somewhat irately to her man, for
    she felt almost as if she had been cheated out of the most thrilling chapter
    of her romance, &ldquo;dressed in his beautiful bridal clothes, with arms
    folded across his chest, and not a hair on his head the least bit ruffled.
    Ah! these English! they have no heart. I thought to find him either with
    a sword thrust through his heart, else a man mad and raving with grief. Holy
    Virgin! Had my father taken me away from thee, my Blond, on the very night
    of our wedding day, wouldst thou not have been crazy with rage, even if thou
    hadst not actually committed suicide? There&rsquo;s heart for thee! There&rsquo;s
    love! But not in these English! And wilt believe me that when I said something
    to milor about supper, he did not even curse me, but said quite quietly that
    he had no hunger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well now! does not all that give furiously to think?</p>
  <p>Milor had no hunger, the bride had gone and the supper was ready. What could
    Mme. Blond do better than to dish up the cro&ucirc;te-au-pot and the fricandeau
    with the winter cabbage and to serve it to her man?</p>
  <p>Monsieur Blond took off his heavy boots and donned a pair of cloth slippers,
    he covered his dark hair with a warmly-fitting cap and drew the most comfortable
    chair to the table, preparatory to enjoying a supper fit for an English milor.</p>
  <p>But he was not destined to enjoy more than a preliminary sniff at the succulent
    cro&ucirc;te-au-pot. Mme. Blond had been very talkative and the dishing-up
    process consequently slow, and at the very moment when good M. Blond was
    conveying the first spoonful of soup to his mouth there was a loud noise
    of wheels grating against the slipper, the cracking of a whip and a good
    deal of shouting; all of which were unmistakable signs that more mysterious
    travellers had chosen this eventful night for their arrival at the &ldquo;Three
    Archangels.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28</b></h2>
  <p>Michael Kestyon had paid no heed to the noise of this last arrival. Indeed
    he had heard nothing since that one awful noise, the departure of the coach
    which bore her away from him. How long ago that was he could not say. It
    might have been a moment or a cycle of years. Just before it he had had his
    last glimpse of her. She crossed the room in company with her father, who
    had come up to fetch her. She was wrapped from head to foot in cloak and
    hood; all that he could see of her was her torn wedding gown.</p>
  <p>He made no movement as she walked past him, and though his whole soul called
    out her name, his lips uttered no sound. What were the use? If she did not
    hear the silent call of love, no words could move her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even his memory hath faded from my ken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael vaguely remembering the sacred tale told him in his childhood by
    his mother of how God had hurled His sinful angels from Heaven down to Hell,
    could not recall that in His anger He had used words that were quite so cruel.</p>
  <p>Well, that page in life had been written, the book was closed. One brief
    glimpse at possible happiness, one tiny chink open in the gates of paradise,
    and then once more the weary tramp along the road which leads to misery on
    this earth, to perdition hereafter.</p>
  <p>The gambler had staked his all upon one venture and had lost. But Michael
    Kestyon was not made of the mould which rots in a suicide&rsquo;s grave or
    harbours a brain which goes crazy with grief.</p>
  <p>A weaker man would have felt regrets, a better man would have been racked
    with remorse. Michael with her words ringing in his ears thought only of
    redemption.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father and mother, who loved you as their son, will never again
    hold their heads high among their kind&mdash;for a dishonoured daughter is
    a lasting curse upon a house. That is your work, stranger&mdash;it is writ
    on the front page in the book of the recording angel, and all the tears which
    you may shed, all the blood and all the atonement could not now wipe that
    front page clean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The gambler in losing all had, it seems, involved others in his ruin; innocent
    people who had loved and trusted him. The debt which he had thus contracted
    would have to be paid to them, not in the coin which Michael had tendered&mdash;since
    it had been dross in their sight&mdash;but in coin which would compensate
    them for all that they had lost.</p>
  <p>And it was because of the future redemption of that great debt, because
    of all that there was yet to do, that Michael held such a tight rein over
    his reason, the while it almost tottered beneath the crushing blow. Nor did
    he allow the thought of suicide to dwell in his mind. Yet madness and death&mdash;the
    twin phantoms born of cowardice&mdash;lurked within the dark shadows of the
    low-raftered room, after Rose Marie&rsquo;s last passage along the uneven
    floor when her torn wedding gown swept over the boards with a sighing and
    swishing sound, which would reverberate in Michael&rsquo;s heart throughout
    eternity.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;From beneath the lintel of that oaken door which had clanged to behind
    her, the spectre of madness grinned into the deserted room, and beckoned
    to the man who stood there in utter loneliness; and on the window-sill whereat
    she had sat awhile ago the gaunt shadow of suicide whispered the alluring
    words: Rest! Forgetfulness! Rest! Forgetfulness!</p>
  <p>Michael did not flee from the twin demons. He called them to his side and
    looked fully and squarely at their hideous, alluring forms.</p>
  <p>Madness and Death! Destruction of the mind or of the body. Both would blot
    her image from his soul. Madness enticed by drink would mean the bestial
    forgetfulness of heavy sleep and addled intellect. Death would mean infinite
    peace.</p>
  <p>The struggle &rsquo;twixt devils and the man was fierce and short. Anon
    the crouching spectres vanished into the night; and the man stood there in
    splendid isolation with the memory of a great crime and of a brief joy for
    sole companion of his loneliness. But the man was a man for all that; body
    and mind were still the slaves of his will, not for the carving of his own
    fortune now, not for the spinning of the web of Fate, but bound and fettered
    under the heel of an iron determination to wipe out the writing on that front
    page in the book of the recording angel; not by tears, not by blood and cringing
    atonement, but by deeds and acts dark if necessary, heroic always, by vanquishing
    the wrongs of the past with the triumphant redemption to come.</p>
  <p>In this mood the good landlady of the &ldquo;Three Archangels&rdquo; found
    him and marvelled at British indifference in the face of a love tragedy.
    And he was still in this selfsame mood half an hour or so later when my lord
    of Stowmaries and his friends came upon the solitary watcher in the night.</p>
  <p>Michael had not eaten, nor had he relinquished his place by the open window,
    for it seemed to his over-sensitive mind as if the sound of those wheels
    which bore his snowdrop further and further away from him echoed against
    the distant bank of storm-portending clouds, and though the heartrending
    sound reverberated within him like unto the grinding of the rack which tears
    the limbs and martyrizes the body, yet it still seemed something of her,
    the last memory, the final farewell.</p>
  <p>It was past ten o&rsquo;clock now, and of a surety Michael thought that
    he must have fallen asleep, dreaming by that open window, when the sudden
    noise of several familiar voices, a loud if somewhat forced laugh, and the
    peremptory throwing open of the door brought the dreamer back to the exigencies
    of the moment.</p>
  <p>The aspect of the room was almost weird, dark and gloomy with only the slanting
    moonbeams to touch with pale and capricious light the tall, solitary figure
    in the window embrasure.</p>
  <p>For a moment the three men paused beneath the lintel, their volatile imagination
    strangely gripped by the picture before them, that dark silhouette against
    the moonlit landscape beyond, the total air of desolation and loneliness
    which seemed to hang like a pall even in the gloom.</p>
  <p>Sir John Ayloffe was the first to shake himself free from this unwonted
    feeling of superstitious awe:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friend Michael, by the Mass!&rdquo; he shouted with somewhat forced
    jocoseness. &ldquo;Still astir, and like the love-sick poet contemplating
    the moon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The loud words broke the spell of subtle and weird magic which seemed to
    pervade the place. Michael Kestyon gave a start and turned abruptly away
    from the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we welcome, Michael?&rdquo; added Lord Rochester pleasantly. &ldquo;Or
    do we intrude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael whose surprise at seeing the three men had been quite momentary,
    now came forward with outstretched hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; he said cordially, &ldquo;and ye are right
    welcome. I had thoughts of going to bed and yet was longing for merry company,
    little guessing that it would thus unexpectedly fall from heaven. And may
    I ask what procures St. Denis the honour of this tardy visit from so distinguished
    a company?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The desire to see you, Cousin,&rdquo; here interposed Lord Stowmaries, &ldquo;and
    if you&rsquo;ll allow us, to sup with you, for we were not invited to your
    wedding feast, remember, and have not enjoyed the worthy tailor&rsquo;s good
    cheer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have not tasted food since the middle of the day,&rdquo; added
    Ayloffe, &ldquo;and that was none of the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But mayhap Michael hath supped,&rdquo; suggested Lord Rochester,
    who contrary to his usual freedom of manner and speech seemed unaccountably
    reticent for the nonce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay! And if I had I could sup again in such elegant company,&rdquo;  rejoined
    Michael. &ldquo;But I was dreaming indeed since I was forgetting that we
    were still in the dark. Our amiable host must bring us light as well as food.
    It will give me much pleasure to see your amiable faces more clearly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as he spoke he went to the door, and soon his calls to Mme. Blond for
    lights and supper echoed pleasantly through the house.</p>
  <p>The three others were left staring at one another in blank surprise. They
    had not thought of putting questions to mine host on their arrival, but had
    merely and somewhat peremptorily ordered M. Blond to show them up to the
    room occupied by their friend, the English milor. They, therefore, knew nothing
    of what had happened, but all three of them vaguely felt&mdash;by a curious,
    unexplainable instinct&mdash;that something was amiss, and knew that Michael&rsquo;s
    attitude of serene indifference was only an assumed r&ocirc;le.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strike me dead but there&rsquo;s something almost uncanny about the
    man,&rdquo; said Lord Rochester, forcing a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something has happened of course,&rdquo; rejoined Ayloffe, &ldquo;but
    nothing to concern us. Mayhap an early quarrel with the bride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis strange, forsooth, to find the bridegroom alone at this
    hour,&rdquo; added Stowmaries, whilst the refrain of a ribald song rose somewhat
    affectedly to his lips.</p>
  <p>But Rochester quickly checked him, for Michael&rsquo;s footstep was heard
    on the landing. The latter now entered, closely followed by M. Blond who
    carried a couple of candelabra of heavy metal and fitted with tallow candles.</p>
  <p>These he soon lighted and the flickering yellow flames quickly dispersed
    the gloom which lingered in the corners of the room. They threw into full
    relief the faces of the four men, three of whom retained an expression of
    great bewilderment, whilst the fourth looked serene and placid, as if the
    entertaining of his friends was for nonce the most momentous thing in his
    existence.</p>
  <p>Michael went to the window and with a quick, impatient gesture he pulled
    the curtains together, shutting out the moonlit landscape and the silhouette
    of the trees, whose soft sighs had been the accompaniment to the murmur of
    her voice; mayhap he had a thought of shutting out at the same time the very
    remembrance of the past.</p>
  <p>Then he turned once more to the others and his face now was a perfect mirror
    of jovial good-humour as he said gaily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope, gentlemen, that you are anhungered. As for me I could devour
    a wilderness of frogs, so be it that it is the only food of which this remarkable
    country can boast. I pray you sit. Supper will not be long&mdash;and in the
    meanwhile tell me, pray, the latest gossip in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The company settled itself around the table. Every one was glad enough to
    be rid of the uncanny sensation of awhile ago. M. Blond in the meanwhile
    had bustled out of the room but he soon reappeared bearing platters and spoons,
    and, what was more to the purpose, pewter mugs and huge tankards of good
    red wine. Close behind him came his portly spouse holding aloft with massive,
    outstretched arms, the monumental tureen whence escaped the savoury fumes
    of her famous cro&ucirc;te-au-pot.</p>
  <p>Loud cheers greeted the arrival of the worthy pair. Mme. Blond quickly fell
    to, distributing the soup with no niggardly hand, the while her man made
    the round, filling the mugs with excellent wine.</p>
  <p>Gossip became general. Rochester as usual was full of anecdotes, bits of
    scandal and gossip, retailed with a free tongue and an inexhaustible fund
    of somewhat boisterous humour. The soup was beyond reproach and the wine
    more than drinkable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s &rsquo;ounds,&rdquo; he cried presently when Blond and
    his wife had retired, leaving the English company to itself, &ldquo;this
    is a feast fit for the gods! Michael Kestyon, our amiable host, I raise my
    glass to thee! Gentlemen, our host!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He raised his glass, Stowmaries following suit; but Ayloffe checked them
    both with a peremptory lifting of his hand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my lord Rochester you do forget&mdash;and
    you, too, gentlemen! Fie on you, fie, I say! Not a drop shall pass your lips
    until you have pledged me as you should. &rsquo;Tis I will give you the first
    toast of the evening. Gentlemen, the bride!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was loud clapping of mugs against the table, then lusty shouts of &ldquo;The
    bride! the bride!&rdquo; The three men raised their bumpers and drained them
    to the last drop, honouring the toast to the full. Sir John looked keenly
    at Michael, but even his sharp, observant eyes could not detect the slightest
    change in the calm and serene face. Michael, too, had raised his mug, but
    Ayloffe noted that he did not touch the wine with his lips.</p>
  <p>Shrewd Sir John ever alive to his own interests fell to speculating as to
    what had gone amiss, and whether any event had been likely to occur which
    would affect his own prospects in any way. Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s twelve
    thousand pounds had not yet&mdash;remember,&mdash;been transferred to Cousin
    John&rsquo;s pocket, and no one was more profoundly aware of the truth of
    the old dictum that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s many a slip&mdash;&rdquo; than was
    Sir John Ayloffe himself. But there was naught to read on Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s
    placid face, only the vague suspicion of carefully concealed weariness; and
    in Ayloffe&rsquo;s practical mind there was something distinctly unnatural
    in the serene calm of a man who was richer to-day by one hundred and twenty
    thousand pounds, not even to mention an excessively pretty and well-dowered
    bride.</p>
  <p>Sir John, relying on his own powers of observation, had every intention
    of probing this matter to the bottom, but in the meanwhile he thought it
    best not to let the others see, too clearly, what he himself had only vaguely
    guessed, therefore it was he again who shouted more lustily even than before:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Now the bridegroom, gentlemen! I give you the bridegroom! Long
    live! Long live I say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was on his feet waving his mug with every lusty shout. Then he drained
    it once more to the last drop, Stowmaries and Rochester doing likewise, for
    time-honoured custom demanded that such toasts must be responded to right
    heartily. Michael however made no acknowledgment as he should have done.
    He sat quite still with slender, nervy fingers idly toying with the crumbs
    on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Respond, Michael, respond,&rdquo; cried Lord Rochester who seemed
    to have quite shaken off his former diffidence. &ldquo;Man, are you in the
    clouds?&mdash;Of a surety,&rdquo; he continued with a knowing wink directed
    at his friends, &ldquo;&rsquo;twere no marvel on this eventful night, and
    with a pretty bride awaiting her lord not thirty paces away on the other
    side of that door. We saw her in church, Michael, and by Gad, man, you are
    a lucky dog! But we did drink to the bridegroom and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I, too, drink to him,&rdquo; interposed Michael loudly, as he
    rose to his feet, bumper in hand and turned directly to his Cousin Stowmaries, &ldquo;to
    you, my lord and cousin do I drink&mdash;the only bridegroom worthy of such
    a bride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To say the least of it, this speech was vastly astonishing. No one quite
    knew how to take it, and as Michael drained his cup Stowmaries broke into
    a forced laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do flatter me, Coz,&rdquo; he said, feeling strangely uncomfortable
    under the other&rsquo;s steady gaze, and realising that some sort of reply
    was expected of him, &ldquo;but of a truth the flattery is misplaced. The
    bride is yours and you have won her by fair means; and I, in my turn, will
    add something to my lord Rochester&rsquo;s toast&mdash;something which, an
    I mistake not, will be vastly acceptable to you&mdash;a draft for seventy
    thousand pounds on my banker, Master Vivish of Fleet Street. The final payment
    of my debt to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Stowmaries took a paper from the pocket of his surcoat and handed it
    to Michael, who made no movement to take it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I accepted the bargain which
    you offered me, I was more deeply in my cups than I myself had any idea of.
    Let us admit that &rsquo;twas an ignoble bargain, shameful alike to me and
    to you. Now I would pray you to return that draft to your pocket; &rsquo;tis
    but little I have spent of that first fifty thousand pounds, the balance
    of what remains you shall have on my return to London, as for the rest&mdash;that
    which I have so foolishly spent&mdash;I pray you to grant me a few months
    delay and I will repay you to the full. Thus we two who made the bargain,
    and these two gentlemen who witnessed it, will cease to have aught but a
    dim recollection of the shameful doings of a mad and roisterous night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence greeted this strange speech. The beginning of it had at once awakened
    surprise, the end left the three men there present in a state of complete
    puzzlement. Stowmaries frankly gazed at Michael with wide-open eyes wherein
    good-humoured contempt fought with utter amazement.</p>
  <p>Then as no one spoke, Michael added quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I await your answer, Cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush, man, you are joking,&rdquo; retorted Stowmaries with a shrug
    of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never was more serious in my life,&rdquo; rejoined the other with
    deep earnestness, &ldquo;and &rsquo;tis a serious answer that I ask of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I know not to what your lengthy speech did tend, how can I give
    it answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I asked you to put that draft for money yet unpaid into your
    pocket; I propose to repay you in full every penny of that which this folly
    hath already cost you, and you on the other hand can fulfil your obligations
    to the lady who, of a truth, is still legally your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, man, hold on!&rdquo; cried Stowmaries almost in dismay,
    for it seemed to him that his cousin was bereft of his senses. &ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s
    fish! But you talk like a madman&mdash;and a dangerous one, too, for you
    use words which, were I not your guest, I could not help but resent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is naught to resent, Cousin, in what I say, nor is it the act
    or speech of a madman to ask you to rescind a bargain which tended neither
    to your honour nor to mine own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, by the Mass, Cousin, the bargain good or bad, righteous or shameful,
    is no longer in the making. Even were I so minded&mdash;which by our Lady
    I vow that I am not&mdash;I could not now release you of your pledged word
    to me. What is done, is done, and you have fulfilled your share of the bargain.
    Now &rsquo;tis my turn as an honourable gentlemen to acquit myself of my
    debt to you. So I pray you take the money&mdash;it is justly yours&mdash;but
    do not prate any further nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay! ay! friend Kestyon,&rdquo; added Ayloffe with his habitual bonhomme,
    through which nevertheless the cloven hoof of sarcasm was quite perceptible, &ldquo;do
    not allow your over-sensitive conscience to persuade you into refusing what
    is justly your due.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s fish, man, you have won the bride and thereby rendered
    Stowmaries an incomparable service,&rdquo; quoth Lord Rochester decisively, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was about to say more but Michael interrupted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;grant me patience for
    awhile; I fear me that my gentle cousin did not altogether grasp my meaning.
    Cousin,&rdquo; he added, turning once more fully to Stowmaries, &ldquo;will
    you put your money back into your pocket and instead of fulfilling your engagements
    to me, fulfil them toward the lady who hath first claims on your loyalty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush, man!&rdquo; retorted Stowmaries, who was waxing wrathful, &ldquo;cannot
    you cease that senseless talk? The thing is done, man, the thing is done.
    Gad! We none of us want it undone, nor could we an we would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord of Stowmaries is right,&rdquo; concluded Lord Rochester decisively, &ldquo;and
    you, Kestyon, do but run your head against a stone wall. An you feel remorse,
    I for one am sorry for you&mdash;but what has been, has been. You no more
    can withdraw from your present position than you could erase from the Book
    of Life all that has passed to-day. So take your money, man, you have the
    right to it. Odd&rsquo;s fish! A hundred and twenty thousand pounds, and
    you talk of flinging it as a sop to your perturbed conscience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who talked of conscience, my lord?&rdquo; rejoined Michael haughtily, &ldquo;or
    yet of remorse? Surely not I. We have all been gambling on an issue, and
    I now offer my cousin of Stowmaries his own stakes back again an he&rsquo;ll
    pay his just debt to his wife rather than to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My wife, man, are you joking!&rdquo; retorted Stowmaries hotly. &ldquo;After
    what has occurred, think you I would take for my countess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The purest, most exquisite woman, Cousin, that ever graced a man&rsquo;s
    ancestral home,&rdquo; interposed Michael earnestly. &ldquo;To say less of
    her were blasphemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; ejaculated Stowmaries with ill-concealed contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cousin, I swear to you,&rdquo; reiterated Michael with solemn emphasis,  &ldquo;by
    all that men hold most sacred, by all that I hold most holy, that the lady
    is as pure to-day as when her baby hand was placed in yours eighteen years
    ago, in token that she was to be your wife. She is as worthy to be the wife
    of a good man, the mother of loyal children, as I am unfit to tie the laces
    of her shoe. An you&rsquo;ll do your duty by her, you&rsquo;ll never regret
    it&mdash;all that you will regret will be the memory of that turbulent night
    when in your madness you thought of wronging her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God, man, I swear that you are crazy!&rdquo; cried Stowmaries
    whose impatience had been visibly growing and who now gave full rein to his
    exasperation. &ldquo;Are you a damned, canting Puritan that you talk to me
    like that? Nay, an you wish to be rid of yon baggage, send her back to the
    tailor&rsquo;s back shop whence she came,&mdash;throw her out into the streets,&mdash;I
    care not what you do with her, but in G&mdash;d&rsquo;s name I tell you that
    you shall not palm off on to my mother&rsquo;s son a cast-off troll whom
    you no longer want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even before the words had fully escaped the young man&rsquo;s lips Michael
    had lifted his glass and thrown its full contents in the face of the blasphemer.</p>
  <p>Sickened and blinded with his own fury and the pungent odour of the wine
    which poured down his face into his eyes and mouth, Stowmaries uttered a
    violent oath and the next instant had sprung upon his kinsman like an infuriated
    and raging beast, and had him by the throat even before Ayloffe and Rochester
    who had quickly jumped to their feet were able to interfere.</p>
  <p>The onslaught was vigorous and sudden and Stowmaries&rsquo; fury hot and
    uncontrolled. But Michael who throughout the wordy warfare had kept his own
    temper in check, who had foreseen the attack even when he threw the wine
    in the younger man&rsquo;s face, had already grasped Stowmaries&rsquo; wrists
    with a steel-like pressure of his own nervy hands, causing the other to relax
    his grip and forcing an involuntary cry of pain to escape his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Cousin,&rdquo; he said, still speaking quite quietly, but with
    a slight tone of contempt now, &ldquo;in a hand-to-hand struggle you would
    fare worse than I. Have I hurt your wrist? Then am I deeply grieved&mdash;but &rsquo;tis
    not broken I assure you&mdash;and you know, dear Coz, that since you are
    still my debtor, you could not in honour kill me until you had acquitted
    yourself of your debt to me. I have offered you a fair way of paying that
    debt, not to me but to her to whom you really owe it. An you&rsquo;ll keep
    your money now, and take back all you&rsquo;ve given me, an you&rsquo;ll
    fulfil your sacred promise to take Rose Marie for wife, you&rsquo;ll be the
    happiest man on God&rsquo;s earth. This I swear to you, and also that I&rsquo;ll
    serve you humbly and devotedly as servant or as slave to the last day of
    my life and with the last drop of blood in my veins. After that an you wish
    to kill me&mdash;why, my life is at your service. Will you do it, Cousin?
    God and his army of saints and of angels will give you rich reward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Stowmaries who with a sulky look on his face was readjusting the lace
    ruffles at his wrist whilst glowering at the man whose physical strength
    he had just been made to feel, turned on him now with an evil sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be intimately acquainted with the heavenly hierarchy,
    Cousin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, believe me, I have no intention of entering
    those celestial spheres which are of your own imagining and of which you
    seem to be the self-constituted guardian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sneer at me as much as you will, Cousin, but give me answer,&rdquo;  urged
    Michael and for the first time his voice shook as he uttered this final,
    desperate appeal, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere best for you&mdash;this I entreat you
    to believe. Best for you and right for her. As for me, I no longer exist;
    the ignoble bargain has never been; wipe it out, Cousin, even from your memory.
    Take back your money and with it your honour. She is worthy of your love,
    of your faith and of your trust; take her to your heart, Cousin, take her
    for she is as pure as the Madonna and you will be richer by all that she
    can give, the priceless guerdon of her exquisite womanhood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other two men were silent. They had taken no part in the discussion
    and had listened to it each with vastly divers emotions. Rochester, a noble
    gentleman despite his many extravagances, could not help but admire the man
    who thus stood up boldly to right a wrong, fearless of consequences, fearless
    of ridicule. But Ayloffe merely hoped that Michael&rsquo;s rugged eloquence,
    his earnest, passionate appeal would fail to reach the armour of selfishness
    and vanity which effectually enveloped Stowmaries&rsquo; better nature.</p>
  <p>Now after this last appeal there was a pause. The storm of turbulent passions
    was lulled to momentary rest, the better to gather strength for the final
    conflict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take her to your heart, Cousin,&rdquo; Michael had urged, and no
    one there could guess the infinity of renunciation which lay in this appeal.
    Stowmaries was silent for awhile. His glowering eyes expressed nothing but
    unyielding obstinacy. Otherwise he was totally unmoved.</p>
  <p>Then, keeping his gaze rivetted on Michael, he pointed with outstretched
    finger to the paper which lay on the table&mdash;the draft for seventy thousand
    pounds on Master Vivish of Fleet Street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is my answer, Cousin,&rdquo; he said loudly and firmly. &ldquo;You
    have rendered me a service; for this now I pay you to the full as agreed.
    Let there be no more of this crazy talk, for what is done is done, and you
    above all should be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more there was silence in the low-raftered room. A gust of wind blew
    the thin curtains way from the open window and caused the scrap of paper
    to stir with a soft sound as of a spirit voice that murmured a warning &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael had neither moved nor spoken, not a line of his face betrayed the
    conflict in his soul. But three pairs of eyes were fixed upon him. He did
    not seem to see them, for his own were fixed on the fluttering curtain which
    had whispered spectral words to him; between the gently swaying folds there
    peeped cold gleams of moonbeam radiance, and from far away the sighing of
    the young acacia boughs which had mingled with her voice awhile ago.</p>
  <p>Then he turned his gaze back to the paper which lay before him, still gently
    stirring under the soft breath of the evening air. Deliberately and with
    a firm hand he took it up, folded it across and across and slipped it in
    the inner pocket of his coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know best, Cousin,&rdquo; he said in a quiet, unmodulated voice. &ldquo;As
    you say, I have rendered you a service. You have paid me in full according
    to our bond. We should both be satisfied. And now, gentlemen, shall we proceed
    with supper?&rdquo;</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="Part4"></a>Part 4</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29</b></h2>
  <p>Mistress Julia Peyton felt a trifle worried. Matters had not turned out
    exactly as she had anticipated; it is a way peculiar to matters over which
    we have no control.</p>
  <p>She had been quite aware of the fact that my lord of Stowmaries, with Sir
    John Ayloffe and Lord Rochester, had made the journey over to Paris in order
    to be present at the marriage of Michael Kestyon with the tailor&rsquo;s
    daughter, and it had been with the intention of frustrating my lord&rsquo;s
    desire to pay his final debt of seventy thousand pounds to Michael that she
    had sent old Daniel Pye over in the gentlemen&rsquo;s company, armed with
    the letters writ in scholarly French by the exiled Huguenot clerk and intended
    for good M. Legros&rsquo;  personal perusal.</p>
  <p>Mistress Peyton had no special wish to save the susceptibilities of a tailor&rsquo;s
    wench, and cared little whether the fraud was discovered by her before she
    had left her father&rsquo;s home or afterwards, but&mdash;she had argued
    this out in her own mind over and over again&mdash;if the girl never actually
    left her father&rsquo;s house, my lord would not in honour be bound to pay
    Michael the additional seventy thousand pounds, since the latter would not
    have accomplished his own share of the bargain to the full. On the other
    hand there would be quite enough public scandal and gossip round the girl,
    as it was, to enable my lord of Stowmaries to justify his repudiation of
    the matrimonial bonds, contracted eighteen years ago, on the grounds that
    the future Countess of Stowmaries no longer bore a spotless reputation.</p>
  <p>That had been Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s subtle argument, and on the basis
    of this unanswerable logic she had laid her plans. Caring nothing for the
    girl, she cared everything for the money, and above all for the power that
    so vast a sum would place in Michael&rsquo;s hand for the furtherance of
    his own case.</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye had returned to England about a week after the wedding at St.
    Gervais. He was an unblushing liar, both by habit and by temperament. Therefore,
    when he presented himself before his mistress, he assured her that he had
    handed her letter over to the master tailor even while the wedding festivities
    were in progress in the back shop, and long before the coach bore the bridal
    pair away.</p>
  <p>When Mistress Peyton heard the circumstantial narrative of how her faithful
    henchman had fought his way into the tailor&rsquo;s house at peril of his
    life, and had given the letter into M. Legros&rsquo; own hands, the while
    his own poor shoulders were bruised and well-nigh broken with the blows dealt
    to him by cruel miscreants who strove to hinder him from performing his duty&mdash;when
    the fair Julia heard all this, I say, she was vastly pleased and commended
    Master Pye very highly for his faithfulness, and I believe even rewarded
    him by giving him five shillings.</p>
  <p>The wedding it seems had been the talk of Paris, ladies and gentlemen from
    the Court had been present thereat, and Mme. de Montespan had loudly praised
    the handsome presence of the bridegroom. All this was passing satisfactory,
    and Mistress Julia was quite content to think that the tailor and his family
    would&mdash;after such an esclandre&mdash;be only too willing to hide their
    humble heads out of the ken of society wherein they had become a laughing
    stock.</p>
  <p>On legal grounds my lord of Stowmaries could readily command the nullity
    of the child-marriage now; as for the religious grounds which had been the
    chief stumbling-block hitherto&mdash;&rdquo;Bah!&rdquo; argued the fair Julia
    na&iuml;vely to herself, &ldquo;His Holiness the Pope of Rome is a gentleman;
    he will not expect an English grand seigneur to acknowledge as his countess
    the cast-off plaything of an adventurer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The disappointment came some three or four days later when Cousin John in
    his turn presented himself at the little house in Holborn Row. Of course
    he had known nothing of his fair cousin&rsquo;s treacherous little scheme,
    and although he had greatly wondered at Master Pye&rsquo;s presence in Paris
    at the time of the wedding, yet he had been far from suspecting the truth
    with regard to its purport. All that good Sir John knew was that the bridal
    pair did leave the house of M. Legros in a somewhat unconventional style,
    for this he had been told by the gaffers of the neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>He had not seen the departure, but had heard glowing accounts of it all
    from one or two of the spectators whom he had closely questioned.</p>
  <p>There was no doubt that it had been a fine departure: romantic and epoch-making.
    No fear now of the scandal being in any way hushed up. &ldquo;Milor the Englishman,&rdquo; as
    that rascal Michael had been universally called in that quarter of Paris
    wherein his prowess had been witnessed, was a magnificent horseman, so the
    gossips declared with one accord. The way he had jumped on his horse, using
    neither stirrup nor bridle, was a sight good for sore eyes, then two of his
    English serving-men had raised the bride to his saddle bow, and after a lusty
    shout of farewell milor had ridden away with her, and soon his horse was
    heard galloping at maddening speed. Never had such a spectacle been witnessed
    in the streets of Paris before; the gaffers were still agape at the remembrance
    of it, and it had all seemed more like a vivid and exciting dream than like
    sober reality.</p>
  <p>But no sooner had milor and the bride disappeared round the bend of the
    narrow street than the first breath of gossip rose&mdash;apparently from
    nothingness&mdash;in their wake. Whence it originated nobody knew, but sure
    it is that within an hour the whole of the quarter was agog with the scandal.
    Cousin John prided himself on the fact that he had contributed more than
    his share in spreading the report from one end of Paris to the other that
    the daughter of the mightily rich and highly-respectable tailor-in-chief
    of His Majesty the King of France had eloped with an adventurer, who was
    even kinsman to her own husband, my lord of Stowmaries and Rivaulx.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The scandal is quite immense, fair Cousin,&rdquo; quoth Cousin John
    lustily, and with a merry guffaw the while he sat sipping sack-posset in
    Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s elegantly furnished boudoir. &ldquo;Personally I
    see naught for the tailor&rsquo;s wench but the inevitable nunnery, although
    Michael&mdash;but of this more anon. In the meanwhile Mme. de Montespan dotes
    on the adventure. Lord Rochester retailed it all to her outside the church
    porch, and you may well believe that it hath lost naught in the telling.
    She quite fell in love with Michael&rsquo;s handsome presence, and His Majesty
    the King of France vows that English gentlemen are the primest rogues on
    this earth; and even sober diplomatists aver that Michael&rsquo;s prowess
    and Michael&rsquo;s romantic personality have done more to cement international
    friendship than a whole host of secret treaties. From the Court the scandal
    hath reached the lower classes of Paris, all thanks to your humble servant,
    so I flatter myself; the tailor and his family are the butt of every quip-maker
    in the city. There is a rhyme that goes the round which&mdash;nay, your pardon,
    fair Cousin, I could not repeat it for fear of offending your ears, but let
    me assure you that the heroine thereof is not like to petition Monseigneur
    the Archbishop of Paris or His Holiness the Pope to assert her rights to
    be Countess of Stowmaries&mdash;Countess of Stowmaries,&rdquo; added Sir
    John with another prolonged guffaw, &ldquo;Countess of Stowmaries! Odd&rsquo;s
    fish! In Paris they sing of her: &lsquo;<i>Une vertu inguli&egrave;re</i>&mdash;&rsquo; your
    pardon&mdash;your pardon again, dear Coz, I was forgetting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Cousin John had indeed to stop in his narration, for he was choking
    for very laughter and the tears were streaming down his ruddy cheeks.</p>
  <p>Mistress Peyton had listened to the cheerful tale with but ill-repressed
    impatience, and had not Sir John been so absorbed in what was his favourite
    topic of conversation&mdash;the tearing to shreds of a woman&rsquo;s reputation&mdash;he
    would not have failed to notice that his kinswoman was far from sharing his
    own hilarity.</p>
  <p>Of a truth, the fair Julia&rsquo;s impatience soon gave place to great anger,
    for it was by now quite clear to her that Daniel Pye had failed in his trust,
    that he had not only lied like a consummate rogue, but had actually by his
    unforgivable delinquency caused his mistress&rsquo; most cherished and carefully-conceived
    counter-intrigue to come absolutely to naught.</p>
  <p>Michael Kestyon had carried off the bride and Lord Stowmaries could not
    now as a man of honour refuse to pay him that final seventy thousand pounds;
    a fortune, forsooth, wherewith the adventurer, the wastrel, the haunter of
    brothels and booths could now make good his claim to the title and peerage
    of Stowmaries and Rivaulx.</p>
  <p>Given a dissolute, money-grabbing king on whose decision the claim for the
    peerage rested, given this adventure which rendered Michael interesting to
    those who had the ear of Charles Stuart, and what more likely than that the
    present lord of Stowmaries should find himself in the terrible position of
    having paid for his own undoing?</p>
  <p>And all because a fool of a serving-man had failed in doing what he had
    been ordered to do, and this in despite of the most carefully thought-out
    plans, most ardent wishes and most subtle schemes. We may take it that visions
    of a terrible retribution to be wreaked on that rascally Daniel Pye already
    found birth in his mistress&rsquo; inventive brain; and whilst good Cousin
    John was wiping the tears of laughter which his own narrative had called
    to his bulgy eyes, his fair cousin was meditating on the best pretext she
    could employ for ordering Pye to be lawfully and publicly flogged.</p>
  <p>At last Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s sullen silence brought Cousin John back
    from the pleasing realms of gossip and scandal. Looking into her face he
    saw anger, where he had expected to witness a smile of triumph; he also saw
    two perfect lips closed tightly in obvious moodiness, the while he had looked
    forward to unstinted praise for his own share in the furtherance of her desires.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Cousin John, therefore, was vastly astonished. Puzzlement in its turn
    yielded to speculation. Mistress Julia was angered&mdash;why? She had desired
    the scandal; now she seemed to resent it. Something had gone amiss then&mdash;or
    had she veered round in her intentions?</p>
  <p>Women were strange cattle in Sir John Ayloffe&rsquo;s estimation. Had his
    ambitious cousin perchance nurtured some counter-scheme of her own, which
    had come to naught through the success of the original intrigue? It almost
    seemed like it from the wrathful expression of her face.</p>
  <p>The presence of Daniel Pye in Paris came back to Sir John as a swift memory.
    There had been a counter-intrigue then?</p>
  <p>Of a truth this would trouble him but little, provided that such intrigue
    did not affect the due payment to himself of the twelve thousand pounds promised
    by the capricious lady. But of this guerdon he felt fully assured. Which
    is another proof of the truth of the ancient adage which says that there&rsquo;s
    many a slip &rsquo;twixt cup and lip, and also of the fact that women are
    far keener diviners of such untoward slips than are those who belong to the
    sterner and less intuitive sex.</p>
  <p>Even while the prospect of those pleasing thousands was flitting&mdash;all
    unbeknown to him&mdash;further and further from his future grasp, Sir John,
    studying his cousin&rsquo;s unaccountable mood tried to make some of his
    wonted cynical maxims anent the motives and emotions of the other sex fit
    the present situation.</p>
  <p>Mistress Peyton was angered when she should have been pleased. Had she perchance
    conceived an attachment for the romantic blackguard? Such things were possible&mdash;women&rsquo;s
    tastes ever erred on the queer side&mdash;and this would certainly account
    for Julia&rsquo;s impatient anger when she heard of Michael&rsquo;s interesting
    departure with the beautiful bride in his arms.</p>
  <p>Nay then! if this was the case, good Cousin John had still the cream of
    his narrative in reserve, and the final episode which he had to relate would
    of a surety satisfy the most rancorous feelings of revenge harboured against
    a hated rival by any fair monster that wore petticoat.</p>
  <p>And at the moment that Mistress Peyton finally decided in her own mind that
    an accusation of theft preferred by herself against Daniel Pye would bring
    that elderly reprobate to the whipping post and the stocks, Cousin John&rsquo;s
    mellifluent voice broke in upon these pleasant dreams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s fish, fair Coz,&rdquo; he said loudly and emphatically,
    for he desired his words to rouse her from her absorption, &ldquo;imagine
    our surprise, nay, our consternation when on our arrival at St. Denis we
    found one solitary turtledove mourning over the absence of the other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The effect of these words was instantaneous. The fair Julia&rsquo;s thoughts
    suddenly flew from prospective vengeance to present interests, and though
    the frown did not disappear from her brow, her eyes flashed eagerness now
    rather than anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What nonsense is this?&rdquo; she queried with a show of petulance. &ldquo;I
    pray you, Cousin, speak with less imagery. The matter is of serious portent
    to me as you know&mdash;and also to yourself,&rdquo; she added significantly, &ldquo;and
    I fear me that my poor wits are too dull to follow the circumlocutions of
    your flowery speech.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir John smiled complacently; he was quite satisfied that he once more held
    his cousin&rsquo;s undivided attention, and resumed his narrative with imperturbable
    good-humour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I crave your pardon, fair lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but on my
    honour &rsquo;tis just as I have told you. My lord of Stowmaries, Lord Rochester
    and your humble servant did journey by coach to St. Denis, for we knew that
    thither was the bridal couple bound. We drove in the lumbering vehicle on
    God-forsaken roads all the way from Paris, and never in all my life did I
    experience such uncomfortable journeying. &lsquo;Milor the Englishman,&rsquo; quoth
    Rochester as soon as his feet had touched the ground, &lsquo;is he abed?&rsquo; For
    you must know that it was then nigh on ten of the clock and the hostelry
    of the Three Archangels looked as dark as pitch from within and without. &lsquo;Milor
    is upstairs,&rsquo; exclaimed mine host who, of a surety, looked vastly bewildered
    at our arrival. He seemed like a man bursting with news, and as if eager
    to explain something, but we were too impatient to pay any heed to him at
    the time and ran helter-skelter upstairs in the wake of Lord Rochester who,
    as you know, is ever in the forefront in a spicy adventure, and who moreover
    was eager for another peep at the bride, whom he had greatly admired during
    the religious ceremony in the church. We none of us had any idea that anything
    could be amiss, and as I have had the honour of assuring you, our consternation
    was great when on entering the parlour we found Michael standing by the open
    window, staring moodily out into the dreary landscape, the room itself in
    total darkness, and&mdash;as we learnt afterwards&mdash;the bride gone back
    to Paris by coach in company with her father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; ejaculated Mistress Peyton, feigning surprise
    which of a truth she did not feel. What had been and still was a mystery
    to Sir John was clear enough to his fair cousin, and there was, it seems,
    some slight attenuation to Daniel Pye&rsquo;s monstrous delinquency. The
    letter, by some idiotic blunder on the part of old Pye, had reached Master
    Legros just a trifle too late, but it had reached him at last, and the infuriated
    father had contrived to reach St. Denis in time to snatch his daughter away
    from the arms of the adventurer&mdash;who thus stood prematurely unmasked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; she reiterated the while Sir John like a true
    raconteur, having succeeded in capturing her interest, made an effective
    pause in his narration. He could not complain of her moodiness now, for she
    seemed all eagerness and agitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True, nevertheless,&rdquo; he asserted quietly, &ldquo;the bride
    was gone and Michael&mdash;left desolate&mdash;seemed inclined to act like
    a man bereft of his senses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How mean you that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had, it seems, fallen madly in love with the tailor&rsquo;s daughter,
    and had no doubt during his hours of loneliness been assailed with remorse
    at what he chose to call a shameful bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Cousin John paused; his large, prominent eyes were fixed once more
    upon his cousin. Clearly there was an undercurrent of intrigue going on here
    of which he did not as yet possess the entire secret, for he had distinctly
    noted that at his last words the deep frown which had still lingered on Julia&rsquo;s
    snow-white brow now vanished completely, giving place to an excited look
    of hope. Something of the inner workings of her mind began to dawn on him,
    however, a vague, indefinable sense of what had gone before, what she had
    feared, and what she now hoped. Therefore he waited awhile, watching her
    eager, impatient face, the play of her delicate features, the nervous movements
    of her hands, ere he resumed with well-simulated carelessness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay! my dear Coz, the more I think on it, the more am I convinced
    that Michael in his love-sickness became bereft of reason, for you&rsquo;ll
    scarce believe it when I tell you that when my lord of Stowmaries desired
    to acquit himself like an honourable gentleman of his debt to his kinsman,
    and held out to him the draft for seventy thousand pounds, Michael refused
    to take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time there was no mistaking the look of pleasure which lit up the fair
    Julia&rsquo;s face. A less acute observer than was Sir John would have realised
    at once that this last item of news was essentially pleasant to the hearer.
    Mistress Peyton of a truth, found her anxieties vanishing away, and was at
    no pains to hide the pleasure which she felt. Hope was returning to her heart,
    also gratitude towards Fate who, it seems, had been kind enough after all
    to play into her hands.</p>
  <p>Psychologically the situation was interesting, and we may assume that Cousin
    John was no longer at sea now. He might not yet possess the key which opened
    the magic gate into his fair cousin&rsquo;s secret orchard, but he was essentially
    a gambler, an unscrupulous schemer himself; money, to him, was the all-powerful
    solution of many an obscure puzzle.</p>
  <p>The mention of money had brought on the beautiful face before him the first
    smile of satisfaction since the beginning of his narrative; ergo, argued
    Cousin John, the fair mistress entered into a private, villainous little
    scheme of her own, of calling the tune without paying the piper. Women have
    no sense of honour, where debts between gentlemen are concerned.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Once on a track, Sir John was quick enough to follow the puzzle to
    its satisfactory solution. But he was not pleased that his cousin, and partner
    in the whole enterprise, should thus have intrigued without his knowledge
    or counsel. Heavens above, if conspirators did not work together, every plot,
    however well laid, would speedily abort. Women were ever ready for these
    petty infamies; they seemed to revel in them, to plan and scheme them even
    if&mdash;as in this case&mdash;they were wholly superfluous.</p>
  <p>He was angry with his pretty cousin, and showed it by keeping her on tenter-hooks,
    dropping his narrative and ostentatiously draining a mug of posset to its
    last drop. He would force her, he thought, to disclose her treacherous little
    hand to the full.</p>
  <p>And he succeeded, for as he did not speak she was quite unable to curb her
    impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;the money&mdash;&rdquo; she asked with obviously affected
    indifference, &ldquo;what became of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The money?&rdquo; he asked blandly &ldquo;What money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The seventy thousand pounds,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;which Michael
    Kestyon was to receive and which he refused to take.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cousin John looked at her over the top of his goblet, his round, bulgy eyes
    told her quite plainly that he had read her through and through, and that
    he for one was not sorry that her little counter-scheme had failed, since
    she had not thought fit to ask his advice. But he said quite lightly, as
    one who speaks of a trifle too mean to dwell in the memory:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! the seventy thousand pounds! They are where they should be, dear
    Cousin, in Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s pocket. The just reward for his services
    rendered to his kinsman, your future lord, fair Coz!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you said just now&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered on the verge of
    tears, for the sudden sense of disappointment had been very bitter to bear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said that Michael had been smitten with remorse, and had at first
    refused to take the money, but Lord Stowmaries soon overcame his scruples
    and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Stowmaries is a fool!&rdquo; she interrupted hotly.</p>
  <p>Sir John feigned great astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A fool? For acquitting himself of a debt of honour?&rdquo; he asked
    in tones of mild reproof.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay! a fool, and thrice a fool,&rdquo; she reiterated with increased
    vehemence, for she was no gaby and was not taken in now by Cousin John&rsquo;s
    blandness. He had divined her thoughts, and guessed something of her aborted
    plans; there was no occasion therefore to subdue her annoyance any longer. &ldquo;An
    Michael Kestyon was such a dotard as to refuse a fortune,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;why
    should my lord Stowmaries be the one to force it upon him. Nay! The whole
    bargain was iniquitous or worse. Ridiculous it was of a truth&mdash;one hundred
    and twenty thousand pounds to a man who would have done the trick for so
    many pence. I marvelled at you, Cousin, for lending a hand to such wanton
    waste and did my best to circumvent your folly, but thanks to that dolt Daniel
    Pye, and apparently to my lord Stowmaries&rsquo; idiocy, Michael Kestyon
    is now in possession of the means whereby he can divest the cousin who paid
    him so well not only of his title but of all his wealth. A blunder, Cousin,
    an idiotic, silly blunder,&rdquo;  she added as she jumped to her feet, unable
    to sit still, tramping up and down the room like a raging wildcat, lashing
    herself into worse fury by picturing all the evils which the unfortunate
    business would bring in its train, chief amongst these being my lord Stowmaries&rsquo; undoing,
    for which she really cared naught only in so long as it affected her own
    prospects.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The silly adventure is already the talk of the town; the king has
    asked to see Michael Kestyon. Bah! The man sold his kingdom, the liberty
    and dignity of England for a sum not much larger than what Michael can now
    offer him for a favourable decision in a peerage claim. Ye saints above!
    what fools men are! what blind, blundering, silly fools, the moment they
    begin to prate of honour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cousin John had allowed his fair cousin&rsquo;s vehement vituperations to
    pass unchallenged over his humbled head. That there was some truth in her
    argument he himself could not deny, and it was a fact that fears very akin
    to her own in the matter of the money had more than once crossed his mind.
    Feeling, therefore, that the reproof, though exceptionally violent, was not
    undeserved, he dropped his bland, cynical manner, and when at last the fair
    Julia paused in her invectives, chiefly for lack of breath, and also because
    tears of anger were choking her voice, he spoke to her quite quietly and
    almost apologetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, Coz,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would have you believe that
    I am deeply touched by your reproaches, which, alas, I may have merited to
    a certain extent. Zeal in your cause may have rendered me less far-seeing
    than I really should have been, considering what we both have at stake. But
    let me tell you also that I have not been quite such a dolt as you seem to
    think. You are quite wrong in supposing that Michael Kestyon would have acted
    the part which he did for a less sum than we have given him. Nothing but
    a real substantial fortune would have tempted Michael. Nothing,&rdquo; reiterated
    Sir John emphatically, seeing that Julia made a contemptuous gesture of incredulity. &ldquo;He
    is a curious mixture of the wastrel and the gentleman; if we could not satisfy
    his ambition, we could not attack his sense of honour. Where we made the
    mistake was in thinking that a substantial sum would satisfy him in itself.
    No one guessed that his dormant claim to the peerage of Stowmaries was still
    of such vital importance to him. He had ceased to move actively in the matter
    partly through the lack of money, but also in part through the moral collapse
    which he has undergone in the past two years. I confess that I did think
    that when he was possessed of his newly-acquired fortune, he would continue
    the life of dissolute vagabondage which we all believed had become his second&mdash;nay,
    his only nature. It seems that we were all mistaken&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Has anything occurred already?&rdquo; asked Julia,
    who found all her fears increased tenfold at Cousin John&rsquo;s seriously-spoken
    words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo; he said reassuringly, &ldquo;nothing at present,
    save that Michael Kestyon has made no attempt to return to his boon companions
    in the various brothels which were wont to be his haunts. Rumour hath it
    that he is oft seen in the company of my lord Shaftesbury, and there is no
    doubt that the king was vastly amused by the adventure. Some say that royal
    smiles are the sure precursors to royal favours. But between entertaining
    Charles II with tales of spicy adventures and obtaining actual decisions
    from him in important matters lie vast gulfs of kingly indifference and of
    kindly indolence. There is nothing that the king hates worse than the giving
    of a decision, and, believe me, that he will dilly-dally with Michael until
    that young reprobate will have spent every penny of his new fortune, and
    will have none left to offer as a bribe to our merry monarch. It is not cheap,
    believe me, to be a temporary boon companion to Charles Stuart, and a great
    deal more than a hundred thousand pounds would have to pass through Michael&rsquo;s
    fingers in keeping up a certain gentlemanly state, in tailor&rsquo;s accounts,
    in bets and in losses at hazard, before the king would think of rewarding
    him in the only manner which would compensate him for all the money expended
    in obtaining the royal smiles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may be right, Cousin,&rdquo; said Mistress Peyton, somewhat reassured, &ldquo;at
    the same time a great deal of anxiety would have been saved me, if that old
    liar Daniel Pye had done as he was bid. But he shall rue his prevarications,
    and bitterly, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may wreak what vengeance you will, fair Cousin, on the varlet
    who hath disobeyed you. But I entreat you to keep your favours for those
    who have tried to serve you to the best of their poor abilities. As for the
    rest, let me assure you now that Michael Kestyon refused the seventy thousand
    pounds and even offered to repay the first instalment of fifty thousand on
    terms which were wholly unacceptable to Lord Stowmaries. The chief condition
    being that my lord should rescind the whole of the bargain, and take the
    tailor&rsquo;s wench back into his heart and marital bosom. You see, fair
    Coz, how impossible it was to treat with Michael at all, and we certainly
    were not to blame. My lord of Stowmaries is still the happiest man on earth;
    glad enough to have purchased his happiness for one hundred and twenty thousand
    pounds. An I mistake not he is in Rome now, awaiting the Pope&rsquo;s decision&mdash;but
    that is a foregone conclusion. Monseigneur the Archbishop hath assured him
    of his cooperation. Soon my lord will receive that for which he craves: religious
    dispensation to avail himself of the civil law of England which will readily
    grant him nullity of marriage, and the blessing of the Pope himself on his
    remarriage with the fairest beauty that e&rsquo;er hath graced an ancestral
    home. Until then I entreat you, Cousin,&rdquo;  added Sir John with elaborate
    gallantry, &ldquo;to smooth away those frowns of anxiety which ill become
    the future Countess of Stowmaries. Let me see you smile, dear Coz, ere I
    take my leave, having, I trust, assured you that you have no truer servant
    than your faithful kinsman, the recipient of your favours, and, I trust,
    of many more in the not very distant future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no resisting Cousin John&rsquo;s assurance and his smile of confident
    encouragement. Mistress Peyton did allow the wrinkles of anger to fade from
    her smooth brow. But complete peace of mind was not restored to her in full;
    she was almost glad that &ldquo;the happiest man on earth&rdquo; was away
    from her just now. She wanted to think matters over in absolute quietude,
    away from her good cousin&rsquo;s bland platitudes. It almost seemed as if
    Fate had reshuffled all her cards; she and her partners in the great life-gamble,
    Lord Stowmaries, Sir John and Michael Kestyon, too, had had fresh hands dealt
    to them. They needed sorting and the game mayhap reconsidering.</p>
  <p>It was even doubtful at the present moment what was the chief trump card.
    Daniel Pye with his clumsy fingers had abstracted one out of his mistress&rsquo; hand.
    At thought of that the frown returned and the &ldquo;fairest beauty that
    e&rsquo;er graced an ancestral home&rdquo; looked not unlike a vengeful termagant
    gloating over the petty revenge which&mdash;in a small measure&mdash;would
    compensate her for all anxieties past, present and to come.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30</b></h2>
  <p>Daniel Pye, having arrived at that corner stone in Holborn Row which afforded
    him a full view of the house whence he had just been ignominiously dismissed,
    turned and shook a menacing fist in its direction. His body ached, he was
    smarting in every limb, and he had a grievance which clamoured loudly for
    revenge.</p>
  <p>In Paris he had endured, whilst executing his duty, the buffetings and blows
    of a crowd of rowdy apprentices; this he had done not from any deep-rooted
    attachment to a capricious and exacting mistress, nor from any very exalted
    notions of abstract duty, but chiefly for the sake of the commendations and
    the rewards which the due fulfilment to Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s commands
    would naturally bring in its train.</p>
  <p>The fact that, in order to allay the futile anxieties of a pretty woman,
    good Daniel Pye subsequently went in for a somewhat highly-coloured tale
    of his adventures was, after all, a venial sin, and surely the minor transgression
    which he had committed in delivering the letter, half an hour later than
    he should have done, did not call for such malignant and cruel treatment
    as his ungrateful mistress had thought fit to impose upon him. Under a paltry
    accusation of theft, which the lady herself must have known was totally unfounded,
    she had handed him over to the magistrate for punishment. Convicted of the
    charge on the most flimsy evidence, he had been made to stand in the pillory
    two hours, and been publicly flogged like some recalcitrant &rsquo;prentices,
    or immoral wench.</p>
  <p>Nay, worse! For Mistress Peyton herself, accompanied by Sir John Ayloffe,
    had gone down to Bridewell to see her serving-man whipped, under the pretence
    that she wished to see justice properly tempered with mercy, since she only
    desired merited chastisement for him and not wanton cruelty.</p>
  <p>And yet when he, Daniel Pye, was howling at the whipping post like one possessed,
    the while a crowd of young jackanapes&mdash;among whom were some of Pye&rsquo;s
    fellow servants&mdash;stood hooting and jeering, Sir John Ayloffe at Mistress
    Peyton&rsquo;s special command had ordered that an additional ten strokes
    with the lash be dealt him with no lenient hand. And when Daniel anon stood
    in the pillory, bruised, sore, every limb in his body aching with the heavy
    blows, Sir John had caused baskets full of rotten eggs and scraps of tainted
    fish and meat and decayed vegetable to be distributed among the spectators
    so that the ribald youngsters might throw this evil-smelling refuse at the
    unfortunate man whose sole crime had been a tiny lie spoken in order to reassure
    an ungrateful mistress.</p>
  <p>Finally Pye was dismissed from Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s service, despite
    his abject entreaties. He was kicked out of the street door by a young lacquey
    whom he himself had oft flogged for impertinence and who now had already
    assumed the comfortable shoes of office which Daniel had worn for so long.</p>
  <p>To the last the mistress had persisted in her unfounded and cruel accusations.
    To the last she coldly asserted that Daniel had robbed her of seventy thousand
    pounds.</p>
  <p>Seventy thousand pounds! By Heaven! Daniel was not aware that such a vast
    sum existed in the world, nor if he had stolen it&mdash;which of course he
    had not&mdash;would he have known what to do with all that money!</p>
  <p>No wonder, therefore, that the man felt mentally as well as bodily sore&mdash;nay,
    that he swore to be revenged on the cruel lady who had so wantonly wronged
    him. What form his revenge would take he could not at first determine, but
    these were days when it was not over-difficult for a man to make his petty
    spite be very uncomfortably felt, provided he had nothing more to lose and
    possessed neither conscience nor fear of ulterior punishment.</p>
  <p>Now Daniel Pye, we know, had no overwhelming regard for truth; as to punishment,
    by the Lord, he had had all the punishment that any menial could possibly
    receive. He could sink no lower in the hierarchy of respectable domesticity;
    he had nothing more to lose, nothing more to gain. A serving-man who had
    been publicly flogged for theft was an outcast as far as gentlemen&rsquo;s
    houses were concerned. All the service that a branded thief might obtain
    in future would be in mean taverns or places of doubtful reputation where
    the master could not afford to be over-particular in the choice of his henchmen.</p>
  <p>Pye had indeed shaken a menacing fist at the house in Holborn Row. Though
    he had not thought out the exact form which his revenge might take, he knew
    by instinct in what quarter to seek for guidance in this desire.</p>
  <p>His steps led him almost mechanically in the direction of Whitefriars. When
    he himself was still a respectable lacquey; he would have scorned to set
    foot in this unhallowed spot where cheats, liars and other reprobates rubbed
    shoulders with the wastrels of aristocratic descent who had sought sanctuary
    here against their creditors.</p>
  <p>In a corner of the narrow street, and in what had once been the refectory
    of white-robed monks, there now stood a tavern of evil fame&mdash;one or
    two low-raftered rooms, wherein light and air penetrated in such minute particles
    that these had not the power to drive away the heavy fumes of alcohol, of
    rank tobacco, of vice and of licentiousness which filled every corner of
    this dark and squalid spot.</p>
  <p>Here the informer, the perjurer, the cheat, held his court unmolested, here
    the debtor was free from pursuit, and the highway robber safe from the arm
    of the law.</p>
  <p>Whitefriars was sanctuary! Oh, the mockery of the word! For it was the brawlers
    and the bullies, the termagants and hags that inhabited these once holy and
    consecrated precincts, who enforced this self-ordained law of sanctuary.
    Neither townguard nor soldiery would dare to enter the unhallowed neighbourhood
    save in great numerical strength, and even then the flails of the lawless
    fraternity, the bludgeons of the men and stew-pans and spits of the women
    oft gained a victory over the musketeers.</p>
  <p>To this spot now Daniel Pye unhesitatingly turned his footsteps. The servant
    kicked out of house for theft, the henchman who had been flogged and had
    stood in the pillory, naturally drifted towards those who like himself were
    at war with law and order, who had quarrelled with justice or were nursing
    a grievance.</p>
  <p>It was then late in the afternoon. Outside the beautiful May sun was trying
    to smile on the grimy city, on all that man had put up in order to pollute
    God&rsquo;s pure earth: the evil-smelling, narrow streets, the pavements
    oozing with slimy, slippery mud, the rickety, tumble-down houses covered
    with dirt and stains. All this the sun had kissed and touched gently with
    warmth and promise of spring, but into that corner of Whitefriars where Daniel
    Pye now stood, it had not attempted to penetrate.</p>
  <p>Overhead the protruding gables right and left of the street almost met,
    obscuring all save a very narrow strip of sky. Underfoot the slimy mud, fed
    by innumerable overflowing gutters, hardly gave a foothold to the passerby.</p>
  <p>But the door of the brothel stood invitingly open. Daniel Pye walked in
    unchallenged; scarce a head was turned or a glance raised to appraise the
    newcomer. He looked sulky and unkempt, his clothes were soiled and tattered
    after the painful halt in the pillory. In fact he looked what he was&mdash;a
    rebel against society like unto themselves.</p>
  <p>Men sat in groups conversing in whispers and drinking deeply out of pewter
    mugs. One of these groups, more compact than the others, occupied the centre
    of the room. In the midst of it a man with thin, long, yellow hair straggling
    round a high forehead, his thin shanks encased in undarned worsted stockings,
    his stooping shoulders covered by a surcoat of sad-coloured grogram, seemed
    to hold a kind of court.</p>
  <p>Daniel slouched toward that group; the man in the sad-coloured coat raised
    a pair of pale, watery eyes to him, and no doubt recognising by that subtle
    instinct peculiar to the great army of blackguards, that here was a kindred
    spirit, he made way for the stranger so that the latter might sit on the
    bench beside him.</p>
  <p>After a very little while Pye found himself quite at home in that low-raftered
    room, wherein the air surfeited with evil-smelling fumes was less foul than
    the sentiments, the lies, the blasphemies that were freely emitted here.</p>
  <p>The group of whom Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s ex-henchman had now become a unit,
    and over which presided the lanky-haired, pale-eyed youth, consisted of men
    who had neither the enthusiasm of their own villainy nor the courage of their
    own crimes; they were the spies that worked in the dark, the informers who
    struck unseen. False oaths, perjured information, lying accusations were
    their special trade. It did not take Daniel Pye very long to learn its secrets.</p>
  <p>The man with the yellow hair was called Oates. He had once been a priest,
    now he was a renegade, a sacrilegious liar, and maker of false oaths. Close
    to him sat another man, outwardly very different to look at, for he was stout
    and florid, and his eyes were bleary, but the perversion of the soul within
    was equal in these two men. Oates and Tongue! What a world of infamy do their
    very names evoke! They were the leaders of this band of false informers who
    lived and throve by this infamous trade. Oates soon made a fortune by those
    very schemes which he propounded to his henchmen on this memorable day when
    Daniel Pye drifted into their midst.</p>
  <p>The East Anglian peasant torn from his primitive home amongst the wheatfields
    of Norfolk, transplanted into the vitiated atmosphere of the great city,
    there to learn the abject lessons which the service of a capricious woman
    and the bribes of her courtiers do so readily teach to a grasping nature,
    now fell a ready slave to the insidious suggestions of these perjurers. Pye
    at first had listened with half an ear. His thoughts were still centred on
    vengeance and on his own aches and pains, and the denunciations against Papists
    which was the chief subject of discussion between Oates and his audience
    seemed to him of puerile significance.</p>
  <p>But the eye of the other, of him with the florid complexion, was constantly
    fixed on Daniel Pye. Gradually he drew the latter into conversation. A vague
    question here, a suggestion there, and the whole history of that day&rsquo;s
    bitter wrongs was soon poured into overwilling ears: the accusation of theft,
    the whipping post, the pillory.</p>
  <p>Pye felt no shame in retailing these humiliating woes to a stranger. Ever
    since he had been kicked out of the house by that insolent subordinate he
    had longed to tell the tale to some one. Truly he would have gone raving
    mad with compressed rage if he had had to go silently to bed. The stranger
    was a sympathetic listener:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strike me! but &rsquo;tis a damnable tale,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;misdeeds
    that cry loudly for revenge. Cannot you, friend, be even with a woman who
    hath treated you so ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; growled Pye, moodily. &ldquo;A woman! She is rich,
    too, and hath many friends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well-favoured, too, mayhap,&rdquo; suggested the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, she&rsquo;s counted pretty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And her friends are mostly gentlemen, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mostly,&rdquo; replied Daniel impatiently, for he liked not this
    digression from the all-absorbing topic of his own woes.</p>
  <p>Tongue said nothing more for the present, but anon he called for mulled
    ale, and made Pye draw nearer to the table and partake largely of his lavishness.</p>
  <p>The ale had been strengthened with raw alcohol, and made heady with steaming
    and the admixture of spices. It had special properties&mdash;as all blackguards
    in search of victims or confederates well knew&mdash;of loosening tongues
    and addling feeble minds.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Daniel Pye had had no desire to be reticent. He was already over-ready
    to talk. But the spirituous ale which soon got into his head killed that
    instinctive native suspicion in him, which in more sober moments would have
    caused him to look askance at the easy familiarity of his newly-found friend.</p>
  <p>Pye was quite unaware of the fact that Tongue was really questioning him
    very closely, and that he himself gave ready answer to every question. Within
    half an hour, he had told the other all that there was to know about Mistress
    Peyton and her household, but still Master Tongue was disappointing in his
    offers of advice. Daniel was under the impression that the man with the florid
    face would help him to be revenged on his spiteful mistress, and yet time
    went on and Daniel had told his story over and over again in every detail
    and yet nothing had been suggested that sounded satisfactory.</p>
  <p>He wanted to dwell on his troubles, those final ten lashes specially ordered,
    the rotten eggs thrown at him one by one by that damnable little scullion
    whom he himself had so often thrashed. Yet Master Tongue would no longer
    dwell on these interesting facts, but always dragged the conversation back
    to Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s household, or to the gentlemen who formed her
    court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely, friend,&rdquo; he said somewhat impatiently at last, &ldquo;you
    must have known some of these gentlemen quite intimately. If as you say your
    mistress was a noted beauty, she must have had many admirers, some more favoured
    than others&mdash;some of these must have been Papists. The Duke of Norfolk
    now&mdash;did he come to see your lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Daniel Pye, sulkily. &ldquo;But just as that rascally
    scullion hit me in the eye&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about that now,&rdquo; interrupted the other. &ldquo;Try
    and tell me the names of those gentlemen who most often visited this Mistress
    Julia Peyton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was Sir John Ayloffe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is no Papist&mdash;who else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Anthony Wykeham&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Tongue eagerly. &ldquo;Did he come often?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Only once. But as I was telling you, there was a youngster in
    that crowd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the other again broke in impatiently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You only saw Sir Anthony Wykeham once? When was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He came with my lord of Stowmaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord Stowmaries? You know my lord Stowmaries? Did he come often?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every day nearly. Mistress Peyton is like to marry him, now that
    he&rsquo;s rid of his first wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Daniel Pye&rsquo;s utter astonishment, this simple fact&mdash;which he
    himself considered of very minor interest in comparison with the story of
    his own troubles&mdash;seemed to delight his newly-found friend.</p>
  <p>Master Tongue jumped up with every sign of eager excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You knew my lord Stowmaries?&rdquo; he reiterated insistently. &ldquo;You
    knew him well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Pye, somewhat bewildered, assented, he ejaculated:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By G&mdash;d! the best man we could ever have hit upon, under the
    circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He now slipped his hand confidentially under Pye&rsquo;s arm, forcing him
    to rise, then he dragged him away from the group, and into a distant corner
    of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he whispered eagerly, &ldquo;let me tell you that
    you are in luck to-day. You want your revenge; you shall have it, and much
    more yet to boot, and your spiteful mistress will yet have cause to rue the
    day when she turned you out of doors. Listen to me, man! Are you desirous
    of securing a good competence as well as of being even with her who had you
    whipped and pilloried?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; replied Daniel Pye with a fervour which was too deep for
    a longer flow of words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do you go out of here now and find means to kill time in some
    other tavern close by. But at ten of the clock this night return here. You
    will find me and my friend Oates, and one or two more of these gentlemen
    who have a vast scheme in hand for our own good fortune, wherein we will
    ask you to participate. Nay, ask me no more now!&rdquo; added the man with
    the bleary eyes. &ldquo;It were too long to explain, and there are several
    pairs of ears present in this room at this moment who are not meant to hear
    all that I say. But I tell you, friend, that if you be willing, my friend
    Oates will help you to your revenge, and in addition there will be at least &pound;30
    in your pocket, and the chance of earning more. Well, what say you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Daniel Pye simply.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31</b></h2>
  <p>When Mistress Peyton had finally dismissed Daniel Pye from her service,
    after having seen him flogged and pilloried, she felt somewhat more at ease.</p>
  <p>She did not see his gesture of menace, nor would it have perturbed her much
    if she had. Her spite against the man had been cruel and petty; she knew
    that well enough, yet did not strive to curb it. Daniel Pye&rsquo;s howls
    at the whipping post had momentarily served to alleviate the anxieties which
    as day succeeded day grew in intensity.</p>
  <p>The recollection of what she had made the man suffer was a solace, even
    now when the awful truth had begun to dawn upon her that in striving to gain
    too much, she had very likely lost all.</p>
  <p>Rumour was overbusy with Michael Kestyon; his popularity with the king,
    my lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s interest in the long-forgotten peerage claim,
    Michael&rsquo;s long conferences with Sir William Jones, the Attorney-General,
    who was said to know more about peerages, genealogies and legitimacies than
    did His Majesty&rsquo;s heralds and poursuivants themselves.</p>
  <p>On Sir William&rsquo;s report would the king ultimately base his decision
    as to Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s claim to the title and estates of Stowmaries
    and Rivaulx. The matter would not be referred to the Lord&rsquo;s House of
    Parliament. It was absolutely one for the Crown to decide, nor were the noble
    lords like to go against the king&rsquo;s mandate.</p>
  <p>Already gossips averred that Michael had paid the Attorney-General one hundred
    thousand pounds for the report which was ready to be submitted to the king,
    and which, needless to say, was entirely in favour of the claim. It was also
    said that my lord Stowmaries&mdash;financially somewhat straitened for the
    moment, through a recent highly-interesting adventure&mdash;was unable to
    cap his cousin&rsquo;s munificent gift to Sir William Jones by one more magnificent
    still.</p>
  <p>All these rumours were quite sufficient forsooth to cause the fair Julia
    many an anxious hour and many a sleepless night. Small wonder that when she
    thought of Daniel Pye and of that hundred thousand pounds paid to the Attorney-General,
    which could not have been forthcoming if the miserable reprobate had delivered
    his mistress&rsquo; letter to M. Legros in good time, no wonder, then, I
    say, that her small teeth, sharp as those of a wildcat, set against each
    other in an agony of impotent rage. She would have liked to have got hold
    of her serving-man again, to have had him flogged again and again, ay, and
    to have had him deprived of his right hand for his disobedience and his lies.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;might-have-beens&rdquo; were becoming positive torture to the
    beautiful Julia; and my lord Stowmaries had not yet come home. He had gone
    to Rome for the dispensation, which he told her in an ardent and passionate
    missive, he had at last obtained. Julia laughed, a cruel, callous, bitter
    laugh when she read that letter. Of a truth the man must be mad who could
    for a moment think that she would wed him in poverty and obscurity, just
    as readily as she would in riches.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Cousin John did his best to console her. He vowed that rumour lied,
    that Michael was spending his money in a vain endeavour to retain his popularity
    with the king, in which he was rapidly failing, and that no sensible-minded
    person did believe that His Majesty would uphold the preposterous claims
    of a sworn adventurer, wastrel and soldier of fortune, against so elegant
    a gentleman as was my lord of Stowmaries.</p>
  <p>After one of these visits from Cousin John, Mistress Julia always felt temporarily
    relieved of her anxiety. She had thought it best for the moment to keep aloof
    from the society of London; she was nowhere to be seen in public, not even
    at the playhouses where she had once been the cynosure of all eyes. She wanted
    to see her future fully assured before she again encountered the admiring
    glances of the men, or the oft ill-natured comments of the women.</p>
  <p>When at last Lord Stowmaries, back from his journey to Rome, was once more
    at her feet, glowing with loving ardour, triumphant in his success, Mistress
    Peyton remained cold and unresponsive. He did not notice this, for he was
    full of projects and happy that the path which led him to her arms had at
    last been made quite clear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madly as I longed for your sweet presence, my best beloved,&rdquo; he
    said whilst he covered her little hands with kisses, &ldquo;I would not return
    until I knew that I was free&mdash;quite free to place mine all, my name,
    my fortune at your feet. I journeyed to Rome, dear heart, immediately after
    the esclandre in Paris. I paid Michael his due, then flew to His Holiness.
    When I returned homewards I was eager to know how the scandal had spread.
    Nay, there is no fear now that the tailor will strive to interfere with me.
    There are various rumours current about the wench, one of them being that
    she will go to a nunnery, the other, which gains far more credence, being
    that King Louis, vastly interested in her adventure hath cast eyes of admiration
    on her and that Mme. de Montespan is deadly jealous. Be that as it may, Monseigneur
    the Archbishop of Paris is now wholly on my side. He gave me letters to His
    Holiness, whom I saw in Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what said His Holiness, the Pope?&rdquo; queried Julia, feigning
    eagerness which she was far from feeling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has granted me religious dispensation to contract a fresh marriage,
    provided the courts of England do dissolve my present bonds, which is a foregone
    conclusion,&rdquo; said the young man triumphantly. &ldquo;My man of law
    tells me that it will be but a matter of a few weeks, and that the case will
    be decided as soon as heard, provided the tailor&rsquo;s wench doth not defend
    it, which under the circumstances she is not like to do. I am free, dear
    heart, free to marry you as soon as you will consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as she did not reply, he added reproachfully:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are silent, my Julia; will you not tell me that you are glad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made no effort to smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, my lord, I am glad,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;but I
    would not have you hasten matters too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? To me every day, every hour that separates me from you,
    seems like weary cycles of dull and deadly years. Methinks that if you would
    but allow me to proclaim you to the whole world as my future countess, I
    could wait more patiently then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet, my lord, not yet,&rdquo; she said with a slight show of
    petulance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he urged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The times are troublous for your co-religionists, my lord,&rdquo; she
    said vaguely.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Bah! the troubles will not last, and they do not affect me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure of that, my lord? One by one the Papists in the
    kingdom fall under the ban of public hatred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are much maligned, but the king is on our side,&rdquo; interposed
    Stowmaries with an indifferent shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap, mayhap,&rdquo; she rejoined impatiently. &ldquo;But nevertheless,
    the Papists are in bad odour. There is talk that the Duke of York will soon
    be sent abroad. The outcry in London is loud against what is called a Papist
    intrigue to sell England to France and to place her people under the yoke
    of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What hath all that to do with our love, dear heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; she said, angry with him for being so obtuse,
    not liking yet to show him her hand, the cruel hand which would dismiss him
    without compunction, were his fortunes on the wane. &ldquo;You forget that
    by disgracing the tailor&rsquo;s wench, you have made Michael Kestyon, the
    claimant to your title, passing rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! He hath spent half that substance already, so &rsquo;tis said.
    The king soon tires of his friends, and his affections are an expensive luxury
    to keep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rumour goes on to say that Michael Kestyon hath paid the Attorney-General
    one hundred thousand pounds that he may send a favourable report of his case
    to the king,&rdquo; asserted Mistress Peyton, relentlessly, almost spitefully.</p>
  <p>Lord Stowmaries made no direct reply. Truth to tell, he thought his fair
    Julia&rsquo;s anxieties futile, but at the same time, with unvarying optimism
    and self-sufficiency, he had attributed these anxieties on his behalf to
    her great love for him. Everything so far had gone well with him; for years
    now his every wish in life had been gratified; even the child-marriage, that
    great obstacle to the desires of his heart, had been swept away from before
    his path, leaving it clear and broad, to lead him straight to gratification
    and to happiness.</p>
  <p>With characteristic vanity he would not see that Julia, who had been all
    eagerness and ardour awhile ago, had suddenly become cold and well-nigh hostile.
    In every word which she uttered, in every inflection of her voice&mdash;even
    when it became petulant and spiteful&mdash;he heard but the echo of the overmastering
    emotions of a tender heart, whose sole object, himself, was in imaginary
    peril.</p>
  <p>He loved her all the better for her fears, though he felt none himself.
    He knew quite well that a wave of fanatical hatred against the Roman Catholics
    was passing over Puritan England; that the nation tired of a king&rsquo;s
    treachery had turned in deadly bitterness against those whom it held responsible
    for the constitutional faithlessness of a Stuart.</p>
  <p>But Titus Oates had not yet come forward with his lies, and Lord Stowmaries
    and his co-religionists were the last to foresee that the abject terror and
    malignant intolerance of the whole nation were already being directed against
    them, and that these would anon culminate in those shameful accusations,
    mock trials and scandalous verdicts which have remained to this day a dark
    and ineradicable blot on England&rsquo;s integrity and on her sense of justice.</p>
  <p>We must not suppose for a moment that Mistress Peyton foresaw the ugly black
    cloud which was looming on the not very distant horizon. Her intuition in
    political matters only went so far as these affected her own prospects. But
    no one who lived in London in this year of grace could help but see that
    Papists were held in abhorrence and in fear. The terms of the treaty of
    Dover had, despite strenuous efforts on the part of my lords Clifford and
    Arlington, become public property. England, with eyes rendered unseeing by
    abject fear, saw herself the minion of France, the slave of the Papacy. It
    only needed the tiny spark to kindle these smouldering ashes into raging
    flames.</p>
  <p>Mistress Peyton, keenly alive to her own interests, did not wish to tie
    her future irrevocably to a man who within the next few months might find
    himself divested of title and wealth and mayhap in the dock for treason.
    Therefore, all Stowmaries&rsquo; ardent entreaties received but little response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is time and to spare,&rdquo; was all the hope which the fair
    beauty chose to give to her adorer; &ldquo;as you say, this wave of anti-Romanism
    will pass away; Michael Kestyon will dissipate his newly-acquired wealth
    in riotous living; then you, my lord, will be free to think once more of
    marriage. I&rsquo;faith the bonds are scarce broken yet; your nullity suit,
    my lord, hath not even been tried; the tailor may prove more obstinate than
    you think, and give you trouble yet. On my soul, &rsquo;twill be better to
    wait till all anxiety is removed from you, until Michael Kestyon is sunk
    back in obscurity and the tailor&rsquo;s baggage hid in a nunnery. Then,
    my lord, you may claim my promise&mdash;but not before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My lord of Stowmaries had perforce to be satisfied for the present, though
    he chafed under this further period of incertitude. But the fair Julia would
    grant him no more for the present, although after her cold declaration that
    she herself would not be tied by a promise, she did exact from him a holy
    and solemn pledge that he considered himself bound to her irrevocably and
    whatever might betide, so help him God.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32</b></h2>
  <p>M. Legros walked out backwards from the august presence of Monseigneur the
    Archbishop of Paris with head reverently bent to receive the benediction
    not altogether ungraciously given.</p>
  <p>Through the close ranks of gorgeously attired, liveried servants he passed,
    then across the courtyard and through the gilded gates out into the street.</p>
  <p>Then only would his sense of what was due to Monseigneur allow him to give
    vent to his feelings. He sighed and shook his head and muttered vague words
    of despondency.</p>
  <p>Of a truth how different had been this interview to-day to that other one
    a brief while ago, when with light elastic step, good M. Legros had left
    Monseigneur&rsquo;s presence with his heart full of elation, of triumph and
    of hope.</p>
  <p>It had been November then; the kindly tailor remembered how cold had been
    the night, with that penetrating drizzle which sought out the very marrow
    of the unfortunate pedestrian who happened to be abroad. But M. Legros had
    not heeded the cold or the wet then, his heart had been warm with the joyful
    news which he was about to bring into his home. Now the warm glow of a late
    September sun was in the air; not far away in the gardens of the Queen Mother&rsquo;s
    palace the last roses of summer were throwing their dying fragrance into
    the air even as far as the dismal streets which Legros traversed, oh, with
    such a heavy heart!</p>
  <p>Indeed, he paid no heed to the scent of the flowers, the last tender calls
    of thrush and blackbird which came from the heavy bouquets of the Luxembourg,
    and he almost shivered despite the warmth of this late summer&rsquo;s afternoon.
    Monseigneur had not been encouraging; and even the tailor&rsquo;s philosophical
    temperament had shown signs of inward rebellion at the cold manner in which
    the Archbishop had received his just plaint. Wherein had he sinned, either
    he or his wife? They had been deceived, nothing more. Would not any one else
    have been deceived in just the same way, by the soft words and grand manner
    of that splendid blackguard?</p>
  <p>And Rose Marie, the innocent lamb? Was it not a sin in itself even to suggest
    that she had been to blame? Yet Monseigneur would not listen, despite good
    M. Legros&rsquo; entreaties. &ldquo;You should have guarded your daughter&rsquo;s
    honour more carefully,&rdquo; His Greatness had said very severely.</p>
  <p>Prayers for help had been of no avail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot help you now,&rdquo; Monseigneur had reiterated with marked
    impatience; &ldquo;the matter rests with your daughter&rsquo;s husband. My
    lord of Stowmaries is the gravely-injured husband; he may choose to forgive
    and forget, he may take his erring wife back to his heart and home, but I
    cannot interfere; the Holy Church would not enforce her decree under such
    circumstances. It would be cruel and unjust. If the law of England will grant
    the suit of nullity, the Holy Father will not&mdash;nay, he cannot, object.
    My lord of Stowmaries hath the right to his freedom now, an he choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But my child is as pure and as innocent as the Holy Virgin herself,&rdquo; M.
    Legros had protested with all the strength of his poor broken heart; &ldquo;will
    not the Church protect the innocent, rather than the guilty? My lord of Stowmaries
    himself was a party to the infamous trick which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into this discussion I cannot enter with you, sirrah!&rdquo; His
    Greatness had interrupted with overwhelming severity. &ldquo;The matter is
    one which doth not concern the Church. What doth concern her is that my lord
    of Stowmaries, who is a devout Catholic, hath asked for leave to appeal to
    the civil courts of his country for a dissolution of his marriage with a
    woman who no longer bears a spotless reputation. This leave under the unfortunate
    circumstances and the undoubted publicity of the scandal around your daughter&rsquo;s
    fame, the Holy Father hath decided to grant. I can do nothing in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Greatness, knowing the real facts of the case&mdash;&rdquo; hazarded
    the timid man rendered bold by the excess of his sorrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only know the facts of the case, such as I see them,&rdquo;  interrupted
    the Archbishop haughtily, &ldquo;but since you are so sure of your daughter&rsquo;s
    innocence, go and persuade my lord of Stowmaries to view it in the same light
    as you do. Transcendent virtue,&rdquo; added Monseigneur, with a scarce perceptible
    curl of his thin lips, &ldquo;is sure to triumph over base calumny. I promise
    you that I will do nothing to fan the flames of my lord&rsquo;s wrath. My
    attitude will be strictly neutral. Go, seek out Lord Stowmaries. Let your
    daughter make a personal appeal. My blessing go with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;M. Legros was dismissed. It had been worse than useless now to try
    and force a prolongation of the interview. Monseigneur&rsquo;s indifference
    might turn at any moment to active opposition. The tailor had made discreet
    if lavish offers of money&mdash;alms or endowments; he would have given his
    entire fortune to see Rose Marie righted. But either my lord of Stowmaries
    had forestalled him, or the matter had become one of graver moment beyond
    the powers of bribery; certain it is that Monseigneur had paid no heed to
    vague suggestions and had severely repressed any more decided offers.</p>
  <p>No wonder, therefore, that despair lay like a heavy weight on the worthy
    tailor&rsquo;s heart, as he made his way slowly along the muddy bank of the
    river, crossed the Pont Neuf and finally turned in the direction of the Rue
    de l&rsquo;Ancienne Com&eacute;die.</p>
  <p>Now as then, a girlish hand opened the door for him, in response to his
    knock; now as then a pair of confiding arms were thrown around his neck.
    But it was a sigh which escaped his throat, and to the sigh there was no
    response from those girlish lips turned grave in sorrow.</p>
  <p>Maman, with unvarying optimism, insisted on hearing a full account of the
    interview with Monseigneur; she weighed every sentence which was faithfully
    reported to her, queried indefatigably and commented with somewhat forced
    cheerfulness on what she heard.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie sat&mdash;silent and absorbed&mdash;at her father&rsquo;s knee.
    She had never harboured any hopes from this long-projected audience; the
    result therefore in no way disappointed her.</p>
  <p>Not even maman knew what went on in the girl&rsquo;s thoughts, nor how complete
    and sudden had been the transformation from the child into the woman. Rose
    Marie, when she returned home with her father on that never-to-be-forgotten
    night in April, had gone to bed tired and submissive. When she rose the next
    morning at her accustomed hour she took up the threads of her former uneventful
    life, just as if they had never been snapped by that strong and treacherous
    hand.</p>
  <p>She studied her music, and delved deeply into her books, she read aloud
    to her father out of holy books, and oft sang to him whilst playing on the
    harpsichord. M. and Mme. Legros oft wondered exactly how much she felt; for
    they loved her far too dearly to be deceived by these attempts at indifference.</p>
  <p>Something of Rose Marie&rsquo;s girlishness had gone from her, never again
    to return, something of the bird-like quality of her voice, something of
    the deer-like spring of her step. The blue eyes were as clear as ever, the
    mouth as perfectly curved, but across the brow lay&mdash;all unseen save
    to doting eyes&mdash;the ineradicable impress of a bitter sorrow.</p>
  <p>But the child never spoke of those three weeks that were past, nor was Michael&rsquo;s
    name ever mentioned within the walls of the old house in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne
    Com&eacute;die. &ldquo;Milor&rdquo; had come and stolen the girl&rsquo;s
    heart and happiness, wrecked the brightness of a home, and sown disgrace
    and shame. And yet to all these three people who should so ardently have
    hated him, his name seemed to have become through the intensity of that grief
    which he had caused, almost sacred in the magnitude of his sin.</p>
  <p>It was as, when to a fanatic, the name of Lucifer becomes as unspeakable
    as that of God.</p>
  <p>The news that the real lord of Stowmaries had appealed to His Holiness for
    leave to contract a fresh marriage had not been long in reaching the tailor&rsquo;s
    house. For the past five months now M. Legros had exhausted every means of
    persuasion and of bribery to obtain an audience of Monseigneur.</p>
  <p>The Archbishop had been overbusy with grave affairs of state, so the wretched
    man was invariably told whenever he tried&mdash;most respectfully&mdash;to
    press his claim for an early audience. It was only after the terrible news
    which came direct from Rome that at last Monseigneur consented to see the
    stricken father.</p>
  <p>Now that interview was over&mdash;on which so many feeble hopes had of a
    truth been built&mdash;His Greatness had been haughty and severe, and the
    only consolation which he had deigned to offer was advice which was indeed
    very hard to follow.</p>
  <p>At the first suggestion, somewhat hesitatingly put forward by Papa Legros
    to his daughter, she rose up in revolt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make appeal to my lord Stowmaries?&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;Never.
    How could Monseigneur suggest such a course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Papa was silent, and even maman sighed and shook her head. Rose Marie had
    gone to the window, and her cheeks aflame now, she was staring out into the
    street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we beggars,&rdquo; she murmured, proudly defiant, &ldquo;that
    we should be bidden to sue for grace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From where she sat, could her vision but have pierced through the forest
    of houses, and thence through the sunlit distance, she might have beheld
    the forest of Cluny, and that silent pool whereon the water lilies reared
    their stately heads. Here she had sat, just by this same window, when with
    bitter words&mdash;cruel in that irresistible appeal which they made to her
    heart&mdash;he had told her about that pool, the lilies stained with mud,
    the slimy weeds that spread and girt the graceful stems, the ineradicable
    smirch of contact with the infamies of this world.</p>
  <p>Even now his captivating voice seemed to ring in her ears. The blaze of
    wrath fled from her cheeks, and the terrible, awful pain gripped her heart
    which she knew would never find solace whilst she lived.</p>
  <p>At the other end of the room her parents were conversing on the ever-present
    topic.</p>
  <p>Maman&rsquo;s hitherto indomitable optimism was at last giving way. She
    had held up bravely throughout these five weary months of waiting, hoping&mdash;almost
    against hope, sometimes&mdash;that everything would come right in one audience
    with Monseigneur.</p>
  <p>With unvarying confidence she waited for the summons for Papa Legros to
    appear before His Greatness; once the Archbishop heard the truth he would
    soon put the matter to rights, and His Holiness himself would see that the
    child was righted in the end.</p>
  <p>But now the long-looked-for audience had taken place, and it was no longer
    any use to disguise the fact that the last glimmer of hope had flickered
    out behind the gilded gates of Monseigneur&rsquo;s palace.</p>
  <p>Maman, too, had felt indignant when first she heard the Archbishop&rsquo;s
    callous advice to Papa Legros. Her mother&rsquo;s heart rebelled at the very
    thought of seeing her child a suppliant; she would not add fuel to the flames
    of outraged pride by showing what she thought on the matter, but when Rose
    Marie rose in revolt with the indignant outcry of &ldquo;Are we beggars?&rdquo; she,
    the mother, quietly went up to her stewpot and kept her own counsels to herself,
    the while she stirred the soup.</p>
  <p>Anon when the first wave of angry rebellion had subsided, when Rose Marie
    sat quiescent by the open window, Maman Legros put down her wooden spoon
    and went up to her husband, putting her heavy, rough hand on his shoulder,
    with a motherly gesture of supreme consolation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Monseigneur is right, Armand,&rdquo; she said with her own
    indomitable philosophy; &ldquo;why not make appeal to Lord Stowmaries, he
    may not be a bad man after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have heard what the child said, M&eacute;lanie,&rdquo; replied
    M. Legros sadly. &ldquo;Are we beggars that we should be bidden to sue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A great sob rose in Rose Marie&rsquo;s throat. It was the sorrow, the humiliation
    of these two dearly-loved folk that was so terrible to bear. They had been
    stricken in what they held most dear, in their integrity and in their child.
    Self-reproach, too, played no small part in their grief, and they had not
    even a memory on which to dwell.</p>
  <p>She&mdash;Rose Marie&mdash;had had her glorious three weeks of perfect happiness,
    before she had known that the man she loved was a liar and a cheat.</p>
  <p>For the sake of those few brief days of unalloyed joy, because of the memory
    of that unclouded happiness, she had endured such an intensity of pain, that
    at times she felt&mdash;nay! hoped that death or madness would end the agony.
    But she had been happy! Remembrance brought an overwhelming shame, but she
    had been happy!</p>
  <p>Sometimes she thought that her whole soul must have become perverted, her
    sense of virtue warped, for bitter as was the pain of it all, she dwelt oft
    and oft in her mind on those three exquisite weeks of perfect happiness.</p>
  <p>Her heart, starved and aching, now lived on that memory. Her ears seemed
    to catch again the timbre of his voice vibrating with passion, her eyes rendered
    dull and heavy with all the unshed tears, seemed, in closing, to see him
    there, standing near her with his arms held ready to enfold her, and that
    burning, ardent look in his dark eyes which had shown her visions of an earthly
    heaven, such as she had never dreamed before.</p>
  <p>Was it wicked to dwell on it all? Sinful, mayhap!&mdash;and surely not chaste,
    for he had lied to her when he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>And then an insidious spirit voice would interrupt this train of thought
    and whisper in her ear: &ldquo;No, he did not lie when he said that he loved
    thee, Rose Marie!&rdquo; and the girl&mdash;just a suffering woman now&mdash;would
    in response feel such an agonizing sense of pain that she cried to God&mdash;to
    the blessed, suffering Lord&mdash;to take her away out of this unbearable
    misery.</p>
  <p>But they&mdash;the dear old folk&mdash;had no such bitter-sweet memories
    on which to dwell, nothing but blank, dull sorrow, with no longer now any
    hope of seeing the load lifted. It would grow heavier and heavier as the
    years went by. Rose Marie had noticed that the streaks of grey on maman&rsquo;s
    smooth hair had become more marked of late, and Papa Legros seldom rose from
    a chair now without leaning heavily on his stick, with one hand, and on the
    arm of the chair with the other.</p>
  <p>Yet maman still strove to be cheerful, even now she said with that new touch
    of philosophy in her which seemed to have taken the place of her former optimism:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, Armand! if the child will not go, we cannot force her,
    poor lamb! but &rsquo;tis not saying that we are beggars and I cannot help
    thinking that Monseigneur may be right in his advice after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Papa Legros sighed and shook his head, staring in mute depression
    straight out before him, Rose Marie rose from the window seat and came close
    to where her parents sat. Kneeling beside the kind father, whose every sigh
    cut into her heart, looking up at those streaks of grey in her mother&rsquo;s
    smooth hair, she said simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are beggars, Father, Mother dear, beggared of happiness, of joy,
    of pride. Father, we&rsquo;ll to England when you will. We&rsquo;ll seek
    out my lord of Stowmaries and make appeal to him, that he may restore to
    us that which in wantonness he hath taken away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The child is right, Armand,&rdquo; said maman, and like a true ph&oelig;nix
    from out the flames, her optimism rose triumphant:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do verily believe,&rdquo; she said cheerfully, the while she surreptitiously
    wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron, &ldquo;I do verily believe that
    the young man when he sees our Rose Marie will repent him of his folly and
    will be joyful to take her to his heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33</b></h2>
  <p>No one&mdash;not even her parents&mdash;knew what the proposed journey cost
    the girl in bitter sense of shame. She had, in order to consent to this pilgrimage
    of humiliation, to put aside all thoughts of her own feelings in the matter.
    She as a sentient, thinking, suffering woman must for awhile cease to be;
    her individuality must sink into nothingness, her pride, alas, must be broken
    on the wheel of her filial affection, crushed out of all desire for rebellion.</p>
  <p>If the dear folk thought that a personal appeal to Lord Stowmaries was a
    possible loophole out of the present abyss of sorrow and disgrace, then she&mdash;Rose
    Marie&mdash;would lend herself to that appeal: and that not as a martyr,
    a saint going to the rack, but as readily, as cheerfully, as if the meeting
    with the man who had despised and discarded her, who had sold her to another
    man, as if seeing him face to face was at least a matter of indifference
    to her.</p>
  <p>Once having made up her mind to the sacrifice, Rose Marie would not allow
    herself to think of it. She set to her little preparations for the journey
    with well-feigned eagerness. Even maman was at times deceived, for the child
    would sing whilst she put a few stitches to the clothes which she was to
    take away.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Only when she was quite alone, or lying awake in the narrow little
    bed in the wall, would that sinful and rebellious pride rise up in arms,
    and Rose Marie would almost have to cling to the woodwork of her bed lest
    she found herself jumping up and rushing to her parents with a frantic cry
    of revolt: &ldquo;I cannot go! I cannot do it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One word of protest from her even at this eleventh hour, and the journey
    would have been abandoned. But she made no protest, and the day for the voyage
    was fixed.</p>
  <p>It was some two or three days before the projected departure that M. Legros,
    going down at his accustomed hour, to see the last of his &rsquo;prenticess
    and cutters ere they left the workshop, found that two strangers were waiting
    to speak with him.</p>
  <p>One of them was not altogether a stranger, for Papa Legros looking&mdash;with
    the keen eyes of a successful business man&mdash;on the unkempt and slouchy
    figure that stood expectantly in the doorway soon made up his mind that he
    had seen the face before. A second look decided the point, and brought back
    with a sharp pang the bitter memory of that gay wedding festivity which the
    advent of this same stranger, then the bearer of a fateful letter, had so
    rudely interrupted.</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye and his companion, a meek-faced young man who looked like a scholar
    very much out at elbows, were kept humbly standing in the doorway, the while
    the &rsquo;prenticess filed out past them, on the close of the working-day.
    We may assume that these rowdy youngsters did not make the two men&rsquo;s
    halt there any too pleasant for them. But Pye had learnt patience in the
    past two months, ever since he had ceased to be the dreaded majordomo in
    a pretty woman&rsquo;s household. He did not understand the gibes aimed at
    him by the impertinent crowd, and the pin-pricks, covert pinches and other
    physical inconveniences to which he was subjected left him passably indifferent.</p>
  <p>As for the young student who accompanied him, he certainly looked well accustomed
    to buffetings from whatever quarter these might descend upon him.</p>
  <p>The two men stood stolidly still, twirling their soft felt hats in their
    hands, never moving from the spot where they had been told to wait until
    such time as Maitre Legros might condescend to speak with them. Maitre Legros
    for the nonce was engaged in counting out his &rsquo;prenticess as they filed
    past him and then out by the door, lest one of them bent on nocturnal mischief
    remained behind in safe concealment until time was ripe for pranks. After
    the &rsquo;prenticess, the cutters and fitters filed out&mdash;more soberly
    for they were older men, but every man as he passed threw a curious look
    at the visitors, more especially at the shaggy, grimy face of Daniel Pye.</p>
  <p>When the last of the crowd of workers had passed out into the street, Papa
    Legros turned to his foreman cutter, who had introduced the strangers into
    the shop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do these men want?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Have they told you
    their business, Master Duval?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; replied the foreman, &ldquo;one of them
    does not understand French, the other one only seems to be here as interpreter.
    The one with the shaggy beard is the principal, he asked for M. Legros with
    great insistence and as he has been here before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;You do recognize him then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have seen his face before, M&rsquo;sieu&mdash;I&rsquo;d take my
    oath on that&mdash;though when that was I could not say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bien, my good Duval, I&rsquo;ll speak to the stranger anon,&rdquo; rejoined
    M. Legros. &ldquo;I shall not require you any more to-day. You may go now.
    I&rsquo;ll lock the back doors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Whilst Duval obeyed, Legros studied the face of his visitor very attentively.
    He had no doubt in his mind that this was the same man who had brought him
    that fateful letter on Rose Marie&rsquo;s wedding day, just an hour after
    the child had gone away with that cruel and treacherous blackguard. Undoubtedly
    the face was very much altered; it had been trim and clean-shaved before,
    now an unkempt beard hid the mouth and jaw. The eyes, too, looked more sunken,
    the nose and forehead more pinched, and a shifty, furtive expression replaced
    the former obsequious manner peculiar to the well-drilled lacquey.</p>
  <p>Obviously this man was the principal in this new affair, and at a curt word
    from M. Legros he came forward into the room with a certain air of sulky
    defiance, the while his companion followed meekly in the rear.</p>
  <p>Papa Legros would have not owned to it for worlds, but as a matter of fact
    his heart was throbbing with anxiety. Instinctively he looked on the shaggy
    figure of Daniel Pye as on a bird of ill-omen. It was through the agency
    of those same grimy hands that the first terrible blow of a crushing misfortune
    had fallen on the tailor and his family. What other misery would this unwelcome
    visitor bring in his train?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have business with me, my masters?&rdquo; asked M. Legros at
    last. He settled himself down resolutely in the high-backed chair, which
    he always used when talking to his inferiors&mdash;but he left the two men
    standing before him; there were no other chairs in the room.</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye had grunted a surly assent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And of what nature is that business?&rdquo; continued M. Legros,
    keeping up an air of haughty indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is of a private nature, Master,&rdquo; here interposed the younger
    of the two men. He was evidently impressed by the great tailor&rsquo;s august
    condescension and spoke timidly with a slight impediment in his speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you may speak of it freely,&rdquo; said M. Legros. &ldquo;No
    one can overhear you. All my men have gone. So I pray you be brief. My time
    is much occupied, and I have none to waste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young student no doubt would have hemmed and hawed very hesitatingly
    for some little while to come. But Daniel Pye, moody and impatient, gave
    him a vigorous nudge in the ribs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go it, Master Clerk,&rdquo; he said gruffly in English. &ldquo;By
    G&mdash;d, man, I am not paying you to toady to this old fool, but to state
    my business clearly before him. Let me tell you that that business will be
    highly welcomed in this house, so there is no cause for this damnable shaking
    of your body, as if you were afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does your friend say to you, sirrah?&rdquo; asked the tailor
    peremptorily, for he did not like this conversation carried on in a language
    which he did not understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He says, my Master,&rdquo; replied the clerk, &ldquo;that I must
    speak up boldly, for his business will be pleasing to your graciousness.
    I am but the poor, ill-paid interpreter, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I pray you interpret both boldly and briefly,&rdquo; interposed
    M. Legros impatiently. &ldquo;What is your friend&rsquo;s business? Out with
    it, quick, before I have you both kicked out of this door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The clerk did not think it necessary to translate the tailor&rsquo;s last
    words into English.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The business concerns my lord the Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx,&rdquo;  he
    began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis none of mine,&rdquo; retorted the tailor coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, but of a truth it is, good Master,&rdquo; rejoined the other
    more boldly, &ldquo;and my friend here, Master Daniel Pye, by name, a worthy
    and independent Englishman, hath journeyed all the way from London to speak
    with you on this business. The noble Earl of Stowmaries hath greatly wronged
    you, sir, and your family. You have suffered great humiliation at his hands.
    Your daughter through his neglect is neither wife nor maid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you, sirrah, will be neither alive nor dead, but near to both
    estates, an you do not hold your tongue,&rdquo; said M. Legros bringing an
    angry fist crashing down on the arm of his chair. &ldquo;Out of my house
    this instant!&mdash;How dare you speak my daughter&rsquo;s name without my
    leave, you dirty paper-scraper, you bundle of quill feathers, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Good M. Legros was choking with wrath but he did fully intend to put his
    threat into execution and to kick these two impertinent rascals out of his
    house. Ere he could recover himself, however, the clerk forcibly egged on
    by Daniel Pye had interposed quietly but firmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, sir, it is my duty to be the mouthpiece of my friend
    who hath come all this way to tell you that God himself hath taken up your
    cause against the great and noble Earl of Stowmaries, whose pride will soon
    be laid in the dust, who will become an abject, cringing creature, dependent
    mayhap on your bounty for subsistence, dispossessed, disinherited, nay worse,
    tried for treason, and hanged, sir, hanged as a traitor! Is not that a glorious
    revenge, sir, for the wrongs which he has done to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, and by the Mass, sirrah,&rdquo; said M. Legros who had recovered
    sufficiently from his blind wrath to be justly indignant at this mealy-mouthed
    harangue, &ldquo;if you do, value your shoulders and if your friend cares
    for his skin, you can have thirty seconds wherein to reach that door, after
    which the toe of my boot and the stout stick in yonder corner shall accelerate
    your footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; protested the clerk, prompted thereto by Daniel Pye, &ldquo;my
    friend here desires to remind you that he was driven away by blows from your
    doors in this like manner just five months ago. Had you given him more ready
    access to your august person, the letter which he bore and which was written
    by my hand at a kind lady&rsquo;s bidding, would have been delivered into
    your hands one hour the earlier, and thus would have averted a misery which
    you yourself would now give your life&rsquo;s blood to undo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words were well chosen. The Huguenot clerk had interpreted Daniel Pye&rsquo;s
    promptings in a manner which could not fail to bear impress on Master Legros&rsquo; mind.
    The shaft had been well aimed. It had struck a vital nerve centre. The tailor,
    feeling the justice of the reproof, curbed his wrath. He was silent for a
    moment or two, while the two men watched and waited.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the touch of a hand which he loved, roused Master Legros from his
    moody incertitude and a girl&rsquo;s voice said with firm decision:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These men are right in what they say, Father. There is no harm in
    hearing what they have to say. If they bring lying news or empty scandal &rsquo;twill
    be ample time then to turn them out of doors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not heard all their impertinent canting harangues, my jewel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard enough to understand that these men have come here to tell
    you of some evil which is about to descend on my lord of Stowmaries, my husband
    before God. That is so, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she turned great inquiring eyes on Daniel Pye and on the clerk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That is so, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My mother and I heard my father&rsquo;s voice raised in anger against
    you. She bade me come down to see what was amiss. The matter which concerns
    my lord of Stowmaries also concerns me, so I pray you tell my father all
    about it in my presence, and have no fear of his wrath, for he will listen
    to you for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, sirrah, an my daughter desires it, I pray you tell your story!&rdquo; rejoined
    Legros. &ldquo;But do so briefly; I&rsquo;ll patiently hear of the evil which
    hath befallen my lord Stowmaries, but will not listen to any impertinent
    comments on his actions past or in the present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell them the whole tale just as you did write it out,&rdquo; whispered
    Daniel Pye to his interpreter. &ldquo;Damn you, sir, how much longer will
    you be about it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then hear me, master tailor, for it began this wise,&rdquo; now said
    the clerk with a great effort at composure. &ldquo;My lord of Stowmaries
    hath a kinsman, one named Michael Kestyon, whom you know, and on whose conduct
    I am not permitted to make comment. Michael hath for years held&mdash;on
    grounds which it would take too long now to explain&mdash;that he and not
    his cousin should own the titles and estates of Stowmaries and Rivaulx. But
    hitherto he hath had no money wherewith to press his claim. The law as administered
    in England is a vastly expensive affair, my master, and Michael Kestyon was
    a poor man, poorer even than I; he was a wastrel and many called him a dissolute
    reprobate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough of Michael Kestyon,&rdquo; interrupted Legros gruffly. &ldquo;Have
    I not told you to be brief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s affairs form part of my tale, Master. You
    must know that he is now passing rich. Many and varied are the rumours as
    to the provenance of his wealth, and many the comments as to the change in
    the man himself. Armed with money Michael Kestyon hath obtained the ear and
    attention of the high dignitaries of the law and the favour of the King himself.
    The fact hath become of public knowledge that only His Majesty&rsquo;s signature
    to a document is needed now to instate Michael Kestyon in the title and dignities
    which are declared to be legally his. My lord of Stowmaries, therefore, is,
    as you see, no longer secure in his position and his wealth, and though you
    may not permit the humble clerk to make comment on the doings of his betters,
    yet Master Daniel Pye hath come all the way from England to bring you this
    news, which must be vastly gratifying to you, whom that same lord of Stowmaries
    had so wantonly injured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye and his mouthpiece both looked at the tailor with marked assurance
    now. Of a truth they were quite confident that the Legros thirsting for revenge
    would receive the news with every sign of exultation. But the master tailor
    was silent and moody, and it was Mademoiselle who spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is this all the news which you, sir, came all the way from England
    to impart to my father?&rdquo; she asked, addressing Daniel Pye in his mother
    tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not altogether all, Mistress,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I have
    better news for you yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anent my lord Stowmaries&rsquo; troubles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, something you will be still more glad to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord of Stowmaries is a Papist&mdash;or&mdash;saving your presence
    he is a Catholic, and Catholics are in bad odour in England just now&mdash;they
    are said to be conspiring to murder the King, and to place the Duke of York
    on the throne&mdash;to sell England to France, and to place the English people
    under the yoke of the Pope of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hath my lord of Stowmaries thus conspired?&rdquo; she asked coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; replied Daniel Pye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean? That you think so is no proof that he hath done
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can soon bring forward the proofs,&rdquo; said Pye with a knowing
    leer directed at her from under his shaggy brows, &ldquo;if you, Mistress,
    will help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rose Marie felt a shudder which was almost one of loathing creeping up her
    spine, at sight of the expression in the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>It told such an infamous tale of base thoughts and desires, of cupidity
    and of triumphant revenge, that her every nerve rebelled against further
    parleyings with such a villain.</p>
  <p>But there was something more than mere feminine curiosity in her wish to
    know something definite of what was really passing in the mind of Daniel
    Pye. That shrewd instinct and sound common sense&mdash;which is the inalienable
    birthright of the French bourgeoisie&mdash;told her that the man would not
    have undertaken the arduous and costly journey from England to France unless
    he had some powerful motive to prompt him thereunto, or&mdash;what was more
    likely still&mdash;some reward to gain.</p>
  <p>The desire to learn the truth of this motive or of this hoped-for gain remained
    therefore paramount in her mind, and she did her best not to give outward
    expression to her sense of repulsion when Daniel Pye drew nearer to her in
    an attempt at confidential familiarity.</p>
  <p>He was far from guessing that his last words had done aught but please this
    wench and her father, both of whom had as serious a grievance against Lord
    Stowmaries as he himself had against Mistress Peyton.</p>
  <p>It had not taken the dismissed serving-man very long to learn the lesson
    of how he could best be revenged on his past mistress. The easiest way to
    hit at the ambitious lady was undoubtedly&mdash;as Master Tongue had pointed
    out to him&mdash;by bringing the man she desired to marry to humiliation
    and ruin. Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s successful claim to the peerage of Stowmaries
    had paved the way for the more complete undoing of my lord, and Daniel Pye
    soon knew the lesson by heart which the informers of Whitefriars had taught
    him.</p>
  <p>Oates was ready with his lies; he and his confederates had soon mustered
    up a goodly array of names of Papist gentlemen against whom these lies could
    most easily be proved. The first spark had been set to the tinder which presently
    would set the whole of England ablaze with the hideous flame of persecution.
    But to make their villainous perjuries more startling, and at the same time
    to obtain better pay for uttering them, they wanted to add to their list
    a few more high-sounding names which would have the additional advantage
    of proving the far-reaching dimensions of the supposed Popish plot. Amongst
    these names that of Stowmaries would be of great moment. Daniel Pye with
    his intimate acquaintance with my lord became a valuable addition to the
    band.</p>
  <p>Soon he was taught to concoct a plausible story; information against Papists
    was being richly rewarded already by the terrorised Ministry and Parliament.
    But Pye, grafting his own wits onto the lesson given, bethought himself of
    the rich tailor over in Paris who surely would not only help him actively
    in the telling of his lies, but also pay him passing well for bringing Lord
    Stowmaries to humiliation and disgrace&mdash;if not to the gallows.</p>
  <p>Tongue&mdash;who had remained Daniel Pye&rsquo;s guide and leader in all
    his villainies&mdash;fully approved of the plan; we may take it that he intended
    to levy a percentage on what the more ignorant peasant would obtain from
    Master Legros.</p>
  <p>It was felt among that vile band of informers that foreign witnesses, especially
    those of French nationality, would be a valuable help to the success of the
    accusations, and to all these men of low and debased mind, it seemed quite
    natural that the tailor&mdash;whose daughter had been the heroine of a public
    scandal brought about by Lord Stowmaries&rsquo; repudiation of her&mdash;would
    out of vengeful malice be only too ready to swear to any falsehood against
    the young man.</p>
  <p>Thus Daniel Pye went over to France, accompanied by the good wishes of an
    infamous crowd. The few pounds which he had saved whilst he was in Mistress
    Peyton&rsquo;s service were rapidly dwindling away. The journey to Paris
    had been expensive, too, and he had therefore much at stake in this interview
    with the tailor, and watched with greedy eyes the face both of Legros and
    of his daughter, now that the latter was silent and that the old man resolutely
    took no part in the conversation.</p>
  <p>Of a truth Legros had been listening moodily to what this uncouth stranger
    was saying, trying to comprehend the drift of all his talk. But the worthy
    tailor had only a very scanty knowledge of the English tongue, only so much
    in fact as enabled him in his business to make himself understood by the
    cloth manufacturers and button makers of England with whom he came in contact.
    Therefore he had only made vague guesses as to what Pye was saying to Rose
    Marie. Once or twice he tried to interpose, but every time his daughter checked
    him with a gesture of firm entreaty, and then a whispered: &ldquo;<i>Ch&eacute;ri</i>,
    allow me to speak with him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now after that first instinctive movement of recoil quickly suppressed,
    Rose Marie, keen to know what ugly schemes were being nurtured in the man&rsquo;s
    brain, feeling, too, that to know might mean the power to avert or to help,
    turned with well-assumed cordiality once more to Daniel Pye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you have more to tell
    me. In what way can I help to prove that my lord of Stowmaries hath conspired
    against the King of England?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You need not do much, Mistress,&rdquo; rejoined Pye confidentially. &ldquo;I
    will do most of the work for you. But I am a poor man and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand. You want some money. You wish to be paid. For what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That sense of repulsion almost overmastered her again. Was she not lending
    herself&mdash;if only with words and with seeming acquiescence&mdash;to some
    abominable infamy? Swiftly her thoughts flew back to the pool of Cluny, the
    water lilies smirched with the slime. How true had been those words he spoke:
    contact with what is depraved, what is mean and base, soils and humiliates
    ineradicably very soon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have come to my father to sell him some information against Lord
    Stowmaries. Is that it?&rdquo; she reiterated impatiently as Daniel Pye was
    somewhat slow in replying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can bring Lord Stowmaries to the gallows, by just saying the word,&rdquo; replied
    the man. &ldquo;I thought Master Legros would wish me to say the word&mdash;that
    he would help a poor man who tried to do him service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord of Stowmaries is not at the mercy of false accusers,&rdquo; she
    said almost involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Papists in England do conspire,&rdquo; retorted Pye phlegmatically, &ldquo;and
    I and my friends know a vast deal of their doings&mdash;Hark &rsquo;ee, Mistress,&rdquo; he
    added, drawing nearer to her, &ldquo;and you too, my master, for methinks
    you understand something of what I say. It is all as simple and as clear
    as daylight. Papists are in very bad odour in England, and the Ministry and
    Parliament are all in blue terror lest the country be sold to France or to
    Rome. Now my friend Titus Oates and some other equally honourable gentlemen
    bethought themselves of a splendid plan whereby we can all render our own
    country a great service by exposing these Papist conspiracies. We are being
    well paid already for any information we get, and information is quite easy
    to obtain. Look at Master Oates! He hath invented a splendid tale whereby
    the Duke of York himself and certainly his secretary&mdash;one Coleman&mdash;and
    a number of others do find themselves in dire trouble. Lord Stowmaries is
    a Papist, too. I know him well. You know him passing well. We can readily
    concoct a famous story between us, which will vastly please the Privy Council
    and Parliament. Lord Stowmaries, I feel sure, would wish to see England Catholic
    like himself. He wishes to see the King put away, and the Duke of York reigning
    in his stead. Well! all that we need do, good Master and Mistress, is to
    write out a statement wherein we all swear that we overheard my lord of Stowmaries
    express a desire to that effect, and the man who did you both so great a
    wrong, the man, Master, who first married your daughter and then cast her
    away from him as if she were of evil fame, will dangle on the gallows to
    your satisfaction and to mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye paused, viewing his two interlocutors with a glance of triumph.
    He had absolutely no doubt in his mind that the rich tailor would within
    the next second or two&mdash;as soon, in fact, as he had recovered from the
    first shock of pleasant surprise, jump up from his chair, and with the impetuous
    fervour peculiar to Frenchmen, throw himself on the breast of his benefactor.
    The transference of a bag full of gold from the pocket of the grateful and
    rich tailor to that of good Master Pye would then be but a matter of time.</p>
  <p>But no such manifestations of joyful excitement occurred, and the expression
    of triumph in the informer&rsquo;s face soon gave place to one of anxiety.</p>
  <p>M. Legros had looked up at his daughter, who stood beside him, pale and
    thoughtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not understood all that this man hath said, my jewel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis as well, Father dear,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for methinks
    you would have thrashed him to within an inch of his life. Nay!&rdquo; she
    added coldly as the Huguenot clerk&mdash;suddenly realising that matters
    were taking a dangerous turn all unbeknown as yet to his companion&mdash;gripped
    the latter&rsquo;s arm and began to talk to him volubly in English, &ldquo;you,
    sir, need not warn your friend. I will tell him, myself, all that he need
    know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miserable perjurer,&rdquo; she continued, now speaking directly to
    Pye,  &ldquo;go out of my father&rsquo;s house forthwith, ere he understands
    more of your villainies and breaks his stick across your back, as he would
    over that of a mad and vicious cur. I have listened to your lies, your evil
    projects, your schemes of villainies only because I wished to know the extent
    of your infamy and gauge the harm which your perjuries might cause. Now,
    with the help of God, I can yet warn him, who though he may have injured
    me, is nevertheless my husband in the sight of Heaven. Your perjuries will
    do you no good&mdash;they will mayhap lead you and your friends to the gallows.
    If there is justice in England your lies will lead you thither. Now you can
    go, ere I myself beg my father to lay his dog-whip across your back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye&rsquo;s surprise was quite boundless. It had never for a moment
    entered his head that the tailor and his family would not join readily in
    any project for the undoing of my lord Stowmaries. He blamed himself for
    having been too precipitate; he would have liked to argue and mayhap to persuade,
    but though he did not understand the French language, he guessed by the expression
    in the master tailor&rsquo;s eyes, as his daughter now spoke with cold decision
    to him, that the moment was not propitious for a prolonged stay in this inhospitable
    house.</p>
  <p>The look of terror on his interpreter&rsquo;s face also warned him that
    a hasty retreat would be the most prudent course; already M. Legros was gripping
    his stick very ominously.</p>
  <p>But by the time the old man had struggled to his feet, Daniel Pye and his
    companion had incontinently fled. They had reached the door, torn it open
    and were out in the street even before M. Legros had time to throw his stick
    after them.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34</b></h2>
  <p>When Legros was alone once more with his daughter he asked for a fuller
    explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish, my jewel, that you had not interfered,&rdquo; he said reproachfully, &ldquo;when
    first I desired to kick those rascals out of doors. My first instinct was
    right, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, but, Father dear,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;I am glad that
    you yielded to me in this. If we had not listened to what these men said,
    we should know nothing of the villainies which they are concocting, and could
    not warn those whom they attack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks that were no concern of ours,&rdquo; retorted her father
    gruffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are proposing to bring false accusations of treason against
    Lord Stowmaries,&rdquo; urged Rose Marie, almost reproachfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what is that to us, my child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Stowmaries is my husband, Father; to-morrow we set out on a
    journey in order to ask him to render me justice&mdash;and this we do on
    Monseigneur&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no obligation on our part to undertake the journey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was none yesterday, Father dear, but there is to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;To-day? Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because to-day we know that Lord Stowmaries&mdash;my husband&mdash;is
    in danger of his life, and that we can, mayhap, give him timely warning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Stowmaries is so little thy husband, child, that even to-day
    when thou thinkest of saving him from these perjurers, he goes about carrying
    in the pocket of his coat the dispensation to repudiate thee, which he hath
    obtained from His Holiness by a misrepresentation of facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as he spoke these harsh words&mdash;and he spoke them roughly, too&mdash;the
    good tailor took his daughter&rsquo;s hand tenderly in his, and stroked it,
    as if to mitigate by this loving touch the cruelty of the words. But the
    child who had been once so yielding and submissive was now an obstinate woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the more reason, Father dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for proving
    to my Lord Stowmaries that he hath deeply wronged me, and that I am worthy
    to be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was wholly unaccustomed to this new phase in his daughter&rsquo;s character.
    She had always been of a meek, gentle disposition, still a child in her expressions
    of loving obedience, in her tender, clinging ways. Now, suddenly she seemed
    to have a will of her own. She it was who had decreed that Monseigneur&rsquo;s
    advice should be followed, she it was now who refused to give up all thoughts
    of the journey.</p>
  <p>Let us confess that worthy M. Legros was now for awaiting events. If the
    rascals spoke true, God Himself had provided a glorious vengeance against
    the dastardly young reprobate who had so ill-used Rose Marie. Papa Legros
    of a truth did not see that she&mdash;the injured wife&mdash;was called upon
    to move a finger in the cause of a man who had paid another to dishonour
    her. There are times and circumstances in life when the meekest of men become
    as ravenous tigers. The kindly tailor had a heart of gold, a simple mind
    and an adoring fondness for his child. He would never have done the meanest
    man any hurt. Yet in this case, and because of the terrible wrong done to
    his Rose Marie, he almost gloated on the thought of the troubles which were
    about to descend on Stowmaries. Vaguely the hope wormed itself into his heart
    that my lord would cease to exist&mdash;painlessly if possible&mdash;still
    that he would cease to be, and then Rose Marie would be free, a child-widow,
    who might yet find happiness in the arms of a good man.</p>
  <p>But not one thought of Michael in all this! Legros himself would not let
    his mind dwell on that reprobate whom he had loved as a son. And Rose Marie?
    Did she perchance, when thinking of her journey to England, feel a vague
    thrill of hope that she might see him there?</p>
  <p>Who shall pry into the secret orchard, the key of which lies hid in a young
    girl&rsquo;s heart. Those who knew Rose Marie both before and after the tragic
    episode of the mock marriage, declared that she had a great desire to see
    Michael Kestyon again.</p>
  <p>If only to tell him that she had not forgiven him&mdash;that she would never
    forgive&mdash;and never, never forget.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35</b></h2>
  <p>And it was in consequence of Monseigneur the Archbishop&rsquo;s advice,
    and of maman&rsquo;s desire that this advice be acted upon, that anon we
    see Master Legros, tailor-in-chief to His Majesty, the King of France, journeying
    with his daughter to England.</p>
  <p>But this was chiefly, too, because of what Daniel Pye, the informer, had
    gone over to Paris to say. Nothing would take it out of Rose Marie&rsquo;s
    head that it was her duty now, if ever, to be loyal to the man who was still
    her husband in the sight of God. He could repudiate her&mdash;if His Holiness
    gave him leave&mdash;but two great wrongs could never make one simple right.</p>
  <p>She, Rose Marie, had no dispensation to break the marriage vows of eighteen
    years ago. She had done no wrong to justify a dissolution of that marriage.
    Her husband was her husband; he was in danger of losing his honour and his
    life. She could at least give him timely warning.</p>
  <p>If she failed in this, her duty, then indeed would she deserve the scorn
    of the world, the repudiation and the disgrace which pertains to the unfaithful
    wife.</p>
  <p>On a beautiful sunny day early in October, Master Legros and his daughter
    first caught sight of the white cliffs of England gleaming beneath the kiss
    of the radiant sun. Rose Marie had sat silently, meditatively, in the prow
    of the boat; she had gazed during the past few hours into that distant horizon
    whereon trembled a heat-laden mist. The titanic band of gilded atoms had
    long hidden from her view the shores of that mysterious country wherein he
    dwelt.</p>
  <p>England to her meant the land where Michael Kestyon lived, and with aching
    eyes and throbbing heart she watched and watched, waiting for that first
    view when the mist would part and reveal to her the soil on which his foot
    was wont to tread. How starved was her heart that even that thought was a
    solace; the sensation of putting her foot down on the selfsame land whereon
    he dwelt was almost a consolation.</p>
  <p>She gazed at the white cliffs like one anhungered, and as the slowly-moving
    boat drew nearer to this new land of promise, the sun slowly setting in the
    west changed with a touch of the fairy wand the white cliffs into gold.</p>
  <p>She thought England beautiful both in the long twilight when mysterious
    veils of grey and mauve soften the outlines of the distant landscape, and
    in the glory of noon when tiny clouds chase one another across a sky of tender
    sapphire blue. She loved the early morning when every blade of grass on the
    crest of the cliffs at Dover was adorned by a tiny brilliant diamond, and
    she loved the midday sun which had drawn the breath of the dew until its
    soul had passed into delicate golden vapours.</p>
  <p>She loved the quaintly-arrayed army of fruit trees in the orchards, the
    tender green of the lawns, the ruddy tints of early autumn which clothed
    the hillside with a brilliant mantle of gold. No! She could not believe that
    in this land of beauty, of peace and of plenty, all men were born traitors,
    all men were liars and thieves of honour.</p>
  <p>Some subtle change came over them, no doubt, and their bravery, their loyalty,
    passed away from them, revealing the devil which had taken possession of
    their soul. She would persist in thinking that Michael, whom she had loved,
    was a different man to the one who stood before her, accused and self-convicted&mdash;more
    shamed than she whom he had wronged.</p>
  <p>Thus her thoughts kept her body alert and she scarcely felt the fatigue
    of that long, lumbering drive on the stage-coach between Dover and London.
    There was so much to see and so much to think on and to plan. The very next
    day her father should seek out my lord of Stowmaries and tell him all that
    was brewing against him. It was surely more than likely that my lord would
    be grateful and in his gratitude strive to undo the mischief which his own
    wantonness had created.</p>
  <p>What this would mean to Rose Marie she had not even dared to ask herself.
    A strong sense of right and of justice and an overwhelming love for her parents
    had prompted her to offer herself a willing sacrifice for their happiness.
    Her own poor heart was already so bruised, so battered, almost broken in
    its agony of sorrow, what mattered a little more humiliation, a few more
    tears, another pang?</p>
  <p>Rose Marie sighed with regret when in the gloaming the stage-coach finally
    left behind it the orchards and green pastures of Kent and rattled over the
    cobblestones of the big city. At seven o&rsquo;clock, with much rattle of
    chains and billets, many shouts from driver and ostler and much champing
    of bits, the big vehicle swung through the gates of the yard at Savage&rsquo;s
    Bell Inn near Lud Gate. Here the tailor and his daughter meant to put up,
    the hostelry having been warmly recommended to him by several business friends
    who travelled to and fro from London to Paris.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;As Rose Marie climbed down from the top of the coach, it seemed to
    her that despite the fast-gathering gloom within the enclosed yard, she could
    recognise the face of Master Daniel Pye among the crowd who were assembled
    to witness the arrival of the coach.</p>
  <p>The face disappeared in the crowd almost as soon as she had recognised it,
    but the brief vision left her with a great sense of satisfaction that obviously
    the journey had not been undertaken in vain. The man had taken the trouble
    to watch and to wait, obviously fearing that his nefarious plans might be
    frustrated by those whom he had hoped to enlist on his side.</p>
  <p>Neither Rose Marie nor good M. Legros slept much that night. The fatigue
    of the journey, the sound of many voices jabbering in a tongue unfamiliar
    to their ear, chased sleep resolutely away. Only toward early morning did
    father and daughter, each in their respective very uncomfortable beds, fall
    into troubled slumber.</p>
  <p>Master Legros dreamt of the morrow&rsquo;s meeting with his lordly son-in-law,
    and Rose Marie fell asleep wondering in what quarter of the great city dwelt
    the man whose very image she would wish to blot out of her memory.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36</b></h2>
  <p>Master Daniel Pye had certainly thought it wiser&mdash;after that precipitous
    exit from the master tailor&rsquo;s house&mdash;to watch and to await events.
    He had been wholly taken by surprise at M. Legros&rsquo; reception of his
    news, and staggered at the thought that where he had sought a patron, or
    at least an ally, he had found an active enemy.</p>
  <p>He soon learned that preparations were being actively pushed forward in
    the house of the Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne Com&eacute;die for the journey of
    the master and his daughter to England. Pye and his interpreter, therefore,
    well-disguised and travelling as the poorest of men in the wake of their
    betters, reached Dover by the same packet boat that had brought the Legros
    hither. While the latter took rest at a small hostelry in the town, awaiting
    the day when a stage-coach would take them to London, Pye made his way straight
    to the great city, using what humble conveyances he contrived to hire for
    some portions of the road.</p>
  <p>The yard of Savage&rsquo;s Bell Inn near Lud Gate was the halting place
    of the stage-coach from Dover, and thither Pye repaired on those afternoons&mdash;three
    days in the week&mdash;when a complement of voyagers from France were expected.
    It was quite simple, and within forty-eight hours Pye found his patience
    rewarded and his worst fears justified. The good tailor had obviously come
    to London in order to warn Lord Stowmaries of the mischief that was brewing
    against him.</p>
  <p>Fortunately Pye had his false information against my lord ready, even before
    he had set out for Paris. His friend, the Huguenot clerk, had writ out the
    deposition in a good round hand, and Daniel Pye had sworn to it before a
    commissioner. All he had to do now was to lodge it with Sir Edmund Berry
    Godfrey, who had already received the sworn depositions of Titus Oates and
    of Tongue.</p>
  <p>Lord Stowmaries&rsquo; name also figured on the Oates indictment as one
    of those who were said to have been present at the famous &ldquo;consult&rdquo; whereat
    the Duke of York was offered the crown of England by the Catholic peers of
    this realm at the express desire of the Pope of Rome.</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye had incontinently sworn to everything that had been asked of
    him. He pretended a close intimacy with my lord of Stowmaries, and was prepared
    to take all the solemn oaths that were required to the effect that he had
    overheard my lord express loudly every kind of treasonable wish&mdash;notably
    that of seeing the king duly poisoned by his physician.</p>
  <p>But for all these false accusations, Pye presently discovered that he could
    only get about &pound;20 as a reward, and that only if the indictment was
    proved on evidence. The commissioners had already told him that in order
    to bring his accusations home it were better that another witness came forward
    to swear to the same story. This is where the help of the French tailor or
    of the wench would have been so useful for&mdash;as luck and his own eagerness
    would have it&mdash;Pye had declared in his original affidavit that he had
    overheard my lord Stowmaries&rsquo; treasonable conversations at a hostelry
    in Paris.</p>
  <p>Pye had thought thereby to give more verisimilitude to his story, and even
    Master Tongue had approved of this plan, when he heard the man declaring
    emphatically that the tailor&rsquo;s daughter would only be too ready to
    swear away the life of the man whom she must hate with all the bitter sense
    of an overwhelming wrong.</p>
  <p>Thus therefore did the accusation stand. Master Daniel Pye had sworn that
    when he was at the hostelry of the &ldquo;Rat Mort,&rdquo; in Paris, on April
    19th of this same year of grace, he had overheard my lord of Stowmaries talking&mdash;with
    one of the ministers of the King of France&mdash;of the terms of a treaty
    whereby the Papist peers of England would acclaim the Duke of York as King
    of England and vassal of the Pope, and receive a subsidy of five million
    livres from King Louis for their pains.</p>
  <p>It was indeed a splendid story. No wonder that Master Pye was over-pleased
    with it; he had added the final touch of apparent truth to it by stating
    that M. Legros&mdash;a French subject&mdash;and his daughter&mdash;the reputed
    and repudiated wife of the accused&mdash;were also present at the &ldquo;Rat
    Mort&rdquo; on that occasion and had also overheard this conversation, and
    would testify as to the verity thereof.</p>
  <p>Imagine the disappointment, the vexation, nay, the grave fears now engendered
    in Master Pye&rsquo;s mind at thought that the tailor and his wench meant
    to frustrate his schemes completely, and not only to throw discredit on the
    elaborate accusation, but even mayhap to prejudice the payment of that meagre
    reward of &pound;20.</p>
  <p>When Master Legros, accompanied by his daughter arrived at the Bell Inn,
    Daniel Pye was at first seized with a mad desire to try and influence them
    yet once again in his own favour. Remember that Pye was little more than
    an uncouth peasant, with just as much knowledge of other people&rsquo;s natures
    as he had gleaned through daily contact with his own underlings.</p>
  <p>He could not get it into his head that the Legros really meant to forego
    the happy sensation of a complete revenge, and half thought that, mayhap,
    they had misunderstood the whole scheme during that stormy interview in the
    back shop, when there was so much talk of stick and of dog-whip, and not
    nearly enough of just reward for a great service rendered.</p>
  <p>At the last moment, however, when Legros had alighted from the coach and
    had somewhat impatiently ordered beds and board, Daniel Pye&rsquo;s heart
    misgave him, and he felt afraid to encounter the irascible little tailor&rsquo;s
    wrath.</p>
  <p>Once more he sought out his friend, the needy and out-at-elbows Huguenot
    clerk, and offered him a shilling to go the next morning to the Bell Inn
    and to watch the Legros&rsquo; movements. Quite a goodly amount of Master
    Pye&rsquo;s savings were now dwindling away in this direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you try and get speech with the tailor,&rdquo; he said to the
    young scribe, &ldquo;and try by your great skill to make him believe that
    you would wish to serve him, seeing that you have quarrelled with me and
    are now penniless. These people must of a truth be friendless and lonely
    in London; who knows but that they may take you as their guide, in which
    case all you need do is to try and prevent by every means in your power that
    they have speech with Lord Stowmaries for the next few days. Once my lord
    is duly arrested on our information, strangers will, of course, have no access
    to him; the trials we know are to be hurried through very quickly and there
    would then be no fear of our losing our just rewards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well schooled in the part which he had to play, the Huguenot clerk duly
    installed himself just outside the gates of the yard of the Bell Inn on the
    following morning, and by ten o&rsquo;clock he had the satisfaction of seeing
    Master Legros obviously bent on obtaining information, and wandering for
    that purpose somewhat disconsolately about the yard, seeing that no one there
    was able to converse with him in his own tongue.</p>
  <p>This was the clerk&rsquo;s opportunity. He slipped through the gate, and
    doffing his soft cap, humbly accosted the foreign gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I be of service, Master?&rdquo; he said in French. &ldquo;I am
    an interpreter by trade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I mistake not,&rdquo; replied the tailor suspiciously, &ldquo;you
    are one of two damned blackguards who came to my house in Paris with some
    lying tale of Papist conspiracy against my lord Stowmaries, some few days
    ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, good Master, I entreat you,&rdquo; quoth the clerk with
    well-feigned alarm, and throwing quick, furtive glances around him; &ldquo;the
    subject is not one which must be discussed aloud just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And why, sirrah, must it not be discussed aloud?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because to call yourself a Papist just now, my Master, is synonymous
    to proclaiming yourself a traitor. Your very life would not be safe in this
    yard. A reign of terror hath set in in England. The peaceful citizens themselves
    go about the streets carrying flails hidden in the pockets of their breeches
    to defend themselves against the Jesuits. Nay, Master, an your business is
    not urgent, I entreat you to return to France, ere you or your daughter come
    to any harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My business with my lord Stowmaries is urgent,&rdquo; said Legros
    with characteristic hot-headed impulsiveness; &ldquo;an you&rsquo;ll direct
    me to his house, there&rsquo;ll be a shilling or mayhap two for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, good Master,&rdquo; ejaculated the clerk
    in an agonised whisper, &ldquo;do not speak that name aloud. My lord is in
    very bad odour. His arrest is imminent and all his friends are like to fare
    as badly as himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the more reason why I should speak with him at once. So now,
    sirrah! Wilt earn that shilling and direct me to his house, or wilt thou
    not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas, kind sir, I am a poor man, a starving man since that traitor,
    Daniel Pye, hath turned against me, seeing that I would not aid him in his
    conspiracies. And I&rsquo;ll gladly earn a shilling, kind sir, and direct
    you to the house of my lord Stowmaries, an you will deign to place yourself
    under my protection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Truly Master Legros had no cause not to accept the clerk&rsquo;s offer.
    However villainous the man&rsquo;s conduct might or might not be, there could
    be no harm in accepting his escort in broad daylight as far as the house
    of my lord of Stowmaries.</p>
  <p>Legros was a complete stranger in the English city, which he thought overwhelmingly
    vast and terribly dirty. He had heard many tales of the plague in London,
    and though this had occurred thirteen years ago, he still thought the place
    infected and mistrusted the hackney coaches and carrying chairs which were
    plying the streets for hire.</p>
  <p>After hurried consultation with his daughter, he decided that no harm could
    come of being escorted by the clerk through the streets of London. The latter
    spoke French and would be vastly useful, and he could easily be dismissed,
    once my Lord Stowmaries&rsquo; house had been reached.</p>
  <p>Good M. Legros was suffering from an unusually severe attack of chronic
    fussiness. He could not have sat still another hour, and was for starting
    immediately for my lord&rsquo;s house. Rose Marie had no reason for wishing
    to put off that interview, the thought of which she abhorred more and more
    strongly as the time for its occurrence drew nigh.</p>
  <p>She was conscious of a desire to get it over, to put finality between the
    inevitable and her own ever-rebellious hopes. For her parents&rsquo; sake
    she wanted to see Lord Stowmaries grateful and yielding; for her own she
    almost wished that he remained obdurate. She would gladly have purchased
    her freedom at the price of more bitter humiliation than she had yet endured,
    yet she had set herself the task of purchasing the content and happiness
    of those she cared for at the price of her freedom and the most bitter of
    all humiliation.</p>
  <p>These contradictory thoughts and wishes fretted her and rendered her nervous
    and agitated. But at her father&rsquo;s bidding, she was ready to make a
    start.</p>
  <p>When Legros once more came down into the courtyard, dressed for the momentous
    visit, and with his daughter on his arm, the Huguenot clerk was nowhere to
    be seen. He soon reappeared, however, almost breathless from fast running,
    but seemingly ready to accompany the distinguished foreign visitors withersoever
    they wished to go.</p>
  <p>He had just had time in the interim to consult with Master Daniel Pye as
    to what had best be done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I do not take that accursed tailor over to my lord Stowmaries,
    some one else will for sure,&rdquo; he said disconsolately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me think for a moment,&rdquo; quoth Pye, with an anxious frown
    on his lowering brow. &ldquo;I understand that the arrest of my lord is imminent&mdash;if
    only we can put off this meddlesome Frenchman for to-day, I do verily believe
    that all will be well. For the nonce you had best tell him that my lord Stowmaries
    is from home, but is expected daily, hourly, to return. Thus we might gain
    twenty-four hours, for you would tell the same tale again in the afternoon&mdash;after
    that your wits should give you counsel. Am I not paying you that they should
    be of service to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus it was that when the clerk arrived breathless in the yard of the Bell
    Inn, where Master Legros was impatiently awaiting him, he excused himself
    for his absence on the grounds that he had&mdash;surely with commendable
    forethought&mdash;taken the precaution to make enquiries as to whether my
    lord of Stowmaries was at home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord&rsquo;s house is some distance from here,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and
    I thought to save you and the fair mistress a fruitless walk through the
    city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;twas mightily officious of you, sirrah?&rdquo; quoth
    the irascible tailor, &ldquo;to meddle with what doth not concern you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zeal in your service prompted me, good master, and as my lord of
    Stowmaries is from home, I have the honour of saving you much fatigue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord is from home, did you say?&rdquo; queried Legros in a tone
    of obvious disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, good master; but his servants expect to see him back to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will find out for ourselves, Father dear, when my lord is expected
    home,&rdquo; here interposed Rose Marie, with her usual quiet air of decision; &ldquo;no
    doubt there are others in London besides this same officious clerk who will
    guide us to his house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We may imagine that at this point the pious young Huguenot formulated an
    inward but very emphatic &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; cursing the interference of
    young damsels and their impatient ways.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Not having his principal to consult with, he was momentarily thrown
    on his own resources of wit and of readiness. This was certainly an occasion
    when the devil should aid those who serve him well. The clerk had only a
    very slight moment of hesitation, then a brilliant idea seemed to strike
    him, for his wizened face brightened up visibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fair Mistress,&rdquo; he said in tones of respectful reproach, &ldquo;far
    be it from me to shirk my duty toward you. An you&rsquo;ll permit me I&rsquo;ll
    escort you to the house of my lord of Stowmaries forthwith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, why so much talking, sirrah,&rdquo; rejoined Papa Legros. &ldquo;March,
    and briskly, too. I have a convenient stick which oft works wonders in making
    laggards walk briskly. Go ahead; my daughter and I will follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37</b></h2>
  <p>After half an hour&rsquo;s continuous walking&mdash;for the roads out of
    London were over-bad after the heavy rains during the past week&mdash;the
    Huguenot clerk, closely followed by Master Legros, who had his daughter on
    his arm, turned into the new parish of Soho, where a number of fine houses
    had been recently erected, and a few more were even now in process of construction.</p>
  <p>The clerk had at first seemed desirous of imparting various scraps of topographical
    information to his compatriots, but to his interesting conversation the tailor
    only responded in curt monosyllables. He still harboured a vague mistrust
    against his guide. The latter part of the walk through the ill-paved, muddy
    and evil-smelling streets of London was therefore accomplished in silence.
    Rose Marie&rsquo;s nerves were tingling with excitement, and she shivered
    beneath her cloak and hood, despite the warmth of this fine summer afternoon.</p>
  <p>Soon the little party came to a halt before a newly-built house, fashioned
    of red brick with a fine portico of stone, richly carved and tall, arched
    windows set in flush with the outside walls and painted in creamy white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here lives my lord of Stowmaries,&rdquo; said the clerk, as without
    waiting for further permission he plied the brass knocker vigorously. &ldquo;Shall
    I ask if he hath come home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;The tailor nodded in assent. He, too, was now getting too excited
    to speak. The next moment a serving-man, dressed in clothes of sober grey,
    opened the front door, and to the clerk&rsquo;s query whether my lord was
    at home, he replied in the affirmative.</p>
  <p>Master Legros and Rose Marie were far too troubled in their minds to notice
    the furnishings and appointments of the house. Rose Marie threw the hood
    back from her face, and asked whether they could speak with my lord forthwith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you tell him, I pray you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that Monsieur
    Legros from Paris desires speech with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Legros dismissed the clerk&mdash;who was eager enough to get away&mdash;by
    bestowing a shilling upon him, and after that he and his daughter followed
    the serving-man through the hall into a small withdrawing room where they
    were bidden to wait.</p>
  <p>A few moments of suspense&mdash;terrible alike to the girl and to the father&mdash;then
    a firm tread on the flagged floor outside; a step that to Rose Marie&rsquo;s
    supersensitive ear sounded strangely, almost weirdly familiar.</p>
  <p>The next moment Michael Kestyon had entered the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have come to speak with me, good M. Legros&mdash;&rdquo; he said
    even as he entered. Then he caught sight of Rose Marie and the words died
    on his lips.</p>
  <p>They looked at one another&mdash;these two who once had been all in all
    one to the other&mdash;parted now by the shadow of that unforgettable wrong.</p>
  <p>Instinctively&mdash;with eye fixed to eye&mdash;each asked the other the
    mute question: &ldquo;Didst suffer as I did?&rdquo; and in the heart of each&mdash;of
    the defiant adventurer, and the unsophisticated girl&mdash;there rose the
    wild, mad thrill, the triumphant, exulting hosanna, at sight of the lines
    of sorrow, so unmistakable, so eloquent on the face so dearly loved.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie saw at once how much Michael had altered&mdash;that tender, motherly
    instinct inseparable from perfect womanhood told her even more than that
    which the sunken eyes and the drawn look in the face so pathetically expressed.</p>
  <p>Yet outwardly he had changed but little; the step&mdash;as he rapidly crossed
    the room&mdash;had been as firm, as elastic as of old; he still carried his
    head high, and his manner&mdash;as of yore&mdash;was easy and gracious. When
    he had first entered, there was even an eager, joyful expression in his face.
    He did not know, you see, that M. Legros&rsquo; visit to him was the result
    of a mistake, the freak of a mischievous clerk. He really thought that the
    good tailor had come here to see him, Michael, and the news had brought almost
    joy to his heart and had accelerated his footsteps as he flew down to greet
    his visitor.</p>
  <p>No, the change was in none of these outward signs. It was the spirit in
    him which had changed. The dark eyes once so full of tenderness had a cold,
    steely look in them now, which was apparent even through the first pleasurable
    greeting. The mouth, too, looked set in its lines; the lips, which ere this
    were ever wont to smile, were now tightly pressed as if for ever controlling
    a sigh or trying to suppress a cry of pain.</p>
  <p>Michael&mdash;with the eyes of a man hungering for love&mdash;gazed on his
    snowdrop and saw the change which the past dark months had wrought on the
    former serenity of her face. And if he had suffered during that time the
    exquisite pangs of mad and hopeless longing, how much more acute did that
    pain seem now that he saw her, looking pale and fragile, almost frightened,
    too, in his presence, cold as she had been ere that mad glad moment when
    he had held her&mdash;a living, loving woman&mdash;in his arms, with the
    hot blood rushing to her cheeks at his whispered words of passion, and the
    light of love kindled in her eyes.</p>
  <p>Can brain of man or of torturing devils conceive aught so cruel as this
    living, breathing embodiment of the might-have-been; this tearing of every
    heart-string in the maddening desire for one more embrace, one last lingering
    kiss, one touch only of hand against hand, one final breath of life&mdash;after
    which, death and peace?</p>
  <p>As in a dream, good Master Legros&rsquo; diffident voice struck on Michael&rsquo;s
    ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was with my lord of Stowmaries that we wished to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And directly after that, Rose Marie&rsquo;s trembling tones, half-choked
    with sobs resolutely suppressed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us go, Father&mdash;we&mdash;we must not stay here&mdash;let
    us go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had drawn close to her father, and was twining her hands round his arm
    trying to drag him away.</p>
  <p>The sad pathos of this appeal&mdash;this clinging to another as if for protection
    and help, whilst he&mdash;Michael&mdash;stood by&mdash;nothing to her, less
    than nothing, a thing to fear, to hate, mayhap, certainly to despise&mdash;struck
    him as with a whip-lash across his aching breast. But it woke him from his
    dream. It brought him back to earth, with senses bruised and temples throbbing,
    his pride of manhood brought down to the dust of a childish desire to keep
    her here in his presence if only for a moment, a second; to hear her speak,
    to look on her, to endure her scorn if need be, only to have her there.</p>
  <p>Therefore, he turned to Papa Legros and almost humbly said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you at least tell me, good Master, if I cannot serve you in
    any way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, you cannot,&rdquo; replied Papa Legros gruffly. &ldquo;I
    would have you believe and know that we came here under a misapprehension.
    A miscreant interpreter brought us hither, though he was bidden to take us
    to the house of Lord Stowmaries. We did not know that this was your house,
    sir, or believe me, we had never entered it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is not my house,&rdquo; rejoined Michael gravely. &ldquo;It
    is that of my mother, who hath left her Kentish village in order to dwell
    with me. For the rest, the misapprehension is most easy of explanation; nor
    is your interpreter so very much to blame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused for the space of a second or two, then fixing steady eyes on the
    face of Rose Marie and throwing his head back with an air that was almost
    defiant in its pride, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You asked to speak with my lord of Stowmaries&mdash;&rsquo;tis I
    who am the lord of Stowmaries now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Legros, somewhat bewildered, stared at him in blank surprise, he
    added more quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not know this, mayhap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;my lord,&rdquo; stammered the tailor, who of a
    truth felt strangely perturbed, &ldquo;we&mdash;that is, I and my daughter
    did not know that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty gave his decision late last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence in the room. It seemed as if Michael
    was anticipating something, waiting for a word from Rose Marie. His very
    attitude was an expectant one; he was leaning forward, and his eyes had sought
    her lips, as if trying to guess what they would utter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the title which you borrowed from your cousin awhile ago, and
    to some purpose, you have now succeeded in filching from him altogether?&rdquo;  said
    the girl coldly.</p>
  <p>If she had the desire to hurt him, she certainly did succeed. Michael did
    not move, but his cheeks, already pale, turned to ashy grey; the eyes sank
    still deeper within their sockets, and in a moment the face looked worn and
    haggard as that of a man with one foot in the grave.</p>
  <p>Then he said slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Mistress; I have filched naught which was not already
    mine, mine and my father&rsquo;s before me. That which I took was my right;
    it is also my mother&rsquo;s, who for years had been left to starve whilst
    another filched from her that which was hers. For her sake did I claim that
    which was mine, because during all those years of starvation, misery and
    degradation&mdash;her misery and mine own degradation&mdash;she kept up her
    faith in me. And also for mine own sake did I claim my right, and in order
    to mend a wrong which, it seems, I had committed. Good Master Legros,&rdquo; he
    added, turning to the vastly bewildered tailor, &ldquo;as Lord of Stowmaries
    I entered your house and, methinks, your heart. Of this I am not ashamed;
    the wrong that I did you is past; the righting thereof will last my lifetime
    and yours. I was Lord Stowmaries then by the word of God&mdash;I am that
    now by the word of the King and Parliament. That which seemed a lie I have
    proved to be true. Will you give me back your daughter, whom the caprice
    of a wanton reprobate would have cast from him, and whom I have justly won,
    by my deeds, by my will, by my crime if you call it so, but whom I have won
    rightfully and whom I would wish to render happy even at the cost of my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gradually, as he spoke, the tone of defiance died out of his voice and only
    pride remained expressed therein&mdash;pride and an infinity of tenderness.
    There was no attempt at mitigating the fault that was past, no desire to
    excuse or to palliate. The man and his sin were inseparable; obviously had
    the sin to be again committed, Michael would have committed it again, with
    the same determination and the same defiance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a man, and what I do, I do. I won you by a trick. I fought for
    your love and won it. Mine enemy put a weapon in my hand. With it I conquered
    him; I conquered Fate and you. Had I been ashamed of the act, I had never
    committed it. I looked sin squarely in the face and took it by its grim hand
    and allowed it to lead me to your feet. To you I never lied; you I do not
    cheat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These thoughts and more were fully expressed in his eyes as they rested
    on Rose Marie, and so subtle is the wave of sympathy that she understood
    every word which he did not utter; she understood them, even though she steeled
    her heart against the insidious whisperings of a drowsy conscience.</p>
  <p>We may well imagine that on the other hand, good M. Legros, though he did
    not altogether grasp the proud sophistries of such a splendid blackguard,
    nevertheless quickly ranged himself against the whole array of all the grim
    virtues. Would you blame him very much if you knew that within the innermost
    recesses of his kindly and simple heart he no longer greatly desired to speak
    with the man whom he had come all the way from Paris to supplicate and to
    warn?</p>
  <p>Was it very wrong, think you, very self-interested on the part of this amiable
    little tailor to be now cursing those very necessities engendered by an ultrasensitive
    sense of loyalty which imposed on him the task of cleaving to that man who
    was now dispossessed, beggared, a most undesirable husband for his beautiful
    daughter?</p>
  <p>Truly the situation, from the point of view of conscience and of decency,
    was a very difficult one. Is it a wonder that the doting father was quite
    unable to grapple with it?</p>
  <p>Here was a man who was a terrible scoundrel, yet a mightily pleasing one
    for all that. He was now rich, of high consideration and power; he professed
    and undoubtedly felt a great and genuine love for Rose Marie. On the other
    hand, the other&mdash;his daughter&rsquo;s rightful lord&mdash;only too ready,
    nay, anxious, to repudiate her&mdash;who truly was a far greater blackguard
    and not nearly such an attractive one&mdash;he was now poor and insignificant&mdash;always
    providing that Michael Kestyon&rsquo;s story was true and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Good M. Legros&rsquo; conscience was having such a tough fight inside him
    that he had to take out his vast, coloured handkerchief and to mop his forehead
    well, for he was literally in a sweat of intense perturbation. He would not
    meet Michael&rsquo;s enquiring eyes, lest the latter should read in his own
    the ready assent which they proclaimed. The worst of the situation was that
    good M. Legros was bound to leave the ultimate decision to his daughter,
    and alas, he knew quite well what that decision would be. And God help them
    all, but he was bound to admit that that decision was the only right one,
    in the sight of the Lord and of all His self-denying and uncomfortably rigid
    saints.</p>
  <p>Even now Rose Marie&rsquo;s clear voice, which had lost all its childlike
    ring of old and all its light tones of joy, broke in on her father&rsquo;s
    meditation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir, or my lord,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;for of a truth I
    know not which you are, meseems you do a cowardly thing by appealing to my
    father. He would only have my earthly welfare in view, and even in this he
    might be mistaken if he thought that my earthly welfare could lie there,
    where there is disloyalty and shameless betrayal. For all your pride, good
    sir, and for all your defiance, you cannot e&rsquo;en persuade yourself that
    what you do is right. As for me, I am a wife&mdash;not yours, my lord&mdash;despite
    the trick wherewith you drew from me an oath at the altar. I swore no love,
    no allegiance to any man save to him whom you have now wholly despoiled and
    beggared&mdash;nay,&rdquo; she added with a look of pride at least as great
    as his own, &ldquo;I need no reminder, sir, that I stand here, a cast-out
    wife, repudiated for no fault of mine own, but through an infamy in which <i>you</i> bore
    the leading hand. But, nevertheless, I am a wife, and as such God hath enjoined
    me to cleave to my husband. Since you have beggared him, I, thank God, can
    still enrich him. Never have I blest my father&rsquo;s wealth so sincerely
    as now, when it can go to proving to a scoffer that there is truth and loyalty
    in women, even when sordid self-interest fights against truth and justice.
    And if all the world, his king and country, turned against my lord, I, his
    wife, good sir, his wife in the sight of God, despite dispensations, despite
    courts of law and decrees of popes or kings, I, his wife, for all that would
    still be ready to serve him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gradually her voice as she spoke had become more steady and also less trenchant;
    there was a quiver of passion in it, the passion of self-sacrifice. And he&mdash;poor
    man&mdash;mistook that warm, vibrating ring in the sweet, tender voice for
    the expression of true love felt for another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not know that you loved him, Rose Marie,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>She bent her head in order to hide the blush which rose to her cheeks at
    his words. Was she thankful that he had misunderstood? Perhaps! For of a
    truth it would make the battle less hard to fight, and would guard against
    defeat. But, nevertheless, two heavy tears rose to her eyes, and strive as
    she might she could not prevent their falling down onto her hands which were
    clasped before her.</p>
  <p>He saw the tears, and heard her murmur:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He who was my lord of Stowmaries is a beggar now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not a beggar,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly, &ldquo;for he is rich
    beyond the dreams of men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good sir&mdash;or&mdash;or my lord,&rdquo; here interposed Papa Legros,
    who was still in a grave state of mental perturbation, &ldquo;you see that
    the decision doth not rest with me&mdash;Heaven help me, but with all your
    fault I would&mdash;somehow&mdash;somehow have entrusted my child in your
    keeping with an easy heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And may God bless you for these words, good Master,&rdquo; said Michael
    fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you see, kind sir&mdash;I mean my lord&mdash;that this cannot
    be. My lord of Stowmaries&mdash;if so be that he is that no longer&mdash;yet
    as lord of Stowmaries he did wed my daughter. She feels&mdash;and rightly,
    too, no doubt&mdash;that she owes fealty to him. God knows but &rsquo;tis
    all very puzzling and I never was a casuist, but she says this is right and
    no doubt it is. It had all been much easier but for this additional grave
    trouble which threatens my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What additional grave trouble? I know of none such,&rdquo; queried
    Michael.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A scoundrel, liar and perjurer hath laid information against my lord,
    that he did conspire against the King of England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay! &rsquo;tis true, good my lord. The damned ruffian came to Paris
    to inform me of all the lies which he meant to tell against Lord Stowmaries,
    hoping that I would be pleased thereat and would reward him for his perjuries.
    I kicked him out of my house, and my daughter and I came to warn my lord
    of the mischief that was brewing against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A frown of deep perplexity darkened Michael&rsquo;s brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good master tailor, I pray you leave me to see my cousin forthwith.
    The trouble, alas, if your information be correct, is graver than even you
    have any idea of. England is mad just now! Terror hath chased away all her
    reason, and, God help her, all her sense of justice. It may be that I shall
    have to arrange that my cousin leave the country as soon as may be. An you
    return to France soon he could travel in your company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would wish to see my lord myself,&rdquo; said Rose Marie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you do not trust me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>She would not reply to his look of reproach. How strange it is when a wave
    of cruelty sweeps over a woman, who otherwise is tender and kind and gentle.
    Rose Marie felt herself quite unable to stifle this longing to wound and
    to hurt, even though her heart ached at sight of the hopeless misery which
    was expressed in Michael&rsquo;s every movement, in the tonelessness of his
    voice, and the drawn look in his face. Who shall probe the secrets of a woman&rsquo;s
    heart, of a woman who has been cheated of a great love even at its birth,
    of a woman who thought that she had reached the utmost pinnacle of happiness
    only to find herself hurled from those giddy heights down, down to an abyss
    of loneliness, of lovelessness, and of bitter, undying memories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The child is unstrung, good my lord,&rdquo; here interposed Papa
    Legros gently. &ldquo;I pray, do not think that we do not trust in you. It
    were better mayhaps that you did see Lord Stowmaries&mdash;er&mdash;your
    cousin&mdash;alas! I know not how to call him now&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll to
    him this afternoon. He can then best tell us what he desires to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, Rose Marie, we had best go now,&rdquo; he added with a pathetic
    sigh, which expressed all the disappointment of his kindly heart.</p>
  <p>He picked up his soft felt hat and with gentle, trembling movement twirled
    it round and round in his hand. Rose Marie drew the hood over her hair and
    prepared to follow him.</p>
  <p>It was all over then! The seconds had flown. She had come and would now
    go again, leaving him mayhap a shade more desolate even than before.</p>
  <p>It was all over, and the darkness of the past months would descend on him
    once more, only that the darkness would be more dense, more unbearable, because
    of this one ray of light&mdash;caused by her presence here for these few
    brief moments.</p>
  <p>Of a truth he had not known until now quite how much he had hoped, during
    these past months whilst he fought his battle with grim and steady vigour,
    winning step by step, until that last final decision of the king, which gave
    him all that he wanted, all that he desired to offer her.</p>
  <p>Now she was going out of his life&mdash;for the second time&mdash;and it
    seemed more irrevocable than that other parting at St. Denis. She was going
    and there would not remain one single tiny spark of hope to light the darkness
    of his despair.</p>
  <p>Nothing would remain, only memory! Memory, on which the tears of Love would
    henceforth for ever be fed. Her words might ring in his ears, her image dwell
    in his mind, but his heart would go on starving, starving, athirst for just
    one tiny remembrance on which to dwell until mercifully it would break at
    last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I not kiss your finger tips once more, Rose Marie?&rdquo; he
    pleaded.</p>
  <p>The words had escaped his lips almost involuntarily. The longing for the
    tiny remembrance had been too strong to be stilled.</p>
  <p>A kiss on her finger tips, one crumb of bread to a man dying of hunger,
    the sponge steeped in water to slake a raging thirst.</p>
  <p>She turned to him. The tears had dried on her cheeks by now, and her eyes
    were seared and aching. She looked on his face, but did not lift her hand.
    Papa Legros, who felt an uncomfortable lump in his throat, busied himself
    with a careful examination of the door handle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will probably be a long farewell,&rdquo; said Michael gently. &ldquo;Will
    you not let me hold your hand just once again, my snowdrop? Nay, not mine,
    but another&rsquo;s&mdash;a king now amongst men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as very slowly, and with eyes fixed straight into his own, she raised
    her hand up to his, he took it, and looked long at each finger tip, tapering
    and delicately tipped with rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See the epicure I am,&rdquo; he said, whilst a quaint smile played
    round the corners of his lips; &ldquo;your little hand rests now in mine.
    I know that I may kiss it, that my lips may linger on each exquisite finger
    tip, until my poor brain, dizzy with joy, will mayhap totter into the land
    of madness. I know that I may kiss this cold little hand&mdash;so cold! I
    know that it will chill my lips&mdash;and still I wait&mdash;for my last
    joy now is anticipation. Nay, do not draw your hand away, my beautiful ice-maid.
    Let me hold it just one little brief while longer. Are we not to be friends
    in the future? Then as a friend may I not hold and kiss your hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could not speak, for sobs which she resolutely suppressed would rise
    in her throat, but she allowed her hand to rest in his; there was some solace
    even in this slight touch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it not strange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that life will go on just
    the same? The birds will sing, the leaves in autumn will wither and will
    fall. Your dear eyes will greet the first swallow when it circles over the
    towers of St. Gervais. Nature will not wear mourning because a miserable
    reprobate is eating out his heart in an agony of the might-have-been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, milor, release my hand,&rdquo; she murmured, for of a
    truth she no longer could bear the strain. &ldquo;My father waits&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the husband whom you love&mdash;nay, he must be a good man since
    God hath loved him so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, Rose Marie&mdash;my rosemary&mdash;&rsquo;tis for remembrance,
    you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tasted the supreme joy to the full&mdash;all the joy that was left to
    him now&mdash;five finger tips, cold against his burning lips, and they trembled
    beneath each kiss. Then she turned and followed her father out of the room.</p>
  <p>For a moment he remained alone, standing there like one drunken or dazed.
    Mechanically his hand went to the inner pocket of his coat and anon he pulled
    out a withered, crumbling bunch of snowdrops, the tiny bouquet which she
    had dropped at his feet that day in Paris, when first he saw her, and her
    blue eyes kindled the flame of a great and overwhelming passion.</p>
  <p>Nay! thou art a man, and of what thou doest, thou art not ashamed; but,
    proud man that thou art, there is thy Master, Love; he rules thee with his
    rod of steel, and if thou sin, beware! for that rod will smite thee &lsquo;til
    thou kneel humbly in the dust, with the weakness of unshed tears shaming
    thy manhood, and with a faded bunch of snowdrops pressed against thy lips,
    to smother a miserable, intensely human cry of awful agony.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38</b></h2>
  <p>The one supreme moment of complete and abject weakness was soon past; it
    had gone by in solitude. No one saw the fall of the defiant reprobate brought
    to the dust by the intensity of his grief. No one but God and triumphant
    Love.</p>
  <p>Within a few minutes Michael had gathered together his scattered senses.
    What avail were tears and the bitter joys of lingering memories when there
    was still so much to do? Of a truth, Rose Marie&rsquo;s firm attitude of
    loyalty towards her rightful husband had not so much astonished Michael,
    for to a man who loves, the adored one necessarily possesses every virtue
    that ever adorned the halo of a saint; but he did not know that she loved
    her husband, and the warmth of her defence of the absent one had, in Michael&rsquo;s
    ears, sounded like the expression of her love. He did not stop to reason,
    to visualize the fact that Rose Marie did not know Stowmaries, that the passion
    in her voice had the ring of tragic despair in it, coupled with the sublime
    ardour of heroic self-sacrifice.</p>
  <p>A man in love never stops to reason. Passion and the dormant seeds of ever-present
    jealousy still the powers of common sense.</p>
  <p>The thought that Rose Marie loved him, the remembrance of that day when
    he had held her in his arms, feeling her young body quivering at his touch,
    seeing her eyes glowing in response to his ardour, her exquisite lips moist
    with the promise of a kiss, these had been his life during the past few months;
    they had been the very breath of his body, the blood in his veins, the strength
  which bore him through all that he had set himself to do.</p>
  <p>The winning of name and estate, and then a reconquering of his snowdrop,
    with a foregone certainty of victory ahead, that had been his existence.</p>
  <p>A foregone certainty of victory! How oft had he exulted at the thought,
    drugging his despair with the intoxicating potion of hope, and now one brief
    word from her and defeat had been more hopeless, more complete than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am his wife,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;his wife in the sight of God;
    his wife despite the infamy in which you bore the leading hand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Michael had thought of everything, had envisaged everything save this: that
    Rose Marie would turn from him, because she loved the other. Loyalty and
    love, love and passion, were all synonymous to the impatient ardour, the
    proud defiance of this splendid blackguard&mdash;splendid in this, that he
    never swerved from the path into which he had once engaged his footsteps,
    never looked back with purposeless longing, and neither cursed Fate nor ever
    gave way to despair.</p>
  <p>Even now, he pulled himself together, and within half an hour of the Legros&rsquo; departure
    from his house he was on his way to see his friend Sir William Jones, the
    Attorney-General, first, and thence to his cousin&rsquo;s house on the outskirts
    of Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>Rupert Kestyon&mdash;by the king&rsquo;s mandate no longer Lord of Stowmaries
    now&mdash;still occupied the same house into which he had made triumphant
    entry some two years ago on the death of the old earl. It was an ancient
    family mansion built a century and a half back, with gigantic and elaborate
    coat of arms carved in stone above the majestic porch. The serving-man who
    in response to Michael&rsquo;s peremptory knocking opened the massive door
    to him, gave no outward sign that so great a change had come, and with appalling
    suddenness, in the fortunes of his master.</p>
  <p>He even addressed Michael as &ldquo;sir&rdquo; and spoke of &ldquo;his lordship&rdquo;  being
    still in his room upstairs.</p>
  <p>Impatiently waving the man aside, Michael threw hat and cloak down in the
    hall, and not waiting to be formally announced he ran quickly up the broad
    staircase. He knew the house well, for in childhood he had oft been in it,
    when his mother, holding him by the hand, came to ask for pecuniary assistance
    from the wealthy kinsman.</p>
  <p>Without hesitation, therefore, Michael went up to the door of the principal
    bedroom and gave an impatient rap with his knuckles on the solid panel.</p>
  <p>A fretful &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; from within invited him to enter.</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon was lying on the monumental four-post bedstead stretched
    out flat on his back and staring moodily into the glowing embers of the wood-fire
    which was burning in the wide-open grate.</p>
  <p>At sight of his cousin he jumped up to a sitting posture; a deep frown of
    anger puckered his brow, and lent to the face a look of savagery. He stared
    at Michael for awhile, more than astonished at this unlooked-for appearance
    of his triumphant enemy; then he blurted out in his overwhelming wrath:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out of my house! Out of my house, you thief&mdash;you &mdash;out
    of here, I say&mdash;the men are still my servants&mdash;and I am still master
    here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put his feet to the ground, and made straightway for the door, but Michael
    intercepted him, and gripping the young man&rsquo;s wrists with his own strong
    fingers, he pushed him gently but firmly back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easy, easy, Coz!&rdquo; he said with kindly firmness; &ldquo;by our
    Lady, but  &rsquo;tis poor policy to harass the harbinger of good news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good news,&rdquo; quoth Rupert, who was boiling over with rage, &ldquo;good
    news from you, who have just robbed me of my inheritance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas an even game, good Coz,&rdquo; retorted Michael good-naturedly. &ldquo;My
    father, my mother and I had all been robbed in the past, and left in a more
    pitiable plight, believe me, than it was ever my intention to leave you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prate not of your intentions, man. You used my money, the money I
    myself did give you, in order to wage war against me, and press a claim which
    you never would have made good but for that money which I gave you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us be fair, good Coz. I offered you the whole of that money back
    on that memorable night in April at the inn of St. Denis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, on a ridiculous condition to which I cared not to agree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The ridiculous condition,&rdquo; said Michael gravely, &ldquo;consisted
    in your acknowledging as your lawful wife, an exquisitely beautiful and virtuous
    lady who already had claim on your loyalty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The exquisitely beautiful lady,&rdquo; retorted Rupert with an ugly
    sneer, &ldquo;had, an I mistake not, already dragged her virtue in the wake
    of your chariot, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, man,&rdquo; said Michael sternly, &ldquo;for you know that
    you lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you attempt to deny that your magnanimous offer at St. Denis
    was made because you were in love with my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not deny it, but what my feelings were in the matter concerned
    no one but myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap, mayhap, but e&rsquo;en you admit, good Coz,&rdquo; quoth
    Rupert with obvious spite, &ldquo;that a wife&rsquo;s conduct&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your wife&rsquo;s conduct, Cousin, is beyond reproach,&rdquo; broke
    in Michael calmly, &ldquo;as you know right full well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardi! Since she is in love with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That, too, is a lie&mdash;She loves no one but you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhaps she told you so?&rdquo; queried the young man, as with a
    yawn of ostentatious indifference he stretched himself out again&mdash;on
    a couch this time, with one booted leg resting on the ground and tapping
    it impatiently, whilst the other kicked savagely at an unoffensive sofa-cushion,
    tearing its silk cover to shreds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; replied Michael calmly, &ldquo;she hath told me so.&rdquo; Then
    as the other broke into a loud, sarcastic laugh, he continued earnestly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Cousin, for what I am about to tell you concerns the whole
    of your future. You are a penniless beggar now&mdash;nay, do not interrupt
    me&mdash;I have well weighed every word which I speak, and have an answer
    for each of your sneers&mdash;you are a penniless beggar&mdash;through no
    fault of your own, mayhap, but I was a beggar, too, through none of mine.
    My mother was left&mdash;almost to starve&mdash;alone in a God-forsaken village.
    For years I kept actual starvation from her by courting wounds in order to
    get blood-money. That has been your fault ever since the old uncle&rsquo;s
    death, Cousin, for you knew that your kinswoman starved, and did naught to
    help her. But that is over, let it pass! I was a wastrel, a reprobate, a
    dissolute blackguard an you will! Had I been a better man than I was, you
    had never dared to offer me money to dishonour a woman. Let that pass too.
    But this I swear before God that I never meant to dishonour the girl. I was
    ready to take her to my heart, to give her all that she asked and more, the
    moment you in your wantonness had cast her off. But she is too proud to take
    anything from me, and wants nothing but her rights. Nay, you must listen
    to me patiently, till I have told you all&mdash;She is loyal to you, with
    heart and soul and body, and hath come to England to beg of you to render
    her justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I not told you, man,&rdquo; here broke in Rupert Kestyon, with
    a blasphemous oath which momentarily drowned the quieter tones of the other
    man, &ldquo;have I not told you that were that accursed tailor and his miserable
    wench to go on their knees to me, I would not have her&mdash;no, a thousand
    times no&mdash;with the last penny left in my pocket I&rsquo;ll obtain the
    decree of nullity, and marry the woman whom I love&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;ll have you, Cousin,&rdquo; quoth Michael drily, &ldquo;now
    that you are a beggar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a moment Rupert was on his feet again, burning with rage, swearing mad
    oaths in his wrath, and clenching his fists with a wild desire to rush at
    Michael and grip him by the throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Coz,&rdquo; said the latter with a smile, &ldquo;let us not
    fight like two brawling villains. My fist is heavier than yours: and if you
    attack me, I should have in defending mine own throat to punish you severely.
    But why should you rage at me; I have come to you with good intent. Think
    you, I would have left you to shift for yourself in this inhospitable world?
    Great God, do I not know what it means to shift for oneself&mdash;the misery,
    the wretchedness, the slow but certain degradation of mind and of body? By
    all the saints, man, I would not condemn mine enemy to such a life as I have
    led these past ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do the tailor&rsquo;s wench no good anyhow by preaching to me,&rdquo;  growled
    Rupert sulkily, feeling somewhat shamed.</p>
  <p>He sat down once more, in an attitude of dejection, resting his elbows on
    his knees and burying his head in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not come to preach,&rdquo; rejoined Michael quietly. &ldquo;A
    blackguard like me hath no right to preach, and a blackguard like you, Cousin,
    is not like to listen. Nay, man, we are quits; we have both of us a pretty
    black mark against us in the book of records up there. &rsquo;Tis nigh on
    a year ago now that you came to me with your proposals. They have had far
    wider reaching consequences than any of us had dreamed of at the time. When
    I made a proposal to you at the inn at St. Denis, you refused my terms peremptorily&mdash;they
    were not sufficiently munificent, it seems, to tempt you to right a great
    wrong. I felt my weakness, then. I had no more to offer than just the return
    of your own money. You were a rich man still and could afford to pay largely
    for the satisfaction of a wanton caprice. But now matters stand differently;
    the money which you so contemptuously flung away at St. Denis hath borne
    royal fruit. I made that money work; I forced it to toil and slave to gain
    my purpose. I have beggared you, Cousin, and made myself powerful and strong,
    not because I hated you, not because I any longer desire dignity and riches,
    but because I wanted to hold in my hand a bribe that would be regal enough
    to tempt you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused awhile, with stern dark eyes fixed on the weak, somewhat feminine
    face before him. Rupert Kestyon&rsquo;s vacillating pupils searched his cousin&rsquo;s
    face, trying to divine his thoughts. He raised his head, and rubbed his eyes,
    like a man wakened from sleep, and stared at Michael as on a man bereft of
    his senses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he stammered in his bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet, &rsquo;tis simple enough,&rdquo; resumed Michael calmly. &ldquo;The
    good tailor whom you despise hath come over from France because he had heard
    rumours that a charge of conspiracy against the king was being brought against
    you by false informers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; murmured Rupert, who at these words had suddenly
    become pale, whilst great beads of perspiration rose upon his forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we know what that means, Cousin.
    Your name amongst those implicated in this so-called Popish plot&mdash;think
    you you&rsquo;ll escape the block? Hath any one escaped it hitherto who hath
    come within the compass of the lies told by that scoundrel Oates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; murmured Rupert Kestyon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is not true? That the information hath been laid against you?
    That, alas, is only too true. A man named Daniel Pye is the informant. It
    seems that his former mistress&mdash;your own liege lady, Coz&mdash;had him
    flogged for theft awhile ago. This has been his idea of revenge on her&mdash;to
    bring you to disgrace or death, he cares not which, so long as the desires
    of her life&mdash;which, it seems, are that she be wedded to you&mdash;are
    frustrated. I have all this from the Attorney-General whom I saw a quarter
    of an hour ago. Nay, there is no doubt that the blackguard hath informed
    against you, and in a vastly circumstantial manner. Come, you are a man,
    Coz,&rdquo; added Michael not unkindly, seeing that Rupert was on the point
    of losing his wits in the face of the awful prospect of this accusation,
    knowing full well its probable terrible consequences, &ldquo;and men in these
    troublous times must know how to look on death in whatever grim guise it
    may appear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But not that,&rdquo; murmured the younger man involuntarily, &ldquo;surely
    not that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; rejoined the other. &ldquo;Have I not told you
    that I was the bearer of good news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good news!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I own it sounds like irony, but, nevertheless, Coz, you&rsquo;ll
    presently see that it is better than it seems. Let me resume, and tell you
    all I know. Daniel Pye hath lodged his information against you. I have it
    directly from Sir William Jones, who in his turn had it from Sir Edmund Berry
    Godfrey. The villainous rogue says that on a certain day in April he was
    at the hostelry of the &lsquo;Rat Mort&rsquo; in Paris, in the company of
    one Legros&mdash;tailor of Paris&mdash;and that there he overheard you talking
    over with one of the ministers of the King of France, a plan whereby Charles
    Rex is to be murdered, the Duke of York to be placed on the English throne,
    and the whole of England sold to France and to Rome. It is one of those impudent
    and dastardly lies which, alas, find ready credence in our poor country just
    now. You remember Stailey&rsquo;s trial on the information of that scoundrel
    Oates, who in spite of his own obvious blunderings and contradictions was
    absolutely believed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Rupert Kestyon with a groan, &ldquo;I
    am undone, I know. Cousin, I must fly the country at once&mdash;I can reach
    Dover to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, that you cannot, Cousin; your arrest is imminent. The warrant
    is out and would take effect the moment you attempted to leave your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But in the name of God, is there no way out?&rdquo; came in tones
    of tragic despair from the unfortunate man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, that there is and a right simple one. The regal bribe, Cousin,&rdquo; said
    Michael with a grim smile, &ldquo;which I promised to offer you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My life&mdash;do you mean my life? You have not the power to save
    my head from the block. If I am arrested and brought to trial on one of these
    infamous charges, the king himself could not save me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the king could not&mdash;but I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On one condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can guess it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The same I put before you at St. Denis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon broke out into a laugh, a harsh, disagreeable laugh of irony
    and of despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Man, the wench would not have me now. Am I not beggared and a fugitive
    from justice? Her father would now be the first to take her from me. She
    married the Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Michael interrupted him, saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after a brief sojourn with her in her old home in Paris you,
    as Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, will bring your wife back as chatelaine
    of Maries Castle, even before the last leaf has fallen from the oak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;&rsquo;tis you who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stay here to meet the charge of high treason and conspiracy preferred
    against the Earl of Stowmaries,&rdquo; said Michael very quietly.</p>
  <p>Like one in a dream, Rupert Kestyon passed a trembling hand over his damp
    forehead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you would&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I not the Earl of Stowmaries?&rdquo; queried the other simply. &ldquo;Was
    I not actually in Paris on that memorable day in April? True, I am not a
    Romanist by religion, but the travesty of justice which, alas, now goes on
    under the guidance of Chief Justice Scroggs, will not ask too many questions
    and will be satisfied as long as it has one more prey to throw to the hungering
    intolerance of the mob. When I am gone, Cousin, you are the rightful heir
    to the title and estates which the king&rsquo;s mandate hath just conferred
    on me. You see how simple it is. It but rests with you to accept or refuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why&mdash;why should you do this?&rdquo; murmured the other,
    whose brain seemed almost reeling with this sudden transition from tragic
    despair to the first glimmer of hope. &ldquo;Why should you give your life&mdash;and&mdash;and
    mayhap die such an awful death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not for love of you, Coz; you may take an oath on that,&rdquo; said
    Michael with a humorous twinkle in his eye and a quick smile which softened
    the former stern expression of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I know that,&rdquo; retorted the other, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis because
    you love her&mdash;my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My head will no longer grace my shoulders when you return with your
    bride to England, Cousin; you have therefore no cause for jealousy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence between the two men now. Rupert was of a truth too dazed
    to understand fully all that his cousin&rsquo;s proposal would mean to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, by the Mass, man!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot accept such
    a sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill not be the first act of cowardice that you&rsquo;ll
    have committed, Cousin. This one will atone for the graver sin of a year
    ago. Take what I offer you. Now that we are both face to face with the problem
    of life or death, we can look back more soberly on the past. We have both
    done an innocent woman an infinite wrong. Fate hath so shuffled the cards
    that we can both atone; after all, methinks that mine is the easier r&ocirc;le.
    It is ofttimes so much simpler to die than to live. Nay, Cousin, your part
    will not be altogether that of a coward, not even though your path in life
    will henceforth be strewn with roses. She loves you purely, loyally, good
    Coz. &rsquo;Tis your duty as a man to render her happy. Above all, think
    not of me. Odd&rsquo;s fish, man, death and I have looked at one another
    very straight many a time before&mdash;we are friends, he and I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But not such a death, Cousin&mdash;and the disgrace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah, even disgrace and I have held one another by the hand ere this.
    And now before I leave you, Coz, your solemn word of honour that you will
    make her happy, for by God!&rdquo; he added more lightly, &ldquo;methinks
    my ghost would haunt you, if ever it saw her in tears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you take my hand, Cousin?&rdquo; asked Rupert in simple response,
    as he somewhat timidly held his hand out to the other man.</p>
  <p>Michael took it without a word and thus at last were the hands of these
    two men clasped for the first time in friendship. Kinsmen by blood, Fate
    and human passions had estranged them from one another; yet it was blood
    that told, else Rupert could not even for a moment&mdash;and despite his
    love of life and joy in living&mdash;have accepted the sacrifice.</p>
  <p>Even now he hesitated. This taking of his cousin&rsquo;s hand, this tacit
    acceptance of another man&rsquo;s life to save his own, wore an ugly look
    of cowardice and of dishonour. Yet the young man was no coward. In open fight
    in a good cause, his valour would have been equal to that of any man, and
    he would on the field of honour have met death, no doubt, with fortitude.
    But what loomed ahead was far different to the glamour, the enthusiasm of
    courting death for honour. It meant disgrace and shame, the trial, the ignominy:
    death dealt by the hand of the executioner in sight of a jeering mob. It
    meant the torture of long imprisonment in a gloomy, filthy prison; it meant
    the ill-usage of warders and menials, insults from the judge, rough handling
    by the crowd. It meant, above all, the supreme disgrace of desecration after
    death, the traitor&rsquo;s head on Tyburn gates, the body thrown to the carrion,
    an ignominy from which even the least superstitious shrank in overwhelming
    horror. Ay, and there was worse shame, more supreme degradation still&mdash;for
    a traitor&rsquo;s death was rendered hideous by every means that the cruelty
    of man could invent.</p>
  <p>This picture stood on one side of Rupert Kestyon&rsquo;s vision, on the
    other was only a hated marriage and the somewhat cowardly acceptance of another
    man&rsquo;s sacrifice.</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon did hesitate, the while the insidious voice of Luxury and
    of Ease whispered sophistries in his ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He does not do this for thee, man, but for the woman whom he loves.
    Why shouldst thou stand in the way of thine own future comfort and peace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The battle was a trying one and whilst it lasted Rupert Kestyon felt unwilling
    to meet his cousin&rsquo;s eyes. Yet had he done so, he would have seen nothing
    in them save expectancy, and from time to time that same humorous twinkle,
    as if the man derived amusement from the conflict which was raging within
    the other&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>As usual under these circumstances, Fate put her lean, sharp-pointed finger
    into this grim pie, and it was the small incident which settled the big issue
    in the end, for even as Rupert stood there, shamed, hesitating, fighting
    the inward battle, there came a timid rap at the door, and a serving-man
    entered, bearing a missive which was tied down with green cord but otherwise
    left unsealed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Rupert Kestyon, who seemed to be descending
    from the stars, in so dazed a manner did he gaze at the man who was handing
    him the letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man hath just brought it, my lord; he said that the message was
    urgent but would not say from whence he came&mdash;he went away down the
    street very quickly as soon as I had taken the letter from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good; you may go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With hands still trembling from recent emotion, Rupert Kestyon, as soon
    as the servant had gone, tore open the missive, on the outside cover of which
    he had at once recognised the ill-formed scrawls which emanated from the
    untutored pen of Mistress Peyton. It was addressed in that same illiterate
    but deeply loved hand to Mister Rupert Kestyon, erstwhile my lord of Stowmaries,
    and began:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;<i>Honord Sir.</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;This is to warn you that the villan Daniel Pye
      hath informed against you, he did make brag of it befor my servants to-day
      saying that you will be arrested for treson and he be thus revenged upon
      me. i think it were best you did not com to my house until this clowd has
    clered away. But i am yr frend always.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lady had signed the missive with her name in full. The hot blood rushed
    to Rupert Kestyon&rsquo;s face, for despite his own natural vanity he could
    not help but see the callous indifference as to his own fate which pierced
    through the fair Julia&rsquo;s carefully-worded warning.</p>
  <p>Without a word, however, he folded the letter and slipped it into the inner
    pocket of his coat. Then he turned once more to his cousin.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there no other way?&rdquo; he asked, whilst the weakness
    of his nature, the vacillation peculiar to his character, was very apparent
    now, in the ever-shifting expression of his face, the pains he took to avoid
    looking Michael quite square in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see none now,&rdquo; rejoined the other. &ldquo;Methinks, Coz,
    that you have received confirmation of what I told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I have. Unless I leave the country to-day I shall be a prisoner
    ere nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Rose Marie, beyond all that we have made her suffer already,
    will be left to mourn for you. To torture a woman then leave her desolate!
    Nay, man, the shame of that were worse than a traitor&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When shall I see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anon, I think. Master Legros is on his way to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll to France to-day, taking my wife with me,&rdquo; said
    Rupert resolutely, &ldquo;and may God guard you, Cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, we&rsquo;ll not ask Him to do that just now,&rdquo; rejoined
    the other with the same quaint smile; &ldquo;rather may He protect her, and
    give her happiness. We both owe her that, methinks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus was the compact sealed. It had of course been a foregone conclusion
    all along, and Michael had never for a moment anticipated that his cousin
    would refuse the sacrifice.</p>
  <p>The great game begun a year ago across the supper table of a tavern and
    in the midst of a drunken orgy, ended here and now. Both the gamblers lost
    all that they had staked. One was losing his self-respect, the woman he loved
    with a capricious passion, the freedom which he had coveted; the other was
    throwing away his all so that a fair-haired girl, the cold ice-maid who had
    no love for him, should still be the only winner in the end.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39</b></h2>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon&mdash;erstwhile styled my lord of Stowmaries and Rivaulx&mdash;turned
    away from his house in Piccadilly with a comparatively light heart.</p>
  <p>Comparatively only, because strive as he might he could not altogether banish
    from his mind the last picture he had of his cousin, standing all alone in
    the gloomy withdrawing room, tall, erect, perfectly cheerful and placid,
    just as if he were awaiting a summons to some festivity rather than to disgrace
    and to death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is best that I should remain here pending the execution of the
    magistrate&rsquo;s warrant,&rdquo; Michael had explained simply. &ldquo;It
    will then be done without confusion of identity or difficulties of any kind.
    The informer will probably not see me until I am on my trial, and, in any
    case, I imagine that he will be just as content to tell his lies against
    me as he would against you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rupert, of a truth, did marvel not a little at his cousin&rsquo;s coolness
    at such a moment; he himself felt a tingling of all his nerves and his faculties
    seemed all numb in face of this terrible crisis through which he was passing.
    He could not really imagine that any man could thus calmly discuss the details
    of his own coming dishonour, of the awful public disgrace, the physical and
    mental agony of a coming trial and of ignominious death. Yet Michael was
    quite serene, even cheerful, and ever and anon a whimsical smile played round
    the corners of his lips when he caught the look of shame, of perturbation
    and renewed hesitancy in the younger man&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>He himself was ever wont to decide quickly for good or ill, to map his course
    of action and never to deviate from it. Many there were who knew Michael
    Kestyon well, and who declared that he had no conscience, no real sense of
    what was right or wrong. That may be so. Certain it is that whatever part
    in life he chose to play, he never paused to think whether morally it was
    right or wrong that he should play it.</p>
  <p>Even now he did not pause to think whether what he was doing was sublime
    or infamous. He gave his honour, his name and his life not in order to right
    a wrong, not in order to atone for a sin which he himself had committed,
    but because his love for Rose Marie transcended every other feeling within
    him, overshadowed every thought. She had told him that her happiness lay
    there where duty and loyalty called. He&mdash;poor fool!&mdash;imagined that
    she loved Rupert, her husband, from a sense of duty mayhap, but loved him
    nevertheless.</p>
  <p>With an accusation of conspiracy threatening that man, an accusation which
    could only find its complement in a traitor&rsquo;s death, Rose Marie could
    not be aught but unhappy. So thought Michael to himself, whereupon the giving
    of name, of honour and of life to the man whom Rose Marie loved, was as natural
    to Michael as to draw his breath.</p>
  <p>The fact that this sacrifice meant dishonour and shame was no pang. Michael
    cared less than naught for public opinion. To himself he would not stand
    disgraced. He had weighed his action, looked at it from every point; had
    in his mind&rsquo;s eye seen the public trial, the ignominious condemnation,
    all the disgrace which pertains to such a death. He had seen it, and decided
    without the slightest hesitation.</p>
  <p>All this Rupert could not of course understand. In this he was different
    to Michael, that he felt poignant remorse for his own action, the while he
    had really not the moral power to reverse his decision. Had the acceptance
    of another man&rsquo;s heroic sacrifice to be done again, he again would
    have accepted it, and again have bitterly repented, hesitated, repented and
    accepted again. He would have understood Michael&rsquo;s attitude better
    if there were any prospect of an admiring world knowing subsequently the
    truth of the sacrifice, of there being a chance of the public recognition
    of the heroism, even after death. But here there was no such prospect. For
    Michael it would be humiliation, and nothing but humiliation, shame and disgrace
    even beyond the grave.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the young man was over-glad when&mdash;the preparations for his
    journey being all complete&mdash;he at last turned his back on the old house
    in Piccadilly. All the servants had been enjoined that if any one came thither
    and asked for my lord of Stowmaries the new and only real lord of Stowmaries
    would receive the visitor, whatever his errand might be. Then Rupert took
    his leave of his cousin; not a word more was said on the subject of the future,
    nor did the young man attempt to express any gratitude. I do not think that
    he felt any in the true sense of the word, and Michael&rsquo;s attitude was
    not one that called forth any outward show of sentiment. An hour later Rupert
    Kestyon had finally turned his steps in the direction of Fleet Street; soon
    he found himself inside the yard of the Bell Inn, asking if he might have
    speech with Master Legros of Paris, lately come to the hostelry.</p>
  <p>There was something almost comical in good Papa Legros&rsquo; expression
    of surprise when he realised who his visitor was. Rupert&rsquo;s face was
    of course unfamiliar to him, and it took him quite a little time to collect
    his thoughts, in view of the happy prospect which this unexpected visit had
    called forth before him.</p>
  <p>His kindly heart, ever prone to see good, even where none existed, quickly
    attributed to this erring sinner the saving clause of loyal repentance. Knowing
    nothing of what had occurred between the cousins, Papa Legros naturally sprang
    to the conclusion that the young man, tardily smitten with remorse, had come
    of his own accord to make reparation, and the worthy tailor was only too
    ready to smooth the path of atonement for him as much as lay in his power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor,&rdquo; he began, as soon as he understood who Rupert was,
    and stretching out a cordial hand to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I am no longer milor now,&rdquo; broke in Rupert Kestyon with
    a slight show of petulance. &ldquo;My Cousin Michael is Lord of Stowmaries
    now. I am only a poor suppliant of high birth and low fortunes who would
    humbly ask if your daughter&mdash;my wife before God&mdash;is still prepared
    to link her fate to mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter, milor&mdash;sir&mdash;will answer herself,&rdquo; rejoined
    the tailor with at least as much dignity as a high-born gentleman would have
    displayed under the like circumstances; then he went to the door, and opening
    it called to Rose Marie.</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon, despite the deep-rooted antagonism which he felt against
    this woman to whom now his future was irrevocably bound, was forced to own
    to himself that Fate tempered her stern decrees with a goodly amount of compensation.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie&rsquo;s beauty was one which sorrow doth not mar; in her case
    it had even enhanced it, by etherealising the childlike contour of the face,
    and giving the liquid blue eyes an expression such as the medi&aelig;val
    artists of old lent to the saints whom they portrayed. She came forward with
    quiet self-possession, through which shone an air of simple confidence and
    of sublime forgiveness. Though she had not expected Rupert&rsquo;s coming,
    yet she showed no surprise, only pleasure that he had so nobly forestalled
    her, and saved her the humiliation of coming to him as a suppliant.</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon was young, and his senses were quickly enflamed at sight
    of so much loveliness, and though inwardly he railed at chance, that had
    not made of this exquisite woman a great lady, yet when she so graciously
    extended her hand to him, he kissed it as deferentially as he would that
    of a duchess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, as soon as she was seated, and he standing
    before her, &ldquo;we are told in the Scriptures that there is more joy in
    Heaven for the conversion of one sinner than for the continued goodness of
    one hundred holy men. It had always struck me ere this that this dictum was
    somewhat unfair on the holy men, but now I have come to be thankful for this
    disposition of Heaven&rsquo;s rejoicings, since you&mdash;who no doubt have
    come straight from there&mdash;will mayhap show some consideration to the
    repentant sinner who hath so miserably wronged you, and who now craves humbly
    for pardon at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was very much pleased with himself for this speech, accompanied as it
    was with pretence of bending the knee. He felt sure that Michael would be
    pleased with him for it, nor did it cost him much to make it, for of a truth
    Rose Marie was exquisitely beautiful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Gad,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, &ldquo;meseems that I am ready
    to fall in love with the wench.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said quietly, meeting with perfect impassiveness
    the sudden gleam of admiration which lit up his eyes, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not
    for me&mdash;your wife&mdash;to judge you or your conduct. The wrong which
    you did to me, I do readily forgive, so be it that my father and mother,
    whom you have wronged as deeply as you did mine own self, are equally ready
    to forget all that is past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An my lord is willing to make amends,&rdquo; said Papa Legros with
    an involuntary sigh. He thought of Michael and how different he had looked
    when first he had wooed Rose Marie; Michael with the handsome proud head,
    the merry smile, the twinkling dark eyes so full of fun at times, at others
    so earnest and so infinitely tender. Papa Legros sighed, even as he felt
    that rectitude was a hard taskmistress, and that &rsquo;twas a vast pity
    Rose Marie was quite such an angel of goodness. But Rupert&rsquo;s impatient
    voice broke in on these thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not persist in calling me my
    lord. My Cousin Michael is and has always been, it seems, the rightful Lord
    of Stowmaries. I am a poor man, now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my father, sir, is rich enough that your poverty need not fret
    you,&rdquo; said Rose Marie quietly. &ldquo;An you&rsquo;ll have me as your
    wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is my duty as well as my pleasure, Madam,&rdquo; he broke in decisively, &ldquo;to
    ask you if you&rsquo;ll permit me to lay my submission at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have but to command me, sir,&rdquo; she rejoined coldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An unfortunate incident, of which I understand you have some inkling,
    will force me to leave England for a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We know that a false charge has been preferred against you, sir,
    and we came to England&mdash;I trust not too late&mdash;to warn you of your
    danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, not too late, Madam; as you see I am still free. I had warnings
    from other quarters yet am equally grateful for your pains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cloud will blow over,&rdquo; she said stiffly. &ldquo;When do
    you propose to go to France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night an it please you, Madam,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Will
    you journey in my company?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you so desire it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose, and with the same calm dignity prepared to go. Rupert&rsquo;s
    glowing eyes followed her graceful movements and dwelt with unconcealed pleasure
    on every line of her young figure, which the somewhat stiff mode of the day
    could not altogether disguise. A warm tinge of colour flew to her cheeks
    when, raising her eyes to his for a moment, she encountered his bold look;
    then when the colour flew as swiftly as it came she looked pale and frail
    as the snowdrops to which Michael had ever loved to compare her.</p>
  <p>But beyond that quick blush, she showed no sign of emotion. Her almost medi&aelig;val
    sense of duty to her husband caused her to accept his every word, his every
    look, without a thought of censure or even of rebellion. She had so schooled
    her sensibilities that they were her slaves, she their absolute mistress&mdash;the
    rigid and mechanical being come into existence from out the ashes of her
    past happy self in order to right the great wrong committed by another.</p>

  <p>Obedient to her lord&rsquo;s mute but peremptory request, she gave him her
    hand, and accepted his kiss as she would have done his scorn, coldly and
    humbly, for her father stood there and watched her, and she would not let
    him see what this interview was costing her in agony of mind, in humiliation
    of her entire soul. For, look you, when she left Paris in order to offer
    herself a willing sacrifice on the altar of filial love, she had steeled
    her pride against her husband&rsquo;s scorn, but not against his capricious
    passion, and now that his boldly admiring glance swept over her face and
    form, she felt a wild, mad longing to flee&mdash;to hide her sorrow which
    had suddenly turned to shame, and to put the whole world between herself
    and the pollution of her husband&rsquo;s kiss.</p>
  <p>Her father&rsquo;s voice recalled her to herself, and even Rupert Kestyon
    had not noted the swiftly-flying look of agony which had momentarily darkened
    her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Papa Legros now, with firmer decision than he had
    hitherto displayed, &ldquo;you see that both my daughter and myself are over-ready
    to forget the past. You are young, sir, and methinks sinned more from thoughtlessness
    than from any love of evil. Rose Marie is ready to follow you, withersoever
    you may command. She is your wife before God, and directly we are in Paris
    we will ask His blessing in confirmation of your union. Monseigneur will
    not refuse to perform the ceremony&mdash;the other, alas, whereat a miscreant
    held my daughter&rsquo;s hand, was but a mockery&mdash;Monseigneur will pass
    it over. &rsquo;Twas he advised me to make a final appeal to your honour,
    and I thank God on my knees, sir, that with you rests the glory of having
    made such noble amends entirely of your own accord. I pray you only&mdash;and
    herein you must forgive a father&rsquo;s anxiety&mdash;I pray you to place
    in my hands the final pledge of your good faith towards my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What may that be, sirrah?&rdquo; quoth Rupert, whilst the first show
    of arrogance suddenly pierced through his borrowed armour of outward deference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The decree of His Holiness the Pope,&rdquo; rejoined the tailor quietly,  &ldquo;annulling
    your marriage with my daughter. An you mean loyally by her you will place
    the mandate in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a second or two only Rupert seemed to hesitate. This simple giving over
    of a paper meant the final surrender of his will, the giving up of all for
    which he had planned and intrigued; the acknowledgment that Fate was stronger
    than his desire, God&rsquo;s decree greater than the schemes of men. That
    mandate once out of his hands, he could never get it back again, nor ever
    obtain another. It was real, tangible finality; therefore did he hesitate,
    but the next moment he had looked once more on Rose Marie, and the natural
    primitive man in him, the shallow nature, the masterful senses, caused him
    to shrug his shoulders in indifference. Bah, one woman after all was as good
    as another; this one loved him in her curious, cold way, and&mdash;-by Gad!&mdash;she
    was d&mdash;d pretty. So Rupert Kestyon delved in the deep pocket of his
    surcoat and drew out therefrom a parchment to which was appended an enormous
    seal that bore the arms and triple crown of His Holiness the Pope.</p>
  <p>This he handed to Papa Legros.</p>
  <p>The latter took it and glanced at its contents; one phrase therein caused
    a dark frown to appear on his brow, and a flash of anger to rush to his cheeks.
    It related to the misconduct of Rose Marie, the daughter of one Armand Legros,
    master tailor of Paris, in consequence of which His Holiness did grant dispensation
    to Rupert Kestyon, Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, to contract a marriage
    with another woman, his former marriage being null and void.</p>
  <p>For a brief moment good Papa Legros hated the young reprobate before him
    with all the strength of which his kind heart was capable; for a moment he
    longed to throw that lying parchment back into the teeth of the miscreant
    who had dared to put an insult on record against the purest saint that had
    ever adorned her sex. The good man&rsquo;s hands shook as they held the paper,
    and during that brief moment Rupert experienced a hideous sensation of fear.
    If Rose Marie rejected him now, would Michael withdraw from the sacrifice
    which he was prepared to make?</p>
  <p>But that anxiety was short-lived. With a deep sigh of resignation, and a
    firm compression of the lips, Master Legros looked the young man straight
    in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is past, is past,&rdquo; he said, as if in answer to the other&rsquo;s
    thought, &ldquo;and I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he did not tear the parchment up, as Rupert had at first thought that
    he meant to do. He folded it up with hands still slightly shaking from the
    inward struggle which had just taken place within his simple soul, and then
    slipped it into the breast pocket of his coat.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter40"></a>Chapter 40</b></h2>
  <p>It was later in the afternoon and Master Legros and his daughter had finished
    their preparations for the return journey. Strangely enough, papa&rsquo;s
    heart was not as glad as it should have been, considering that the object
    of his visit to England had been attained, and that he had reached the pinnacle
    of his desire much more easily than he had ever dared to contemplate, for
    he had reached it without the cost of humiliation to his child or rebuff
    to himself.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the kindly heart was like a dead weight in the good man&rsquo;s
    breast, even though Rose Marie did her best to seem cheerful, talking ever
    of the joy of seeing maman again, and at times quite serenely of her own
    future.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy husband looks kind, Rose Marie,&rdquo; said papa tentatively,
    whilst his eyes, rendered keen through the intensity of his affection, strove
    to pierce through the mask of impassiveness wherewith his child tried to
    hide her thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He also seems greatly to admire thee,&rdquo; he added with an involuntary
    display of paternal pride.</p>
  <p>But has any man&mdash;has even the most devoted of fathers&mdash;ever succeeded
    in reading a woman&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject of another man.</p>

  <p>All that Papa Legros thought at this moment was that Rose Marie looked very
    pale and that a shiver seemed to go through her as if she had the ague. Mayhap
    she was over-tired, certainly she was unstrung. He himself felt uncommonly
    as if he would like to cry.</p>
  <p>In the early part of the afternoon he persuaded Rose Marie to lie awhile
    on her bed and rest. &ldquo;Milor&rdquo;&mdash;for so he still persisted
    in calling Rupert Kestyon in his mind&mdash;would be here at six o&rsquo;clock;
    his coach would then be ready for the journey to Dover. It was now little
    more than three.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie obeyed willingly. She was very tired and she longed to be all
    alone. Papa declared his intention of going out for a walk and of returning
    within an hour.</p>
  <p>A great longing had seized him to see Michael once again. The worthy man
    cursed himself for his folly and for his weakness but he felt that he could
    not go away from England without grasping once more that slender, kindly
    hand, which he once used to look on as that of a dearly-loved son.</p>
  <p>Papa Legros did not see the reason why&mdash;now that all difficulties had
    been duly planed&mdash;he and Michael should not remain friends. He had more
    than a vague suspicion, too, that &ldquo;milor&rsquo;s&rdquo; repentant attitude
    was due to Michael&rsquo;s persuasion.</p>
  <p>Asking his way from the passers-by as he went, he soon found himself once
    again before the house in Soho. But his disappointment was bitter when he
    heard that my lord was from home, and no one knew when he would return.</p>
  <p>Sadder of heart then, Master Legros retraced his steps towards the Bell
    Inn. On the way he had wiped many a tear which had fallen down his cheeks,
    blaming himself severely the while for this display of weakness. But&mdash;strange
    though it may seem&mdash;this failure in seeing Michael and in hearing his
    cheery voice speak the &ldquo;God-speed&rdquo; had weighed the good tailor&rsquo;s
    spirits down with an oppressive weight which seemed almost like a foreboding.</p>
  <p>In the yard of the inn, Master Legros encountered quite a crowd of gaffers.
    Some great excitement seemed to be in the air; they talked volubly to one
    another, with that stolid absence of gesture, that burying of hands in breeches
    pockets which always makes an Englishman&rsquo;s excitement seem so unconvincing
    to the foreign observer. In the centre of the yard, a heavy coach&mdash;a
    note of bright canary yellow in the midst of all the sober greys and drabs
    around&mdash;stood ready, with ostlers at the leaders&rsquo; heads, the horses
    champing their bits and impatiently pawing the cobblestones. The driver,
    with thick coat unbuttoned displaying an expanse of grey woolen shirt, was
    quenching his thirst inside the vehicle; obviously it was not his intention
    to join actively in the babel of voices which went on all round him, although
    the coach itself and the horses seemed special objects of curiosity, since
    a crowd of gaffers surrounded it as closely as the impatient horses themselves
    would allow.</p>
  <p>Master Legros made his way through the crowd, trying to catch a chance phrase
    or so, which might give him the keynote to all this unwonted bustle. The
    words &ldquo;Papist&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrest,&rdquo; which he understood,
    caught his ear repeatedly, also the name &ldquo;Stowmaries,&rdquo; invariably
    accompanied with a loud imprecation.</p>
  <p>Feeling naturally diffident through his want of knowledge of the language,
    he was somewhat timorous of asking questions, but hurried up to his room,
    having bidden the barman downstairs take a bottle of wine and two glasses
    up to his room.</p>
  <p>He found Rose Marie sitting quietly in the armchair, pensive but otherwise
    serene. To the father&rsquo;s anxious eyes it seemed as if she had been crying,
    but she returned his kiss of greeting with clinging fondness, and assured
    him that she felt quite rested and ready for the journey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord&rdquo; had arranged that his coach should take them by night
    journey to Dover, and thence immediately to Calais if the packet-boat was
    plying; for &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; seemed in a vast hurry to get across to
    France as soon as may be, and Rose Marie herself was conscious of a great
    longing to put the sea between herself and this land which called forth so
    many bitter memories.</p>
  <p>When the serving-man brought the wine, Legros asked his daughter to question
    him as to the excitement which reigned in the yard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; explained the man, who was eager enough to talk, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    only the news of the arrest of another of these d&mdash;d Papists. They do
    conspire, you know, to murder the king, and it seems that this time they&rsquo;ve
    arrested another noble lord, no less a person than my lord of Stowmaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord of Stowmaries!&rdquo; ejaculated Legros in utter dismay,
    for he had partly guessed, partly understood, what the man was saying; &ldquo;surely
    it cannot be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When and where did this occur?&rdquo; queried Rose Marie peremptorily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About an hour ago, at his lordship&rsquo;s house in Piccadilly,&rdquo;  replied
    the man. &ldquo;They do say that the miscreant hath confessed, directly he
    saw the musketeers. He was scared, no doubt, and blurted out the truth. By
    the Lord! If the people of England had their way, a man like that should
    be broken on the wheel and the fires of Smithfield should be revived to rid
    the country of such pestilential vermin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fortunately Master Legros did not understand all that the man said, else
    his wrath had known no bounds. As it was he had only a vague idea that the
    man was being insolent, and he shouted an angry command of:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough of this! Get out, sirrah!&rdquo; which the man readily obeyed,
    being over-satisfied that he had annoyed and even frightened these foreign
    Papists, who, no doubt, had come to England only to brew mischief.</p>
  <p>Directly the door had closed behind the serving-man, Rose Marie said decisively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father dear, we must to my husband&rsquo;s house at once, and find
    out what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He seemed to make so light of the danger which threatened him, when
    he was here just now, that I had begun to think that blackguard Daniel Pye
    was naught but a clumsy blackmailer. And yet, milor&mdash;I&mdash;I mean
    our milor&mdash;he thought the matter grave, and went forth very hurriedly
    to warn his kinsman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father dear, I would give anything to have further news,&rdquo; said
    Rose Marie, who was trembling with agitation. &ldquo;Do, I pray you, let
    us go forth and try and find out something more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even as with feverish movements, she began putting on a cloak and hood,
    the door opened and Rupert Kestyon entered. Rose Marie stared at him as if
    she had seen a ghost, and Master Legros murmured in complete bewilderment:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you, my lord&mdash;then, thank God!&mdash;it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is not true?&rdquo; queried the young man, who also seemed labouring
    under grave agitation, for his cheeks were almost grey in colour, and his
    lips twitched painfully as he tried to control the tremor of his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you have been arrested, my lord!&rdquo; said Legros. &ldquo;They
    told us that you had been arrested for treason and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They told you lies, no doubt,&rdquo; broke in Rupert roughly, &ldquo;as
    you see I am safe and sound. The horses are put to,&rdquo; he added with
    obvious want of control over his own impatience. &ldquo;I pray you, Madam,
    to descend as soon as you are ready, and you, too, good Master, and to enter
    the coach without parleying with the crowd. You need have no fear; they will
    not molest you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are ready, milor&mdash;I mean sir,&rdquo; said Papa Legros, who
    was taken with an exceptionally severe attack of his usual fussiness. &ldquo;I
    pray you give your arm to my daughter&mdash;I will follow close on your heels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; it seems, was so agitated that he even forgot his
    good manners, and curtly bidding the others not to linger, he darted out
    of the room, and had even disappeared down the corridor before Rose Marie
    had had time to collect her little bits of hand luggage.</p>
  <p>She went back to the window which gave on the covered balcony that on this
    floor ran all round the house, overlooking the yard. The excitement down
    below was evidently reaching fever pitch; every one was rushing toward the
    gate and the yard itself was for the moment left deserted. Only one ostler
    remained at the horses&rsquo; heads, and his head, too, was turned in the
    direction of the gates. The driver had emerged from the depths of the vehicle
    and together with his mate was hoisting the Legros&rsquo; luggage into the
    boot. He, too, however, craned his neck from time to time, trying to see
    beyond the dense knot of human heads which totally obstructed both the view
    and the passage out into Fleet Street.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie, feeling still strangely perturbed, her heart beating with a
    nameless fear, which she could not herself understand, threw open the window
    and stepped out onto the balcony. Rupert Kestyon was standing just below,
    giving impatient directions to his men anent the disposition of the luggage.
    The sound of the opening window and of Rose Marie&rsquo;s footsteps above,
    caused him to look up and at sight of her he uttered a loud oath. It was
    evident that he had completely lost all control over himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have run it too late, d&mdash;n you!&rdquo; he shouted roughly. &ldquo;Now
    we cannot get through Fleet Street till after that accursed mob hath dispersed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rose Marie with lips compressed and brows closely puckered withdrew out
    of his sight, blushing with shame at the thought that a group of serving-girls
    who stood also on the balcony not far from her, giggling and chattering,
    should have heard her husband&rsquo;s rough words.</p>
  <p>But the wenches were evidently too much engrossed with their desire to see
    something of what was going on beyond the hostelry gates to pay much heed
    to the pale, foreign miss and to her doings, and even as Rose Marie prepared
    once more to join her father, she heard one girl say excitedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be passing by for another few minutes&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
    have time to run to the gates&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! Cannot you hear the shouts? They are bringing him along now,&rdquo; cried
    another, holding with both hands to the iron railing, the while her companion
    tried to drag her away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can just see over the heads of the crowd,&rdquo; said an other. &ldquo;Here
    they come! Here they come! Can you hear them all hooting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she herself indulged in a vicious &ldquo;Boo! Down with the traitor!
    Down with the Papists!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beyond the gates, the crowd, invisible to Rose Marie, was evidently giving
    vent to its excitement. As the wench had said, they were hooting lustily.
    Shouts of &ldquo;Death to the traitors!&rdquo; mingled with obvious cries
    of terror and of pain following immediately on the clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs
    on the mud-covered street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a closed vehicle!&rdquo; said one of the girls on the
    balcony in obvious disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t see even that with all that pack of soldiery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Boo! Boo! Death to the Papist!&rdquo; screamed the other girls in
    unison.</p>
  <p>Just for a moment then in the small space between the top of the archway,
    and above the heads of the crowd, Rose Marie caught sight of a closed hackney
    coach, being driven at slow pace and surrounded by an escort of musketeers.
    The hooting, hissing, and other expressions of hatred and opprobrium became
    almost deafening for the moment, and through the shouts of &ldquo;The rope,
    the rack, the stake for the Papists!&rdquo; could distinctly be heard the
    name,  &ldquo;Stowmaries!&rdquo; accompanied by loud imprecations, whilst
    a shower of evil-smelling refuse was hurled at the vehicle by the enthusiastic
    staff of the Bell Inn, congregated at its gates.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie felt sick with horror. Gradually that fear which had hitherto
    been nameless, gained more tangible shape. She peeped down again and saw
    that her husband had taken refuge inside his coach.</p>
  <p>Then she understood.</p>

  <p>It was Michael who had been arrested&mdash;the only Lord of Stowmaries,
    as he himself had proudly said awhile ago.</p>
  <p>Did some inkling of the real truth of the case rise in her heart then and
    there, it were difficult to say. There is a strange telepathy which exists
    in nature and which warns the sensitive mind of the danger, the misfortune
    of another being. It was only a purely natural, human instinct which prompted
    her to ask the serving-wenches a final question, the answer to which she
    knew already.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is all the excitement about?&rdquo; she asked, turning to the
    group of girls and steadying her voice as much as she could. &ldquo;Who is
    it they are taking past in that closed carriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord of Stowmaries, Mistress,&rdquo; said one of the girls. &ldquo;He
    is one of the Papists that do conspire against the king. He&rsquo;ll hang
    for sure&mdash;I wish they&rsquo;d burn the lot as they did in the olden
    days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;tis my lord Stowmaries&rsquo; coach that is standing here
    below,&rdquo;  said Rose Marie; &ldquo;he is safe and sound within.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I know naught about that,&rdquo; quoth the girl decisively; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    my lord Stowmaries they are taking to prison sure enough, and &rsquo;twill
    be my lord of Stowmaries&rsquo; head that&rsquo;ll be on Tyburn gate before
    many days are over, and I for one&rsquo;ll go to see him beheaded, if I can
    get a holiday on that day.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter41"></a>Chapter 41</b></h2>
  <p>Rose Marie had told her father all that she feared, all that she, alas,
    knew to be true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot go now, Father dear,&rdquo; she said with quivering voice,
    whilst her eyes burning with hot tears, looked down appealingly at her father, &ldquo;we
    must surely hear what becomes of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my child,&rdquo; said Papa Legros with a heavy sigh, &ldquo;what
    can we do by remaining here? Your duty is to your husband. No doubt he, too,
    fears for his life, and would wish to leave this country ere suspicion fall
    upon him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Father, methinks you do not understand. I know not if there hath
    been conspiracy or not, but this I do know, that the charge was preferred
    against my husband. Then why is my lord arrested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know not, my jewel,&rdquo; replied Papa Legros, deeply perplexed
    and miserable. &ldquo;England seems to be a queer country just now. Mayhap
    all these gentlemen do conspire. God knows there always have been many conspiracies
    against our own most high and most Catholic King Louis, the ever victorious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Master Legros doffed his felt hat in token of deep respect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy husband waits, child,&rdquo; added the worthy man resignedly; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    him thou must obey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as he spoke, Rupert&rsquo;s steps were heard once more along the corridor.
    He entered, still looking miserably anxious, but at sight of Rose Marie a
    blush of shame-facedness overspread his pale cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Mistress,&rdquo; he said, striving to speak quietly, &ldquo;methinks
    the coast is clear now. Will you deign to descend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He offered Rose Marie his arm. She felt like some wild creature trapped,
    looking round her with wild, terrified eyes as if for a means of escape.
    Her father gave her an appealing look, and Rupert reiterated his request
    with more distinct command in his tone. His eyes, wherein wrath, fear, and
    a certain look of shame were obviously fighting for mastery, seemed to dare
    her to disobey. He was her master after all, and a master of her own choosing.
    The bars of that cage against which she would henceforth for ever bruise
    her heart were fashioned by her own hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, Mistress, I wait,&rdquo; said Rupert, and with a gesture which
    was almost rough in its peremptoriness, he took her hand and slipped it under
    his arm.</p>
  <p>Papa Legros gathered the sundry small bags and parcels which formed his
    own and his daughter&rsquo;s hand luggage, and then he followed the young
    couple out of the room.</p>
  <p>But Rose Marie once across the threshold and in the corridor soon disengaged
    her arm. This masterful appropriation of her person and of her will caused
    her an instinctive pang of fear. Good God! Was she going to hate this man
    whom through an impulse of loyalty and righteousness she had openly acknowledged
    as her lord, and to whom she almost wilfully had surrendered her whole young
    life, her hopes of happiness, her every thought and wish? Now with every
    look of unfettered admiration, with every word of command, he roused her
    numbed spirits into rebellion. Even now she could not bear to take his arm,
    she could not bear the touch of his hand on hers as he began to lead her
    along the corridor, as if already she were part of his goods and chattels,
    the obedient servant of his caprice.</p>
  <p>When she withdrew her hand from his, he looked inquiringly on her face,
    then realising her motive, guessing her repugnance, he laughed a forced,
    ironical laugh and said with obvious intent to wound:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Madam! I&rsquo;m vastly sorry that even in this dark passage
    you cannot fancy that I am my cousin Michael. But you made your choice yourself &rsquo;twixt
    him and me, and therefore pray understand that &rsquo;tis too late to repent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He walked, however, on ahead, keeping a little in front of her, and soon
    reached the door which gave on the yard.</p>
  <p>His coach stood there all in readiness, the driver on the box holding the
    ribbons, the groom standing by the carriage holding open the door. But between
    the coach and the door through which Rupert with Rose Marie and Papa Legros
    had just stepped forth into the yard, there stood a group composed of three
    musketeers, one of whom was a little in advance of the others, and apparently
    in command.</p>
  <p>Master Savage, landlord of the Bell Inn, was in close and voluble converse
    with the soldier, as Rupert with a peremptory voice called to his own driver
    to pull up a little closer.</p>
  <p>At the sound, Master Savage turned, and the musketeer now came up to the
    little party in the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which of you two gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, looking from Rupert Kestyon
    to Master Legros, &ldquo;is Master Legros, tailor-in-chief to His Majesty
    the King of France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Papa Legros, hearing his name thus mentioned, instinctively stepped forward,
    more fussy than ever, poor man, wondering indeed if some fresh misfortune
    was not coming his way. Rupert, pale to the lips, stood mutely staring at
    the musketeer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By order of His Majesty the King!&rdquo; resumed the soldier now
    addressing Legros, and presenting a paper to him, which the worthy tailor,
    hopelessly bewildered and not a little frightened, now took from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My orders are to intimate to Master Legros, tailor-in-chief to His
    Majesty the King of France, that he is not to leave his present place of
    abode without express permission from the Lord Chief Justice of England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Qu&rsquo;est ce qu&rsquo;il dit?&rdquo; queried Papa Legros, turning
    helplessly toward his daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That we may not leave England just now,&rdquo; she said, feeling
    not a little bewildered, too, for this was so unexpected. &ldquo;Let me see
    that paper, Father dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rupert, whom this incident had thrown into a well-nigh unbearable state
    of fear, had kept silent all this while, longing yet not daring to question
    the officer closer. But the latter seemed in no way concerned with him, his
    errand was apparently solely confined to these peremptory orders to Master
    Legros.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie read the paper through, then she looked inquiringly on Rupert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are we to do, sir,&rdquo; she asked coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have no option,&rdquo; he said, as he took hold of her wrist
    and quietly drew her back under the shadow of the doorway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no doubt,&rdquo; he continued in an agitated whisper, &ldquo;that
    if your father attempts to disobey the order, he would be stopped more forcibly,
    and his situation would then become more uncomfortable. Does this paper state
    on what grounds your father is thus forbidden to go away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied calmly; &ldquo;it says that by order of the
    king, Master Legros, tailor of Paris, is required to give evidence on behalf
    of the Crown in the forthcoming trial of the Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx,
    for conspiracy and treason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is summoned as a witness. He has no option&mdash;he must stay&mdash;they
    would stop him if he attempted to go,&rdquo; reiterated Rupert Kestyon, whose
    trembling voice scarce contrived to pass from his dry throat through his
    parched lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then with your permission,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;I will stay
    with my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; he said hurriedly.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie bent her head in token of farewell. She felt more like a puppet
    moving and acting mechanically than like a sentient woman. She suffered such
    an agony of mind and heart at thought of what had occurred, what she visualized
    and what she guessed, that the mere act of speaking and of moving seemed
    no part of her present existence. She was called upon to act and to decide
    for herself and for her father&mdash;but as Rupert Kestyon very properly
    said, there was no option. Nor had Rose Marie anything to fear for her father;
    it was difficult for her to imagine how the present situation had come about,
    and why the King of England should desire Master Legros to be a witness for
    the Crown against the Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, accused of conspiracy
    and treason, nor did she quite understand what being a witness for the Crown
    really meant, but for her own part she was conscious of an intense sense
    of relief when she saw Rupert Kestyon&mdash;her husband&mdash;turning on
    his heel, and without looking either to right or left, making his way somewhat
    hurriedly to his coach.</p>
  <p>She went back to her father&rsquo;s side, and taking his arm in order to
    assure him that all was well, she turned to the musketeer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;are there any further orders
    which you have to transmit to my father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mistress, none,&rdquo; replied the soldier. &ldquo;Your father
    must understand that he is free to come and go as he pleases, so long as
    he remains in the city. Strong measures would only be taken if he attempted
    to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father understands all that, sir,&rdquo; she said with a haughty
    little toss of the head; &ldquo;though we are strangers, we respect the laws
    of your country just as we in France would expect you to respect ours. My
    father understands the order as set forth in this paper, and he will not
    leave this city until His Majesty the King of England hath no longer any
    need of his services. Come, Father dear,&rdquo; she whispered, in her own
    mother tongue and with gentle pressure trying to lead the good man away, &ldquo;I
    will explain everything to you when we are alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But thy husband, child!&rdquo; urged Papa Legros, whose bewilderment
    had reached its veriest climax. &ldquo;Thy husband!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without giving direct reply, Rose Marie pointed to the coach, just ahead
    of them both, in the middle of the yard. Papa Legros, following his daughter&rsquo;s
    glance, saw Rupert Kestyon in the act of stepping into the carriage, and
    the groom closing the door in after him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He goes to France without us, Father dear,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>And for the first time for many days now, a real smile lit up the girl&rsquo;s
    eyes, and chased away the miserable, haggard look from her young face.</p>
  <p>She bowed graciously to the musketeer officer, who saluted her with utmost
    deference. Then she led her father away. The soldier&rsquo;s eyes followed
    her graceful form with undisguised admiration. At the door she turned back
    and gave him a final little bow of farewell.</p>
  <p>For Rose Marie in the midst of her great sorrow and of her agonizing fear,
    looked on that young musketeer as a deliverer and was grateful to him, too,
    for the good news which he had brought.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter42"></a>Chapter 42</b></h2>
  <p>That same afternoon, and at about the same time as Rupert Kestyon&rsquo;s
    coach swung out of the gates of the Bell yard, Sir John Ayloffe presented
    himself at his kinswoman&rsquo;s house in Holborn Row.</p>
  <p>He had come in answer to an urgent and peremptory summons, and had made
    all haste, seeing that he had just heard the news that it was Michael Kestyon
    who had been arrested for treason, and not the fair Julia&rsquo;s erstwhile
    faithful adorer, Rupert. Visions of that exceedingly pleasant &pound;12,000
    which he had thought were lost to him for ever when Michael obtained the
    peerage of Stowmaries, once more rose before his mind&rsquo;s eye, surrounded
    with the golden halo of anticipatory hope.</p>
  <p>Of a truth, if Michael was condemned and executed for treason&mdash;and
    there was but little doubt of that, taking the temper of Parliament and people
    on the subject of the hellish Popish plots&mdash;then young Rupert would
    come into his own again very quickly and there was no reason why the pleasing
    scheme of the fair Julia&rsquo;s marriage with her faithful admirer should
    not reach success after all.</p>
  <p>To Cousin John&rsquo;s supreme astonishment, however, instead of finding
    his beautiful cousin in gleeful excitement at the good news, he saw her lying
    on a sofa in her tiny boudoir with her fair head buried in billows of lace
    cushions, and on the verge of hysterics.</p>
  <p>She was clutching a letter in her hand, and when Cousin John approached
    her, with that diffidence peculiar to the male creature in face of feminine
    tears, she held out the paper mutely towards him.</p>
  <p>It was a letter signed Rupert Kestyon. Cousin John quickly ran his eye over
    its contents. In flowery and elegant language and with many reproaches directed
    at the cruel beauty who that very morning had struck him to the heart at
    a moment when she believed him to be in the most dire distress, the writer
    explained that Fate would now part him from his beautiful Julia for ever:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I go to France this night,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;with the wife
    whom God gave me eighteen years ago, and to whom I now see that &rsquo;tis
    my duty to cleave. You, I feel, did never love me, else you had not sent
    me that cruel message this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was his Julia&rsquo;s adoring and ever-faithful servant, but there was
    no mistaking the tone of the letter: he was leaving her for good and all.</p>
  <p>Silently Cousin John folded up the letter and handed it back to his cousin.
    There was nothing more to be said. He could only console and even in this
    he was unsuccessful, for his own heart was heavy at thought of that  &pound;12,000
    which now could never be his.</p>
  <p>Mistress Peyton had by the selfishness of her own ambition allowed the trump
    card in the great gamble of life to slip through her dainty fingers. The
    incident was closed; the tailor&rsquo;s wench had won the stakes in the end.</p>
  <p>No wonder that Julia fell into hysterics; indeed, indeed, Fate&rsquo;s irony
    had been over-cruel. It seemed as if every one of her schemes turned wantonly
    to a weapon against her most cherished desires.</p>
  <p>Cousin John was vastly puzzled. He could not understand what had induced
    Rupert to make amends to the wife in order to repudiate whom he had spent
    a fortune, and lost his all. But when, anon, he heard through public news-criers
    that Michael had confessed to the charge preferred against him, and when
    his keen mind began to think over in detail the various events in connection
    with the arrest, he arrived at a pretty shrewd guess as to what had occurred
    between the cousins. Remembering the incidents of that memorable evening
    at St. Denis and Michael&rsquo;s offer to Stowmaries then, he bethought himself
    that men who are great blackguards are capable of strange things when they
    love a woman. Whereupon good Sir John shook his head and ceased his wanderings
    in the realms of conjecture, for he had come across a psychological problem
    which passed his understanding.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter43"></a>Chapter 43</b></h2>
  <p>Daniel Pye on that selfsame memorable day was literally floating in a blissful
    atmosphere of delight.</p>
  <p>My lord of Stowmaries had not only been arrested but he had confessed to
    his guilt; a matter which at first had greatly surprised Master Pye, who
    had been at great pains to concoct an elaborate lie, only to find through
    some mysterious accident of Fortune, he must have hit upon the truth.</p>
  <p>Of course he did not realise as yet that the man who had been arrested and
    who had confessed was not the former suitor for Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s hand.
    He had only heard some pleasant rumours anent the reward which he would get
    as soon as conviction was obtained against the accused. Many spoke of fifty
    pounds, others that his reward would be as great as that given to Master
    Oates: a substantial pension and comfortable lodgings in one of the king&rsquo;s
    houses.</p>
  <p>But the thought of Mistress Peyton&rsquo;s miserable condition of vain regrets
    and bitter disappointment the while her lover lingered in the Tower, pleased
    Master Pye as much as that of his own good fortune, nor could he resist the
    desire to brag of his prowess to those very menials who had witnessed his
    downfall. There would be no great pleasure in the discomfiture of Mistress
    Peyton, unless she knew whose was the hand that had dealt the death blow
    to all her cherished schemes.</p>
  <p>Of a truth the lady was staggered when she heard of Daniel Pye&rsquo;s boasts.
    He had been sitting in the kitchen for the past hour surrounded by a crowd
    of gaping listeners, and enjoying one of the many fruits of notoriety. The
    cook had placed a large venison pasty before him, together with a tankard
    of ale, and lacqueys and wenches were hearing open-mouthed the account of
    how Master Pye had brought my lord of Stowmaries to disgrace, and that the
    life of more than one great nobleman lay in the palm of that same Pye&rsquo;s
    very grimy hand.</p>
  <p>Mistress Peyton, when she heard of the man&rsquo;s boasts and of his popularity
    among her servants, had him incontinently kicked out of the house again,
    but not before he had told her with insolent spite that she was now paying
    for the injustice she had perpetrated on a faithful servant close on half
    a year ago.</p>
  <p>To Daniel Pye the awakening from these pleasing dreams came all too soon.
    That same evening at the tavern in Whitefriars, he gathered the truth from
    out the conflicting rumours which he heard. It was the new Earl of Stowmaries
    who had taken upon himself the charge of conspiracy preferred by Master Pye,
    and &rsquo;twas he who had confessed his guilt. What could this mean, and
    what would be the consequences which would accrue to the informant, to his
    future reward and future safety through this unexpected turn of affairs?</p>
  <p>Master Oates, consulted on the point, was for sticking to the lie on every
    point. The actual personality of the man could not matter in the least, and
    since this Earl of Stowmaries actually pleaded guilty to the charge, why
    then, all was for the best and it was not for Daniel Pye to worry about it
    all.</p>
  <p>Master Tongue&mdash;more wary&mdash;feared a trap, but his objections were
    overruled, and on the whole the infamous fraternity decided that confr&egrave;re
    Pye must uphold his perjuries to the end, since he would obtain the reward
    whoever was condemned on his information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You need have no fear, good Master,&rdquo; concluded Oates reassuringly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
    be believed in any event. Master Bedloe and myself never had any difficulty
    hitherto, even though at the Stayley trial we got in vast confusion, seeing
    that we made several slips which could easily have been proved against us,
    had the judge and jury been so minded. Nay! nay! Do you stick to your story.
    Since one Lord Stowmaries desires to hang instead of the other, why, let
    him, so say I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This cynical speech was, alas, an only too true expos&eacute; of the situation.
    Daniel Pye was almost reassured, and fell to applying himself to making his
    story more circumstantial. On consultation with his friends it was decided
    that the recent murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey would be dragged into
    the indictment. That mysterious crime was indeed a trump card in the hands
    of the informants. It seemed a pity not to play it when the stakes were as
    high as they were just now.</p>
  <p>Pye therefore prepared himself to state on oath that the murder was freely
    projected by my lord Stowmaries with the minister of the King of France,
    in the course of the treasonable interview in Paris.</p>
  <p>But even then did the course of this true liar not run altogether smooth,
    for anon it became generally known that Master Legros, tailor of Paris, and
    his daughter who was none other than the wife of the dispossessed Lord of
    Stowmaries, had been compelled to give evidence for the Crown in corroboration
    of Master Pye&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p>Whereupon the latter fell into a state of agitation worse than before. He
    stared dry-lipped and wide-eyed at the man who had come in with this news.
    This was the first intimation which he had that one of his lies at least
    would find him out. When he had vowed that Master Legros had overheard the
    treasonable conversation between the Earl of Stowmaries and the minister
    of the King of France, he had no thought that the tailor would actually be
    compelled to give testimony, whether he would or no.</p>
  <p>Pye turned well-nigh sick at the thought. Dotard though he was, he had no
    hopes that Master Legros would endorse his lies. Once more he turned to his
    friends for counsel, and briefly explained to them the terrible plight in
    which he now found himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap I&rsquo;d better disappear,&rdquo; he suggested timorously, &ldquo;before
    I am caught for perjury. It means the loss of my right hand and years of
    imprisonment; mayhap in this case the rope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah, man, be not such a coward,&rdquo; admonished Oates boldly. He
    had gone through all the anxieties himself and knew how to make light of
    them. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a pity you did drag an alien&rsquo;s name into the
    case, of course, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the magistrate suggested it to me,&rdquo; broke in Pye,
    who was on the verge of tears; &ldquo;he said that it would be better if
    another witness were forthcoming, who also had heard the conversation at
    the hostelry in Paris. It would strengthen my evidence, so he said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why this French papist?&rdquo; queried Bedloe with an oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because the tailor was in deadly enmity with my lord of Stowmaries&mdash;with
    the other one, I mean&mdash;and I thought he would help me and gladly too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And think you he&rsquo;ll turn against you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me that he will,&rdquo; quoth Pye, who truly was in a pitiable
    condition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, man, you must change your tactics,&rdquo; now said Oates decisively. &ldquo;Nay!
    I repeat, do not be afraid. &rsquo;Tis you they will believe, and not the
    papist tailor or his daughter. What can they say? That they did not hear
    the treasonable conversation between the accused and the minister of the
    King of France. Well, what of that? &rsquo;Tis but a negation, and no evidence.
    The Attorney-General will soon upset such feeble testimony. But do you swear
    that on thinking the matter over you now remember that the tailor and his
    daughter had already left the hostelry of the &lsquo;Rat Mort&rsquo; when
    that treasonable consult took place and that you were in my company and not
    in theirs. Then with one fell swoop do you destroy the whole value of the
    Legros&rsquo; evidence, and place yourself once more in an unassailable position,
    for I too can swear then that I was with you at the time, and heard the whole
    conversation&mdash;so be that you are prepared to share the reward which
    you will get with me,&rdquo; concluded the scoundrel with earnest emphasis.</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye had no option. Of a truth he was not quite such a hardened sinner
    as these professional liars who had thriven and prospered under their organized
    perjuries for close on half a year.</p>
  <p>The whole of the information against Lord Stowmaries was therefore gone
    through all over again, nor was there any fear that this change of front
    would in any way prejudice the noble jury against the informant. In Coleman&rsquo;s
    case and in that of Stailey, and alas, in that of many others, the infamous
    witnesses contradicted themselves and one another to an extent which makes
    the modern historian gasp, when he has to put it on record that men in England
    were condemned to death wholesale, on evidence that was as flimsy as it was
    false.</p>
  <p>Master Pye, once more at peace, therefore, with his prospects and with himself,
    learned his new lesson with diligence. But Master Oates was firm on one point,
    and that was on his share in the coming reward. Pye demurred for a long time.
    Emboldened by the encouragement of his friends, he now thought that he could
    carry the whole business through alone.</p>
  <p>Ultimately it was decided that Master Oates was to receive &pound;5 of the
    reward, provided he swore that on a certain day in April he too was present
    at the tavern of the &ldquo;Rat Mort&rdquo; in Paris when my lord of Stowmaries
    discussed with the minister of the King of France the terms of the shameful
    treaty whereby King Charles was to be murdered, the Duke of York be placed
    on the throne of England and the latter country sold to the French and to
    the Pope of Rome.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter44"></a>Chapter 44</b></h2>
  <p>The news that Michael Kestyon&mdash;the hero of one of the most exciting
    adventures in the history of gallantry, the man who less than twenty-four
    hours ago had by the king&rsquo;s mandate obtained the titles and estates
    for which he had fought for over ten years&mdash;the news that he had been
    arrested for treason connected with the hellish Popish plot, horrified and
    astonished all London.</p>
  <p>It seemed incredible that a man whose romantic personality had charmed all
    the women and even fascinated the king, could lend himself to such base treachery
    as to sell his country to the foreigners, and to incite others to poison
    the merry monarch who even at that moment had with one stroke of the pen
    seen that justice was done to the miserable reprobate.</p>
  <p>Such is popularity! Michael, who a couple of days ago was the idol of society,
    the cynosure of all eyes at assemblies or in the playhouse, on whom the women
    smiled, and whom the men were proud to know, Michael now was naught but an
    abominable traitor, for whom hanging and the rack were more suitable than
    the block to which he was entitled by virtue of his newly acquired dignities.</p>
  <p>And there was no doubt as to his villainies: the infamous blackguard had
    confessed, even at the time of his arrest, which no doubt had taken him wholly
    by surprise, and thus forced on an avowal which would expedite the trial
    and give every one a chance of seeing the traitor&rsquo;s head on Tyburn
    gate before many days were over.</p>
  <p>Excitement and terror had by this time so taken hold of the people of England
    that all sense of justice had gone hopelessly astray, and there was but little
    chance of any man&mdash;however high placed he might be, however upright
    and loyal had been his conduct throughout his life&mdash;escaping condemnation
    and death, once the army of false informers and perjurers had singled him
    out for attack.</p>
  <p>As for Michael, everything was against him from the first. His former dissolute
    life, his long wanderings abroad, where he was supposed to have imbibed all
    the imaginary desires of the foreigners to turn England into an obedient
    vassal of France and Rome, also his sudden accession to wealth and the rumours
    anent that certain adventure, the details of which grew both in confusion,
    in mystery and even in horror as they were passed from mouth to mouth.</p>
  <p>When the fact that the young girl-wife of the dispossessed Earl of Stowmaries
    would be one of the witnesses for the Crown became known, gossip became still
    more wild. Interest in that former adventure increased an hundred fold, and
    the news did of a truth give verisimilitude to the most weird conjecture.
    The words black magic and witchcraft were soon freely bandied about. Michael
    Kestyon was no longer an ordinary plotter, but the veriest anti-Christ himself,
    who was in league with the Pope of Rome to ruin England and to bring forth
    her submission by such means even as the Lord employed against the Egyptians
    in favour of the Israelites. Only in this case, the devil was to be the instrument
    whereby the ten plagues were to be hurled on this defenceless isle.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;There was to be a plague of locusts and one of rats, the waters of
    the Thames would turn to corroding acid and the miscreant Earl of Stowmaries
    had promised to give the devil the blood of every noble virgin in England
    as payment for his satanic help.</p>
  <p>Had we not the testimony of sane-minded men and women who lived at the time,
    and who witnessed every phase of that amazing frenzy which swept over England
    during these awful years, we could not believe that the people of this country,
    usually so gifted with sound minds and above all with a sense of justice
    and of tolerance, could thus have rushed headlong into an abyss of maniacal
    fanaticism which hath for ever remained a blot upon the history of the seventeenth
    century.</p>
  <p>There is a curious letter extant written by Mistress Julia Peyton in her
    usual almost illegible scrawl and embellished by her more than quaint spelling;
    it was addressed to her cousin, Sir John Ayloffe, a week or so before the
    trial, and in it she says:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I wod Like to know the truth about this Story wich sayth that my
    lord Stowmaries wil be acused of witchcraft. They do sa he praktised Black
    Magic, and tried to kil the talor&rsquo;s daughter, so to use her blood for
    his Arts and his Inkantations. She being a Virgin. They do sa also that her
    Evidens against Him wil vastly startle Every one. As for me I tak vast Interest
    in the reprobate and do wish him well at his Trial. The husband of the talor&rsquo;s
    wench is naut to me. I do not desire to see him become Earl of Stowmaries,
    but rather that Michael be suksesful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What other schemes the fair lady now nurtured in her heart we know from
    the fact that she made several attempts to have access to the prisoner, all
    of which were unsuccessful, despite the fact that she used the influence
    of her other admirers to effect her ends, whilst on one occasion she wrote
    to Cousin John:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;An Michael doth sukseed in getting an acquittal, I pra you bring
    him to my house forthwith afterwards. Remember good coz that I promisd you
  twelve thousand pounds if I do marry the Earl of Stowmaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But beyond these secret wishes of the fair beauty, and mayhap a sigh of
    regret or so from pretty lips for the handsome adventurer, popular feeling
    was raging highly against the accused, and many chroniclers aver that among
    the many conspirators who were brought to these shameful trials during this
    time, against none was there so much venomous hatred as there was against
    Michael Kestyon.</p>
  <p>There is this to be remembered&mdash;though truly &rsquo;tis but weak palliation
    for the disgraceful antagonism displayed against the accused&mdash;that this
    was the first instance where a man so highly placed as was the Earl of Stowmaries
    was directly implicated in the plot; he was a sop thrown to the rampant radicalism
    of the anti-Church party as well as to its intolerant fanaticism.</p>
  <p>Public sympathy on the other hand had at once gone out to the dispossessed
    Earl of Stowmaries, whom the traitor had tried to rob of his wife and had
    effectually succeeded in robbing of his inheritance.</p>
  <p>But retribution for the guilty and compensation for the innocent had come
    together hand in hand. Michael Kestyon would hang, of course, whereupon the
    only rightful Lord of Stowmaries would once more come back into his own.
    The latter with commendable delicacy had left London directly his cousin&rsquo;s
    arrest became known; he would not stay to gloat over his enemy&rsquo;s downfall.</p>
  <p>In fact, for the moment everything that Rupert did was right and proper
    and worthy of sympathy, and everything that Michael had ever said and done
    and all that he had never said or done was held up against him by all those
    who awhile ago were ready to acclaim him as a friend.</p>
  <p>Of all these rumours Michael himself knew nothing. On his arrest he had
    at once pleaded guilty, hoping thereby to expedite his trial, and to curtail
    the time during which he would have to linger in prison. Echoes of the turmoil
    which was raging in the capital did reach him from time to time. The murder
    of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey had sent raging fanaticism to boiling point.
    Needless to say that here was another crime to fasten on the already overburdened
    shoulders of the accused.</p>
  <p>All these fresh outbursts of hatred and injustice, however, left Michael
    cold and indifferent, even when through a subordinate he heard the amazing
    story of how he was supposed to have tried to murder his cousin&rsquo;s wife
    by means of black magic, he had nothing but an almost humorous smile for
    the quaint monstrosity of the suggestion.</p>
  <p>He quickly tired of prison life and though there was no pang of suspense
    connected with it, for the issue was of course a foregone conclusion, yet
    he fretted at the delay which the importance of his case had brought about
    in the otherwise simple machinery of summary justice.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter45"></a>Chapter 45</b></h2>
  <p>For the rest, &rsquo;tis in the domain of history. Michael could have been
    tried by his peers had he so desired it. The few friends who rallied round
    him urged him to demand the right, but when we remember that in pledging
    his life to his cousin, his one wish was speedy condemnation and summary
    death, we cannot be astonished that he refused to be tried by those who might
    have been lenient toward one of themselves.</p>
  <p>Among his peers, too, the fact would of a surety have come to light that
    he did not belong to the Catholic branch of the Kestyons, that he himself
    was a member of the Established Church, which&mdash;as all these trials,
    alas, really amounted to religious persecution&mdash;would almost certainly
    have obtained an acquittal.</p>
  <p>Parliament&mdash;still suffering severely of its no-Popery fit&mdash;demanded
    that the traitor be tried as a common criminal before the King&rsquo;s Bench
    and required the king to issue a special commission that the day might be
    fixed as soon as may be.</p>
  <p>The accused was of course allowed no counsel, and no defence save what he
    could say on his own behalf. Nor did he know the precise words of the indictment,
    or what special form the informant&rsquo;s lies had taken.</p>

  <p>He did not know exactly what he was supposed to have said or done, he could
    only vaguely guess from what he knew of similar trials that had gone before.</p>
  <p>The trial of Michael Kestyon, Earl of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, did, we know,
    take place before the King&rsquo;s Bench on the twenty-first day of November,
    1678. Lord Chief Justice Scroggs presided, and the Attorney-General, Sir
    William Jones, once the friend of Michael, addressed the jury for the Crown.</p>
  <p>We also know that the court sat in Westminster Hall for the occasion, as
    it was expected that a very large concourse of ladies and gentlemen would
    desire to be present. As a matter of fact, the &eacute;lite of London society
    did forego on that occasion the pleasures of The Mall, and of the playhouse
    in order to witness a spectacle which would rouse the jaded senses of these
    votaries of fashion and whip up their blas&eacute; emotions more than any
    comedy of Mr. Dryden or the late Master Shakespeare could do.</p>
  <p>This would be a tragedy far more moving, far more emotional than that of
    Hamlet or of Romeo and Juliet, for the element of romance mingled agreeably
    with that of crime, and the personality of the accused was one that aroused
    the most eager interest.</p>
  <p>Outside, a gloomy November drizzle enveloped London with its clammy shroud.
    Ladies and gentlemen arrived in their chairs or their glass coaches, wrapped
    to the eyes in mantles and hoods of fur. There was a goodly array of musketeers
    guarding the approach to the Hall, and a small company of the trained bands
    of London lined the way from Whitehall to Westminster, for it was pretty
    well known that His Majesty would come&mdash;in strict incognito&mdash;to
    see the last of his nine days&rsquo; favourite, who during the last few months
    had made Mistress Gwynne sigh very significantly, and caused Lady Castlemaine
    to make invidious comparisons between the gallant bearing of the romantic
    adventurer and the mincing manners of the gentlemen of the Court.</p>
  <p>The less exalted spectators of to-day&rsquo;s pageant were being kept outside
    and pushed well out of the way by the soldiery; nevertheless, they stood
    about patiently&mdash;ankle deep in the mud of the roadway, their sad-coloured
    doublets getting soaked beneath the persistent drizzle and exhaling a fetid
    odour which made the street and the open place seem more dismal and humid
    than usual.</p>
  <p>The men pressed to the front, leaving the women to shift for themselves,
    to see as best they could. It was pre-eminently a spectacle for men, since
    it carried with it its own element of danger. For, look you, the Papists
    would be mightily rampant on this occasion, and who knows but that a gigantic
    conspiracy was afoot to blow up the Lord&rsquo;s House of Parliament, which
    would sit this day to try the arch-conspirator.</p>
  <p>Recollections of the Gunpowder Plot caused men to curse loudly, and to grasp
    with firm hand the useful flail safely hid inside the doublet: a good protection
    against personal attack, but alas, useless if the whole of Westminster was
    really undermined with powder.</p>
  <p>The &rsquo;prenticess, ever to the fore, had taken French leave to-day. At
    certain risk of castigation to-morrow they deserted work with one accord
    and were at the best posts of observation, long before the more sober folk
    had thought to leave their beds. They wriggled their meagre bodies between
    the very legs of the soldiery, like so many lizards in search of sunshine,
    until they had conquered their places of vantage in the foreground whence
    they would presently see the prisoner when he stepped out of the vehicle
    which would bring him from the Tower.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the crowd wiled away the time by watching the arrival of
    the grand folk, and noting their names and quality as they descended from
    coach and chaise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my lord of Rochester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this my lady Evelyn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vow &rsquo;tis Master Pepys himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his lady, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis His Grace of Norfolk!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon since the duke was a well-known Papist, there were hoots and hisses
    and cries of &ldquo;The stake for heretics!&rdquo; in which even the musketeers
    joined.</p>
  <p>The informers came together and were vigorously cheered and loudly acclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An Oates! An Oates! A Bedloe! Hurrah for the saviours of the nation!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Daniel Pye, a little anxious, was being upheld by his friend Tongue, who
    kept up a running flow of encouraging words which he poured forth into the
    other man&rsquo;s ear. He not being known to the mob remained unnoticed.
    As the time drew nigh for making his lying statements more public, the East
    Anglian peasant felt his courage oozing down into his boots. Bedloe and Oates,
    who had gone through similar experiences several times now, added their own
    encouragement to that expressed by Tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one will worry you,&rdquo; said Bedloe loftily; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll
    believe every word you say. Only stick to your story, man, and never hesitate.
    They can&rsquo;t contradict you: no one else was there to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Although the gloom outside had almost changed day into evening, yet on entering
    the great hall wherein a very few lamps flickered near the centre dais, Daniel
    Pye could see nothing of his surroundings. He was glad that Oates himself
    took him by the arm, and piloted him through the great hall toward a side
    door immediately behind the bench and which gave on the room that had been
    assigned to the witnesses.</p>
  <p>A goodly number of ladies and gentlemen wore masks when they arrived, and
    among these was a man obviously young and of assured position, for his step
    was firm and his movements like those of one accustomed to have his own way
    in the world. He was dressed in rough clothes of sad-coloured material, but
    there was nothing of the menial about his person as he presented his paper
    of admission to the most exclusive corner of the hall.</p>
  <p>Here he sat himself down in a dark recess beneath the sill of the great
    mullioned window, nor did he remove his mask as almost every one else had
    done. Had not the crowd all round him been deeply engrossed in its own excitement
    no doubt that some one would have challenged and mayhap recognised the solitary
    figure.</p>
  <p>But as it was, no one took notice of him. Rupert Kestyon&mdash;like the
    criminal who cannot resist the impulse of once more revisiting the scene
    of his crime&mdash;had returned to London to see the final act of the great
    tragedy, wherein he himself was playing such a sorry part.</p>
  <p>Not that Rupert had any fear that matters would not turn out just as Michael
    had mapped them out. He knew his kinsman far too well to imagine for a moment
    that he would lift a finger to save the life which he had bartered for his
    cousin&rsquo;s loyalty to the tailor&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>But in Paris, whilst waiting in seclusion and inactivity, the moment when&mdash;the
    tragedy being over&mdash;he could once more resume the more pleasing comedy
    of life, he felt an irresistible longing to see the fall of that curtain,
    to be present when Fate dealt him his last trump-card, the final sacrifice
    of the man who stood in the way of his own advancement.</p>
  <p>Therefore he sat there in the corner, solitary and watchful, noting the
    arrival of the spectators, the appearance of the men of law, the whole paraphernalia
    of justice which was about to crush an innocent man.</p>
  <p>The hall by now was packed to overflowing; to right and left temporary seats
    had been erected and covered with crimson cloth, forming an amphitheatre
    which accommodated over a thousand people, amongst whom were many that bore
    historic names, as well as the gayer crowd that formed the Court set.</p>
  <p>Vast as was the room, it had already become insufferably hot; ladies plied
    their fans vigorously, whilst the men, worried with their heavy perruques,
    became restless and morose. On the right hand side, and somewhat in advance
    of the rest of the seats, a few more comfortable chairs had been disposed.
    Here sat a man dressed in sober black, with dark perruque pushed impatiently
    off his high forehead, and shifty, mistrustful-looking eyes wandering over
    the sea of faces all around him. To right and left of him ladies whispered
    and chatted, trying to bring a smile to the pinched lips, and not succeeding,
    for the man in the black surcoat was moody to-day, anxious, too, and vastly
    dissatisfied with himself, which is ever an uncomfortable state of mind.
    He had entered the Hall almost unobserved by the crowd outside, stepping
    out of a closed coach in no ways different to others that had driven up before.
    He had worn a mask when he arrived and only removed it when he was already
    seated. Several people recognised him then, but what cheering there came
    from the more brilliant members of this promiscuous throng was quickly repressed.</p>
  <p>Despite the many supposed attempts on the life of the king, he was far from
    popular just now. Conscious of this, he frowned when he realised that&mdash;though
    he was recognised by many&mdash;yet he was acclaimed only by a very few.</p>
  <p>Already the jury were seated and Sir Cresswell Levins was sorting his papers,
    and incidentally chatting with the Attorney-General. And now from outside
    came a muffled sound, like unto great breakers rolling into shore; distant
    at first, it gradually drew nearer, drawing strength as it approached. Soon
    through it there came, striking sharply on the ear, the stamping of horses&rsquo;  hoofs
    on the cobblestones of the road, and the creaking of heavy wheels through
    the mud. The sound of rolling waves turned to one which came from hundreds
    of human lips&mdash;hisses and groans were distinctly heard; shouts of execration,
    with here and there a blasphemous oath loudly uttered against the cursed
    Papists.</p>
  <p>The prisoner had arrived.</p>
  <p>Inside the Hall all necks were craned to catch the first glimpse of the
    man who was destined mayhap not to leave this place save with the axe suspended
    over his head.</p>
  <p>The romantic tales which had clustered around the personality of Michael
    Kestyon, the horrible suggestions of unavowable deeds, of black magic and
    devilish incantations, had borne fruit. Though eyes were fixed with eager
    curiosity on the man as he entered, though many a pleasing shudder ran along
    white plump shoulders as this confederate of Satan passed so closely by,
    there was not a single demonstration of sympathy on his behalf.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;The women whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is goodly to look on!&rdquo; and took stock of the prisoner&rsquo;s
    bearing, the upright carriage of his handsome head, the quiet look of splendid
    aloofness with which he regarded his surroundings.</p>
  <p>Whereupon the men retorted gruffly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The emissaries of the devil are always made handsome in the eyes
    of others. Satan arranges it so, else they would have no power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Following on the prisoner&rsquo;s entrance, the great doors of the Hall
    had been closed, whereupon the noise outside became quite deafening. The
    hoots and hisses, the shouts of execration, were still apparent but they
    mingled now with the clash of arms, the tramping of many feet, and loudly
    repeated groans of agony. The mob, robbed of its spectacle, had turned restive,
    the men broke through the lines of the soldiery and made an effort to rush
    the gates of the Hall. From the officers came quick words of command, rallying
    their lines from where they stretched toward White Hall.</p>
  <p>A few heavy blows, well aimed and vigorously dealt, with the butt end of
    the muskets, a few bodies trampled beneath horses&rsquo; hoofs, some broken
    heads and shattered limbs, and the mob sobered down, withdrew grumbling and
    cursing, but understanding that the great pageant within was for their betters
    and not for them.</p>
  <p>During the turmoil the Lord Chief Justice had entered and the prisoner had
    been led to the bar; he had been made to hold up his right hand whilst he
    was told why he had been brought here, and why he was made to stand his trial.
    Being a peer, the Chamberlain of the Tower stood beside him holding the axe.</p>
  <p>Michael silently did all that he was bidden to do. The proceedings had no
    interest for him. Of a truth he had been more than satisfied if the more
    barbarous justice of two centuries ago had been meted out to him. An accusation,
    a brief interrogation, mayhap an unpleasant quarter of an hour in the torture
    chamber, then the block! How much more simple, how much more easy to endure
    than this sea of curious faces, this paraphernalia of gorgeously-clad judge
    and of lawyers assembled there with the pre-conceived and firm determination
    to condemn the accused whatever might betide.</p>
  <p>The while Sir Cresswell Levins opened the case, admonishing the jury to
    do their duty by the prisoner at the bar, Michael with indifferent eyes scanned
    the faces all around him. He saw Mistress Julia Peyton in the front rank
    of the spectators clad in exquisite pearl grey silk, her beautiful shoulders
    but thinly veiled beneath filmy folds of delicate lace. He saw the piquant
    face of Mistress Gwynne, the haughty figure of Lady Castlemaine. Most of
    the women as they encountered his look blushed to meet those dark eyes, which
    looked almost unnaturally large in the face rendered thin and pale through
    the nerve-racking experiences of the past few weeks.</p>
  <p>Anon Michael&rsquo;s eyes met the restless ones of the king. He bent his
    head with deep respect, for he had not yet learned to despise the man to
    whom he owed all that he had, all that he was now sacrificing in order that
    his snowdrop might find happiness again.</p>
  <p>Charles Stuart turned his head away with a sigh. All that was good and noble
    and kind in him went out to that man, in whose innocence he firmly believed
    but whom he found was well-nigh intolerable.</p>
  <p>But Michael now was obliged to pull his senses back to the exigencies of
    the moment and he pleaded &ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo; in a calm and steady voice.
    He had not even grasped the full meaning of the indictment read out at full
    length by the Attorney-General. All he knew was that he was accused of having
    plotted to murder the king, whom he revered, and of having sold his country
    to the head of a Church to which he did not happen to belong.</p>
  <p>Michael desired his own condemnation. He was here solely for that, in order
    that the man whom his ice maiden loved with that cold, passionless heart
    of hers might give her all that she wanted, all that was her due. But the
    inactivity of the moment was so terrible to bear. To a man accustomed to
    rule his own destiny, to choose his own path, and to say to Fate: &ldquo;This
    will I do, and thou art my slave!&rdquo; to a man of that stamp the present
    situation was well-nigh intolerable.</p>
  <p>The long-drawn-out speech of the Attorney-General, the platitudes addressed
    to the accused by the Lord Chief Justice, his own answers mechanically given
    soon left him wandering into the realms of unreality.</p>
  <p>The heat in the room pressed upon his temples like a monster weight of lead.
    Michael, gazing with eyes that saw not on the solemn scene in which he was
    the chief personage, soon fell into a kind of torpor akin to a trance. Ghost-like
    forms clad in crimson robes, grinning faces with perruques awry, began to
    dance before his fevered fancy. They twirled and turned, round and round
    the flickering flames of the lamps, until these were magnified an hundredfold
    and multiplied innumerably. Now faces and forms disappeared: there were only
    a thousand millions of eyes that blinked and blinked, the while the lamps
    were will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps, glowworms with monstrous shining horns that
    stood upright on iron tails and joined in the wild sara band which had transformed
    the solemn Hall of Westminster into the precincts of Hell.</p>
  <p>Then gradually all the grinning faces, all the glowing monstrosities and
    witch-like forms became a gigantic circle of ruddy light wherein flames flickered
    at intervals like unto a burning halo which seared the eyes of the beholder.
    And right in the very centre of that transcendent glow two faces appeared,
    white and ghost-like, spirits surely from a world beyond.</p>
  <p>Michael knew that he was dreaming, his temples and pulses were throbbing.
    He had lost count of space and of time. He just breathed and held himself
    upright and no more; living had become an unknown thing to him. But the faces
    were there still, in the centre of the glowing halo, and they were those
    of his beautiful snowdrop and of Master Legros, tailor to the King of France.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter46"></a>Chapter 46</b></h2>
  <p>His snowdrop was gazing straight at him from out great, wide eyes, her lips
    were parted as if she meant to speak, and her hand lay on the arm of her
    father, good Papa Legros, dressed all in black, and above whose sombre surcoat
    shone a kindly face almost distorted by its expression of anxiety and from
    which ran streams of perspiration which the poor man wiped off ever and anon
    with a bright-coloured handkerchief.</p>
  <p>With a mechanical movement Michael passed his hand across his eyes. His
    brain returned from its long wandering in the realm of dreamland; the light
    ceased to flicker, the sea of grinning faces receded into the darkness. Michael
    now only saw Rose Marie. The devilish visions had been transformed into peaceful
    dreams of Heaven.</p>
  <p>Though his mind&mdash;still feverish and numb&mdash;refused to believe that
    she was really there, yet his eyes took in every tiny detail of the golden
    picture which they saw.</p>
  <p>There were the tiny curls that, ever rebellious, would break through the
    confines of the lace cap and flutter tantalisingly round her ear; there was
    the little mole just above the lip, which gave the perfect mouth, that otherwise
    had been accounted too serious, an exquisite air of piquancy; there was the
    delicate rise of the throat, peeping above the lace kerchief, a god-like
    snare wherein he had once dared to hope that his lips would be entrapped.</p>
  <p>And all the while that Michael looked on his beloved, Daniel Pye was busy
    with his perjuries, and Master Oates stood up to corroborate these. Once
    or twice the Lord Chief Justice had turned to the accused, expecting a contradiction
    of such obvious lies. But the only word that ever escaped the latter&rsquo;s
    lips came mechanically as from one who had learned a lesson by heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am guilty&mdash;what these men say is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once the Attorney-General had spoken quite irritably:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The prisoner&rsquo;s attitude, my lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is
    one of contempt for this Court. He must be made to answer more fully the
    charges that are preferred against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis for you to question him,&rdquo; retorted the Lord
    Chief Justice drily.</p>
  <p>Emboldened by Michael&rsquo;s attitude of passive acquiescence, Pye and
    Oates surpassed themselves. Their story gained in detail, in circumstantial
    broiderings under cross-examination. Once or twice their imagination and
    impudence carrying them too far, they palpably contradicted one another.
    A man&rsquo;s voice then rose from the midst of the spectators: &ldquo;These
    men are accursed liars!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice was authoritative and loud, as of a man accustomed to be obeyed.
    And no one cried &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; to the remark, since it came from royal
    lips.</p>
  <p>After an examination which we know lasted nearly an hour, the two witnesses
    were dismissed. They left the great hall together and walked with an assured
    air of satisfaction across to the small room beyond the bench, where they
    were bidden to wait in case they were required again. To a sanely judicial
    mind the only point which would present itself in the evidence of these miscreants
    as being uncontradicted and unquestionably established by them, was that
    the treasonable converse between the accused and a minister of the King of
    France did take place at the tavern of the &ldquo;Rat Mort&rdquo; in Paris
    in the evening of the nineteenth day of April of this same year.</p>
  <p>Beyond that it was a tangle which Michael, had he chosen, could easily have
    unravelled in his own favour. But this he did not mean to do; he was only
    anxious for the end.</p>
  <p>While the lying informer spoke of that same nineteenth day of April his
    thoughts flew back on the sable wings of a dead past to all the memories
    that clung to that day.</p>
  <p>The religious ceremony at St. Gervais, the dance on the dusty floor of the
    tailor&rsquo;s back shop, the ride through the darkness along the lonely
    road with his beloved clinging to him, the while his arm ached with an exquisite
    sense of numbness under the delicious burden which it bore.</p>
  <p>These men spoke of the evening of that nineteenth day of April! Oh, the
    remembrance of every hour, every minute which the date recalled!</p>
  <p>The darkened room in the old inn, the streaks of moonbeam which kissed the
    gold of her hair, the April breeze which caused her curls to flutter, and
    the sighing of the reeds and young acacia boughs like spirit whisperings
    that presaged impending doom!</p>
  <p>Her voice, her eyes, so tender, for that one brief day! Would not the remembrance
    of it be graven on his heart when after so much joy, such hopeless abnegation,
    it would cease to beat at last.</p>
  <p>Of a truth can you wonder that Michael was impatient for the end? He had
    seen his snowdrop through the gossamer veil of a day-dream across the crowded
    court and the vision had caused him to realise more fully than he had ever
    done before how impossible life would be without her.</p>
  <p>Thank God, that he had pledged his life to his cousin! Thank God, that Rupert
    had accepted the pledge, and gave in exchange for the worthless trifle, his
    own loyalty to Rose Marie.</p>
  <p>Then why so many parleyings, such long, empty talk, such tortuous questionings?
    Michael had pleaded guilty and almost asked for death.</p>
  <p>Even as with an impatient sigh of intense weariness he had for the twentieth
    time that day spoken his mechanical &ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo; there was general
    movement amongst the spectators. Imagine a hive of bees swarming round their
    queen: the women leaned forward clutching their fans, forgetting the heat
    and the discomfort of those long hours. The men put up spy-glasses the better
    to see what went on in the centre of the stage, the while a murmur of excitement
    ran right through the assembly.</p>
  <p>Papa Legros was being led by a gorgeously-clad usher in the direction of
    the bar, opposite to the prisoner, whilst his daughter walked by his side.</p>
  <p>Dormant attention had indeed been roused, necks were craned to get a better
    view of the interesting witnesses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is the wife of my lord of Stowmaries,&rdquo; came in whispers
    all round the hall, like the swish of the wind through poplar trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;of the prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! No! Of the man whom he dispossessed and who will be Lord of Stowmaries
    again, once this man is hanged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is very young.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;a girl-wife. &rsquo;Tis her whom the accused tried to murder,
    so that he might offer her blood in sacrifice to the devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this statement obtained little credence now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The accused does not look like a wizard, or an emissary of the devil,&rdquo; commented
    the ladies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet the girl is there to testify against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is because she must hate him so. She is the wife of the man
    whom the accused hath dispossessed. They say she dearly loves her husband,
    yet did the accused try and steal her from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will make a handsome Countess of Stowmaries anon,&rdquo; quoth
    Lord Rochester with his wonted cynicism, and speaking in the ear of his royal
    master, &ldquo;What think you, sire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s fish!&rdquo; retorted Charles Stuart. &ldquo;If she proved
    as big a liar as these damnable informers then is there no virtue writ plainly
    on any woman&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There certainly was something infinitely pathetic in the appearance of father
    and daughter: he in his clothes of deep black, and with the tears of anxiety
    and perturbation rolling slowly down his cheeks. She fragile and slender,
    with pale, delicate face and eyes wherein girlish timidity still fought against
    a woman&rsquo;s resolve.</p>
  <p>No wonder that for the moment every unkind comment was hushed. The Countess
    of Stowmaries&mdash;as she was already universally called&mdash;seemed to
    command respect as well as sympathy. With a great show of kindness, the Lord
    Chief Justice himself spoke directly to the two witnesses, asking their names
    and quality, as was required for form&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie now no longer looked at the accused. She stood beside her father,
    tall and stately as the water-lilies to which the man who loved her so ardently
    had once compared her. The mud of the world had left her unsmirched; she
    carried her head high, for the slimy tendrils of men&rsquo;s unavowable passions,
    of trickery, of lies and deceit had not reached the high altitude whereon
    her purity sat enthroned.</p>
  <p>Her father was the witness called on behalf of the Crown; he had made his
    statement on oath, and stood here now to repeat it before all the world.
    His daughter was his interpreter, since he was unacquainted with the English
    language.</p>
  <p>Her voice was clear and firm as in answer to the questions put to her by
    the Lord Chief Justice she gave her father&rsquo;s humble name and quality
    and then her own as Mistress Kestyon, wife of Rupert Kestyon, erstwhile known
    as my Lord of Stowmaries and Rivaulx.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter47"></a>Chapter 47</b></h2>
  <p>Michael could scarce believe his own eyes. The reality had brought him back
    with irresistible force from his day-dream to the tangible situation of the
    moment.</p>
  <p>Papa Legros was here with Rose Marie. So much was true; that was no longer
    in the domain of dreams. They had been brought here to add their testimony
    to the lies spoken by the informers.</p>
  <p>Torturing devils, whispering in Michael&rsquo;s ears, made this hellish
    suggestion. With it came an intensity of bitterness. He had thought that
    the old man loved him, yet his appearance here and now seemed like petty
    vengeance wreaked on a fallen enemy.</p>
  <p>Michael ground his teeth, trying to drive these whispering devils away.
    He would not&mdash;even at a moment such as this&mdash;lose if only for an
    instant his perfect faith in the purity of the woman he loved. If she stood
    here, it was for a noble purpose. What that purpose could be, not even the
    mad conjectures of his own fevered fancy could contrive to imagine; his veins
    were throbbing and he could not think. Only the puzzle confronted him now,
    mocking his own obtuseness; the laggard brain, that had suffered so long,
    and was now dormant, unable to guess the riddle which could not be aught
    save one of life or death.</p>
  <p>All he did know was that Rose Marie was standing there before all these
    people, she the very essence of purity and of truth, and that she was being
    made to swear that she would speak the truth. Was this not a vile mockery,
    masters, seeing that naught but what was true could ever fall from her lips?</p>
  <p>Now the Attorney-General was questioning her father, with thin, sarcastic
    lips curled in a smile. Rose Marie replied calmly and firmly, interpreting
    her father&rsquo;s answers, not looking once on the accused, but almost always
    straight before her, save when she threw a look of encouragement on good
    Papa Legros, who then would pat her hand with unaffected tenderness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you were present, so the other witness swore in his original
    information, on the 19th day of April, with him at the tavern of the &lsquo;Rat
    Mort&rsquo;  in Paris, and you did on that same evening hear the accused
    hold converse with one who was minister to His Majesty the King of France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Attorney-General&rsquo;s voice was metallic, trenchant, like a knife;
    it reached the furthermost distance of the great hall and grated unpleasantly
    on Michael&rsquo;s ear. He hated to see his beloved standing there before
    that gaping crowd. He cursed the enforced inactivity which made of him a
    helpless log when with every fibre within him he longed to take her in his
    arms and carry her away to a secluded spot where impious eyes were not raised
    to her snow-white robes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he interposed loudly, &ldquo;I have confessed to
    my guilt. What this witness may have to say can have naught to do with the
    plain fact. I am guilty. I have confessed. Cannot your lordship have mercy
    and pass sentence as soon as may be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar,&rdquo; rejoined the Lord Chief Justice, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    not for you to dictate the procedure of justice. &rsquo;Tis my duty to hear
    every witness who hath testimony to lay before this court. You have confessed
    your guilt, &rsquo;tis true, but on such confession the law will not hold
    you guilty, until you have so been proved; and for the sake of the witnesses
    who have testified against you, as well as for the sake of justice, we must
    obtain corroboration of their statements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned once more to Papa Legros and graciously bade him to make
    answer to the questions put by the Attorney-General.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie, before she spoke, turned and looked on Michael. Their eyes met
    across that vast assembly and as in one great vivid flash, each read in those
    of the other the sublime desire for complete sacrifice.</p>
  <p>In a moment Michael understood; in that one brief flash and through the
    unexplainable telepathy which flew from her soul to his, the truth had burst
    upon him with the appalling force of absolute conviction.</p>
  <p>She, the woman whom he adored, who was a saint exalted in his mind above
    every other woman on earth, she was about to throw her fair fame, her honour,
    her purity as a plaything to this crowd of hyena-like creatures, who would
    fall on the tattered remnants of her reputation and tear its last fragments
    to shreds.</p>
  <p>This she meant to do. This was the grim and sublime answer to the riddle
    which had so puzzled Michael when first he saw his Rose Marie in this court.
    She meant to give her honour for his life. She loved him and came here to
    offer her all&mdash;her own, her father&rsquo;s good name, so that he&mdash;Michael&mdash;should
    be saved.</p>
  <p>The terrible, awful agony of this thought, the mad, tumultuous joy! Here
    was the moment at last&mdash;the one second in the illimitable cycle of time&mdash;when
    if there be mercy in Heaven or on earth, the kiss of Death should bring peace
    to the miserable wastrel who had in this brief flash of understanding tasted
    an eternity of happiness.</p>
  <p>She loved him and was here to save him! But Heavens above, at what a cost!</p>
  <p>He looked round him like some caged beast, determined at all hazards to
    make a mad dash for liberty.</p>
  <p>It could not be! No, no; it should not be! Surely God in Heaven could not
    allow this monstrous sacrifice; surely the thunderbolts from above would
    come down crashing in the midst of this mocking, jeering assembly before
    his exquisite snowdrop dragged her immaculate white skirts in the mire.</p>
  <p>What he did or how he fought, Michael himself scarcely knew. What was he
    but one small, helpless atom in this avalanche of callous lawmakers? All
    that he did know was that with all the strength at his command he protested
    his guilt again and again, imploring judgment, uttering wild words of treason
    that might secure his own immediate condemnation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord, my lord,&rdquo; he cried loudly, &ldquo;in the name of Heaven
    as you yourself hope for justice hereafter, listen not to these witnesses.
    I swear to you that they will only confirm what the others have said. I am
    guilty&mdash;thrice guilty, I say&mdash;yes, I plotted to murder the king.
    I plotted to sell England to France and to Rome. I admit the truth of every
    word the informers have uttered. I am guilty, my lord&mdash;guilty&mdash;judgment,
    in Heaven&rsquo;s name&mdash;I ask for judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar, I command you to be silent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silent, silent when so monstrous a thing was about to happen! As well command
    the giant waves lashed into madness by the fury of the wind to be silent
    when they break upon the rocks. The Lord Chief Justice commanded the musketeers
    to restrain this madman, to force him to hold his tongue, to drown his voice
    with the clatter of their arms.</p>
  <p>The spectators stared aghast, women gasped with fear, the men were awed
    despite themselves in the presence of this raging torrent of a man&rsquo;s
    unbridled passion.</p>
  <p>The general impression which this scene had created was of course that the
    prisoner was dreading some awful revelation which these two witnesses might
    make. He was avowing his guilt, therefore he did not hope to escape death;
    once more the superstitious dread of witchcraft rose in the minds of all.
    Was the accused&mdash;already practically condemned for treason&mdash;in
    fear that his death would mean the stake rather than the block?</p>
  <p>A close phalanx gathered round the person of the king, who with a cynical
    smile was watching the confusion which occurred round the august majesty
    of this court. But he waved aside those who would have stood between him
    and Michael.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll quieten down anon,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;and
    if I mistake not, gentlemen, we shall then learn a lesson which throughout
    our lives we are not like to forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was it accident or design? Had Michael fought like a madman, or had his
    brain merely given way under an agonizing moral blow. Certain it is that
    suddenly he felt a terrible pain in his head, his senses were reeling, his
    tongue, parched and dry, refused to obey the dictates of his will that bade
    it protest again and again, until his heart could no longer beat, until his
    last breath had left his body.</p>
  <p>He tottered and would have fallen but for strong arms that held him up.
    He felt that irons were being placed on his wrists, that four pairs of hands
    gripped his arms and shoulders so that he could no longer move. The pain
    in his head was well-nigh intolerable; he closed his eyes in the vain effort
    not to swoon.</p>
  <p>It was the butt end of a musket that had rendered him helpless. From the
    lips of many spectators came loud invectives against the miscreant who had
    dared to strike a peer; vaguely reaching the half-unconscious brain came
    the sound of voices, also the cry from a woman&rsquo;s throat, heard above
    all the others, uttered with an intensity of agony even as he fell.</p>
  <p>With Michael&rsquo;s half-swoon the turmoil had somewhat subsided. The musketeers
    round him, terrified at their comrade&rsquo;s act, were bathing the prisoner&rsquo;s
    head with water hastily obtained. The spectators, deeply moved&mdash;unable
    to understand the inner meaning of the strange scene which they had just
    witnessed&mdash;were talking excitedly to one another.</p>
  <p>Conjectures, wild guesses, flew from mouth to mouth.</p>
  <p>And in the midst of all this noise, and of all the confusion, Rose Marie
    had remained calm, holding her father by the hand. Only when the dastardly
    blow felled the fighting lion down, then only did a cry of pain escape her
    trembling lips. Now when comparative stillness reigned around her, she once
    more faced the judges. Michael was now helpless, she could offer up her sacrifice
    in peace.</p>
  <p>The Lord Chief Justice repeated his question and even as he began speaking
    complete silence fell upon all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you swear before this court that on the evening of the nineteenth
    day of April you were present with Master Pye and Doctor Oates at the hostelry
    of the &lsquo;Rat Mort&rsquo; in Paris and there on that same evening did
    hear the accused holding converse with a minister of the King of France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, milor,&rdquo; replied Rose Marie firmly; &ldquo;my father was
    not present on the evening of the nineteenth day of April in the tavern of
    the &lsquo;Rat Mort&rsquo;  in Paris, nor in any other tavern, nor did the
    accused hold converse on that same evening with a minister of the King of
    France. And this do I swear in my father&rsquo;s name and mine own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed the Attorney-General in his dry, sarcastic
    tone,  &ldquo;the former witnesses have sworn that you were there present
    together with them, when the converse did take place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those witnesses have lied, my lord,&rdquo; spoke Rose Marie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take care, Mistress,&rdquo; admonished the Lord Chief Justice, &ldquo;you
    do bring a grave charge against those witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A grave charge yet a true one, my lord. Yet what they have sworn
    to is both false and grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet are you sworn in as a witness for the Crown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And as a witness for the Crown do I speak,&rdquo; rejoined Rose Marie
    simply, &ldquo;for the Crown of England is the crown of truth, and my father
    and I are here for the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which mayhap will bear fuller investigation,&rdquo; quoth Sir William
    Jones with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As full an one as you desire, my lords.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then pray, Mistress, since you and your father do swear that you
    were not at the hostelry of the &lsquo;Rat Mort&rsquo; in Paris on the evening
    of the nineteenth of April, how comes it that you can state so positively
    that the accused did not then and at that place hold treasonable converse
    with the minister of the King of France, as the other witnesses have testified?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rose Marie paused before she answered; it almost seemed as if she wished
    to wait until all disturbing sounds had died down in the vast hall, so that
    her fresh and firm voice should ring clearly from end to end.</p>
  <p>Then she spoke, looking straight at the judge:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because of the truth of the statement, my lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
    which my father hath already sworn before the magistrate, and to which he
    must, it seems, now swear openly before this court, according to the laws
    of your country. The accused, my lord, could not have been present at a hostelry
    in Paris, or held converse with a minister of the King of France on the evening
    of the nineteenth day of April, for on that day did I plight my troth to
    him at the Church of St. Gervais, and he did spend the full day in my father&rsquo;s
    house. At five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon he did journey with me to St.
    Denis and there remained with me at the hostelry of the &lsquo;Three Archangels,&rsquo; when
    my father came and fetched me away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; came faintly whispered from the lips of the prisoner,
    whose consciousness only seemed to return for this brief while, that he might
    register a last protest against the desecration of his saint.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie&rsquo;s words had rung clearly and distinctly from end to end
    of the hall. After she spoke, after that protest from the accused, dead silence
    fell on all. Only the fluttering of the fans came as a strange moaning sound,
    hovering in the over-heated air.</p>
  <p>Excitement like the embodiment of a thousand spirits flew across and across
    on wings widely outstretched&mdash;unseen yet tangible. Soon a half-audible
    curse spoken from beneath the mullioned windows broke the spell of awed silence.</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon, with rage and shame surging in his heart, fear, too, at
    the possible consequences of this unexpected interference, muttered angry
    oaths beneath his breath. Then like the ripple of innumerable waves, an hundred
    exclamations rose from every corner of the court. Lord Rochester was seen
    to whisper animatedly to the king. Mistress Peyton turned and held hurried
    converse with Sir John Ayloffe, who sat at her elbow. A few women tried to
    titter; the lowering cloud of scandal made vain endeavour to spread itself
    over the head of that slender girl who stood there before the judge, fearless
    and impassive beneath this gathering tempest of sneers and evil words.</p>
  <p>She had heard the muttered oath, spoken by lips that she had already learned
    to dread, and her calm, blue eyes, serene as the skies of her native Provence,
    sought the lonely figure beneath the mullion, and rested on it with a look
    of challenge and of defiance. She had meant and desired to be loyal to him,
    she would have clung to him through sorrow and loneliness, humiliation and
    derision, if need be, but Fate had been too strong for her. The man she loved
    was in peril of his life and could only be saved at the sacrifice of her
    own loyalty and of her honour.</p>
  <p>There had never been any conflict within her. The moment she knew how the
    accusation stood against her beloved, she mapped out her course and never
    swerved.</p>
  <p>Come contumely and disgrace, public scandal and her own undoing, she was
    ready for it all. It had been over-easy to guess what had occurred: how Michael
    had come to be accused of that which was threatening his cousin. Rose Marie
    understood it, even as if she had been present at the interview between the
    two kinsmen, when one man sold his life for the other&rsquo;s loyalty and
    for her happiness.</p>
  <p>All this and more her glance across the court told to Rupert Kestyon. It
    told him that ready as she had been to follow him even at the cost of her
    own misery, she was not ready to pay for his safety with the life of the
    man whom alone she loved.</p>
  <p>Michael may have sinned. He did sin, no doubt, against God and against her,
    but God of a truth had made him suffer enough. It was Rupert&rsquo;s turn
    now to pay, and pay he must. Small coin it was, for his child-wife&rsquo;s
    disgrace, his own humiliation at the inevitable scandal and consequent gossip
    was but small money indeed beside the boundless wealth of self-sacrifice
    which Michael had been ready to throw in his cousin&rsquo;s lap.</p>
  <p>Perhaps that something of the magnetism which emanated from her personality,
    perhaps the subtle and mysterious magic which Love exercises over all who
    think and who feel, affected these people who were present at this memorable
    scene. Certain it is that there were but very few men and women in this stately
    hall who did not feel an undefinable sense of sympathy for the three chief
    actors of the drama which they were witnessing.</p>
  <p>The Lord Chief Justice&mdash;at best a hard and cynical man of the world,
    a man on whom history hath cast a mantle of opprobrium&mdash;was strangely
    impressed. He had watched the girl very closely whilst she spoke, had noted
    the looks which passed between father and daughter and thence across to the
    prisoner at the bar, and something of the truth of the soulful sacrifice
    which all three were prepared to make dawned upon his alert brain.</p>
  <p>His words were the first clear tones that rose above the babel of whisperings
    and titters; he turned directly to Master Legros and addressed him personally,
    speaking in fluent French.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your daughter, Master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hath made a strange
    statement. Do you endorse its purport?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter spoke the truth, milor,&rdquo; replied Papa Legros quietly,  &ldquo;and
    I endorse every word which she hath said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon your oath?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On mine oath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false, my lord,&rdquo; murmured Michael still feebly, but making
    frantic efforts to keep his wandering spirits in bondage. &ldquo;It is false,
    on my soul&mdash;I was in Paris&mdash;not at St. Denis&mdash;the lady is
    unknown to me&mdash;I am guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hear the prisoner&rsquo;s protest, Master?&rdquo; queried the
    judge, once more speaking directly to Legros. &ldquo;If your statement be
    true, he is your bitter enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did my daughter a great wrong, my lord, but he is an innocent
    man, unjustly accused of a grave crime. I cannot let him die for that which
    he hath not done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet doth he protest his guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis natural that he should thus protest, my lord. He hath
    taken on his own shoulders the burden of another. Yet I would have you believe
    that I would not stand by now, and see my daughter sacrificing her good name
    for any cause save that of truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Papa Legros spoke with so much simplicity, such perfect dignity, and withal
    had made so logical a statement, that it seems impossible to imagine that
    it should not carry at least as much conviction to the minds of judge and
    jury and of all the assembly as the obviously lying statements of the informers
    had done. Yet such was the temper of the times, such the wave of intolerant
    fanaticism which had passed over the country, that even whilst good Master
    Legros was stating so noble and simple a point of truth, the first murmurs
    of dissent against him and his daughter rose throughout the hall: whispered
    words of &ldquo;foreign papist,&rdquo; of &ldquo;prejudiced witnesses,&rdquo; of &ldquo;a
    wench and her lover,&rdquo;  flew from mouth to mouth.</p>

  <p>Rose Marie, whose sensibilities were attuned to their highest pitch, felt
    this wave of antipathy, even before its first faint echo had actually reached
    her ears.</p>
  <p>She was quite clever enough to know that the simple mention of an actual
    fact by herself and her father would not be sufficient to turn the tide of
    judicial sympathy back toward Michael, after the perjuries of men who had
    for some time now been exalted into popular heroes; she had, alas, known
    only too well that she had not yet reached the summit of that Calvary which
    she had set herself to climb for the loved one&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>There were yet many cups of bitter humiliation which she and her kind father
    would have to drain ere an innocent man was forbidden to give his life for
    another, and the first of these was being held to her lips even now by the
    Attorney-General, as he said, turning once more to her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are aware, Mistress, of these statements to which your father
    hath sworn in open court. Do you on your own account and independently of
    your father, add your sworn testimony to his?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I swear, quite independently
    of what my father hath said, that on the evening of the 19th day of April,
    when the false witnesses aver that my lord of Stowmaries was in Paris, he
    was at St. Denis with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are quite sure of the date?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I like to forget?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd&rsquo;s fish!&rdquo; he retorted, with a sarcastic curl of the
    lips, &ldquo;when a pretty wench is in love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am the wife of Rupert Kestyon, formerly styled my lord of Stowmaries,&rdquo; she
    rejoined with calm emphasis. &ldquo;Had my father kept silent, had he not
    endeavoured to clear an innocent man of an unjust charge by giving up that
    which he holds most dear&mdash;his daughter&rsquo;s honour and his own good
    name&mdash;had he remained silent, I say, then would the accused have suffered
    death, my husband would have succeeded to his title and estates, and I would
    have duly become the Countess of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, the richest, mayhap
    the most honoured lady in this beautiful land. Think you, then, that &rsquo;tis
    the caprice of wanton love that would make me swear what I did? Think you
    that&mdash;unless truth and honour itself compelled him&mdash;my father would
    lend a hand to the degradation of his own child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What Michael endured in agony of mind throughout this time, it were almost
    impossible to conceive. Imagine that type of man&mdash;the adventurer, the
    soldier of fortune, the carver of his own destiny, good or bad, the dictator
    of his own fate! Imagine that man for the first time in his life rendered
    absolutely helpless the while his fate, his life, was being decided on by
    others. After those first mad and useless protests, after that wild struggle
    for freedom of speech, for the right to refuse this whole-hearted sacrifice,
    this offering of the lily on the altar of love, he had remained silent, with
    his head buried in his hands, driving his finger nails into his own flesh,
    longing with a mad longing of pain to find a means of ending his own existence
    here and now, before his snowdrop had suffered the full consequences of her
    own heaven-born impulse.</p>
  <p>Ye gods above! And he&mdash;Michael&mdash;had doubted her love for him!
    Fool, fool that he had been, even for a moment, even in thought to give her
    up to another. He who had ever been ready to account for his own actions,
    who with the arrogant pride of fallen angels had always looked his own sins
    in the face, grinning, hideous monsters though they may have been&mdash;how
    came it that when first she spoke cold words to him he did not then silence
    them with a kiss, how came it that he did not then and there take her in
    his arms, defying the laws of men, for the sake of the first, the greatest
    of God&rsquo;s laws which gives the woman to the man?</p>
  <p>Fool that he had been to think of aught save love, and of love alone.</p>
  <p>And all the while, Rose Marie, calm and still as the very statue of abnegation,
    was completing her work of self-immolation. When the Attorney-General-with
    sneering lips and mocking eyes threw discredit on those statements which
    she and her dear father were making at the cost of their own honour, she
    felt the first terrible pang of fear. Not for herself or her future, but
    for him whom she longed to save and lest her sacrifice be made and yet remain
    useless. Just for that moment, her serenity gave way. She looked all round
    her on that sea of jeering faces, longing to cry for help, just as with her
    whole attitude she had until this moment only called for justice.</p>
  <p>Once more her eyes lighted on Rupert Kestyon, her husband, throwing him
    a challenge, which now had almost become a prayer. He could if he would help
    her even now. She had become naught to him, of course. Whatever he said could
    not add to her disgrace; but he could help to save Michael if he would.</p>
  <p>She met his lowering glance, the look of hatred and wrath which embraced
    her and her father, and the obstinate set of jaw and lips which spoke of
    the determination to win his own safety, his own advancement and the furtherance
    of his own ambition now and at any cost.</p>
  <p>But when the iron determination of a woman who loves, and who fights for
    the safety of the man she loves, comes in contact with the cold obstinacy
    of a man&rsquo;s ambition, then must the latter yield to the overwhelming
    strength of the other.</p>
  <p>Rupert Kestyon could have saved Michael at cost of his own immediate exaltation,
    and thus saved Rose Marie a final and complete humiliation, but this, his
    every look told her that he would not do. Therefore after that quick glance,
    her eyes no longer challenged him; she feared that if she dragged him forcibly
    into this conflict with perjury, his own self-interest would make a stand
    against justice. Heaven alone knew to what evil promptings his ambition would
    listen at the moment, when the one life&mdash;already so splendidly jeopardised&mdash;stood
    between him and the title and wealth which he coveted.</p>
  <p>She did not know that any one save her father and herself could speak with
    certainty as to that memorable evening of April nineteenth when she went
    forth&mdash;cruel, cold and resentful&mdash;leaving Michael alone and desolate
    at the inn of St. Denis.</p>
  <p>Even now the Attorney-General, fresh to the charge, pressed her with his
    sarcastic comments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You speak well, fair Mistress,&rdquo; he said blandly, &ldquo;but
    you know no doubt that your story needs corroboration. Two witnesses who
    are Englishmen and members of our National Church have sworn that the prisoner
    spent the evening of April the nineteenth in treasonable converse with an
    enemy of this country and in their presence; mark you that the accused himself
    hath confessed to his guilt. Yet do you swear that he spent that day and
    evening in your company, until so late that a cruel father came and dragged
    you away from the delectable privacy. But with all due acknowledgment to
    the charm of your presence, Mistress,&rdquo; added Sir William Jones, suddenly
    dropping his bland manner and speaking with almost studied insolence, &ldquo;you
    must see for yourself that if a wench desires that she be credited, she must
    above all bear a spotless reputation, and this on your own acknowledgment
    you flung to the winds, the day that you&mdash;avowedly married to Mr. Rupert
    Kestyon, formerly styled Earl of Stowmaries&mdash;did publicly flout your
    marriage vows by leaving your father&rsquo;s house in company with the accused.
    Now justice, though blind, my wench, doth wish to see farther than a minx&rsquo;s
    tale which mayhap hath been concocted to save her gallant from the block.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl had not winced at the insults. Happily her father had not understood
    them, and the issue at stake was far too great to leave room for vain indignation
    or even for outraged pride. What bitter resentment she felt was for Michael&rsquo;s
    sake. She knew how every insolent word uttered by that bland cynic in the
    name of the law and of justice, would strike against the already-overburdened
    heart of the man who loved her with such passionate adoration. The impotence
    that weighed on Michael now was of a truth the most bitter wrong to bear
    in the midst of all this misery. Samson bound and fettered was helpless in
    the hands of the Philistines. Prometheus chained to the rock saw the vultures
    hovering over him and the eagles pecking at his heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As to that, sir,&rdquo; replied Rose Marie quietly, after a brief
    pause, &ldquo;these honourable gentlemen here whom you call the jury will
    have to judge for themselves as to who hath lied: those other witnesses or
    I&mdash;they who have everything to gain, or I and my father, who have everything
    to lose. But you say that the justice of this land will need corroboration
    of our statements ere she turns to right an innocent man. This corroboration,
    sir, you shall have, an you will tell me what form it shall take.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some other witness of the prisoner&rsquo;s presence in your company
    at the inn of St. Denis during the day and evening of April nineteenth,&rdquo; retorted
    Sir William Jones brusquely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know only of the innkeeper himself and his wife,&rdquo; she rejoined.  &ldquo;Simple
    folk to whose testimony&mdash;seeing the temper of the people of England
    just now&mdash;you would scarce give credence, mayhap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap not,&rdquo; quoth the Attorney-General mockingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet think again, Mistress,&rdquo; interposed the Lord Chief Justice
    not unkindly, &ldquo;corroboration the law must have&mdash;if not to right
    the innocent then to punish the guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young girl&rsquo;s eyes closed for a moment. She clung to her father
    in pathetic abandonment; beads of perspiration stood on her forehead; her
    eyes were dry and hot and her throat parched. But for Papa Legros&rsquo; presence
    mayhap her magnificent calm would have deserted her then. She drew herself
    together, however, and a look of understanding passed between father and
    daughter. Then the tailor drew a paper from his pocket.</p>
  <p>It was a large and heavy document and it bore two huge seals engraved with
    the arms of the Holy See. This Papa Legros gave into an usher&rsquo;s hand,
    who in his turn handed it up to the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is this paper?&rdquo; queried His Lordship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a dispensation, my lord,&rdquo; replied Rose Marie firmly, &ldquo;signed
    by His Holiness the Pope, as you will see. It was granted to my husband,
    Rupert Kestyon, then styled my Lord of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, giving him
    leave to avail himself of the laws of England, which would, on his request,
    annul his marriage with one Rose Marie Legros , who did on the nineteenth
    day of April, 1678, break her sworn marriage vows by contracting with Michael
    Kestyon a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even as the awful words trembled on the girl&rsquo;s lips, Michael&rsquo;s
    restraint completely gave way. Despite the soldiers around him&mdash;who
    of a truth were taken by surprise&mdash;despite the hopeless futility of
    his former attempt&mdash;he broke through the rank of musketeers who were
    surrounding him, and with a cry as that of a wild animal wounded unto death,
    he bounded forward to where his snowdrop stood, and with one arm round her,
    pressing her to him with all the strength of passion held in check so long,
    he, with the other hand placed upon her mouth, smothered the word which would
    have escaped her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord, my lord,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is this justice? Sire,
    you are here present! Where is your kingly power? Will you not stop this
    desecration of the purest, holiest thing on earth? Are we in the torture
    chambers of our forefathers that men in England will listen unmoved to this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had taken the guard so completely by surprise that the men were still
    standing mute and irresolute, the while the prisoner with defiant head erect
    challenged the king himself to intervene. He had sunk on one knee, his arm
    still round the form of his beloved. No one would have dared to touch him
    then, for he was like a wild beast defending its mate.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie&rsquo;s strength had indeed failed her at last; when she felt
    herself falling against the breast of the man whom she so ardently loved,
    all her calm, all her resolution suddenly gave way. Once more she was the
    woman, the pure, tender-hearted, gentle-nurtured child, content to rest in
    the protecting arms of her lord, content to live for his happiness, or to
    share his disgrace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I feared you before, my lord&mdash;meseems that I could love you
    now,&rdquo; her cold lips seemed to murmur the echo of the very first words
    of love which they had ever uttered.</p>
  <p>And a groan of agony escaped the poor blackguard&rsquo;s overburdened heart.
    No longer splendid now, no longer defiant or proud&mdash;but humbled from
    his self-exalted state of arrogant manhood. And she, the slender water-lily,
    had of her own free will allowed the mud of a polluted world to soil the
    exquisite whiteness of her gown. She had descended from her lofty pedestal
    of saint-like aloofness, in order to link her fate to his&mdash;her sins
    to his&mdash;her life and love to his own. Fate and the overwhelming love
    of a woman had conquered his will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a man and what I do, I do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; love triumphant had retorted, &ldquo;for what <i>I</i> command
    that must thou do. I am the ruler, thou my slave! Whoever thou art, I am
    thy master and the arbiter of thy destiny!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter48"></a>Chapter 48</b></h2>
  <p>At Michael&rsquo;s call, at his sudden rush for the protection of his beloved,
    general confusion prevailed such as had never before been witnessed in the
    sober halls of Westminster.</p>
  <p>Gorgeously-clad gentlemen of high degree, ladies in silks and brocades,
    elbowed and pushed one another, climbing on their chairs, in order to have
    a clear view of the small group on the floor of the hall at the foot of the
    judge&rsquo;s bench&mdash;Michael kneeling on one knee, Rose Marie half prostrate
    on the ground, Papa Legros with large coloured handkerchief mopping his streaming
    forehead.</p>
  <p>These were times when men gave freer rein to their emotions than they do
    now; they were not ashamed of them, and modern civilisation had not yet begun
    to propagate its false doctrine that only what is ugly and sordid is real,
    and what is fine and noble&mdash;and therefore mayhap a trifle unbridled
    and primitive&mdash;is false and must be suppressed.</p>
  <p>That public feeling had&mdash;with characteristic irresponsibility&mdash;veered
    round to the accused and to these two witnesses was undoubted. The poignancy
    of the situation had told on every one&rsquo;s nerves. It had been a moving
    and palpitating drama, vivid, real and pulsating with love, the noble passion
    that makes the whole world kin.</p>
  <p>The same men and women who awhile ago had clamoured for the traitor&rsquo;s
    head, who had heaped opprobrium, invectives and curses upon him, were now
    quite prepared to demand his acquittal, with as little logic in their sympathy
    as they had shown in their unreasoning vituperations. The same primeval vices
    of bigotry and intolerance that had presided at the trials of Stailey and
    Coleman and sent them to the gallows, sat here in judgment, too, equally
    intolerant of contradiction, equally bigoted and peremptory.</p>
  <p>In the midst of this unprecedented turmoil which had turned stately Westminster
    Hall into an arena filled with wildly-excited spectators, the ushers&rsquo; loud
    calls for silence were absolutely drowned. Nor could the Attorney-General
    and the Lord Chief Justice make themselves heard by the jury, even though
    his lordship did his best to admonish these twelve honourable gentlemen not
    to allow their sentiment to run away with their conscience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Justice, good Masters, justice above all! Remember these people are
    all Papists. They will help one another through thick and thin. What is a
    papal dispensation, good Masters? It can be bought and bartered. &rsquo;Tis
    a true witness we want, an honourable witness to prove the truth of what
    may be but a fabulous concoction, devised to cheat the gallows of a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, then odd&rsquo;s fish!&rdquo; here interposed a loud voice from
    out the crowd; &ldquo;since it must be, it shall be, and here, my Lord Justice,
    is a witness to your hand whose honourability I&rsquo;ll challenge you to
    doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tones rang clear and loud; they were those of a man accustomed to be
    heard in large or small assemblies, of a man who knew how to make his presence
    felt and his word obeyed.</p>
  <p>Instantly the waves of murmurs, of cries, of excited whispers were stilled.
    Eyes so long fixed on the moving spectacle at the foot of the bench were
    turned in the direction of the speaker.</p>
  <p>It was my Lord of Rochester, standing beside the king. He waited a moment,
    then taking the judge&rsquo;s silence for assent, and obviously encouraged
    by a nod from His Majesty himself, he made his way to the witness bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Lord of Rochester,&rdquo; protested the Attorney-General sternly, &ldquo;by
    what right do you come forward at this hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the right that every man hath in England, to bear testimony for
    or against a man or woman accused of crime,&rdquo; replied my Lord of Rochester. &ldquo;I
    stand here as a witness on behalf of the prisoner, and called by the other
    witness&mdash;Rose Marie Legros&mdash;to corroborate what she already hath
    said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you swear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear to tell all the truth and nothing but the truth,
    so help me God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All on behalf of the accused?&rdquo; sneered Sir William Jones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every word which I must utter will be in his favour, sir, seeing
    that on the nineteenth day of April, I too, in company with Mister Rupert
    Kestyon, then styled my Lord of Stowmaries and Rivaulx, and with Sir John
    Ayloffe, were present at the Church of St. Gervais where Mistress Rose Marie
    Legros did plight her troth to the accused. We witnessed their departure
    from the church to the house of Master Legros, tailor-in-chief to His Majesty
    the King of France, where great festivities were then the order of the day.
    The accused and Mistress Rose Marie Legros did start for St. Denis on that
    selfsame afternoon in the presence of a vast number of spectators, from whom
    I had detailed account of the event. We&mdash;that is Mister Rupert Kestyon,
    Sir John Ayloffe and myself&mdash;did make for St. Denis less than an hour
    after the accused and the lady had left the tailor&rsquo;s house. We arrived
    at the inn of the &lsquo;Three Archangels&rsquo; at ten of the clock and
    there found the accused all alone, and we did stay with him, and supped with
    him until far into the night. This do I swear on my most solemn oath, and,
    therefore, any one who says that the accused was in Paris on the evening
    of that nineteenth day of April is a liar and a perjurer&mdash;so help me
    God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My Lord of Rochester&rsquo;s lengthy speech was listened to in silent attention.
    Michael, kneeling beside Rose Marie, scarcely heeded it. What happened to
    him now or hereafter mattered so little, now that he knew that she loved
    him with that strength which moveth mountains.</p>
  <p>But to the vast company assembled here, all that my Lord of Rochester said
    mattered a great deal, for it was a confirmation of inward convictions. It
    gave sympathy free rein, having crowned it with justification.</p>
  <p>Even Sir William Jones felt that the prosecution had completely broken down
    beneath the weight of my Lord of Rochester&rsquo;s evidence. He meant to
    demand further corroboration, seeing that Sir John Ayloffe was in court;
    but it would be an uphill fight now, against what was too obvious justice
    to be wilfully set aside.</p>
  <p>But he did ask my Lord of Rochester why he had delayed in coming forward
    until well-nigh it had been too late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was ready to come forward at any time,&rdquo; was Rochester&rsquo;s
    simple reply; &ldquo;had the prisoner called me, I would have told the truth
    at once. But among gentlemen, sir, there is an unspoken compact, guessed
    at by those who understand one another as gentlemen should. That the accused
    did not desire mine evidence I readily saw. Only when a noble lady came forward
    in sublime sacrifice and I feared that this&mdash;great as it was&mdash;might
    prove purposeless, then did I feel in honour bound to corroborate her testimony
    and to prove her true, whilst placing at her feet the expression of my most
    humble respect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To have doubted my Lord of Rochester&rsquo;s testimony had been madness
    in the face of public feeling as well as of justice. No one would ever attempt
    to suggest that his lordship was either a Papist or biassed in favour of
    Roman Catholicism. Moreover, Sir John Ayloffe, also an unimpeachably honourable
    gentleman, was there to add his word to that of his friend. Sir William Jones
    having called him, asked him but a few questions.</p>
  <p>What could Cousin John do, but swear to the truth? Believe me that had he
    found the slightest loophole whereby he could even now arrange a happy marriage
    between his fair cousin and any earl of Stowmaries who happened to be bearing
    the title at the time, he would have done it, and earned that &pound;12,000
    which now certainly seemed hopelessly beyond his grasp.</p>
  <p>But he could find no loophole, nor could he attempt to deny the truth of
    what Lord Rochester had said.</p>
  <p>By the time Sir John Ayloffe had given what evidence was asked of him, the
    spectators were loudly clamouring for the verdict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not guilty! Not guilty!&rdquo; came in excited shouts from the furthermost
    corners of the great hall.</p>
  <p>Of a truth had the informers been recalled they could not have escaped with
    their lives, and as a measure of precaution the Lord Chief Justice, before
    he began his summing up, did, we know, order the removal of Pye and Oates
    through a back door and unbeknown to the crowd. Oates&rsquo; villainies did,
    unfortunately, rise triumphant from out the ashes of this his first signal
    defeat in his campaign of perjuries. As for Pye, he passed through that back
    door out of ken. I believe that his name doth occur on several of the lists
    of witnesses brought up against the unfortunate Papists during the whole
    feverish period of the Popish plots, so we may assume that he continued his
    career of informer with some benefit to himself.</p>
  <p>But in Westminster Hall to-day the verdict was a foregone conclusion. Even
    whilst the Lord Chief Justice summed up&mdash;as he did, we are told, most
    eloquently and entirely in favour of the accused&mdash;he was frequently
    interrupted by cries of: &ldquo;Not guilty! Not guilty! The verdict!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When the verdict was pronounced, with absolute unanimity by the jury in
    whose hands lay the life that had been so nobly fought for, it was received
    with acclamation.</p>
  <p>Men and women cheered to the echoes, whilst many voices shouted: &ldquo;God
    save Your Majesty!&rdquo; There was a general rush for the centre of the
    Hall, there where that small group of three still stood isolated. The musketeers
    had grave difficulty in keeping any order.</p>
  <p>In the midst of all this turmoil no one noticed that from the dark corner
    beneath the mullioned window there rose the figure of a young man dressed
    in rough clothes of sad-coloured cloth, whose pale face was almost distorted
    by lines of passionate anger.</p>
  <p>He drew a mask over his face and made his way through the excited crowd.
    Under cover of the confusion, the rushing to and fro, the cheering for the
    acquitted and the king, he quietly passed out of sight.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter49"></a>Chapter 49</b></h2>
  <p>That same evening in the small house in the parish of Soho, Michael sat
    beside an old woman whose wrinkled, toil-worn hand he held tenderly in his
    own.</p>
  <p>Life had dealt hardly with her, unaccustomed toil and a rough life had done
    their work. Her sensibilities were blunted, almost extinct save one&mdash;her
    love for her son.</p>
  <p>Obediently she had left her Kentish village, her miserable cottage, and
    ungrateful garden, to come to London when first he bade her so to do. She
    had exchanged her rough worsted kirtle for a gown of black silk, soft and
    pliable to the touch. This she had done to please Michael, not because she
    cared. It was many, many years since last she had cared.</p>
  <p>Humbly acceding to his wish she had lived in the house in Soho Square, allowing
    herself to be tended by servants, she who awhile ago had been scrubbing her
    own floors. To please him she had accepted all the comforts, all the luxuries
    which he gave her. As for herself she had no need of them.</p>
  <p>Then when he went away and she was all alone in the big house, save for
    the army of mute and obedient servants round her, she had wept not a little
    because she did not see her son. She knew not whither he had gone, and when
    she asked any of the servants they gave no definite answer, only seemed more
    mute, more obedient than before.</p>
  <p>But she did not complain. Michael was oft wont to go away like this, to
    the wars mayhap; soon he would return all in good time and she would see
    him again. Not the faintest echo from the great world outside reached the
    lonely house in Soho Square; but then it had not reached the Kentish village
    either, so old Mistress Kestyon was quite satisfied.</p>
  <p>To-night Michael had returned. She was over-glad to see him. It seems he
    had not been wounded in the wars, for which she was over-glad. He would not
    let her out of his sight, even when a visitor came desiring speech with him.</p>
  <p>The visitor was Rupert Kestyon; the name hardly reached the feeble intelligence,
    and the face conveyed no meaning. The old dame was quite happy, however,
    for Michael sat beside her, holding her hand in his. She did not understand
    much of what went on between the two men. They were cousins, so Michael had
    said when first the young man entered and he himself went forward to greet
    him and warmly took his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see me shamed before you, Coz,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;You
    know that had I had the control of my fate, I should be watching you now
    from the height or depth of another world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You sent for me,&rdquo; said Rupert, in no way responding to the
    other&rsquo;s cordiality. &ldquo;I presume &rsquo;tis because you have something
    to say to me of more importance than excuses for your happening to be alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! There is nothing more important than that just now, Coz,&rdquo;  retorted
    the other quietly. &ldquo;I sent for you because a chance of word from your
    servant to mine revealed to me the fact that you were in London. You came,
    no doubt, to see me hanged. A beautiful woman of whom you, Coz, were never
    worthy, hath decided that I shall live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The word that Rupert uttered in response brought an ugly frown on Michael&rsquo;s
    brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;in your own interest I pray
    you cease this wanton talk. I would have you know that I mean well by you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew from out his pocket the paper that had the seal of His Holiness
    the Pope attached to it and handed it to Rupert, who with a savage oath took
    it from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Coz,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the papal dispensation which
    good M. Legros gave into my hands when I parted from him at Westminster Hall.
    The civil law of England will not take long in setting you free. What money
    can accomplish, that it shall do to expedite your case. My word on it! The
    lady will not defend it and the nullity of your marriage shall be pronounced
    ere the first bud appears on the chestnut trees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A free man and yet a beggar,&rdquo; murmured Rupert moodily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, Cousin, why should you look on me as your enemy? Have I
    ever acted as such? My mother, alas, is here as a proof that you and yours
    were enemies to me, but I, not to you, &rsquo;pon my honour. I have no need
    of great riches. The hundred and twenty thousand pounds with which you gambled
    a year ago are yours, Cousin. Let us call them a loan which you made me,
    and wherewith Fate hath worked its will for us. I give them to you freely
    and with all my heart. You are not a beggar, you see, and are free to marry
    whom you choose. You are still the cousin of, if not the actual Earl of Stowmaries;
    many a pretty woman with taste and ambition will&mdash;an I mistake not&mdash;smile
    on you. Life is full of joys yet for you, Cousin, and Mistress Peyton will
    relent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While he thus spoke lightly, almost gaily, the frown of moodiness fled from
    Rupert Kestyon&rsquo;s brow. He could not help but be gratified at his cousin&rsquo;s
    generosity, even though his heart no longer turned toward the faithless beauty
    whose callousness had killed in him all love for her. But there were plenty
    of pretty women yet in England, thank God, and a man well-born and well-connected
    could cut a very fine figure in London society these days on one hundred
    and twenty thousand pounds. In the far-off days in old Virginia he had been
    quite glad of as many pence.</p>
  <p>He was quite manly enough to thank his cousin warmly. But before he went,
    he told Michael the news that had been all over London for some day before
    the trial, namely, that beautiful Mistress Peyton had finally decided to
    bestow her hand and fortune and her heart&mdash;on John Ayloffe.</p>
  <p>Good Cousin John! Confronted with beggary and the irretrievable loss of
    that &pound;12,000, he had bethought himself of the only plan whereby the
    latter goodly sum could, after all, find its way into his own pocket.</p>
  <p>The money with the lady was his only chance, and we are told that he took
    it boldly, even contriving not to make too wry a face when the capricious
    beauty&mdash;realising that Cousin John was her only hope of matrimony now
    that her name had been so plentifully bespattered with ridicule&mdash;decided
    to bestow her &pound;20,000, her house and her person, on the one man who
    would accept.</p>
  <p>Cousin John became exceedingly fat after his marriage, for he led a life
    of ease and comfort even though his former merry haunts knew him no more.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter50"></a>Chapter 50</b></h2>
  <p>Michael did not see Rose Marie in England, for her father had taken her
    away that same evening, after the acquittal, and journeyed with her forthwith
    to Paris.</p>
  <p>And it was in the little room of the Rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne Com&eacute;die
    that Michael once more beheld his snowdrop. It was December now and the room
    was filled with Christmas roses. Outside, the snow lay heavy on the ground.
    Maman Legros, with sleeves well rolled up over her sturdy arms, was stirring
    the contents of her stock-pot. Papa&mdash;a little more grey, a little more
    bent, mayhap, than he had been a year ago&mdash;was staring silently into
    the fire.</p>
  <p>Rose Marie sat at her harpsichord in the window embrasure, and sang to her
    own accompaniment. Through the panes of the leaded window the pale rays of
    a December sun lit up the golden radiance of her hair, and rested on her
    hands as they wandered over the ivory keys.</p>
  <p>Thus Michael saw her again after all these months of suffering. He stood
    for a moment in the doorway, for happiness at times is more difficult to
    bear than grief. But Love was triumphant at last. The splendid blackguard,
    the reckless adventurer, was only an humble lover now. He gazed on his snowdrop
    with eyes wherein ardent passion mingled with deep reverence.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Let the veil of oblivion be drawn across those leaded windows; let
    it shut out all light which comes from the outer world. Michael at Rose Marie&rsquo;s
    feet forgot all save that he had won her&mdash;the pure, stainless girl&mdash;even
    through the infinity of her pity which had first called into being her infinite
    love.</p>
  <p>Papa and Maman Legros, looking on their child&rsquo;s exquisite face, suffused
    now with the glow of perfect love and perfect trust, exchanged a knowing
    look.</p>
  <p>Then they very softly tiptoed out of the room.</p>
