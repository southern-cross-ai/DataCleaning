<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE LONE BUCKAROO</h2>

<p class="first"><i>"Politeness is shorely a shield that stops
many a bullet. Still an' all, if a feller has got to insinuate
hisself into another party's quarrel, it's plumb best to omit
apologies until the shootin' is over...I nev' yit did see a red-
headed gent that wa'n't burnin' to right the wrongs of this yere
unjust world."&mdash;Parting advice of Joe Breedlove to Tom
Lilly.</i>
</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE blazing, blood-red sun dropped over the
western rim and left the valley to a twilight peace. Tom Lilly
riding his weary buckskin toward the distant huddle of buildings
that formed the isolated town of Powder, felt the first of the
evening's breeze. It had all the effect of a cold shower on man
and beast; Lilly wiped the crusted sweat from his face and washed
his parched throat with a drink.</p>

<p>"Another day, another dollar. Buck, you got a restless,
homeless no-account for a rider."</p>

<p>The pony raised its ears and quickened the pace Dust rose
behind in swirling eddies. Night threw successive darkening
cobalt shadows across the land, through which twinkled here and
there the light of a homesteader's shack; eastward the high mesa
became nothing but a stark outline against the sky.</p>

<p>It was new country to Tom Lilly. For that reason and no other
was he here. The lure of the unknown, the unseen drew him like a
magnet. Beyond the hill was always the promise of fairer fields,
the hint of great adventure. And as tired as he was, a small
excitement burned in his blue eyes and compressed the muscles of
his lean, sun-blackened face as he drew upon Powder and beheld
the lights shining out of the windows into the rutty, dusty
street. This was the whole story of Tom Lilly and explained the
wistfulness of his features, the temper that slumbered fitfully
beneath the sorrel-red thatch of hair. He was a wanderer, a
seeker of something that could never come to pass; Joe Breedlove,
his partner back on the H-H, had said this in plain blunt
language&mdash;though rather sorrowfully&mdash;when Tom was on
the point of moving.</p>

<p>"Yuh ain't foolin' me, old-trapper, with that poker face o'
yourn. I reads you mos' clearly. Yore a red-haired gent with
misbegotten idears o' romance. All red-heads is the same, which
is a fact. Yuh have traveled a hell of a lot o' trails before yuh
camped here, without findin' anything to please yuh. Better stick
to these diggin's, amigo. Yuh won't locate any better. All you'll
do is grow gray an' mis'ble. Ain't I seen how these roamers end
up? Usually over a bar'l o' spuds in some town restaurant. Yeah,
a broken-down old codger washin' dishes fer a livin'. Ain't that
a fine end fer an A-l top hand?"</p>

<p>But Tom Lilly tightened his cinches and tied down his blanket
roll, smiling in a faint sheepish way. "Lots of country I ain't
seen, Joe. If I don't like it I'll mosey back."</p>

<p>Joe Breedlove shook his head. "Yore kind don't back track."
Then the man's big paw gripped his friend's arm. "Well, yuh know
best. If yuh ever git in a jam, drop a line or send up a smoke
signal. I'll come-a-runnin'."</p>

<p>"Sho'," muttered Tom, losing his grin. He had ridden off with
a very brief farewell. Now, as he entered this straggling town
street, he was recalling those words. "The hardest part about
movin'," he said to himself "is leavin' a good Joe like that
behind." He had said goodbye often, yet never with quite the same
depression of spirit. "He was shore a square gent. Well, here we
are, and where are we?"</p>

<p>Powder was just another desert town. Tom Lilly had seen a
hundred built in the same loose-jointed shackling fashion, with a
dozen or more false-fronted frame buildings abutting a dirt
street. There would be two or three saloons with their kerosene
lights beckoning through the swinging doors, a general store, a
restaurant, a jail and, somewhere near the edge of town, a livery
stable. Lilly rode slowly, looking for this latter establishment.
Men moved in the shadows, their cigarette tips gleaming. Dishes
rattled in the restaurant and from the nearest saloon came the
flat, unmelodious notes of a piano. Powder was tuning up for the
night, given a new lease on life by the evening breeze. Lilly,
turning his horse into the stable, felt depressed. It was the
same old story over again; Joe Breedlove was right&mdash;he would
travel the long trail until he could no longer sit in the saddle,
looking for something not to be found. How could he find it when
he didn't know what he looked for? Just another stray critter
never thrown and branded. He slipped off the buckskin, seeing the
stable roustabout amble through the door.</p>

<p>"This pony," said he, "gets oats. Where's yore brush and
currycomb?"</p>

<p>He led the animal to a stall, slipped off the gear and set to
work with the implements the roustabout produced. The latter,
displaying the indirect curiosity of his kind, spoke
casually.</p>

<p>"Hope it ain't this hot where you come from."</p>

<p>"We had rain there in 1903," opined Tom gravely. "Where's a
good place to eat?"</p>

<p>"They's only one place, which is the Star. You won't mind it
too much if yore hungry, I might add they's usually a gentleman's
game o' poker in progress at Jake Miner's place. Mos' stranger
like to know, so I'm a-tellin' you. Mama Ringo runs the hotel if
it's your desire to sleep on a real four-bit bed. The sher'ff an'
marshal are both tol'rant to'rds ord'nary misdemeanors o' the
peace. I might add the likker here abouts is thirty proof an' the
cards entirely without marks. Which constitutes the whole story
o' this hole in the ground. It's a nice leetle place&mdash;if you
don't stay long."</p>

<p>"You shore are a compendium of useful knowledge," averred
Lilly, strolling out. "Civic pride is a jewel of great
renown."</p>

<p><br> The roustabout's retort was a short and emphatic word
that exploded in the darkness. Tom Lilly, smiling slightly,
crossed to the Star and had his supper in solitary state. Powder
had unanimously eaten and departed to its pleasures, leaving the
latest arrival to finish his steak and onions among a debris of
dishes. It was a meal, nothing more than that and Tom paid his
bill and walked out, hungry; not for food, but for the palaver of
his own kind, for the rough joke and the twang of a familiar
voice. It was always thus when restlessness drove him onward and
away from friends. He was forever an alien in a strange land,
left to his own sober, wistful thoughts. Under the impulse of
this loneliness, he built himself a cigarette and headed for Jake
Miner's.</p>

<p>But before he reached the door the jingling of the piano, the
rattling of chips and the hum of voices suddenly ceased. A
silence, uneasy and expectant, pervaded the place and when he
pushed through the swinging portals he became a witness to a
scene that jerked at his nerves and sent a warning down his right
arm. There was something going on here out of the ordinary,
something that made him brush the butt of his gun with careful
fingers and move quickly to a rear wall. It was such a little
drama as he had often seen before and within thirty seconds his
quick-acting, partisan temper was thoroughly engaged on the side
of a man who appeared to be the under dog. And of a man not of
his own kind or profession.</p>

<p>He was a nester, this fellow. That was obvious from a glance
at the shabby overalls and the sallow, bewhiskered face. He had a
gaunt, weather-beaten frame and a pair of hands warped out of
shape by hard labor. A very homely man, who leaned uneasily
against the mahogany bar and gripped a glass of whisky that had
not been touched. He was perhaps forty, but he looked older, and
from beneath bushy sun-bleached brows a pair of faded blue eyes
stared out in mixed defiance and fear. Lilly leaned against the
wall, hearing a faint whisper float across a near table.
"Trono'll shore kill 'im. He shore will." And Lilly, growing
angry on the instant, turned his attention to the second party at
the bar.</p>

<p>Trono was smiling in the tight malevolent way of a man
enjoying himself over a victim. He was a short and burly creature
with immense shoulders and arms; a thick, columnar neck supported
a face that was as swart as any Indian's; but here the
resemblance stopped, for his chin was of the outthrust, cleft
kind and he had bulging green eyes. Somewhere he had been engaged
in desperate fighting, one mark of which ran across the high
bridge of his nose and up in to the half-bald bullet head.
Undeniably he was of the cattle range, and he was taking a
cowman's attitude toward the nester. He lifted his own whisky
glass, speaking in a rumbling, husky voice.</p>

<p>"We'll drink to the sudden death o' all nesters. Down she
goes."</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno's that's perlite," protested the other. "I'm a
peaceable feller, a-mindin' my own business."</p>

<p>"Mean to say yuh won't drink with a man?" roared Trono.
"That's the sorta insult that don't go down in this country! Why,
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll drink if it'll soothe yer feelin's any," said the
nester, raising his glass.</p>

<p>Trono was grinning. And when the nester was about to drink,
one massive arm swept across the intervening space and slapped
the glass to the floor. The nester spewed the liquor from his
mouth and wiped his eyes. His flat chest rose and fell with an
excess of outraged feeling, but in the end he spoke quite mildly.
"Seems to me you be tryin' to pick trouble. I want these fellers
to know I ain't startin' no trouble. It's a free country."</p>

<p>"Free fer anything but bugs," broke in Trono, working himself
to a rage. "Y' know what we do with bugs, mister? We bash 'em!
Better take warnin' an' clear out."</p>

<p>"No, I don't guess I'll give up," said the nester. Tom Lilly
inwardly applauded the man's courage. It took nerve to stand in
the midst of a crowd of cowpunchers and declare himself. Even
more nerve to say what he went on to say. "Pilgrim Valley wa'n't
created jes' purposely fer the Octopus an' his JIB ranch, though
you seem to think so. I'm holdin' my land by gov'ment consent.
Mean to prove it an' farm it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>do</i>?" muttered Trono, bearing down on the final
word.</p>

<p>The nester hastened to take the sting from his pronouncement.
"Ain't no reason fer you folks to git sore. They's aplenty land
left to run cows on. Shucks, I'm only holdin' a half section
outen three-four hundred thousand acres."</p>

<p>"Bugs breed," replied Trono. "Leave one alone an' he hatches a
hundred more. No, that ain't no argument. Hey, where you
goin'?"</p>

<p>The nester had started to back off. Trono's right hand dropped
half way to his gun and the nester's whole body stiffened; he,
too, made a gesture toward his coat pocket, only to throw both
arms free of his body as if to show he meant no trouble. It was a
cruel ordeal and the mark of it appeared on his lean face in deep
furrows and fine beads of sweat. Tom Lilly sighed to relieve the
pressure of his accumulating anger. First and foremost he was a
cowman, with most of the prejudices of that class. But he fought
fair, always, and now his sympathies were entirely with the
nester who was being badgered. It bore hard on him to stand back
and watch this quarrel being trumped up by Trono; for there could
be only one end to it. It was obvious that Trono meant there
should be but one end.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' about my business," muttered the nester, rubbing
his lips with a trembling hand. "I know you, Mister Trono. You
figger to cause trouble. You've allus tried to haze me off my
claim. Well, if I was a younger feller I might stand up to you.
All I ask is to be let alone. It's a free country and they's
plenty o' room fer all o' us in it. I'm gettin' along in years
an' there's nobody to take care o' me when I break down, so I
want to make a little stake afore I die. Now you leave me
be."</p>

<p>Lilly checked an impulse to step forward between the men. His
sharp eyes caught the stiffening muscles beneath Trono's coat and
the sudden flare of fire in Trono's eyes. The killer instinct was
there; he had seen such a light before. But, on the verge of
acting, he took hold of himself. It was not his quarrel and
nobody had asked him to interfere. The strictest kind of
unwritten rules guarded such an affair and held him in his place.
Even so, as he watched Trono gather himself, he had come to a
decision. Trono's voice droned throughout the room.</p>

<p>"Callin' me a trouble maker, you damn fool? Come back here an'
drink!"</p>

<p>What passed in the succeeding moments was something that only
swift eyes might see. Trono's arm dropped and seemed to waver. It
was only a gesture, yet it might have been the first move to draw
his gun. The nester, badgered until his nerves were torturing
him, saw that gesture and copied it. But where Trono had been
clever, he was only clumsy. He could not feint. One paw started
downward and could not stop. After that it was murder. Trono's
gun gleamed in the light; the room rocked and roared and someone
cried out a warning. That was Tom Lilly's voice, though he never
knew it. His eyes, passing from side to side, saw the nester
struggle with his weapon and stand a moment; then like a man
crushed by a burden, he buckled at the knees and fell forward.
The life was out of him before he struck the floor. His lean,
bewildered face stared dumbly through the trailing gun smoke. Not
a soul in that room moved, not a word was spoken until Trono's
harsh voice broke the spell.</p>

<p>"You boys saw it. You saw he went for his gun. I'd 'a' been
plugged cold if I'd waited. Plain self-defense, understand? Such
actions is about all you can expect from a nester." And he swept
the crowd with a hard, cold glance. For one instant his attention
was fixed on Tom Lilly; then he walked from the place. Lilly
rubbed his hands along his coat edge and tried to clear the
unreasoning, white-hot rage from his head. A kind of whistling
sigh passed ever the onlookers and the bartender's carefully
indifferent words reached him.</p>

<p>"Some o' you gents lug him into the side room. I don't want my
floors all bloodied up."</p>

<p>Lilly turned away from the sight and built himself a cigarette
with unusually awkward fingers. One of the men at the near table
shuffled a deck and spoke philosophically. "Well, that's another
chalked up to Theed Trono in behalf o' the JIB. God-darnit, why
didn't the fool stay clear o' Trono?"</p>

<p>Lilly bent forward, speaking with a sharp rise o| voice. "Does
this Trono hombre run this JIB rancho?"</p>

<p>The group at the table turned toward him and spent some time
in a carefull inspection. He was rewarded finally by a brief
word. "Not exactly, stranger. Though I'd say he had a-plenty to
say about it. Fact is, he's old Jim Breck's foreman. Who is Jim
Breck? You shorely must be from distant parts. Jim Breck is chief
factotum o' Pilgrim Valley."</p>

<p>"And where might that be?"</p>

<p>"South thirty miles or so. It's behind the string o' Buttes
you might see from here of a day. Though if yore lookin' fer a
job you won't have to ride that far."</p>

<p>"I'm han'somely obliged, but I mistrust my ability to work
under that Trono gent," said Lilly. "I take it this here nester
occupied unhealthy soil."</p>

<p>"Well, you can read the picture an' title fer yourself,"
answered his informant somewhat briefly, and turned away. Lilly
understood the meaning of this perfectly. Trono, he decided, in a
wave of disgust, had Powder buffaloed. He said as much in an
audible phrase that was addressed at nobody in particular. It was
meant to provoke attention and it succeeded admirably. The group
turned on him with sharpened interest and the spokesman put a
direct question. "Who the hell are you, amigo, to tell us what
the trouble is? You a candidate for the unpopularity
contest?"</p>

<p>"I'm just a simple creature," murmured Lilly, "that never
learned the a-b-c's from any book. But I was always taught murder
was a crime."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you'd like to try yore luck with Theed Trono."</p>

<p><br> Lilly ground the cigarette beneath his boot heel and
stared at a group with a cold directness. Ice edged his words.
"You can bet your last chip, fellow, that if I ever do, there'll
be more'n one bullet fired. That's information for general
publication." He swung and left the saloon, knowing that every
soul within the room had heard his last statement. Knowing, too,
that in time the challenge would reach Theed Trono. He had meant
it as a deliberate challenge; etiquette had kept him out of a
poor nester's trouble, but there was nothing in the books that
forbade a man starting an entirely new quarrel if he was so
minded. As he walked somberly down the dark street he had a clear
picture of Trono's savage, bullying face. Why, the man had
committed the coldest kind of murder and these fellows stayed
glued to their seats! It was enough to rouse the spirit of an
Eskimo, for a fact. What sort of a fool was this Trono and what
kind of an outfit was the JIB to allow such free-handed
killing?</p>

<p>He paused in front of the livery stable, sympathies more and
more engaged in the affairs of the dead nester. There was a
volcanic upheaval inside him and he stared narrowly through the
dark, recalling the sage words of Joe Breedlove. "I nev yit did
know a redheaded gent that wa'n't burnin' to right the wrongs of
this yere unjust world." Well, that wasn't exactly so. He, Tom
Lilly, wasn't going around with a chip on his shoulder, but there
certainly was such a thing as fair play in the world.</p>

<p>The stable roustabout ambled out of the doorway and murmured.
"Ain't the flesh pots lured yuh yet?"</p>

<p>Tom Lilly built another cigarette and began delving for
information. "Once upon a time there was a nester&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I heard that shot in the saloon. The ways o' man are
plumb mortal."</p>

<p>"Where might that nester have had his claim, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Jes' inside Pilgrim Valley, offen the road to the JIB about
four miles. They's a nice cold spring on the place, which shore
has been poison bait fer many a foolish feller."</p>

<p>"In other words," said Lilly, "the JIB has sort of illegally
swallowed a lot of gov'ment entry land along with its rightful
range an' objects to a man peaceably settlin' thereon."</p>

<p>"If yore askin' fer an opinion I ain't got any. If it's a
question o' facts, then I guess you don't need no correction on
the foregoin' statement."</p>

<p>"Well, it's an old game," murmured Lilly. "But mos' usually a
cattle outfit will draw the line at cold murder. Pilgrim Valley,
I reckon, is exclusively JIB territory?"</p>

<p>The roustabout happily fell upon a remembered phrase. "The
memory o' man runneth not to the contrary."</p>

<p>"Sho'," approved Lilly, glowering at the shadows. A vague
excitement gripped him and he felt a sense of personal injury.
Theed Trono was taking in too much territory and so was a ranch
that tried to keep settlers off government land. Boiled down, it
amounted to nothing more than a curtailment of his own liberty,
for if the nester was shooed off, then they'd shoo him off too.
No, that was a situation hardly bearable. He threw away the
cigarette with a hunch on his shoulders. "Ain't there a land
office here?"</p>

<p>"Over the gen'ral store. See the yaller light? He sleeps
there, too. An old dodo bird that come out here to die an' ain't
been lucky at it yit." As Lilly drifted away the roustabout sent
a warning whisper after him. "Don't you be a fool, amigo."</p>

<p>"It's a man's born privilege," replied Lilly, crossing the
street. "A privilege I shore do exercise a lot, too," he said to
himself, climbing the stairway. He steered for a door emitting a
single beam of light through the keyhole and knocked once. A
grumbling invitation was evoked and he entered a room that was
both an office and a kind of living quarters. On an army cot
behind the counter&mdash;a counter heaped with record books and
plat maps&mdash;was stretched an ancient fellow with tobacco
stained whiskers and a parchment skin. Amber eyes moved fretfully
toward Lilly. "What you want?"</p>

<p>"Aim to file on some land."</p>

<p>The old fellow stroked his faded whiskers and grinned a
toothless grin. "Wal, my conscience is clear, friend. Takes a lot
o' people to make the world. Don't never say I encouraged
you."</p>

<p>"Cheerfulness," opined Lilly, "is a priceless thing. Don't get
up if it hurts you, though I'd like to have you show me one
particular spot on yore maps."</p>

<p>The old man groaned and hoisted himself an inch at a time.
"Ain't there nothin' I can do to restore sanity. Le's see; have
you got a thousand dollars, a copper lined stomach, the strength
o' a horse? Have you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yore makin' that up," interrupted Lilly. "Just state gov'ment
requirements."</p>

<p>"Upon which portion of this earth's crust do you aim to take
root?"</p>

<p>"Why, there was a claim relinquished half an hour ago by a
gentleman in Jake Miner's place. It's over in Pilgrim Valley an'
it's got a spring on it. I don't doubt but what you recall the
spot."</p>

<p>The answer came quickly enough. The old man's face drooped a
little and he made aimless figures on the counter with his
pencil. "If the advice of a friend is worth anything, my boy,
<i>you</i> don't want land there."</p>

<p>"JIB got you buffaloed, too?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "I'm too far along to mind bein'
shot. It'd be a blessin' to die that sudden. But they wouldn't
tackle a government official. You watch your step."</p>

<p>"Show me this place," insisted Lilly. And the old man
displaying visible reluctance, turned the book to a certain page
and with traveling pencil point indicated the homestead. "Hamby
was a nice feller, too," he opined. "I thought it was jes' an
ordinary shot when I heard it. Well, you understand, there's
formalities to go through with before you can file. If you want
to squat until then it'll be all right. Better take lots of
cattridges."</p>

<p>Lilly turned toward the door. "Consider me as bein' entered,
then. I'm here to stay." He walked out, going cautiously down the
stairway. There was a matter of supplies to take care of, but
these could wait until later in the evening. Right at present he
felt inclined to return to Jake Miner's place; he had laid an egg
there that by now ought to have hatched something. Poised in the
doorway he heard voices floating through the darkness and by and
by Theed Trono came into the small reflection of the hotel light.
There was another man with him&mdash;the tall, horsey-faced type
familiar throughout the cattle country. England was stamped all
over the long, out-thrust chin and the prominent nose. Only for a
moment were they suspended in this yellow beam. Lilly tarried
thoughtfully, mind revolving around several pieces of information
he had gathered. What he now proposed to do was enter Pilgrim
Valley and challenge Theed Trono's attention; Theed Trono, who
was a killer foreman walking under the protection of the JIB, and
its owner. Men seemed to be reluctant to speak of the owner of
this ranch. The roustabout had mentioned his name&mdash;it was
Jim Breck&mdash;casually and with no desire to go on. And the
nester had called him an octopus. Fitting title.</p>

<p>"Well, if Breck instigated the shootin' the devil will shorely
pay him for it."</p>

<p>With this reflection he advanced on the saloon and pushed
through the door and into trouble. Trono was at the bar, his eyes
quite hard and bright; when he saw Lilly advancing he put his
whisky glass carefully on the bar and thrust his bullet head
forward as if wishing a closer view of this new specimen. Once
again Lilly was aware of the pervading silence of the expectancy
half-veiled in men's eyes. The Englishman, he noticed, had not
entered the saloon.</p>

<p>"Amigo, I been hearin' things about yuh."</p>

<p>It was Trono's voice, unpleasant and blunt. Lilly inclined his
head, eyes pinned on the burly one. "Always been my policy to
declare myself," he admitted. "Whatever you heard about me
goes."</p>

<p>"Uhuh. Pass some remark about more'n one bullet flyin?"</p>

<p>"That's correct."</p>

<p>"Ain't you a little previous with them rash words?" growled
Trono. He closed the fingers of one hand as if to show Lilly the
power that was in his arm. "Usually a gent don't go huntin' fer
trouble."</p>

<p>"Fatal error of my education," admitted Lilly.</p>

<p>"It's apt to be fatal, shore enough," said Trono, displeasure
growing. "I think I got an apology comin' from you. Gettin'
pretty bad when a man can't perform his chores 'thout bein'
libelled. I'm listenin'."</p>

<p>"You'll listen a long, long while, hombre," replied Lilly. He
had a hard struggle with the flame of outraged anger that blazed
up. "To shorten this palaver I will add that I don't like yore
methods or yore manners. I hear you don't allow nesters in
Pilgrim Valley. Tomorrow mornin' I'll be on my way up there.
You'll find me squattin'. Better change yore style, mister,
before you try to run me off."</p>

<p>Fighting talk. A cooler head would not have invited trouble in
such a way. But Tom Lilly's sympathies were in control and he was
willing to force the issue. He saw quite clearly that sooner or
later he would clash with this Trono and he was willing that the
fight should come and be done with. Trono seemed plunged in deep
thought, studying Lilly with a long, deliberate glance. Evidently
the swart foreman saw something in his adversary that bade him
move carefully. Lilly was no half-broken nester. That gun butt
was placed in the careful manner of a man who had experience.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "if yore lookin' fer trouble, they's
folks that'll oblige yuh. Personally I'm a peaceable man&mdash;"
He seemed to feel that he was losing ground, so he finished with
a huge roar. "But I'll give yuh twenty-four hours to pull
freightl After that I'm shootin' at sight!"</p>

<p>"A large and clear statement," observed Lilly and turned
squared around. It was fifteen feet to the door and at each step
he expected to hear a warning shout. None came. He reached the
street with mingled regret and relief. "I shore played my cards
to the limit that time. Joe Breedlove wouldn't scarcely care for
such sword-swallowin'."</p>

<p>There was another question in his mind and he re-traced his
steps to ask it of the roustabout. "Say, tell me somethin' more
about this Jim Breck."</p>

<p>The answer rolled solemnly out of the doorway. "Sooner or
later, amigo, he'll cross yore path. An' you won't never fergit
it. That's the old Octopus."</p>

<p>The meeting of Lancelot Stubbins and Theed Trono had been very
brief and very private. Only by a moment of carelessness had
Stubbins permitted himself to be drawn into the patch of light
near the hotel. It was here that Lilly had seen the man's English
features, and in turn Stubbins had caught a glimpse of the
newcomer. The next moment he had pulled Trono into the helter of
the shadows, grumbling at his own negligence. "That was foolish.
Well, I'll turn into this alley. Trono, I wish you could hustle
things a bit."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night is plenty soon, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"How's Breck now?"</p>

<p>"Seems like he's losin' his grip faster ner usual. He don't
get around like he used to a month back."</p>

<p>"His kind goes down all in a pile," observed Stubbins. "I
don't believe it'll be long now. Then you and I can do what we
want to."</p>

<p>Trono was dubious. "You got to consider the girl, Stubbins.
She's a fighter like her daddy."</p>

<p>Stubbins laughed. "Trono, I've got a way with women. Don't let
that worry you. It's only old Jim Breck I'm afraid of. He's stung
me too many times when I thought he was licked. We can afford to
wait. Tomorrow night, then, at the usual place."</p>

<p>"Uhuh," said Trono, started toward the saloon. Stubbins looked
back toward the hotel and saw Tom Lilly advancing also upon the
saloon. But the stranger made no particular impression on
Stubbins, whose mind was filled with other things, and thus
preoccupied he slipped between buildings and rode from town.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE OCTOPUS</h2>

<p class="first"><i>"This bein' a bad man is shorely a tough job, fer sooner er later they's bound to come a leetle bit badder man who's honin' to shoot off the tie."&mdash;Joe Breedlove.</i> </p>

<br>

<p class="first">AT false dawn Tom Lilly was away from Powder,
heading south toward the Buttes. By sunrise he had crossed the
railroad tracks and penetrated a land that boasted neither house
nor windmill nor fence. It was strictly cattle country and for
the greater part of the morning he traveled across it, marching
directly upon the high bluffs and then paralleling them until the
road swung sharply upward and passed through a gap into a kind of
elevated valley. This, Lilly had discovered from the maps, was
Jim's Pass and the only entrance to Pilgrim Valley from the west.
He turned his horse up the side of the gap and stopped on a
commanding point What he saw caused him to whistle softly and
build a cigarette in deep meditation.</p>

<p>The valley, ringed on three sides by the Buttes and merging
into a pine forest far to the south, was a self-contained, almost
inaccessible land. No such thing as a fence was needed and since
it was a great deal higher than the country outside and below the
Buttes it drew more moisture and was visited with a cooler air.
The buffalo grass, just turning yellow, covered the valley in a
solid mat as far as his eyes could reach. It was an astonishing
contrast to the dead area stretching west and north. No wonder
Jim Breck, the octopus, wanted to keep out interlopers. The sight
of it explained a great many things to Tom Lilly and as his eyes
wandered out upon the plain below him he recalled stray gossip he
had pumped from the reticent roustabout.</p>

<p>That road, for instance, which drifted away before it reached
Jim's Pass and vanished into the desert. He had learned that it
led to the 3Cross, an outfit owned by an Englishman called
Stubbins. Stubbins, the roustabout had cautiously implied, ruled
the country outside of Pilgrim Valley and had even tried to
penetrate the JIB domain. But old Jim Breck had fought him to a
standstill, using the heavy-handed methods common to the country.
Ever since they had dwelt side by side in an uneasy attitude of
peace; just two gents, the roustabout had indicated, trying to
cut each other's throat and alike only in the manner they hazed
unwelcome newcomers out of the country.</p>

<p>Lilly pinched out his cigarette and threw it away, turning
down into the valley. Five miles farther on he reached a small
trail that darted from the road toward the pine forest and this
he followed for something like an hour when of a sudden he dipped
over a ridge and came upon a shanty nestling between three or
four young cottonwoods. The soil had been broken around the house
and corn was coming up; a piece of fence had been built and a
plow stood idle in the yard. Tom slid from the horse, took his
sack of supplies and pushed through the door.</p>

<p>Typical bachelor's quarters. The dead Hamby had spent very
little time in housekeeping. A long row of nails stretched around
the walls from which hung most everything capable of being
suspended. A pine table, a bunk, a chair, and a stove well filled
the place. All there was of food stood on the table and Lilly saw
at a glance that the nestcr had allowed himself to get very low
before venturing to town. The man must have understood his danger
and put off the trip as long as possible. The thought revived
Lilly's sulphurous anger and on sight of a riflc hanging above
the doorway he walked over and took it down, sliding the bolt
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow, I sure can't help you any, but I can show
this JIB crew a few things about land rights."</p>

<p>That reminded him he meant to pay a visit. So, after watering
his horse from the spring at the rear of the shanty and eating a
can of cold beans, he swung up and rode east. Somewhere beyond
the grassy ridges was the JIB home quarters. What he meant to do
was state his intentions to the so-called octopus and withdraw.
After that it was a case of listening for the thunder to roll
across the sky.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly at the thought of turning nester. Twenty-four
hours before he would have taken the idea in great and
unbelieving humor. Why, he hardly ever turned around unless on
the back of a horse. And as for struggling behind the handles of
a plow&mdash;"Joe Breedlove shore would laugh," he murmured,
closing his eyes against the glare of the day. "Oh, I know I'm
hot-headed. It's been proved plenty times enough. But, by the
Lord, that shootin' would make a wooden Indian cuss. If this
ain't a free land it's high time somebody changed things."</p>

<p>And as he was thus plunged deep in a study he crossed a ridge
and saw the many buildings of the JIB ranch stretched before him.
The place took him back forty years to the time of the Indian
wars. Once upon a time there had been a stockade stretched around
the place, an occasional mark of which still was visible. Within
this stockade they had built the dozen or so houses in the shape
of a square, with the main house sitting in the middle of the
great yard thus formed. All were built of logs and the center
house, a single storied structure sixty feet long, had elbows
built at each corner with rifle embrasures cut through; atop a
sod roof a cupola likewise hewn of logs commanded all angles of
the yard. A porch ran the length of the place, upon which at
intervals opened heavy oak doors.</p>

<p>Men moved slowly about. Dust rose out of a remote corral and a
horse sunfished upward through the haze with a man weaving
perilously in the saddle. At another corner several Indians
seemed busy around a fire. As Lilly drew rein before the main
house he was hailed by a rumbling voice.</p>

<p>"Sit an' light."</p>

<p>Tom had to look around a pine pillar to see the man, and at
once knew him to be the redoubtable Jim Breck. He was sprawled in
a chair, his massive body overflowing it&mdash;a body that even
with the accumulated layers of fat displayed something of the
tremendous muscles that once must have stretched across the
shoulders. The head was square and seemed hewn out of so much
granite, each feature chiseled roughly and generously. The
Octopus, someone had called him. Well, it was a good nickname.
Even so Lilly was not prepared exactly for the rest of the
picture. Here was an old man, a sick man; one who sat very still
and listened to the sound of his own heart as it labored toward
the end of its journey. A gray, dust-like pallor was on the face
and the lips were almost colorless; a strange and depressing
spectacle of a mighty frame going to pieces. Still, there was
fire in those grim eyes. It flashed out now, fitfully.</p>

<p>"Come out o' the sun, young man. We'll eat shortly."</p>

<p>At this moment an ancient, skinny Indian slipped around the
corner of the house and reached for Lilly's reins.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe I will, thanks. It ain't right to traffic
on a man's hospitality. I take it yore Jim Breck. Such bein' the
case I don't reckon I could eat comfortable at your table."</p>

<p>One mighty shoulder rose and fell. "Knew somethin' was itchin'
you when I saw you comin' over the rise. Say it, younker."</p>

<p>"I'm settlin' on the three-sixty over at the spring. I aim to
stay, notwithstandin' yore foreman. Just wanted to declare
myself."</p>

<p>Jim Breck sat motionless, his eyes exploring Lilly. After a
long interval he answered almost gently. "The fightin' kind,
ain't you? Somethin's roused yore sense o' justice. But it's too
late, Red. They's a nester on that place now. A fellow by the
name o' Hamby."</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "Yore foolin' me, Mister Breck. You ought
to know better."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Breck with an increase of energy.</p>

<p>"Yore foreman bullied him into a fight. Shot him dead." Lilly
was unable to keep the anger from his words. "About as dirty a
piece o' work as I've seen in my time. Don't you draw the line at
anything?"</p>

<p>"So," muttered Breck. His chin fell forward and he fumbled in
his pocket for a cigar. He looked wistfully at it, then with a
defiant gesture put it in his mouth. "So that's got you excited.
Hornin' in on another party's misfortune. 'Tain't a safe game,
son. But yore kind don't care about playin' safe. Reckon you've
got me gauged as a hop toad, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yore reputation is on public record," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, that's so," murmured Breck in a gentle voice. "But I
was raised in a hard school. Had to fight my way. Don't this
ranch look like it was built to stand siege? If you observe them
logs you'll see bullet marks a-plenty."</p>

<p>"That ain't no answer for shootin' a nester."</p>

<p>Fire gleamed in the eyes again. "Mebbee 'tain't. When a man
gets to the end o' the road an' looks back he sees plenty things
different than he used to. Well, I like yore spunk. I could
shorely use a fighter on this ranch. Want a job?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lilly. "I'm obliged, but that's not my politics.
The world ain't goin' to be large enough for Trono an' me, let
alone a ranch. Anyhow, I'm camped off yonder an' I wanted to let
you know."</p>

<p>"Pleased to know a man's real feelin's," agreed Breck. He
started to add something, but was interrupted. A door opened and
a woman's voice broke in. "Dad, are you disobeying the doctor?
You give me that cigar."</p>

<p>"Damn the pill peddler," muttered Breck, irritably. "If I got
to die, I got to die. But I'm goin' to have a leetle fun."</p>

<p>Lilly turned in the saddle and without knowing just why,
removed his hat. She was a girl of perhaps eighteen or twenty; a
sturdy supple figure dressed in riding clothes. In the shadow of
the porch her eyes glowed and there was a rose-pink color on her
cheeks. She took the cigar from her father in a quick, defensive
movement "You won't help yourself, so I must treat you like a
baby." Then she saw Lilly and a smile flashed out. Her black eyes
passed from man to man and the quick, open-handed hospitality of
the West prompted her to speak to the newcomer. "Won't you stop
for dinner?"</p>

<p>"I'm han'somely pleased," said Lilly, "but I've got to get
back to my place."</p>

<p>"You live near here?" she asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes'm. I'm taking up the homestead by the spring."</p>

<p>He saw friendliness vanish and resentment spring up.</p>

<p>Old Jim Breck's chuckle followed him away from the place and
far along the road home.</p>

<p>"Spitfire," he murmured. "She's got every bit of her daddy's
temper. But, by Godfrey, she's pretty! Now look what I'm
into."</p>

<p>The rest of the journey was made in heavy silence. This
meeting had greatly puzzled him. If Breck were so heavy-handed,
why hadn't the man challenged him on the spot? Instead he'd been
offered a job. Was the Octopus the kind that spoke softly and
struck in the dark? This affair was getting complicated and that
was a fact. There was only one thing he could depend on for a
certainty&mdash;Theed Trono's outright enmity.</p>

<p>Back on the porch, Jill Breck spoke her mind. "He certainly
has got his nerve riding deliberately over here to tell us that.
Did he mean, Dad, he was going in with Hamby?"</p>

<p>"Hamby died," answered Breck, staring into the bright yard.
"The lad's goin' to take over the homestead."</p>

<p>Jill fell silent for a moment. She was a loyal girl with an
immense pride for everything concerning the JIB. Nor was it her
fault that she did not know the seamier side of her father's
affairs. She had always thought that every acre within the valley
was owned in fee simple and she could never understand why
nesters dared to trespass. She had asked her father about this
once, but the reply had been so vague and technical that it only
served to strengthen her belief that her father was, in a kindly
way, trying to shield the lawless nesters. For she had never seen
other than kindness in her father. What he had been in his
younger days she never knew, and was never told. The stories of
the range wars came down to her as so much legend and whatever
the trouble occurring between JIB and 3Cross in later years, it
was carefully kept from her, just as it was kept from the outside
world.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry the man died. He was old and goodness knows
how he made a living, but he shouldn't have come on our land. And
I don't see why you allow this red-headed cowpuncher to defy you
like he did. I'll bet he's a Stubbins' man. A nester doesn't wear
clothes like that, or ride like that."</p>

<p>"Uhuh. Jill, you go see about the grub."</p>

<p>When she had disappeared inside, Breck spoke to the Indian who
had held Lilly's horse. "Pattipaws, you git Trono for me. Tell
him I want him."</p>

<p>The Indian was away on the run, leaving Breck a morose, silent
figure. "Seems there's a lot o' things passin' on hereabouts I
don't have wind of lately. Trono's forcin' my hand. Well, I allus
knew what sort of man he was. If he's tryin' to out-nigger me,
it's my own fault."</p>

<p>Trono rolled around the corner of the house, a surly
indifferent man built in the same mold as his boss. Breck, eyeing
the foreman, concluded that was the reason he had kept the
foreman so long. Here was the image of himself as he had been in
earlier days&mdash;huge and tireless, without compunction, a hard
driver. If Trono, in addition, had the handicap of being without
loyalty and was a dirty fighter in his rages, Breck had shut his
eyes. Trono had accomplished the necessary and unmentionable JIB
chores; that was the service he had required. But now Trono was
assuming too much; he was becoming intractable.</p>

<p>"Well?" muttered the foreman.</p>

<p>Breck closed his great fists. "Who told you to kill
Hamby?"</p>

<p>Trono smiled. "How d'yuh know?"</p>

<p>"Don't trim with me, you yellow-belly!" cried Breck. "Ain't I
told you to leave Hamby alone?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's all the good it did yuh. If yore goin' to call
names, I'll call a few myself. Yore gettin' chicken-hearted.
Losin' yore grip. I tried to use peaceable means on that nester,
but he was pigheaded, so I killed him. Since when've you changed
idees on that subject? Wa'n't long ago when you sent me out with
a gun fer those fellas."</p>

<p>The gray color swept down into Breck's collar and his hand
pressed at his heart. "The world ain't the same to an old man,
Theed. Was a time when the whole valley wasn't elbow room enough.
Well, I'm more peaceable now to'rds neighbors. Y'see, about all
the land I'll be needin' is a strip six feet by three."</p>

<p>Trono ripped out a short and ugly word. "I killed Hamby fer my
own personal satisfaction like I used to do certain jobs fer you.
An' I'll kill any other gent tha tries to squat on that
spring."</p>

<p>"You got my orders on that, Trono," said Breck, speaking in a
dead level tone. "Mean to disobey me?"</p>

<p>Trono was grinning. It was the same tight, malevolent grin
Lilly had witnessed the night before in Jake Miner's place; the
man was riding his victory high and wide. "Who's talkin' about
obedience? I'm a free man, Breck."</p>

<p>Breck leaned forward, one trembling forefinger tapping the arm
of his chair. "Listen, Theed. Nobody ever crossed me yet an' got
away with it. Which applies to you. Yore my foreman. I picked you
outen trouble an' I give you a job when other folks wanted to tie
you to a limb. Now, boy, don't try any rannies or I'll bust you.
I'll bust you, hear? You do my orders an' you do 'em on the jump.
What's more, keep away from the spring. They's a new man there
and he's welcome to the place. I suspect he's more'n a match fer
you, at that."</p>

<p>Trono's features suffused with a purplish red. "That redhead
eh? So he come tellin' you tales. I give him twenty-four hours to
pull out an' by Godfrey he'd better take the warnin'!"</p>

<p>"You got my orders, Trono!"</p>

<p>"To hell with you, Breck. I'll do as I please. You start a
fight with me an' I'm apt to show you a few surprises on this
yere ranch. Think that over!"</p>

<p>He wheeled off toward the bunkhouse. Breck saw him stop,
whisper something to one of the hands and jerk a thumb toward the
porch, nodding his head derisively. The old man relaxed in his
chair, breathing hard. A grinding pain ran from his neck down his
left arm and a old sweat covered him from head to foot. Of a
sudden he was very weak and the world grew dim and distant. He
seemed to be apart from his body&mdash;watching himself die.
Well, he had a few regrets. He had lived his share of years,
lived them up to the hilt and had all the fun any man could have
wished. A few things, perhaps, he would like to have the power of
undoing. But life wasn't that way; once a man played his hand
there was no recalling it.</p>

<p>No, it wasn't for himself, but for his girl that he worried.
Trono had the upper hand now, and Trono was a disloyal, self-
seeking dog. Why hadn't he considered this long ago when he could
have crushed the man with his fist? What would happen to the
place after he died? Jill was a hard-headed little kid with a
world of spunk, but she couldn't run a cattle ranch without help
and she couldn't buck Trono if he was of a mind to make trouble.
And the foreman meant to make trouble; the man's last warning
indicated as much. There were a dozen ways in which a ranch could
be stripped, mined and made unbearable for the girl. Breck
gripped his hands together, feeling the sweat roll down his
sleeves. This helplessness was something new, something
terrible.</p>

<p>"I'm of a mind to kill him, by the Lord!" He groaned, and he
thought of getting his gun and calling Trono back. Shoot him
cold. Once he would have had no scruples, but the stomach was out
of him now, just as the foreman had said.</p>

<p>The day grew dimmer and the sunshine turned to shadow. In the
dim borderland which is passed by man but once he found himself
thinking of Tom Lilly. There was a fighting heart and an honest
face. He had seen men like that before. He had ruined men like
that before. Ruined them and laughed. But there was no laughter
in him now. "Jill," he muttered, "Jill! You send for the pill
peddler. And bring Pattipaws to me. I've got one more shot in the
barrel yet."</p>

<p><br> Tom Lilly ate his supper, rolled a cigarette and sat in
the doorway watching the sun go down over the Buttes. With the
lengthening shadows came a breeze that soughed through the
cottonwoods and lulled him to a lazy, dreaming peace. There were
plenty of things to think about, but for a time he let his fancy
roll where it pleased. It was a mighty queer feeling, this, of
being perched high above the heat of the desert and watching the
world turn around from his own doorstep. Of course, it wasn't
really his yet, but it would be. He meant to camp. The rolling
stone had found a mighty fine place to grow a little moss.</p>

<p>"Joe Breedlove would shore laugh," he murmured. Tom Lilly a
nester. Well, worse things had happened. Clerking in a store, for
example, or doing roustabout's work in a stable. And this land
suited him right down to the grass roots. He ran his eyes along
the unfinished fence with a professional interest and he began to
calculate the amount of hand labor that lay before him. There was
plenty of it&mdash;but there was plenty of time, too. First and
foremost, he would be busy with the JIB and its efforts to remove
him from the valley.</p>

<p>So he sat until it was quite dark. Then he rose and lugged his
saddle to a ridge a hundred yards left of the house and returned
for his pony. It wouldn't do to sleep in the shack this night.
Unless he was greatly mistaken there would be visitors along to
see him. He picketed the buckskin in a hollow and rolled himself
in a blanket, staring upward at the inky sky. It was very
strange, this feeling of restfulness that took hold. Most usually
he was always wanting to go on, always wanting to see the land
beyond the ridge. He chuckled. "I'll have to tell Joe about
this."</p>

<p>He wondered how much the girl knew of her father's affairs. By
George, but she was a pretty one, and with her little head plumb
full of fight! Those black eyes had changed powerfully quick from
friendliness to resentment when he announced himself. "I wonder
if she understands what her daddy and that Trono person have been
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>The question was pushed to the back of his mind. The ground
was telegraphing him the beat of many hoofs coming rapidly across
the swelling valley floor. He rolled from his blanket and touched
the butt of his gun; the rumbling grew louder and presently a
party swept over the ridge and toward his house. He heard them
stop and made out the murmur of voice. A match flared and by it
he saw the dim blur of a face. According to the noise of the
horses there must have been a half dozen in the party and they
appeared to be waiting. A horse blubbered softly and a stray word
floated over the still air. "Late."</p>

<p>This was interesting. Lilly gathered himself and crept down
the side of the ridge until he made out the faint outline of men
and beasts. In a few moments he heard the rumbling of another
rider and he stopped, plastering himself to the ground. The
newcomer spurred out of the east and reined in with a jingling of
gear. A heavy, grumbling voice that was quite familiar to him
floated across the black gulf of space. "Hey, Stubbins, this is a
hell of a place to stop. They's that red-head around here. He's
took up Hamby's claim."</p>

<p>A ripping, explosive oath. Men dropped out of their saddles
and circled around the house. A match flared again and by it
Lilly saw someone move in and out the door of the shanty. "Well,"
announced a voice, "He ain't here now. Guess he got cold feet an'
departed. Whyn't you let me know this before, Trono?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't able to get away. Been a lot o' thunder raised at the
rancho."</p>

<p>"Old man gettin' ticklish, eh?"</p>

<p>"I told him where to head in," muttered Trono. He was in the
saddle again, moving toward Lilly's position. "And I give this
red-head twenty-four hours to vamoose, but he's plumb bull-faced
an' won't scare. Can't have him puttin' his long nose into our
affairs, Stubbins."</p>

<p>"Well, if he meddles he'll get badly scorched," replied the
Englishman. "No great worry about that. You're always issuin'
some sort of a challenge, me lad. Better salve yourself. And I
wouldn't cross old Jim. He's a tough fellow. Easy does it."</p>

<p>"Pussyfoot," snorted Trono. He was within ten feet of Lilly,
turning from side to side in his saddle. "That don't get you
nowhere."</p>

<p>"Sometimes it does," countered the Englishman. "The trouble
with you, me lad, is that you fail to understand when a soft word
will do the work of a hard one. I have no scruples about
violence, you mind. But I'd rather take the easy path than the
hard one. There is trouble enough in this country without
creating more. Well, let's haze these brutes out of the timber
before daylight. Onward."</p>

<p>The party drifted around the shack and were lost in the rising
ground to the south. Lilly rose and returned to his blanket,
piercing together diverse bits of information. Trono was a JIB
man and Stubbins ran the 3Cross. Why all this fraternizing when
the two outfits were in a state of armed truce? The answer was
simple enough. Trono was knifing his boss. This night party was
making a raid on JIB stock; they meant to break the old Octopus
who was no longer able to fight for himself. Lilly shook his head
in disgust. "I'd as lief sleep with a skunk as have any business
with Trono. The doggone doublecrosser! If he ain't even loyal to
his own outfit he ain't fit to be shot." Perhaps old Jim Breck
was unscrupulous, but it was plain dirty to knife a man when he
was down. And so he drifted off to a light slumber, mildly
sympathizing with the man he had not long before defied.</p>

<p>He had trained himself to wake at the slightest sound. Yet
when he did wake it was at no sound, but rather from a sense of
danger close by. Even before his eyes opened the nerves at the
back of his neck sent a chilly warning through him and he groped
for his gun, rolling swiftly aside from his blanket. Gray dawn
had come and at his very feet, crouched, was the skinny Indian
buck who had held his reins the day before, Pattipaws. The Indian
had crept within five feet of Lilly without betraying himself and
now as he saw Lilly rising up in self-defense he held out a hand,
palm to the front, and the inscrutable copper-colored visage
moved from side to side. "Pattipaws a frien'. You come with me.
Boss he want to see you now."</p>

<p>Lilly studied the Indian with mild indignation. "You shore had
me in a hole, Smoke Face. First time I was ever trapped like
that."</p>

<p>"Indian way," said Pattipaws briefly. His faded, murky eyes
played across Lilly's face for a long while. He put out his hand.
"We frien's. Come."</p>

<p>Lilly saddled and swung up. The Indian trotted over the ridge
and reappeared on a flea-bitten paint pony, riding bareback.
Together they galloped eastward toward the ranch. Rose dawn
suffused the sky and the light, cold air carried the heavy
aromatic smell of the sage. Lilly bent toward Pattipaws. "This a
peace talk, Smoke Face, or are we raisin' the hatchet?"</p>

<p>"Plenty peace, plenty trouble," said Pattipaws, his moccasined
heels banging at the paint pony's flanks. "Boss, he dyin'."</p>

<p>And when they reached the ranch and entered the house Lilly
found old Jim Breck lying in bed, the massive face turned to the
color of old ivory. But there was still a gleam in the heavy
eyes; when he saw Lilly he smiled in a grim sort of way at his
daughter and an elderly man who bent over him. "I'm playin' my
last card," he muttered and for a moment was silent, collecting
his energy. Short, clipped words issued from his strangely
immobile lips.</p>

<p>"Red, you come to this country lookin' fer trouble. Well,
you're goin' to get it. I'm passin' out. You take my cards from
now on. I'm makin' you foreman on the spot. Ain't time to tell
you what to do, or what to watch for. But&mdash;you'll have to
fight Trono. He's bent on bustin' the JIB. Act as if this place
belonged to you. Jill understands. Take care of the kid. You
promise?"</p>

<p>The elderly man, who appeared to be a doctor, leaned over to
mark Breck's flagging pulse and shook his head in warning. Lilly,
plunged in a profound and wondering study, saw the girl fasten a
sharp glance on him that had all the effect of a blow. Then she
dismissed him with a pressure of her lips and turned toward her
father, her hands tightly clenched and her whole body rigid.
"Father, what is it you are doing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," assented Lilly. "You don't know me."</p>

<p>"I've seen yore kind afore," muttered Breck. "Know you right
down to the ground. I'm bankin' on you, Red. It's a go!"</p>

<p>"It's a go," said Lilly in a gentle voice. "But there'll have
to be a showdown with Trono. You don't know half o' what he's up
to."</p>

<p>"I can guess," replied Breck, grimly. His chest filled and
swelled under the bed covers. "Damnation I'd like to be strong
fer five minutes. I'd break him with my two hands!"</p>

<p>"That," broke in the doctor, "is no way to leave the earth.
You'd better get a little charity in your system, Jim. You'll
need it."</p>

<p>"I ain't no hypocrite," said Breck. "A man can't change
himself in the last five minutes." His face turned toward
Pattipaws who stood silently in the background. Of a sudden the
room was filled with a guttural droning of the Bannock dialect,
at the end of which the Indian stepped between Lilly and the
girl, laying his hands on both and in turn tapping his own heart.
Gratitude crept over Breck's face&mdash;a strange emotion for
that heavy, granite countenance. "He'll stick when all the rest
are gone," said the old man, pointing toward the Indian. "I
fought this buck's tribe forty years ago. Made friends with 'em
and quartered 'em on the ranch. They'll be leavin' now, but
Pattipaws said he'd stick. He knows a few things that may be
helpful when the shootin' starts. Now, Jill girl, I don't want
you to feel harsh to'rds yore paw fer what he's told you in the
last couple hours. When a man plays with a deck that's been
marked by crooks, he's got to do the best he can. Doc, gimme a
cigar."</p>

<p>But the cigar was of no earthly use to him. He died before it
touched his mouth. Pattipaws turned sharply and darted out; in a
moment there was a long subdued wailing from the Indian quarters
and when Lilly left the room he saw the Bannocks filing slowly
away toward the pine forest, their travois raising dust in the
fresh morning air. One by one the cowhands began to collect in
front of the porch, staring at Lilly in the manner of men not
pleased by what they saw. The Octopus had departed and with him
went the iron discipline surrounding his name. Trouble brewed,
even as the doctor emerged and spoke briefly. "He's on his way,
boys. Said he wanted to be buried before noon. You know what to
do."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; SHOW-DOWN</h2>

<p class="first"><i>"When a gent figgers to pick a quarrel with
yuh, don't watch his eyes ner his gun arm. Keep yore orbs
plastered in the middle o' his chest. He'll telegraph his nex'
move from there."&mdash;Joe Breedlove.</i> </p>

<br>

<p class="first">IT was a hurried, brief funeral and of all the
crowd only Jill, the doctor and Pattipaws seemed to show grief at
the old Octopus' passing. The doctor, standing beside Lilly as
the grave was dug&mdash;on a knoll near the house&mdash;spoke
sadly. "He never was a hand for sentiment. Never gave any and
never expected any, except with Jill. There ought to be a parson
to say a few right words, but he wouldn't have it that way. Said
he wanted to be out of the road so he wouldn't be cluttering the
affairs of live folks. My boy, there was iron in old Jim!"</p>

<p>It was wholly a man's affair. Jill had taken leave of her
father in the bedroom and after that vanished somewhere in the
dark recesses of the house. One of the hands who was something of
a carpenter made a coffin and presently they were lowering it,
with its great burden, into the earth. All of the crew stood
about, with Theed Trono in the background. Lilly, turning his
eyes on the foreman, saw nothing of sympathy in the hard, coarse
face, nothing of regret. Rather, there was a kind of sardonic,
illy-concealed triumph on his countenance as the coffin vanished
from sight. It was an expression that, in varying shapes and
degrees, could be seen among the others also. The doctor,
conscious of his lack of Biblical knowledge, stooped and took up
a handful of soil, letting it trickle beneath his fingers.</p>

<p>"There ain't nothing I could say to speed Jim along," he
murmured. "There ain't much he'd want me to say. He always
figured he could fight his own way, here and hereafter. He never
needed help, he never turned color when he was in a hard fix. It
was always up and a-doing. He took his medicine and kept his
mouth shut. He was hard, but he never double crossed a friend and
he never pretended to be something he wasn't." The doctor pressed
his lips tightly together and surveyed the crew with a defiant,
unfriendly glance. "You won't ever see another like
him&mdash;never. Good hunting, Jim."</p>

<p>That was all. Pattipaws stretched his skinny hand toward the
west and turned away. Trono stepped to the fore and pulled his
gun, firing once into the air. "That was the sound he like best
to hear," he explained and stared at Lilly from beneath his heavy
lids. The newcomer met the challenge with a brief glance and
followed the doctor down the hill. On the porch he tarried,
building himself a cigarette and watching the crew drift slowly
toward the bunkhouse. The doctor went inside and presently came
out, looking very glum. As he climbed into the saddle he swept
the ranch with an arm and spoke.</p>

<p>"You got a job, boy. I don't envy you. But you better be
straight to the girl or I'll have something to say."</p>

<p>With that warning he galloped away, his little black satchel
flopping from the pommel and his coat-tails streaming in the
wind. In a moment he was beyond a ridge and out of sight, leaving
Lilly to his problem. The crew had disappeared and the yard baked
under the hard noon-day light. A Sunday's stillness pervaded the
place, but it was not the silence of peace. Lilly could feel a
threat in the warm, lazy air, a warning of trouble to come. Still
he smoked on as if serenely unconscious of impending danger.
Perhaps he put more of negligence in his bearing than he felt,
for he knew that from the windows of the bunkhouse he was being
surveyed by many pairs of eyes.</p>

<p>"If the old man had wanted to get even with me," he reflected,
"he shore couldn't have picked a better way. Here I am plumb in
the middle of uncertainty with nine chances out of ten that I'll
get my head shot off before sundown. A pleasant prospect. If I
got any value on my hide it'd be better for me to take a good
long pasear and never come back."</p>

<p>But he was only kidding himself. He was in this fight up to
his neck and he had no idea of backing out. Meanwhile time rolled
on and there was something being hatched over at the bunkhouse.
It would do no good standing here and letting them get the bulge
on him. He had to get busy. So he tossed the cigarette into the
yard and went through the door to the main room. It was dark and
cool in this long, low-beamed parlor and for a moment his eyes,
dilated by the sun, saw nothing.</p>

<p>He stood there on the threshold sweeping the dark corners
until he made out a figure huddled in a chair. A silent figure
who stared at him with hot, mistrustful eyes. She had been
crying, he could see that; but the tears had dried, leaving her
with somber, unpleasant thoughts. Lilly guessed that Breck had
told his daughter many things about the JIB she had never known
and that she was struggling now to reconcile them with her
father's kindness and with her own sense of loyalty. He hated to
break in, but he knew very well he had to come to some
understanding with this girl. He could not begin unless she
supported him, and already he felt he had in some manner aroused
her antagonism.</p>

<p>"Ma'am," said he, still on the threshold. "It's a hard time to
palaver, but we've got to thresh a few things out. What I want to
know is: Are you acceptin' me as foreman o' this ranch?"</p>

<p>He thought she had not heard him, so long was the silence. In
the end she moved her head slightly. "You heard what my father
told you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard. But I ain't heard what you think about it.
We've got to work together if we work at all."</p>

<p>The dam broke all of a sudden. "Who are you? What do I know
about you? What did my father know? He saw you twice and then
trusted you with the ranch&mdash;and with me. Am I to believe you
are the only honest man in the county?"</p>

<p>"As to that," said he, "I don't know. I'm not claimin' any
particular virtue for myself. But yore daddy appeared to be in
trouble and he thought I could help you. Give him a little credit
if you can't trust yore own eyes. That's about all I can ask.
Maybe there's lots of honest men hereabouts, but there's also a
considerable number o' crooks&mdash;a few of which are on this
ranch at the present time."</p>

<p>"How do you know? You rode into this country yesterday and now
you say you are quite honest and that the crew is not. That's
taking in a lot of ground."</p>

<p>"You heard what yore daddy said. I'm no prosecutin' attorney.
I've been given a job to do and I got to have yore help to do it.
If yore goin' to buck me I might as well roll my blankets."</p>

<p>"You know the way out," she reminded him. "You can quit now if
you want."</p>

<p>"I can," he admitted grimly, "but I won't. I give my word and
I'll keep it. Yore old enough to know better. Don't be so
foolish. I don't love this ranch, ma'am, and I don't hone to
assume any responsibility for its past misdemeanors. But we're in
a hole right now and we've got to pull together." He saw that he
had spoken more sharply than he meant so he tried to soften his
words. "There ain't any reason why you should jump on me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it! But can't you see&mdash;my father told me
things&mdash;! Everything is crooked, everything is opposite what
I've always believed it to be. Now you come and ask me to trust
you. How can I know that the men here are not loyal, or that you
are any better than they are&mdash;if they are not loyal?"</p>

<p>"You better believe me on that subject," said he. "And come to
a decision."</p>

<p>Again a long silence. There was a rumbling of voices outside,
a short distance from the house and the girl seemed to see the
tightening of Lilly's face muscles. "Well," she admitted, "I'll
do what my father asked. You are the foreman. But remember I have
the final say. I won't have you discharging men who have worked
here for years."</p>

<p>"We'll strive to please," said he, though he disliked her
assumption that she was doing him a favor. "But there'll have to
be a show-down between Trono and me. Unless I'm plumb wrong, one
of us has got to go. We'll know in a minute, for I think I hear a
committee."</p>

<p>When he reached the porch they were grouped around the
steps&mdash;every man who had been at the funeral. It was not a
committee, it was the whole crew and they were led by Trono who
was standing with his shoulders squared and a light of trouble in
his eyes. The man was reaching out now to new heights of
recklessness. The only power that had ever been able to check him
was gone and he had come to the point where he might work his own
will, whatever it was. Lilly understood instantly that Trono
regarded him as only a straw to be blown away, and at the thought
he scanned the crew with a careful, hopeful glance. But if he
hoped for supporters he was to be mistaken. The character of the
JIB cowpunchers was written quite plainly on their faces. With
the exception of one or two, they were the sort of men to be
found along the border, one jump from Mexico; restless,
unscrupulous men who hired out their services to the highest
bidder. They were not the type that ran a peaceful cattle ranch.
Lilly did not fail to note their white hands and the way their
gunbutts swung forward; the new foreman guessed that they were
better with the gun than with the rope.</p>

<p>Well, it was none of his business if this was the kind of a
puncher old Jim Breck had needed in his business. Many and many a
ranch had to have its professional fighters if it were to survive
the encroachment of other ranches. Still, this kind of warfare
was dying out; cattlemen used more peaceful methods and it was
something of a surprise to Lilly that the JIB still carried its
full complement of feudists. It would make his job the more
difficult. He stood immobile, trying to gauge the extent of their
hostility toward him; and while he was thus groping for the right
word to say Trono took the bit in his mouth and issued his
challenge.</p>

<p>"Don't yuh believe in signs, amigo?"</p>

<p>"Depends on the sign," replied Lilly amiably.</p>

<p>"Well, yuh heard my statement the other night. Yore twenty-
four hours is about up. I ain't a man to go back on my word. What
yuh doin' around here?"</p>

<p>Nothing could come of the delay or soft speech. Trono was not
the kind to understand it. So Lilly spoke his piece.</p>

<p>"I'm foreman here now, Trono. Yore out of a job. My orders are
to give you a job as top hand if you want it. If you don't want
it, roll your blanket and walk."</p>

<p>Trono had not looked for such an attack. It took the
belligerent words from his mouth and he stood with his head
craned forward while the ruddy blood rushed into his face. The
green eyes were unblinking. "Who told yuh that?"</p>

<p>"The old man."</p>

<p>Trono's reply was short and unmentionable. He took half a step
forward, his arms swinging wide. "Yuh lie! Bring Jill out here a
minute and I'll talk to her! Don't fool me, Red."</p>

<p>From somewhere came Jill's voice. "That is the truth, Theed.
You have your choice."</p>

<p>Trono looked from window to window; but Jill had vanished
again and in the silence Lilly tried again to find a friendly
face in the crowd. "Well, we might as well get this straight. Are
you working for me or are you pullin' out?"</p>

<p>"Work fer yuh? Hell, I wouldn't take yore orders if I starved.
Yuh ain't gettin' away with that, Red. As to pullin' out, I dunno
about that, either. Misdoubt if you got any right to hire or
fire."</p>

<p>Lilly looked to the others. "You boys have yore choice. It's
me or Trono."</p>

<p>There was no answer. None was needed. Lilly understood his
situation thoroughly. These were Trono's creatures, they would
fight at Trono's nod. The new foreman, watching Trono with a
steady, cautious glance, wondered why that nod didn't come. If
the man was brash enough to force the issue now was the proper
time. Trono's face was settled in reflection and there was a slow
evaporation of his belligerence. Again, as in the saloon, he
hesitated, seeming to weigh Lilly. In the end he turned and spoke
briefly to the men. "We're pullin' out We ain't workin' on no
ranch run by this jasper. If the old man wanted him so bad that
ain't no skin off our nose."</p>

<p>The whole group turned and walked toward the bunkhouse. A
quarter hour later they were galloping over the ridge and out of
sight. Lilly watched them go, both relieved and puzzled; it was
hard to understand Trono's mildness, hard to fathom why the man
hadn't made a stronger bid for control.</p>

<p>"It shore looks like he's backed down from his bluff about me
leavin' the country in twenty-four hours. Yet, somehow, it don't
seem Trono would give in that easy. Must be a nigger in the
woodpile."</p>

<p>Rolling a cigarette, he settled in a chair and watched the sun
dip westward. Life on the ranch had come to a full stop. Nothing
moved in the yard, no sound came from the corrals. It was as if
Breck's passing had withdrawn the JIB's driving force; as if
Pilgrim Valley had shrunk and shriveled and like many another
deserted cattle ranch would forthwith be a place of memories.
Well, perhaps the old man in his sickness had been too
suspicious, too willing to believe in trouble and disaster.
Anyhow, it was a serious matter to usurp authority without
sufficient reason. Perhaps Trono had realized it and ridden away
to other fields.</p>

<p>Here was a job for a man to do. Somehow or other, he had to
get a decent, faithful crew and start the ball rolling again;
prepare for the fall roundup and patch up any number of things.
It took but a brief glance to see that Breck had let things sort
of slide. Some of the top rails of the corral were down, the barn
doors sagging on their runners. The Indian quarters were strewn
with trash piles and the sod roofs of all houses were badly
shaken. When the fall rains set in there wouldn't be a dry spot
in any of these old structures.</p>

<p>"If it's this way on the home stretch," he mused, "what will
it be like out on the range? How many cows am I goin' to
find?"</p>

<p>Considering the night party that had passed by the
homesteader's shack, it looked as if he wasn't going to have much
rest. Well, he could put a stop to rustling and he could make a
sweet-running place of it, providing he could find men. There was
the rub. Being a stranger in the land, knowing nothing of ranch
politics or of men's sympathies, he was going to have difficulty
in collecting six or seven good top hands.</p>

<p>Studying this from all its angles he was interrupted a couple
of hours later when a pair of riders dropped over the ridge and
galloped down the slope toward him. Within fifty yards he
recognized them to be from Trono's party and he stood up,
suddenly wary. They whirled before the house and dismounted, each
looking to the other until one took up the burden of
explanation.</p>

<p>"It's like this," said the spokesman looking the new foreman
squarely in the face. "We couldn't nowise break away from Trono
here on the ranch. We ain't his kind, y'understan'? But a fella
has got to watch his p's and q's. Bill an' me is square an' we
like the JIB. So we sorter told Trono we was a-goin' to ride up
in the pines to have a look-see. When the boys got out o' sight
we come foggin' back here. If yuh need help we'd be right pleased
to throw in. They'll be gunplay sooner or later, yuh bet."</p>

<p><br> Lilly worked his thumbs through his belt and stared at
them with a mild, disbelieving countenance. "If you weren't
Trono's men how does it come you worked under him?"</p>

<p>"Hell, a man's got to eat, ain't he? Now, amigo, let that
ride. We didn't bust into this jes' cause we liked to be shot at.
The old man was white to us. We been here a long
time&mdash;before most o' those jaspers Trono hired on his own
hook. Yu' see? Better make peace an' take what help yu' can get,
which ain't goin' to be plenty, Trono'll scare cowhands away from
here an' yu' ain't ble to turn this job by yoreself."</p>

<p>"Lads, it's too good to be a real yarn. I'm obliged but I
don't hire on Tuesdays or Fridays. Just run back an' tell Trono
it didn't work."</p>

<p>The pair looked mournfully disappointed. The spokesman shook
his head and observed that you never could tell which way a red-
head would jump and wasn't it a fact. "Amigo, what's bit yu'? Yu'
asked for help an' now yu' won't take it. Tell a man!"</p>

<p>"I've changed my mind. It's goin to be a new deck. I'm obliged
but the road out is over yonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They can stay."</p>

<p>It was Jill speaking. She had come from the house and stood
with her back to the logs, tight-lipped and somber. "I know these
men. Billy and Slim have always been good hands. My father spoke
highly of them. Hang your saddles in the bunkhouse, boys, And
thanks for coming."</p>

<p>The two made off, but not before Slim, the spokesman, had
gravely assured Lilly he didn't hold anything against him for the
refusal. "A man can't be too careful these days."</p>

<p>Lilly waited until they were well out of sight before
speaking. "Ma'am, why do you suppose they come back? Don't you
think they'd of stayed when I asked for 'em to choose between me
and Trono? Their yarn is full of holes. They're Trono's men shore
as shootin' an they'll only make trouble&mdash;of which we've got
a-plenty right now."</p>

<p>She was bitter-eyed, resentful; and when he had finished she
laid down the law to him in no uncertain terms. "Remember, you
are the foreman. Nothing more. I told you I would do the firing.
As for those two I know them better than you do. How is it that
you, a complete stranger, insist that all this crew is
untrustworthy? I might use the very same words to you."</p>

<p>He rubbed his hand slowly along the back of the chair,
watching her as the anger seemed to mount. Perhaps he would have
washed his hands of the affair then and there, have taken his
horse and ridden over the ridge&mdash;if the saving grace of
humor had not helped him. She was a spitfire and no mistake! But
he knew, or thought he knew, what was behind those hard words.
Her pride and her loyalty had been shaken by Jim Breck's
confession of fault and in the after hours of tragedy when she
was trying to rebuild something from the wreck, trying to regain
her own self-respect, she had unconsciously laid the blame on the
nearest man. Which happened to be himself. "She hates to have me
see her humbled like this," he reflected. "She thinks I'm passin'
judgment." Well, that would pass and she would be sorry for it.
He could bear it. If she didn't change he would still stick until
the trouble was averted and then pull freight. He hated a
shrewish woman.</p>

<p>So he turned her accusation aside. "Well, if you think they're
all right that settles the matter. Maybe I'm wrong. I've always
been taught to be suspicious until I was shown otherwise. Now,
ma'am, if you don't mind I'd like to see yore daddy's books. I've
got to understand his business before I can start working."</p>

<p>She turned this over in her mind for some time and Lilly
thought she was about to refuse him. "I guess you have a right to
that," she admitted. "His office was at the end of the house.
Look for yourself."</p>

<p>"Look for himself," he judged was going to be his motto on the
JIB. Entering the old man's office&mdash;which was a bare room
with only a great roll-topped desk and pine chair to relieve its
emptiness&mdash;he sat down and tried to find his way through the
mass of letters, catalogues and bills of lading. Everything was
in confusion and according to the dates of the letters nothing
had been filed for six months. The drawers and the pigeon holes
were jammed full of unrelated things as if the old man, suddenly
tired of seeing the top of the desk so cluttered, had swept it
clear with his fist.</p>

<p><br> It grew dark long before Lilly had reduced anything to
order or had found what he most wanted to find&mdash;the tallies
of the spring roundup. Abandoning the job for the day he strolled
to the porch. A light burned in the kitchen and he saw the girl
bending over the stove; her white, strong arms moved swiftly and
once as she turned Lilly thought she looked somewhat happier. She
had forgotten for the moment the troubles of the day. Work did
that, Lilly reflected, strolling across the yard. Many a time he
had plunged headlong into any kind of labor to keep himself from
thinking. Dusk fell across the land in gray, swirling waves,
bringing with it a cool night breeze. There was a light in the
bunkhouse and he heard one of the hands singing a doleful ditty
about Sam Bass.</p>

<p>He moved by the corner of an Indian house and started toward
the corrals. There was a slight, hissing sound to his rear and
the crunch of a boot. He turned swiftly, arm dropping toward his
gun; but he was too late to save himself. A loop fell over his
shoulders and tautened with such a force that it threw him to the
ground. In the dusk he heard a man breathing heavily, advancing
on the run; and when the fellow stooped to take another hitch in
the rope he saw it to be Slim the spokesman. Slim grunted his
satisfaction. "Yu' damn rascal! I knew I'd ketch yu' if I waited
long enough. Quit that squirmin' or I'll bust yu' to aitch! Hey,
Billy&mdash;come on now. I done snared him!"</p>

<p>Slim was on his knee, one arm planted in Lilly's chest. Lilly
bent upward and with one desperate wrench of his shoulders butted
the puncher beneath the chin, throwing the man off balance. A
stream of profanity followed, and though Lilly tried to pull his
hands clear of the rope he failed. Slim's fist shot through the
shadows and took Lilly in the temple. "Yu' damn fool, I could
smash yu' fer that! Now git up an' travel to'rds the
bunkhouse!"</p>

<p>"Here," said Lilly, "what kind of a game are you playin'? Just
what's yore profit in this?"</p>

<p>Bill, who had joined Slim, chuckled. "You'll have to ask Trono
that, amigo. Hey, Slim, it's the smokehouse we want. Yeah. All
right, fella, back in there an' hold yore nose."</p>

<p>Lilly could not see where they were putting him. A door
groaned and Slim's hand went rummaging through his pockets for
knives and sundry weapons. The gunbelt dropped from his hip and
he was shoved none too gently across the high sill of a shed no
more than three feet square. Then the door closed and the hasp
fell over a staple, to be locked. The two men, retreated speaking
softly. By-and-by Lilly heard three shots near the main house.
Three shots evenly spaced&mdash;the ancient signal of the range.
Within ten minutes he heard many men riding into the yard. Trono
had returned.</p>

<p class="first"><i>"The picture o' a gal blindfolded an boldin'

justice to all. But sometimes the lady ain't blind. Sometimes

</p>

<br>

<p class="first">TRAPPED. Neatly put out of the way in a place so
small that he could touch all four walls without moving. Above
his head was a sharp steel hook; from below a current of air
scoured through an aperture in one corner of the hard-packed
floor. Long seasons of meat curing had impregnated the pine
boards with a sharp, woody smell and left heavy layers of soot.
His exploring fingers found it everywhere; found, too, an
occasional rafter charred from the heat. Still, it was not an
unsubstantial prison for when he put his shoulders against the
door it did not give. The old man had built this house as he had
built all others&mdash;solidly and meant to endure.</p>

<p>His head ached from the blow Slim had given him on the temple;
blood trickled down his jaw. But that didn't matter. What really
hurt was to have been so easily captured and put into Trono's
power. What would the old man say if he knew what was going on?
Lilly saw Breck's heavy, fighting face scowling at him through
the black pit. This was not what he had expected of the red-
headed stranger. Lilly reached for his makin's, growing impatient
with himself. What he ought to have done was to have kicked those
two agents off the ranch in spite of Jill's say-so. After all, he
was responsible for her&mdash;responsible for the JIB. She wasn't
the one that had to do the fighting.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "this ain't no time to hold postmortems.
Every minute I stay here means money in Trono's pocket. That gent
used his head proper. Instead o' bein' bull-headed and shootin'
it out he saved himself the trouble an' snares me like a rabbit.
Oh, fine! That's what I get for not followin' my original idea.
The question becomes, what does he aim to do now that he's got
control?"</p>

<p>It was very puzzling. Not that a man couldn't wreck a ranch
and make it thoroughly unprofitable for the owners to stay on.
Between Trono and Stubbins, Jill couldn't hold her own. By sundry
devices, most of which were illegal, they could haze her off.
Just bring the pressure to bear hard enough and she would have to
quit. It was a matter of rustling JIB cows, of sending 3Cross
stock in to graze on JIB territory, of preventing cow-punchers
from working for JIB. Threats&mdash;and actual violence. Oh, the
road was wide enough for them to follow and no doubt they had
examples set them by old Breck himself in earlier days.</p>

<p>Still, what was their next move? Having control, what would
they do with him? They couldn't kill him outright. That
would&mdash;or it should&mdash;create a stink in the country.
Probably they'd escort him down the line and see that he didn't
get a chance to come back. What would they do with Jill? Lilly
shook his head and drew a deep breath of cigarette smoke. There
was one girl they'd have to treat with gloves. She could fight
and she might be able to draw enough sympathy to her throughout
the county so that both Trono and Stubbins would find it entirely
disagreeable. So, if they figured to do the thing neatly they'd
have to keep Jill from getting where she could make herself
heard.</p>

<p>But they couldn't keep her prisoner forever. That would leak
out. What they ought to do was withdraw from the ranch and do
their dirty work from the sidelines. If he was Trono and in that
kind of a game it would be his tactics.</p>

<p>"Followin' which train of thought," he mused, "they got to put
me out o' the road. Then, if they've got the county buffaloed,
which it seems they have, it's only a waitin' game before the JIB
is busted. Tom Lilly, my boy, it's yore move, even though you
only got four feet to move in."</p>

<p><br> Someone passed near the smokehouse, feet shuffling on the
hard earth. Lilly flattened himself against the door, listening.
Presently the sound died. The crew appeared to be in the
bunkhouse and in a happy frame of mind. They were making the
rafters ring with "Arizona Boys and Girls," with now and then a
gun shot to punctuate the rhyme. Lilly, crouched on the floor,
opined they must have found a quart of whisky somewhere to induce
all the hilarity.</p>

<p class="poem"><i>"The boys in this country, they try to
advance<br> By courtin' the ladies an' learnin' to
dance&mdash;<br> An' they're down, down, an' they're down!"</i>
</p>

<p>"You'll shore be down if ever I get out o' this mousetrap,"
muttered Lilly, enraged. "A fine specimen, I am! Supposed to be
protectin' the gal an' here I sit, of no more use than two-bits
worth of canary seed!"</p>

<p>He waited until the crew had embarked on another verse of the
song before butting the door with his shoulders. It gave slightly
and he tried it a second time, hearing the hasp grate against the
lock. Someone moved outside and he stopped quickly, gathering
himself in a corner. As before the sound vanished, leaving him
perplexed. Were they guarding him? And what about Jill? Were they
keeping watch over her? Lilly had a vision of Trono smiling in
his tight-lipped, sardonic manner; smiling at the girl with his
immense shoulders humped forward. He would ride his victory high,
this one-time foreman, would probably exult in his dominion over
the possessions of old Jim Breck. He was
dangerous&mdash;dangerous because of the uncertainty of his
temper and of his mind. There was no telling when he might take
it in his head to use violence; Lilly had read the ruthlessness,
the killer's instinct in the green eyes and he well knew that a
time might come when Trono would tire of playing safe.</p>

<p>The thought moved Lily around in his black cubicle and set him
to exploring again. He dug his fist down into the vent hole at
the bottom of the house. This was the flue by which smoke was
sent into the place from a near-by oven. If he could enlarge
it&mdash;dig his way through to the outside. A few attempts at
crumbling the hard-packed ground discouraged him. It would take
hours to make any impression and unless he mistook his man very
much, Trono would be up and doing before long. Probably the burly
one was mulling over the situation now in his clumsy mental
processes. Lilly stepped back a pace and hurled himself at the
door once again. There was a long groan of the hasp and a sharp
splintering of a board, followed by those soft, shuffling steps
outside. This time they came nearer and stopped. Someone was
fumbling with the lock and as Lilly crowded himself in a corner,
ready to spring at whoever crossed the sill, he heard the hasp
give way. The door came open, inch by inch. As he poised on his
toes the soft, guttural voice of Pattipaws floated in. "Huh. You
come now."</p>

<p>He slid outside, to be met by the Indian's outstretched hand.
Gun and gunbelt was there, not his own, but one that did quite as
well and felt extremely satisfying as he strapped it about his
waist. The Indian whispered. "You go get girl. I fin' horses. Put
'em by barn. <i>Hyak.</i>"</p>

<p>The singing had diminished. Of a sudden the light streaming
from the bunkhouse was shut off by an emerging figure. A figure
that rolled unsteadily along for a brief time on the path of the
yellow beam and then turned directly toward the smoke house.
Pattipaws dissolved in the shadows, leaving Tom Lilly rooted in
his place. The advancing puncher stumbled over his own high
heeled boots, swearing immoderately and presently he was directly
before the house, swaying a little, his tall, lanky figure but an
outline in the night. Lilly tarried, not quite sure of his future
course. But here was a temptation too great to be passed by.
Thus, when the man stretched his arm forward and put one hand on
the open door Lilly drew his gun and reversed the butt, lifting
it high. It was a moment of uncertainty until Lilly heard the
puncher's breath whistling inward as if preparing to send out a
cry of discovery. That cry was never uttered; Lilly crossed the
intervening space at one stride; the gun came down, not with full
force, but heavily enough to send the wandering puncher to the
ground senseless.</p>

<p><br> Lilly worked quickly. He untied the man's neck piece and
gagged him. With his own handkerchief he tied the fellow's hands.
Then he lifted him into the smoke house and closed the door,
propping it shut with a stray piece of wood. This was all
makeshift, he well knew; at the most he had no more than fifteen
minutes to warn the girl and effect an escape before the puncher
would rouse himself and struggle free. Turning, he tiptoed across
the yard to the house, coming to a halt at one end of the porch.
He had meant to save time and enter by one of the front doors,
but the gleaming tip of a cigarette told him he would have to
circle around to the rear. He could not see the man, but it took
only half a guess to surmise who sat in Jim Breck's rocker.
Trono. Trono mimicking the habits of the old man and flattering
his own vanity by the performance. Temptation beset Lilly once
more; this time he shook it off. The odds were too much against
him. Possibly he might surprise and take Trono stowing him away
as he had the fellow in the smoke house. But there were a good
dozen men in the bunkhouse and he could not hope to dispose of
them in the same manner. So, foregoing the pleasure, he
retreated, circled the house and came to the kitchen door. It
stood ajar, leading into a darkened room. Listening for a moment,
he finally groped through it and opened an inner portal; this was
a hallway leading he knew not just where. But he could hear the
creaking of a rocker out on the porch and presently a man
coughing. Nowhere could he see a light until he turned about and
looked at the other end of the hall; then he made out a faint
yellow beam creeping beneath a doorway. On his toes he crept
toward it, listening. No sound.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was the girl's room since all the rest of the
house was dark. She was in there, waiting for trouble to break,
grieving for what the day had seen. Well, it was a poor time to
spend in grief. Right now self-preservation was foremost. He put
his hand on the knob, very much wanting to announce himself but
afraid of having her challenge him and thus arouse Trono. Half
turning it, he felt the latch give and at a single movement
opened the door, swung himself inside and closed it, coming face
to face with Jill.</p>

<p>She was in a chair and she had a gun trained directly on him.
The color had partly left her face, but he was never to forget
that flash of eye which fell fully upon him and then, after what
seemed a long, long time, fade before relief. She had been
expecting someone else&mdash;had posted herself there to stop
that someone. Lilly put a finger to his lips and crossed the
room. "Fix up. We're pullin' out. Quick now."</p>

<p>She nodded, keeping the silence, and rose. Whatever of
resentment Lilly had felt against her for withholding trust in
him vanished. She was a thoroughbred! She asked no silly
questions, wasted no time. A small bundle of papers went into her
coat pocket, papers she had no doubt salvaged from her father's
office. Then she clapped on a battered hunting hat and turned to
him as if asking his approval. And for the first time he saw
friendliness in her face. The color had returned; something moved
in the depths of her eyes as she held out her hand, offering him
her gun. He shook his head and beckoned. Together they stepped
into the hall, closing the door behind, crossing to the kitchen
and threading its cluttered space to the back. The night breeze
struck Lilly's face and the fresh, sage-scented air was as a call
to adventure. Up above, the sky was metal black, pricked by a
dozen dim stars. Beyond this cluttered yard and its garrison of
lustful, over-weening men was freedom. Southward stood the shadow
of the pine forest. Lilly felt the girl's hand slip into his;
with a swift upthrust of reckless pride he closed his calloused
fists about her small fingers and led her across the yard toward
the corrals, venturing a husky phrase.</p>

<p>"We'll beat 'em, my girl. Don't you forget it."</p>

<p>They had only passed the smoke house when a strangled cry
emerged from it&mdash;a cry that woke every echo on the ranch.
Boots struck the bunkhouse floor, the hum of speech ceased.
Trono's bull voice boomed across the area. "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Shucks," grunted Lilly. "I didn't hit that hombre nowise hard
enough. Comes o' bein' chicken-hearted. Now we've got to leg it.
Hold tight, girl."</p>

<p><br> The crew rushed pell-mell out of their quarters and
directed by another muffled cry, bore down upon the smoke house
as Lilly and the girl slipped away from the yard and circled the
corrals; Pattipaws waited somewhere ahead, obscured by the heavy
shadows. Fury was behind. The crew had found and released the
imprisoned puncher. Lilly, chuckling softly, observed he hadn't
impaired the man's voice. It rose toward the sky in outraged
accents. "&mdash;An' I gits a strangle holt on 'im an' he breaks
it like I was a leetle chil'. Belts me acrost the coco a terrible
wallop! Boys, I'm all busted up! Somebody gimme a drink! Oh, Gawd
that was a dirty blow! I'll rake him across his face with m'
spurs! Yeh, I will! Say, gimme a drink!"</p>

<p>"Pattipaws," breathed Lilly, coming to a halt. They were
behind the corrals, groping into a small hollow. "Injun, where
are you at? By the Lord Harry, I hope he got the cayuses. Listen
to Trono yell!"</p>

<p>Trono had done some exploring on his own account and found the
girl missing. He was thundering furiously at the crew. "Jill's
done gone. That red-head missin', too? Well, you damn fools,
don't stand there chatterin' like a cage full o' monkeys! Git
yore hosses! They ain't far away! Two-three you boys gallop
aroun' the premises! On yore toes now! We're shore sunk if they
ain't rounded up!"</p>

<p>"I'm shore glad to hear it from his own mouth," muttered
Lilly. "Pattipaws&mdash;Oh, that you?" The Indian slipped up to
them and grunted briefly. He was leading three horses. Lilly
helped the girl into a saddle, hearing someone running around the
corrals, rapidly approaching. "Injun," murmured Lilly, "you lead
off to'rd the hills, savvy? Walk along easy for a hundred yards,
so they won't hear."</p>

<p>The Indian was in front, the girl in the center and Lilly at
the rear. They climbed the far slope of the hollow and pointed
south, going at a slow and silent gait The exploring party had
gone on to the back of the corrals, missing the hollow by a few
yards. Elsewhere was the creaking confusion of men saddling up in
the dark. Trono's bellicose voice rose and fell, cursing,
threatening, lashing at the crew as so many convicts. Quite
gradually these sounds grew less distinct and mingled to a kind
of rumble. Lilly spoke to the Indian. "All right. Let's stretch
out now. We'll have to clear this place before they begin to
circle around. Hustle."</p>

<p>Jill had not uttered a word all this time. And now as they
swung toward the towering shadow of the pine forest she was
equally silent. The leather gear creaked beneath them and the
steady breathing of the horses made a kind of rhythm as they
covered the miles. Behind them was the one clear beacon of the
sky, the North Star. Elsewhere a dusky veil covered the countless
twinkling lights; a soft breeze fanned them and presently the
aromatic smell of the sage was blended with that of the
trees.</p>

<p>It was a sober, thoughtful caravan that fled from the JIB.
Once only during the night were they in danger. Lilly halting the
group got down and put his ear to the ground. Somewhere in the
near distance was a pursuing party. He published it briefly.
"Find us a hollow or arroyo somewhere, Injun. We'll anchor a
minute." The Indian grunted and turned his course until they were
traveling back toward the ranch. The ground grew rough and in
five minutes dropped from them. Here they stopped and waited
until the rumbling of hoofs could be distinctly heard in the
clear, quiet air. Presently a cavalcade swept by with a great
clatter and groaning, to vanish westward. Lilly waited some
length of time and then signaled the Indian to move on. As near
as he could judge, Trono was sweeping the land in widening
circles from the ranch.</p>

<p>Midnight passed and they stopped for a brief breathing spell.
Toward morning they reached the first trees and began climbing,
penetrating deeper and deeper into the recesses of the pines.
Daybreak found them high above the valley floor. Lilly, seeing
the weariness on the girl's face called a halt. But she was quick
to dissent, saying, "If you're stopping on my account, I won't
have it. I can travel as long as needed." And Pattipaws made a
vague gesture forward, at which Lilly gave in. So they went for
perhaps another hour until the pines suddenly made a small bayou
and revealed a cabin. There they stopped.</p>

<p>It was an old, mouldering trappers' cabin. On all sides of the
little clearing the ground rose in rugged layers and the
underbrush sprang up quickly between the trees. Not a great deal
farther ahead Lilly saw the base of a half bald peak and he
marked it as a place from which he might scour the valley below.
Meanwhile there were other things to consider. Rest and
food&mdash;and a plan for the future. For all her splendid
endurance and courage, the mark of the night's ride was on the
girl as she slid from the horse and looked uncertainly to
Lilly.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "what are you planning now, Red?"</p>

<p>Lilly grew unaccountably warm at her use of the name. The last
twelve hours had revealed many things to her; she accepted him
now. Drowsiness weighted her lids, but still there was a frank
friendliness in her eyes, and unreserved trust.</p>

<p>"First off we'll fix up a place for you to get a little
sleep," he replied. "But not in that shack. If they pick up our
trail&mdash;and I think they wall&mdash;they'll have a look at
it. I'll spread the saddle blankets up in the brush for you. As
for anything to eat, it appears as if we went on a water diet for
a few meals."</p>

<p>She waved that aside as unimportant. "I've been hungry
before." Then she flushed a little, still holding his eyes.
"I'm&mdash;I'm sorry. Most of this is my own fault. But Slim and
Bill were two of Dad's trusted men. Even Trono was always kind to
me. I had no idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yore dad," he reminded her, "was a powerful man. Nobody tried
anything on him. They toed the mark and jumped at his word. But
you can never tell what a fellow carries around in his mind. That
crew puzzles me. A fine bunch of bandits! I'd think yore dad
would have known what they were like."</p>

<p>She was struggling to keep awake. "I think he did. You see
Trono picked quarrels with some of our old hands and they quit.
Usually there'd be a new man the next morning. Dad didn't like
some of them&mdash;I could see that, though he never told
me&mdash;but we had to have help and Trono always recommended
them. So Dad took Trono's word. Now that I think of it. Trono
seemed to do a lot of things, these last few months, that Dad
used to do himself. Dad&mdash;was getting sick."</p>

<p>"Uhuh. Trono packed the ranch with his own private bunch.
Prob'ly bought Slim and Bill to his own side o' the fence. It's
an old story. Well, it looks like a running fight for us. We'll
do a lot of dodgin' before we can hit back."</p>

<p>"You're the boss, Red. I'll not speak out of my turn from now
on."</p>

<p>That gave him courage to say what was in the back of his head.
Through the long night ride he had come to a plan that he thought
would work. "All right. We'll, sleep on it. Then, this afternoon
we'll dodge into Powder and leave you."</p>

<p>He was not quite prepared for her sudden awaking. Dissent
flashed in the dark eyes. "What will I do there?"</p>

<p>"Just wait until I get things in order."</p>

<p>"And where will you be?"</p>

<p>"Roamin' these hills and sort of scoutin' until I lay a few
traps. Don't you worry, girl. Inside of three-four days I'll wash
these bad, bold hombres off the map."</p>

<p>"Leave me in town, doing nothing while you're up here
fighting? No! I won't do it, Red."</p>

<p>"But look here. I've got to leave you in a safe place. This is
going to be a rough job."</p>

<p>She was looking at him with a curious intensity. There was
something of her father in that sharp, weighing, penetrating
glance; something of the same forthright recklessness in the way
she threw back her head and pursed her lips together. The rich
color rose higher in her cheeks. "I'll ride with you. Do you
think I'm a coward? This is my country and I'll fight for it. Oh,
I know what you're thinking! How will I stand up! Don't you worry
about me. And I don't care a rap what anybody thinks! Maybe I
can't be of any help. Maybe I'll even hinder you. But I'd die in
Powder. I'd feel like a shirker, thinking about you doing the
hard work and me doing nothing. No, we'll ride together,
Red."</p>

<p>She spoke her mind and turned half away, as if afraid to see
the effect on the man. Lilly fumbled for his cigarette papers,
disturbed profoundly. This was not at all as he had planned it.
What could she be thinking of, anyway? In the midst of these
troubled reflections he caught her eyes&mdash;and his uncertainty
vanished. She was a fighter, like her daddy. And she had
forgotten, it seemed, that she was a woman. He doubted if she
realized what a curious, gossiping world would have to say.</p>

<p>"Red, I know what you're thinking. Never mind me. I don't
belong to any social clubs and so they can't kick me out in
disgrace. It's my business. I'm not an infant&mdash;and I
<i>will</i> fight for JIB!"</p>

<p>He nodded. "All right. That's settled. We'll get along
somehow. Now for a siesta. Come along."</p>

<p>He took off the saddles and appropriated the blankets, leading
her well into the thicket. It was a rough bed, among the rocks,
but when she settled down she was already half asleep. Lilly bent
over and folded a loose end around her shoulders, wondering if
ever a girl had been fashioned quite like Jill Breck. The dark
hair was all tousled, making her strangely boyish. Yet no amount
of sun or rain or rough riding could conceal the beauties of the
clear white skin of her neck or the pink flush on her cheeks. She
had a drowsy, warming smile for him. Then she was plunged in
profound slumber.</p>

<p>Lilly walked down the slope to where Pattipaws crouched
against the side of the cabin, warming himself in a patch of
sun.</p>

<p>"Old-timer," said Lilly, "I've got a chore for you to do."</p>

<p>"Um. Pattipaws do."</p>

<p>"It's a long trip. Sleep first."</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head. "Pattipaws no need sleep. Sleep for
young bucks. You fix'm."</p>

<p>Lilly found a pencil and piece of paper in his pocket and
after staring thoughtfully at the ground wrote a very brief
message, signing his first name. He folded it and passed it to
the Indian who tucked it in a pocket. Thereafter for three or
four minutes Lilly carefully explained the contents and delivered
his instructions. In the end the Indian rose, jumped on one of
the horses&mdash;scorning a saddle&mdash;and pushed through the
brush. Lilly watched him go and listened until he could no longer
hear the rustling of leaves and the click of hoofs on the stony
ground.</p>

<p>One more chore he had to do before finding himself a moment's
rest. Hiding the horses deep in the forest and likewise caching
the saddles where they could not be seen by prying eyes, he
started toward the summit of the peak. It was a long, weary climb
and more than a half hour elapsed before he reached the top. Once
there he was rewarded by a magnificent sight of the whole valley.
It lay before him as a map unrolled on a table with each
depression and each knoll visible under the hot summer sun. Here
was an isolated kingdom, elevated above the burning desolation of
the desert outside the rimming Buttes. And in the center of it
huddled the buildings of the JIB. He could see them as so many
dark specks against the yellow earth.</p>

<p>But as for moving figures, he saw none. Not a thing seemed to
tenant the valley. No tell-tale wisp of dust kicked up behind a
traveling cavalcade. Trono had buried himself; Lilly, venturing a
shrewd guess, believed the foreman was already in the pine forest
seeking his erstwhile prisoners. The thought hurried his
inspection and he turned down the slope, plunging through the
trees. By-and-by, he heard a sound and he stopped dead, searching
the brush with cautious eyes. It came but once and after a few
moments he proceeded onward, using a great deal more caution. A
warning had come to him, not anything tangible that he could put
his five senses to, but still a warning that stayed his feet when
he reached the edge of the little clearing again. Heavy silence
pervaded it, broken by the sudden heavy beating of a grouse's
wings. Far off, he thought he heard the click of rock against
rock.</p>

<p>Very still, very peaceful&mdash;yet a quick, unfathomable
excitement took possession of Lilly and, without displaying
himself he withdrew and he circled higher in the brush, aiming
for the girl's covert. He crossed a small valley of trees on his
stomach, crawled over heavy boulders and half fell into the pit
formed by an uprooted pine. And of a sudden he was looking at the
very spot he had placed Jill. The ferns and smaller brush were
trampled down on all sides, the blankets thrown carelessly aside.
And the girl was not to be seen.</p>

<p>She had vanished without warning. But at the end of twenty
fleeting minutes Tom Lilly read the story all too well. Trono had
traced the hoof prints this far&mdash;Trono and a party of four
others. And he had found the girl. There was the mark of struggle
in the manner the brush had been beaten down; Jill had not
surrendered without a fight, though it puzzled Lilly that she had
not sent out at least one cry. The pine trees made a vast
sounding board and would have carried her warning well up the
slope. Perhaps she had&mdash;and he had been just beyond the
range of hearing. At any rate, struggling had done her no good.
Trono had taken her and made his escape.</p>

<p>The horses were still tethered where he had left them. That,
too, was peculiar. If they had sought through the underbrush for
the girl and found her, how was it they had not discovered the
horses?</p>

<p>Lilly extended his radius of search, combing the rocky slopes
and the long avenues between trees, coming at last to the
conclusion that Trono had been satisfied with his single capture
and was not in the vicinity, waiting to ambush him. Quickly
saddling a horse and letting the other animal go free, he struck
downward, following the trail. It was a clear trail in places,
showing the homeward bound prints of Trono's horses. At other
places it grew dim and was lost on the rock surfaces. Lilly
pursued it as rapidly as his sense of caution allowed, at times
striking into the woods and skirting such points and ledges as
might form a decent place for a surprise.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the edge of the timber he found the trail
of the party diverged from the route leading to the JIB and swung
westerly on a path that led directly toward the homestead and
Jim's Pass. The thought that they were taking Jill away from her
own house to some unknown hiding place enraged him beyond
measure. He struck the flank of his horse, swearing softly.</p>

<p>"Damn 'em, they can't get away with it! They can't do it! By
the Lord Harry, I'll kill the man if he hurts her! I'll run the
legs off him!"</p>

<p>He spurred along the trail, growing reckless. During the fore
part of the morning he had been very careful; the farther he
traveled across the undulating floor of the valley the less heed
he took of his own safety. He kept recalling the old man's last
words. "You take care o the gal, Red." What a fine job he'd done
so far! For all the good he'd accomplished he might as well be in
China. Then he kept seeing her as she was in the covert, her
black hair tousled, her sleepy eyes smiling upward at him. The
fighting rage welled up and flowed over. Rising in the stirrups
he scanned the ground ahead.</p>

<p>Once, toward noon, he thought he saw something moving along
the skyline near the homestead and he turned toward it,
quickening the pace. Up and down the rolling slopes he galloped,
the wild temper overmastering his caution. Once indeed he drew
rein to give his horse a brief rest and in the breathing space he
recalled Joe Breedlove's sage remarks about the unnecessary
trouble red-head gents brought down upon themselves. He threw the
thought aside and went on. "Joe never got into a jackpot like
this," he muttered, squinting against the hard, glittering light.
What good came of holding back, of caution? He had been careful
and see what had come of it! "I ain't made on that plan," he
reflected. "Better stick to my own method o' fightin'. And by the
Lord Harry, I'll nail Trono's hide to the wall!"</p>

<p>The long chase was rewarded at last. When he reached the top
of a swelling ridge he saw the homestead shack nestling in the
cottonwoods a hundred yards away. Around it were three horses,
and loitering in the shade were three men. They saw him the
moment he came in view and, as he was against the sun, mistook
him for one of the JIB crew. That was all the favor he needed.
Drawing his gun he raced down upon them, seeing Trono's massive
frame rise slowly and then come to astonished attention and swift
recognition. The bawling voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Hey&mdash;it's the red-head!" And his big fist swooped
downward.</p>

<p>Lilly stopped him with a shot that furrowed the sand. "Cut
that! You other two boys put 'em in the air! Nev' mind edgin'
to'rds the door! I ain't in no good humor right now." His
attention snapped back to Trono. "You dirty pirate, what'd you do
with Jill?"</p>

<p>Trono, hands half raised, looked toward the man on his left
and winked broadly. "Hear him," he grunted. "That's a big bluff
for certain. Red, yuh oughta know where she is since yore the one
that took her away. Here, yuh be careful o' that cannon! Goin' to
shoot me cold?"</p>

<p>Lilly, shifting his glance toward the others, realized they
were both strangers; neither were JIB hands. The one to whom
Trono had spoken had a pair of cold gray eyes and a clean shaven
face that at present wrinkled in puzzlement. Trono broke in, "Yuh
fool! Tryin' to bluff it out now? it won't wash. This yere's the
sheriff an' he's lookin' fer yuh. Better put down yore gun. Yuh
can't bluff the law, kid!"</p>

<p>Lilly slid from the saddle advancing on Trono. "Listen," said
he, checking the volcanic eruption of anger, "I'm of no mind to
be played with. Yore goin' to tell me what you did with Jill
Breck an' yore goin' to do it sudden. Hear that? I'm a white man,
but by the Lord Harry I'll use Injun methods if you stand there
an' fool me! Know what that means, don't you?"</p>

<p>A side glance into the cabin had told him the girl was not
around the homestead; and the three horses likewise indicated
there had been a shifting of the original party. As to this
stranger being a sheriff, that was a bluff. Even so the man did
not bear the stamp of Trono's breed. He looked honest. Meanwhile
the JIB foreman shifted his weight and, seeing the expression on
Lilly's face, he began to sputter.</p>

<p>"That don't get you by! If you touch me you'll live to regret
it!"</p>

<p>Lilly was on the point of replying when the man with the
honest face broke in, speaking quietly and with a certain clear
assurance. "Put yore gun down, boy. I declare yore under arrest."
With that announcement he hitched his shoulder in a way that
threw his coat aside, displaying a star.</p>

<p>"Arrest me?" demanded Lilly. "And what for?"</p>

<p>"Kidnappin' Jill Brock," announced the official. "When the doc
got back to Powder he said the situation out here was in poor
shape, so I rode over. First thing I found was you'd gone off
with the gal an' the whole ranch was lookin' fer you. That's a
serous offense, my boy."</p>

<p>"Yore takin' Trono's word against mine?"</p>

<p>The sheriff seemed to have some certain mental reservations.
In the end he shrugged his shoulder. "Yore a stranger here. All
the JIB boys stick to the same story. Deliver me yore gun."</p>

<p>Lilly was shaking his head. "Don't propose to do it, sher'ff.
They may have you deceived, but they ain't got me that way. If I
got to buck the law to find Jill Breck it's plumb too bad. But I
aim to wring a confession out of Trono or cripple him in the
attempt."</p>

<p>There was a movement of the sheriff's eye and a sudden relief
on Trono's sweating face. At the same time a cool voice spoke
from Lilly's rear. "Yore covered. Drop the gun."</p>

<p>Lilly stood immobile for one long, desperate instant. In the
end he nodded briefly, passing his revolver to the sheriff and
locking his lips to keep in the flood of bitter disappointment.
Trono, relieved of danger, sprang forward with an upraised fist.
"Now who's goin' to do the cripplin', you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Back off," said the sheriff, coldly. "You'll do nothing to
this man. He goes to Powder."</p>

<p>"He oughta be lynched here an' now," muttered Trono. "If the
rest o' my crew was around you'd have a hard time gettin' him off
safe."</p>

<p>"So?" grunted the sheriff. "Trono, you don't talk sense."</p>

<p>Another man moved into view, the one who had caught Lilly from
behind. He, too, was a stranger, and doubtless of the sheriff's
party. "Good thing," said he, "I happened to stray off."</p>

<p>The sheriff motioned Lilly to get in the saddle. Meanwhile he
and his deputies found their animals and mounted, leaving Trono
alone. The heavy man was frowning deeply and the sheriff,
catching sight of his temper, stopped to issue a warning. "Don't
get it in yore head you can raid the jail, either. There'll be no
lynchin' in my bailiwick."</p>

<p>"You goin' to let him go off 'thout tellin' where he's got the
gal!" bawled Trono.</p>

<p>"That will develop," said the sheriff, cryptically and started
on. The deputies fell in behind. They rode as far as the main
trail through the Pass before Lilly roused himself to speak. "So
this is justice in Robey County."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," stated the sheriff, "justice don't show her face
completely to the onlooker."</p>

<p>When Lilly turned to look at the sheriff, the latter was
smiling slightly. That smile engrossed Lilly's attention all the
long weary ride into town and puzzled him even when he had been
locked behind the cell door.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; TRONO VERSUS STUBBINS</h2>

<p class="first"><i>"Hark to me, amigo: a woman may shorely be a
weak vessel but she's got more ways o' fightin' than a man ever
heard about. It ain't because o' chivalry a man don't want to hit
a lady&mdash;it's because o' fear o' gettin' a fine lickin'. You
bet."&mdash;Joe Breedlove.</i> </p>

<br>

<p class="first">JILL BRECK had fallen asleep instantly in the
hidden glade. But it was not a dreamless sleep; the long ride and
all the discouraging, tragic incidents of the day had bruised her
profoundly and left unforgettably vivid pictures in her mind. So
she dreamed; terrifying dreams that at times brought helpless
cries from her. It seemed she was being led away from the JIB,
that the house and quarters were going up in flames. She was
being roughly treated and each time she protested a vise-like
fist closed around her throat. She was driven to a strange
country&mdash;to the chasm of a river she could not recognize.
Above the roar and rush of water she felt a heavy fist closed
about her wrist and someone spoke ironically.</p>

<p>"What yuh shoutin' about, sister?"</p>

<p>She woke with a scream in her throat. Trono, his face beet-red
and glistening with sweat, was bending over her, grinning in his-
tight, triumphant manner. "If yuh aimed to hide yuh shouldn't be
caterwaulin' in yore sleep. Come up girl, we got to be movin'.
Where's that red-head went?"</p>

<p>"Take your hand off me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk sassy. Yuh'll live to regret it!"</p>

<p>When she pulled back, resisting the force of his massive arm,
he grew suddenly enraged and yanked her forward at a motion. She
struck at his leering face and left her mark; roaring, Trono
slapped her with the palm of his hand, shoved her through the
bushes and into the clearing. Half a dozen of the JIB crew were
scattered around the cabin, guns out, moving warily. "Yuh goin'
to tell me where the red-head went?" demanded Trono.</p>

<p>She felt the cruel pressure of his grip and gave up her
attempt to get free. "You will be paid for this, Trono! Don't you
know what the men of the county will do to you for treating me
like you do?"</p>

<p>"If there's any pay comin' I guess we'll get it all right,"
muttered Trono, hoisting her into the saddle before him. "But I
guess we'll ride that down. As fer the men o' this county they
oughta know better'n to tackle me or my men. Stop that squirmin',
yuh little spitfire! Ain't your own crew good enough fer yuh?
Think yore awful smart, sidin' in with this waddy. Well, we'll
learn yuh manners."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Wait an' see. Come on, boys. We've lost the redhead, I guess.
It won't do fer us to let him take pot shots from the bush.
Anyhow, we've got Jill, which is plenty. We're ridin'."</p>

<p>"If my father were alive he'd skin you."</p>

<p>Trono chuckled. "Yeah, he shore would. Or I'd skin him. The
old man was afraid o' me. Never had the nerve to gimme my time.
Didn't know that, did yuh? Well, I had the dope on him. I'm a-
tellin' yuh. I ain't no church member, but yore dad wa'n't a
Methodist elder by a long shot. Come on, boys."</p>

<p>She closed her lips, venturing no more. Trono was a desperate
man, and the recent turn of events had unleashed the everpresent
strain of lawlessness. Authority, he had never held in great
esteem. More than once he had openly flouted it, though he
perhaps did not quite understand that the county left him alone
because he had the protection of Old Jim Breck. In his
overweening pride he considered that it was his reputation they
were afraid of; he believed he was the one who had made the JIB
formidable. Stubbins would have told him otherwise, but on this
morning Stubbins was not present to give his cautious advice. The
girl wisely held her peace, uncomfortable in her precarious seat,
thinking of Red and wondering what had become of him.</p>

<p>They reached the open country and instead of going toward the
ranch, curved westward, dropping into an arroyo that put them
below the horizon. Much later they reached the homesteader's
shack and stopped for a rest while Trono sent out men to
skirmish. Jill, half asleep in the house, heard one of them ride
hurriedly back some time later and presently the word "sheriff'"
revived her hopes. It was swiftly quenched. Trono hailed her,
half hurled her up before another of the party. Then they were
away, riding in great haste, leaving Trono behind.</p>

<p><br> She grew so weary that she lost trace of time. Once they
stopped in a depression, the men whispering to one another and
keeping watch over the surrounding land; later they left their
shelter and struck rapidly toward the Pass, crossed it and dipped
into the burning plain below. Jill closed her eyes and for long
stretches of time was oblivious of her surroundings. She never
knew how long she rode; but toward sunset she was roused by a man
speaking and she looked up to see the 3Cross ranch-house directly
in front of them. One of the party rode ahead. By-and-by the
cavalcade reached the porch and stopped before Stubbins.</p>

<p>Stubbins smiled courteously, but Jill understood him well
enough to know there was little hope of help here. Still, she
protested as much as her flagging strength permitted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stubbins, are you making war on a woman? For shame, but
you will never live it down! I'll fight back&mdash;you'll never
keep me long!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am," said he evenly, "don't put it that way. We're only
rescuin' you from your enemies. Consider yourself my guest,
nothing more. All right, boys, the lady rests here."</p>

<p>She slid gingerly to the ground. "Rescue! Fine words. But,
then, you never were a hand to speak the truth. You were afraid
of my father, Mr. Stubbins. You never had the courage to face
him. So you waited until he died&mdash;and then began to fight
<i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>Stubbins reddened. His thin lips folded beneath the bear-like
nose and he motioned her inside with a gesture abrupt and
impatient. "You take advantage of a man, knowin' he can't strike
back."</p>

<p>"Fine reasoning," she retorted. "What excuse have you for
taking advantage of a woman?"</p>

<p>He half pushed her down a hall, into a bedroom. Without a
word, bowed himself out. She heard the key turn and when she
crossed to pull down the shade at the window she saw a puncher
negligently stroll across from the bunkhouse and take up his
station. A prisoner of the 3Cross! She dropped on the bed to cry
but instead, fell asleep.</p>

<p><br> Though transplanted from his native land&mdash;or, more
properly, driven from it by an outraged family&mdash;Stubbins had
never foregone its leisurely, formal customs. It was quite dark
when he knocked on the door and announced supper. "I am waiting
for you, of course. We must not let the meal get cold. Come,
now."</p>

<p>Awakened, Jill debated on self-imposed confinement. But that
passed, for she was not the kind to sulk. Hers was the
temperament that took the fight to the enemy; in this case she
considered it the better part of valor to break bread with the
Englishman and talk him out of his ideas. So she rose, washed
some of the dust from her face and stepped forth to meet him. He
had recovered his perfect urbanity and led her into the dining-
room, seating her with a studious politeness. Jill looked about
her with considerable interest.</p>

<p>The man lived high and took pains to bring as much of England
into the desert as he could. He had fashioned the dining-room,
which was the living-room as well, after the fashion of a
manorial hall, its ceiling extending a story and a half up.
Trophies studded the four walls and bear rugs quite entirely
covered the floor. There was a great fireplace, surmounted by a
mantel filled with pipes, tobacco and a litter of purely
masculine bric-a-brac. A long gun rack stood to one side, the row
of oiled weapons glistening dully in the lamp light And somewhere
he had picked up some magnificent oil paintings of the
West&mdash;a Remington's scene of a bighorn on the high ledges; a
thorough-brace stage coach tilting perilously down a mountain
road done as Russell alone knew how to do.</p>

<p>He enjoyed her unspoken compliment and said so. "You see, I
surround myself with as many comforts as I can. Really, the old
Westerners are grand fighters, but they don't understand the
gentle art of living. It takes a gentleman of the old country to
show them."</p>

<p>Jill shrugged her shoulders in dissent. A Chinaman came
silently in and they ate through four sedate courses, conversing
in desultory phrases. The Englishman proceeded quite as if he
were entertaining an honored guest and Jill, for all her distrust
of the man, conceded that he was a far more polished specimen
than she had ever before known. He made a ritual of supper and,
when they had finished, drew her to the glowing blaze. The
Chinaman came in with coffee; over the cups Stubbins smiled
expansively and touched on dangerous territory.</p>

<p>"Jill, it has been unfortunate that your father and I never
struck it off. A fine gentleman. One I was sincerely sorry to see
go."</p>

<p>The girl stared at him somberly. It was a direct lie&mdash;she
saw as much in his eyes. Stubbins spread his hands outward in a
symbol of frankness. "All this warfare has been exaggerated.
True, we fought sometimes, but usually it was our crews that
collided and caused the rumpus. What I'm getting around to, is
that you must not harbor ill will toward me on account of a
fancied feud. I&mdash;most assuredly do I say so&mdash;am your
friend."</p>

<p>"What are you getting to?" demanded Jill, using her father's
bluntness.</p>

<p>Stubbins shut his mouth suddenly and breathed through his
nose. "Ah, you disbelieve. My dear girl, you must understand that
this world is a dreadful place. Men fight each other over nothing
at all, bear tales that are untrue and so go on weaving a web of
animosity. It's this I wish to break down, betwixt you and me.
<i>We</i> must stick together."</p>

<p>"By all means," said Jill. "Even if you must lock me in my
bedroom."</p>

<p>"Only because I was afraid you would run away before I had a
chance of putting the situation before you in its proper light.
Now, look; here you are entirely alone and very much in trouble.
What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I am going to scratch your eyes out, Mr. Stubbins," said she,
quite earnestly. "Once I get the chance."</p>

<p>He pondered over this, not quite knowing whether she meant it
literally or figuratively. The girl made herself clear.</p>

<p>"Don't take me for a baby. Trono is quite crooked&mdash;and
you are behind him. You mean to make life so miserable for me
that I'll be glad to give you the JIB."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" he asked, drawing the question through
his nose.</p>

<p>"It's to be seen."</p>

<p>He put his cup down, growing slightly red around the gills.
"That newcomer filled you with that yarn. You sh'd have known
better than to've trusted him."</p>

<p>"How is it you know so much about him in so short a time?" she
countered. "Evidently someone has been keeping you informed."</p>

<p>The Englishman studied her at some length and at last came to
a decision. "Well, if you want the cards on the table, I'll not
deny I've been interested. But I'm a little better than you give
me credit for being. Truth is, I have long cherished a
notion."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>For so stolid a temper, he displayed unusual signs of
nervousness. Rising, he kicked back the log of the fire, aligned
the pipes on the mantle, and jammed one hand in his coat pocket.
"Jill, you can't go on alone. Who ever heard of a woman running a
cattle ranch? Now, look; I'm a substantial man. I own a great
deal of land and stock and I can command a fair size of money.
I'm not so old and, bless me, I do know how to enjoy life. But it
is plagued lonesome batching in this house. Here&mdash;I'm
getting into deep water! Will you throw in with me, Jill?"</p>

<p>"Marry you?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's a pleasant idea."</p>

<p><br> He was not expecting the torrent of laughter that
followed. Indignant refusal he could understand, but laughter!
Ridicule! The rosy color stained his long, horsey jaws from
temple to cleft and he stood very quiet, waiting for her to stop.
"What would you be marrying me for?" she asked, catching her
breath.</p>

<p>"Why, devil! What does a man marry for? Companionship."</p>

<p>"And land and cattle." she added ironically.</p>

<p>"You are refusing me?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Do you think you are so profound that you can't be
seen through? Now, let's talk sense. When are you going to stop
this piracy and let me go? You will find you're keeping a white
elephant. Sooner or later there will be trouble for you."</p>

<p>"I had thought you owned a little solid wisdom," he muttered.
"I see you are but a giddy thing. I'll teach you better. Ay, I
will."</p>

<p>She rose. "I give you warning you will learn more than you
teach, Mr. Stubbins."</p>

<p>Stubbins watched her vanish toward her bedroom, his hands
locked behind his broad back. He was scowling heavily in the
heavy outraged manner of a man who had found his charitable
intentions trampled under. Like many another of his kind he
lacked humor; not the small incidental humor that causes a man to
laugh at incongruous things, but the deep, rich vein of amusement
rising out of self-knowledge. He was, in truth, a grave ass who
thought he was doing Jill Breck a great turn. Naturally, he
expected to profit from it. The fact of the matter was he did
care somewhat for the girl, but this curious affection had been
nourished almost wholly on the assumption that in marrying her he
would be master of Pilgrim Valley.</p>

<p>Deprived of this manner of acquiring territory he became
distinctly dangerous. Cautious, disposed to use a soft word where
it would do the work of a hard one, he nevertheless always pushed
toward the main object, never allowing himself to be shunted
aside. He had feared Breck as he had feared no other living man;
that alone kept him humble. But Breck was gone and, like Trono,
he felt a weight removed. From now on he would be less
cautious.</p>

<p>So he stood before the fireplace, pipe clenched in his teeth,
studying his problem. Possession of Jill was no simple matter; he
knew he had most of the county officials beneath his thumb and he
likewise knew that with the 3Cross crew and the JIB
crew&mdash;the latter chosen by him through Trono&mdash;he could
stand off a good sized posse. Even so, it was a dangerous
situation. Once a sentiment thoroughly took hold of the country
it swept men along at a tremendous rate. If Jill's captivity
should become general knowledge it would do nothing but harm to
him.</p>

<p>"Trono," he muttered, "was a cursed fool for making this move.
He should have taken the girl back to the JIB and held her there.
Then nobody could say she was being kidnapped&mdash;on her own
ranch."</p>

<p>Trono, as it had often turned out before, was the stumbling
block. The man was forever doing the wrong thing, the bull-headed
thing. Always butting into trouble. Trono didn't know that you
could only push a community about so far; after that they rose
and wrought destruction.</p>

<p>"Well," he said to himself, "she made a bad bargain when she
turned me down. I may look soft but I'll not let her turn me.
Gad, I will not! She chooses to take pot luck. All right. I'll
use a man's weapons on her. That I will."</p>

<p>Jill, meanwhile, had gone storming to her room with mixed
emotions. In the darkness&mdash;there seemed to be no
lamp&mdash;she stood quite still, listening for the lock to turn;
but Stubbins had not followed her and she felt more relieved than
she could express. Stubbins had made his bid and in doing so had
disclosed his mind. Here was another of those men who would stop
at no point short of his destination. He used a little bluster,
he was quite the suave gentleman when it pleased him; that made
him the more formidable. Jill, on tiptoes, went to the window and
peeped through the blind. A cigarette tip glowed in the darkness,
warning her that she was still guarded.</p>

<p>It heightened her feeling of desperate resistance. Catching
hold of the door knob she turned it until the lock clicked ever
so slightly. Inch at a time she slipped it open; down the hall
the boards glowed from the reflection of the fire in the big
room. That way she could not go without crossing Stubbins'
vision. The other way, then. Slipping through, she closed the
door with equal care and slid into darkness, not knowing where
this black alley led. Dishes rattled from the kitchen, a patch of
light fell athwart her path, then a draught of air. Luck! She was
on the sill of an open door that led into the back yard of the
house.</p>

<p>The glowing cigarette tip was just out of range around an
elbow of the house. The barn loomed against the sky, a landmark
on which she unconsciously set her course. Somewhere she'd find a
horse and get clear of this Englishman and his plans. But Red,
where was he? Jill, setting her foot into an unexpected hollow,
bit her tongue and wistfully wished for the comfort of his
presence. Her father had judged right at first sight&mdash;Red
was a man!</p>

<p>The barn's shadow engulfed her and Jill, fearful that Stubbins
might now be discovering her absence, moved faster. She brushed a
post, lost her balance in the sharp turn and unexpectedly kicked
over a bucket, waking what seemed to her every echo on the ranch.
To the right, the bunkhouse door suddenly opened and a figure
stood silhouetted in a gush of yellow light. Someone drawled,
"That you, Bill?" Hard on this, she heard Stubbins' mealy accent
bark across the yard. "Ashbey, where the devil have you been?
She's given me the slip! Roust out!"</p>

<p>At that she ran faster, circling the barn, seeing the man
spring from the bunkhouse in hot pursuit. She collided against
the sharp bars of a corral and said "darn!" in an aggravated,
rising tone. She could not turn back, so she started to climb
over; but that, too, was fatal. Boots thudded near by and an
ungentle hand hauled her down from her perch. "Honey," said a
soft, southern voice, "you got spunk, but yore buckin' the wrong
brand."</p>

<p>She marched meekly back to the house and into the light of the
big room. Stubbins stared at her with a hard, glowering gaze.
"Get to your room! Don't try that again, hear! I have men on
guard around this house and they're ordered to shoot."</p>

<p>Jill said, malice in her voice, "I told you, Mr. Stubbins,
you'd have trouble keeping me. I'll scratch your eyes out yet."
She went quickly to her room, this time hearing the key turn.
There was another sound, too. Hoofs drummed on the hard ground
outside and a man challenged, evoking a rumbling, familiar reply.
"Oh, put up yore damn gun. Yuh'd think this was an army. It's
me&mdash;Trono."</p>

<p><br> The interview between Trono and Stubbins was very brief,
as usual. The two men seemed to find little comfort in each
other's company; for all their common crookedness. Trono strode
across the room in long, aggressive steps, stopping directly in
front of Stubbins.</p>

<p>"Well, you got the girl. Now what you goin' to do with
her?"</p>

<p>"That's something you should have considered before you
brought her to me," answered Stubbins. "It was a foolish thing to
do. Supposing this gets out? Why, I'll have a fight on my hands.
You should have left her at the JIB and seen to it she stayed
right in the house until she was ready to pack up and leave the
country."</p>

<p>"Yeh? Yuh always got a better idea, ain't yuh?" grumbled
Trono. "I brought her here because the sher'ff was roamin' around
the Valley. Then that damn Red was causin' trouble. We pinned his
ears back an' led him to the calaboose fin'lly. But yore the
boss, so you tell me what yore goin' to do."</p>

<p>"Mean to say the fellow is in jail? Oh, the devil! Now he'll
spread the story and stir the county. My Godfrey, why didn't you
put him out of the way?"</p>

<p>Trono took the rebuke with ill grace. "Say, do yuh think I'm
Jesse James? I been havin' plenty o' trouble the last thirty-six
hours. Now I'm sharin' some o' it with you. It's yore job,
anyhow. You jes' mix in an' do a few licks yoreself. As fer the
red-head, the sher'ff got him booked fer kidnappin'. I think
he'll have a hard time."</p>

<p>"Kidnappin'? Hm. That sounds interestin'" Stubbins studied his
ally. "He ought to be put out of the way, my lad. He's a
dangerous critter."</p>

<p>"How about this?" said Trono, leaning forward. "We'll jes'
hide the girl some place an' then take a bunch o' the boys down
to Powder an' lynch him fer doin' the deed. Then he won't give us
no bother."</p>

<p>Stubbins nodded. "Now you're thinking what you should have
thought some time ago. But I can't have her here. Somebody's
liable to drop in and see her. Got to put her in some other
cache."</p>

<p>"Thought you had a way with wimmen." Trono grinned.</p>

<p>Stubbins pressed his lips together and looked angry. "You take
her, Trono. Now. Over the mountains to the last line rider's
cabin. Grub there. Then in a couple days I'll see to it a
lynchin' party starts for Powder."</p>

<p>"So I'm to pull the coals outa the fire again?" Trono was
sullenly intractable. "Why don't you do it yoreself? Supposin' I
get caught?"</p>

<p>"Afraid?"</p>

<p>"Hell! I'll go. But what you goin' to do with her after
that?"</p>

<p>Stubbins hadn't decided that. Truly, Jill was becoming a
burden to him. But he didn't say as much to Trono; the burly
foreman was given to spells of ridicule that Stubbins disliked.
So he dropped his head significantly and said, "That will take
care of itself. This newcomer must be fixed first. I'll get the
lady."</p>

<p>He roused Jill and escorted her into the hall. Trono grinned
sourly at her and winked portentously at Stubbins. "Jill, we got
to go fer a little ride. Don't you be afeerd, though. It's all
right."</p>

<p>The girl lifted her shoulders. She knew, in a half certain
way, what they were about, though she didn't understand that it
implicated Tom Lilly. Resistance was utterly useless. Mustering
her courage she lifted her clear, oval face to Stubbins. "I'm
already becoming a burden to you, am I not? All right, Mr.
Stubbins. You'll find that a woman has a thousand ways of
fighting back you never heard of. And, remember, I'll scratch
your eyes out before you are finished with me."</p>

<p>Trono led her into the yard. In a few minutes a 3Cross man led
around a second horse and presently the girl was traveling again.
This time southward. She had managed to smile somewhat at
Stubbins and assumed an air of triumph. Here in the utter
darkness, bound for an unknown destination, this triumph deserted
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Red, where <i>are</i> you! I wish you'd come!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; IN POWDER'S BASTILLE</h2>

<p class="first"><i>"I'm a peaceful man. Fightin' I don't like. But here I am, now who do I shoot?"&mdash;Joe Breedlove.</i> </p>

<br>

<p class="first">POWDER sweltered under the baking, midday heat;
Powder shivered with the midnight cold. It was a town of violent
extremes, living in a state of suspended animation for long
periods of time until the cowboy and his money rode furiously in
to spill the red paint. Life here was indolent and easy until the
slumbering passions flared up; then it became cruel, raw, unjust.
Such was Powder as it appeared to Tom as he surveyed it from the
second floor of the sheriff's office during the two days of his
confinement.</p>

<p>There was nothing much to divert him, save his own thoughts
and these were not of a kind to guarantee peace. He was never the
man to play possum; he had no easy-going philosophy to console
him when things went wrong. Rather his quick temper fed upon his
injuries and the injuries done to others, growing greater, more
volcanic. So it flickered and flared under pressure, ready to
burst forth at the first opportunity, making of him an extremely
dangerous character. The sheriff, visiting now and then, saw this
and in an easy-going way tried to humor him.</p>

<p>"Now it don't ever help a man to hold his breath until his
lungs cave in," he warned. "That's what yore doin'. You'll bust
yore G string and be plumb out of harmony if you don't just float
with the tide a while. Sing yoreself a sweet little ditty an'
pretend yore takin' the rest cure."</p>

<p>"That," muttered Tom Lilly, "is what Joe Breedlove would say.
Yeh, 'Take it easy' is his fav'rite motto."</p>

<p>"Yore friend has got plenty of sense," said the sheriff. "An
oiled wheel lasts longer than a dry one."</p>

<p>"Hell! I'm not built that way. Yore a fine fellow to come
round here talkin' like Santy Claus. It ain't no skin off yore
nose that they's a bunch of wild men up in the hills pickin' the
JIB to pieces."</p>

<p>He couldn't quite understand the sheriff. The man draped
himself against the door, smiling down his pipestem. There was
apparent honesty in his eyes and a certain stubborn fearlessness
in the cut of the grizzled, middle-aged face. "Seems to me you
didn't have any friendly notions to'rds the JIB when you went
into Pilgrim Valley," said he. "Why all the concern now?"</p>

<p>"I hate a double crosser," said Tom. "It natcherlly makes me
riled."</p>

<p>"Well, you're buckin' some powerful gents, my son. Take the
advice of an old campaigner. Slick does it in this country. Don't
go around announcin' your intentions. Just sing low until you're
ready to slam in with the artillery."</p>

<p>"Fine to say," grunted Tom. "But do you realize they's a girl
bein' held somewhere in those hills? By the Lord Harry, it ain't
nothin' to smile about! That's what gripes me. I'd kill somebody
for that."</p>

<p>The sheriff stared long and intently at Tom Lilly. His
forehead wrinkled thoughtfully and he removed his pipe, tapping
it against the grating. "Wherever she is, nobody's treatin' her
too bad. Them boys ain't forgot they're gentlemen&mdash;of a
sort."</p>

<p>"What boys?" demanded Lilly.</p>

<p>The sheriff merely grinned. Lilly stood up. "Say, you seem to
know a powerful lot. When do I get tried for this awful crime I
didn't commit?"</p>

<p>"Soon enough," said the sheriff. "As for knowin' things, I'll
admit it. That's why I hold my job. You have to mingle politics
with duty in this country, Red."</p>

<p>Lilly heard him creaking down the stairs and call to somebody
in the street. A short while after a rider cantered southward
from the town&mdash;Lilly saw him go from the back window of his
cubicle. The sheriff, too, got aboard his sorrel and ambled
leisurely away from the smothering heap that was Powder. The day
droned along; night came and with it the sounds of reviving
pleasure. Supper came. The piano in Jake Miner's place sent forth
its stuttering off-key harmony. Boots clumped across the
sheriff's office below him. Evidently that worthy was back from
his ride. Lilly rolled an after supper cigarette and reflected on
many things. Considering the seriousness of the charge placed
against him, it seemed the sheriff maintained a mighty friendly
attitude toward him; nor did he seem greatly exercised at the
thought of Jill Breck having disappeared. There was mystery
behind this. Was the man in league with Trono? On the surface it
appeared so, but Lilly could not imagine double-dealing behind
the sheriffs square, frank face.</p>

<p>Darkness had long since fallen. Below, there was a murmuring
of voices, two or three of them. Then the stairway squealed under
a heavy body and a vague shadow appeared beyond the grating. A
key scraped the lock and a soft voice&mdash;a voice that had a
sweet and laughing timber to it&mdash;floated inward.</p>

<p>"Yeh. The sheriff said this was where he kept his star
boarder. Iron bars do not a prison make! Shore enough. Mister
Lilly would you be so kind as to step forth where I c'n shock
myself with yore unholy mug oncet more?"</p>

<p>Lilly sprang up, checking a shout of delight. Joe Breedlove!
Pattipaws then, had delivered his message. He shoved the door
open and with an effort spoke casually. "You old wampus cat."</p>

<p>"Yeh. Same to yuh an' many of them. It shorely seems
natcheral&mdash;me gittin' yuh outa jail oncet more. I'm allus
giftin' yuh outa some mess." A firm hand closed on his shoulder.
Breedlove's tall, square body stooped toward him. "I'm a man o'
peace. I hate to fight. But here I am, now who do I shoot?"</p>

<p>"Easy, boy. What'd you do with the sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Moses an' I sorter sauntered in like we wanted to
converse with him an' gits the drop. He's down talkin' religion
to Moses now. Only it's hard fer a gent to talk with his hands
tied."</p>

<p>"You brought the boys along?"</p>

<p>"Eight simple-minded men o' the open spaces. We rolled our
blankets five minutes after yore telegram come. Hopped a freight
at the water tank an' had a right nice journey. Railroad men c'n
be awful accommodatin', when they got to be. The Injun was at the
Junction waitin' fer us. Guess he knew all about yuh, fer he
leads us thisaway. I left the boys outside so nobody'd get
excited."</p>

<p>Lilly groped down the stairway and opened a door into a side
room. A lantern emitted feeble rays through its smudgy shield,
revealing the sheriff neatly tied to a chair and a sad-faced,
loose-jointed person standing near him, speaking in polite
solemnity about the weather. The sheriff seemed not to mind his
position; he grinned with cheerful humor when Tom Lilly
entered.</p>

<p>"I was wonderin' when your party would arrive," said he.
"Better turn down that lantern a little. Somebody might peek in
that door."</p>

<p>"Huh?" asked Lilly. "How did you know I asked for help?"</p>

<p>"Shucks, man, give me a little credit. Ever' time a sparrow
ketches a worm in Robey County I know it. How? That's my own
business. What's your next move?"</p>

<p>"Now look here," interrupted Lilly. "Explain yoreself. I don't
arrive at you atall. Are you for me or agin me? If yore for me,
why did you put me in the jug? If yore agin me, what's the idea
o' actin' as if you'd found yore long lost brother?"</p>

<p>"I'm for justice. Red. That's a-plenty. But sometimes I've got
to use devious means to arrive at it. Now, I pinched you to keep
Trono and his fine assassins from tyin' you to a tree, which they
honed to do. As for lookin' proud in these close-embracin' folds
of rope, what good would it do me to cuss? You got me. Now go on
an' peddle your papers. Though I'm more'n half glad you rustled
up some good men."</p>

<p>"Don't it beat hell?" grunted Lilly. Joe Breedlove was
smiling, his tall, husky frame slightly bent over. His was the
countenance of a man well disposed toward the world; from his
sandy yellow hair downward he made a picture of an easy-going,
shrcwdly-observant character. Sadness had touched Joe Breedlove;
he had never had a home. Once, he had seen himself double-hitched
and running his own small ranch. But that was only a memory now.
Out of all this he could still smile that sweet, charitable
smile, looking at the world with eyes that were sometimes
thoughtful, but never embittered.</p>

<p>The sheriff seemed to find him worth studying. "Tell that red-
headed friend of yours how it is when you get a chance. You
savvy, don't you?"</p>

<p>Breedlove nodded. "Uhuh. Tom might, too, if he wa'n't such a
dog-goned ser'ous nature. Y' see, he's all fight."</p>

<p>"So I can see. Well, where you bound for now?'"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to rake Pilgrim Valley with a fine comb," said Tom
Lilly.</p>

<p>"It's plumb empty," replied the sheriff. "Turn your attention
to the 3Cross. You'll find something interesting there."</p>

<p>"Well, by the Lord Harry," exploded Tom, "if you know that
much, why haven't you collected a posse and gone after 'em?"</p>

<p>"Because I couldn't find ten men I could trust. Somebody'd
squeal and when I got to the rancho I wouldn't find a thing."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll surprise 'em this time," said Tom. "You better
come along."</p>

<p>"Nope," objected the sheriff. "There might be some violence
done and I'd have to take official cognizance of it. What I don't
see I don't know. Just tie me tighter in this chair an' shove me
in the corner. Then turn out the light, lock the door and be on
your way. Good luck."</p>

<p>Joe Breedlove, chuckling, stepped forward to do as the sheriff
asked. The two exchanged glances, they understood each other
quite well, for they were of the same type. "I'd admire to drink
with yuh some day," said Breedlove.</p>

<p>"Well, that goes double," replied the sheriff. "When your
vacation in the hills is finished drop back."</p>

<p>Lilly shook his head. "You shore beat me, Sheriff. Well, let's
be goin'." They slid out of the office and, hidden by the
shadows, ducked through an alley to the back of the town. A
hundred yards off they collided with a waiting party. Muffled
words of greeting floated upward, the rough and apparently
unemotional talk of men glad to see another.</p>

<p>"Here's the ol' hoss."</p>

<p>"Drunk er sober? Hey, remember when we had t' pull him outen
that scrape at Box Canyon?"</p>

<p>"He don't git no tamer."</p>

<p>Lilly fired back. "Same old pack of gossipin' gran-ma's. Hope
you brought yore tattin' along."</p>

<p>They had journeyed into the country without horses or gear.
Yet here they stood, eight of them, each mounted, and with an
extra animal for Lilly. Mounting and leading away to the south,
he put a puzzled question. "Where'd you collect these scarecrows
from, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Why, we borrowed 'em from the town's stable. The gent in
charge is out in one o' them empty sheds, reflectin' over the
sinfulness o' this world."</p>

<p>There was a suppressed chuckle. The H-H crew was having a
glorious vacation. Lilly settled into a stiff pace and led them
toward the 3Cross. "Well, have a good time while you can, amigos.
There's shootin' work ahead. Don't forget it." Leather creaked
and spurs jingled. A black veil shrouded the sky and left the
world in utter darkness. Somewhere, a coyote sent forth his
quavering, lonesome cry; the smell of sage was in the night
breeze.</p>

<p>"Ease up," said Lilly in a muffled voice. The cavalcade
dropped to a slow walk, crawling southward. "We're pretty close
to the 3Cross now. I can smell it."</p>

<p>"Do we pay 'em a visit or a surprise?" whispered Joe
Breedlove.</p>

<p>"A surprise. It's a fightin' game now, Joe. I want you to take
four of the boys and corral the bunkhouse. I'll picket a couple
around the house an' one at the barn. Me, I'm goin' in to find
this horse-faced Englishman and pluck his eyebrows out, one at a
time."</p>

<p>"Sounds bad," murmured Breedlove; he was chuckling. "The
boys'll enjoy this little holiday."</p>

<p>Blacker shadows in the thin, morning air. Lilly halted, the
cavalcade colliding with him. Soft warning ran from man to man
and there was a slight groaning of leather and the muffled sound
of hands sliding across holsters. "We walk from here," announced
Lilly. "Joe, I'll give you five minutes to get that bunkhouse
located. When yore ready, let out a whoop and a shot as warnin'
to me."</p>

<p>They slid down, leaving the horses. Indian file, they slouched
forward behind Lilly until the ranch-house barred their way.
Silently, Joe Breedlove touched the four nearest men and,
together they disappeared. Lilly whispered directions to the
remaining three and waited until they had slipped off before
advancing across the porch of the house. As with all Westerners,
Stubbins scorned to lock his doors and Lilly raised the latch and
opened the portal an inch at a time. A single coal gleamed in the
fireplace; stale pipe smoke filled the room. Lilly groped his way
over the rug-strewn floor, touched a table and stopped to orient
himself. This room was quite silent; but he heard the heavy
snoring of a man come out of some near-by room. He skirted a
chair, entered what felt like a hallway to his exploring fingers
and stopped at a sudden opening. The sleeping fellow's breath
rose and fell, alternately sibilant and droning. A heavy sleeper,
this one. Lilly felt certain it was Stubbins and moved over the
threshold, approaching the bed. There was a window directly
beyond the bed and by the patch of gray shadow relieving the
opaque dark of the room he saw the crooked figure sprawled
beneath the blankets.</p>

<p>Closer he dared not go. So he rested, bringing up his gun and
waiting for the signal from Joe Breedlove. Treacherous silence
pervaded the 3Cross. The sleeping figure strangled and turned,
relapsing to a more normal breathing.</p>

<p>The signal changed all this. There was a high, "Eee-yippy-
yippy-yip!" and the flat explosion of a revolver. A door was
smashed in and instantly a dozen voices and another gun shot
answered the challenge. Lilly had no opportunity to follow Joe
Breedlove's fortunes; his own man had risen bolt upright in bed,
silhouetted by the gray patch of the window, and was swearing
broadly. "What's that&mdash;what's that?" he grumbled. A better
comprehension came to him when Lilly stepped up, speaking in a
soothing voice. "You stand fast, brother Stubbins. I recognize
that beef-eatin' accent. Boost yore hands. Boost 'em!"</p>

<p>The bed springs screeched. Stubbins flung himself backward and
smote the woolen head of his couch with terrific force. Lilly saw
a hand go around in a semicircle and knew the man was reaching
for his gun. He brought the barrel of his own weapon down,
smashing Stubbins across the head. Thereupon, the master of the
3Cross grunted and temporarily passed from the scene. Lilly's
exploring hand reached and appropriated Stubbins' gun and holster
hanging on the bed post.</p>

<p>A rear door opened with a clatter and boots came tramping down
the hallway. A voice said, "Hey, Stubbins! What the
hell&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He was pouring words through the bedroom door; but his senses
told him something was wrong and he drew back with a challenge.
"Who's that there? Speak up or I'll plug yuh!"</p>

<p>"Same to you, brother," announced Lilly and stepped aside into
a deeper patch of darkness. An orange-purple flame ran out and
was met by another; a water jar trembled in its bowl, the acrid
odor of burnt powder swirled high. A gun dropped, a body slid
down with a surprising sigh. Somewhere to the rear a Chinaman's
voice was flinging weird, wild words about like so many pitched
knives. Over this bedlam he heard the drawling voices of one of
his own men, Moses. "Well, how's it stand?"</p>

<p>"I plugged somebody," announced Lilly. "The main guy is here
on the bed where I plastered him."</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty," announced Moses in a bored tone. "I ketched me
a person at the front door. Seems like he was on guard, but I
reckon he fell asleep till the noise jarred him some. He's
chewin' at the knots I took in him. Say, that Chink is apt to
bust a lung if he don't take a few cinches in them gosh-awful
words."</p>

<p>"Light up," said Lilly. "I think Joe's rounded his
critters."</p>

<p>He had followed the sound of struggle in the bunk-house but
intermittently during his own activity; and by now the shots had
ceased and there was only the hum of voices like the buzzing of
bees in a disturbed hive. Breedlove sent his gay announcement
across the yard. "Say what, Tommy."</p>

<p>"Good enough here."</p>

<p>"Well, what'll I do with these boys? Never saw so many
punchers fer one ranch. I count fifteen."</p>

<p>"Hobble 'em an' come over."</p>

<p>Moses had found and lighted a lamp in the main room. He
carried it into the bedroom and inspected the man Lilly had
dropped at the door. Blood streamed down his face, but it seemed
to be something less than a mortal wound. Moses put the lamp on
the floor and ran an investigating finger over the fellow's head.
"He's grazed, Tom. Sorter knocked him cuckoo. I'll put a
han'k'chuff aroun' it an' he'll be good enough."</p>

<p>Stubbins on the bed, was coming out of his enforced sleep;
coming out in a fighting mood, twitching his arms. Lilly waited
until the Englishman opened his eyes and shook the mists clear of
his head. Anger glinted in the pale blue eyes as he stared toward
Lilly. "What's this confounded banditry about?" he growled. "I
shall hold you for this, friend. I'll have your scalp for it,
believe me."</p>

<p>"What have you done with Jill Breck?" demanded Lilly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;that's it, eh? It would please you to find out,
wouldn't it? Well, she's not here, Red. She's far away." Then it
seemed to occur to him that he had forgotten himself. "Why, you
damn pup, <i>you</i> know well enough where she is! I'll have you
back in jail within six hours. Watch you hang, too, by
Godfrey!"</p>

<p>"Yore out of date," said Lilly. "Things have happened since
you went to sleep. Yore gang is hog-tied. I've got a posse here
that'll string you to a tree if you lie to me. Time's past for
foolin'. I've got enough on you this minute to send you to the
pen."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Some of the JIB boys have been tellin' tales," offered Lilly.
"Some of the JIB cows have been found in yore herds, too. We know
Jill Breck's been here. Now, you talk turkey an' talk fast."</p>

<p>It was all guess work, but based on good evidence. Lilly
watched the Englishman's face settle and to further upset the man
he ordered him up and into the main room where Joe Breedlove and
three or four of the H-H crew were lounging. "It's all off with
you, Stubbins. You tell the truth. We've got six men who'll turn
state's evidence against you. Where's Jill Breck?"</p>

<p>"What if I tell?"</p>

<p>"You'll get an even break," promised Lilly.</p>

<p>"What if I don't tell?" shot back Stubbins, his thin mouth
disappearing beneath the great nose.</p>

<p>"You'll be hung in an hour."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, no. You wouldn't dare that. I'm too big a man in this
country."</p>

<p>"So? Say, when this leaks out there won't be a man, woman or
dog in Robey County but what won't want to take a piece out of
yore hide. No, you ain't got a foot to stand on. Now, where's
Jill Breck?"</p>

<p>Stubbins thrust a long, cool glance around at the H-H men,
then rose and filled one of the pipes on the mantel. Behind a
cloud of tobacco smoke he deliberated. For all his villainy,
there was something in the man to evoke admiration. Here he
stood, with all his plans crashing down around his head, with
three or four grave charges against him&mdash;charges that would
inevitably lead him to the penitentiary or worse; he had no means
of knowing whether this posse would take his life or not, or if
they let him go, whether an outraged county would be as lenient.
Still, he smoked imperturbably, as if deciding no more important
a thing than whether or not to hire another hand for his
ranch.</p>

<p>"Yore house is made of cards," broke in Lilly. "As long as old
Breck lived, he and you could buffalo this county. But it's too
big a job for you alone. A dozen good men can bust any sort of
range piracy, and we're goin' to bust you. Times are changin',
amigo. You'll change with 'em or go down."</p>

<p>Fretfulness invaded the horsey face. "Damn the man," said
Stubbins testily. "Damn Trono. He was the one I always
mistrusted. You can't play with a bullheaded fool. Now, he
shouldn't have brought&mdash;" There he stopped, finishing the
sentence to himself.</p>

<p>"Anybody's a fool to trail along with Trono," broke in Lilly.
"He'll saddle murder to you yet."</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Stubbins, jerking up his head.
"Murder&mdash;murder?"</p>

<p>"It's the kind he is," replied Lilly. "I know him. He'll go
bugs an' shoot anything in sight."</p>

<p>Stubbins appeared to be seeing unwelcome visions. "Ay, I know
that. Look, what do you mean by an even break?"</p>

<p>"Stolen goods returned and no questions asked."</p>

<p>"Ah. What goods?"</p>

<p>"Jill Breck for one. Later Joe and I will hold a roundup of
yore stock and pick JIB critters."</p>

<p>"And no tales told!"</p>

<p>"None but what naturally leak out, amigo. Of course, yore
goin' to lose some of them nice cut-throats you've got hired.
Joe's goin' to see that they get started north after breakfast.
I'll send the JIB bunch over to you, seein' they're yore men
anyhow. Now, let's shorten this palaver."</p>

<p>"Devil," muttered Stubbins. He shot a glance at Lilly. "My
boy, you ain't scarin' me, understand? I do this of my own
conscience. No man's big enough to scare me."</p>

<p>"Have it yore own way," said Lilly. Joe Breedlove dropped a
wink at his partner, which Lilly answered.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Trono took Jill Breck, the night before lost. I
told him to stop at a line rider's cabin." He marched to a book
case and found a map of the country, running his finger along its
surface and pointing for Lilly's benefit. "There you are. It's
twenty miles southeast. In the fringe of rock and trees. Welcome,
my lad."</p>

<p>"And you let that lout take her off!" cried Lilly, his temper
rising. "If she's harmed I'll kill you for it!"</p>

<p>Stubbins returned a hard, obstinate stare, growing red around
his heavy neck. He was about to make some rousing answer when he
caught Joe Breedlove's usually mild eyes anchored on him with
such an intent, weighing glance that he forebore. Instead, he
asked a question.</p>

<p>"You mean to kill him?"</p>

<p>"One of us goes down," retorted Lilly.</p>

<p>"It's all the same to me," said Stubbins. "You or him." With
that he dropped in a chair and smoked furiously.</p>

<p>"Moses," said Lilly, "find me a fresh horse." He walked into
the pale light of false dawn, Joe Breedlove close behind. The big
man's arm rested lightly on Lilly's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, this is yore fight, Red, so I ain't goin'. But watch
yore rear. An' say, yuh wouldn't have hung Stubbins, even if he'd
refused to talk."</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Lilly, "but I shore would've done
somethin'. He's slick, that boy. Know why he told on Trono?
Because he knew one of us won't come back, which is just right
for him."</p>

<p>"Like hell it is," growled Breedlove. Moses was returning with
a saddled paint horse. "If yuh don't show up in five-six hours,
Mr. Stubbins is like to have an accident. Meanwhile, we'll take
care o' this crew."</p>

<p>Lilly swung up, gripped Joe's outstretched arm, and spurred
away. Dawn was just below the eastern rim; toward it he traveled,
going as fast as the horse would stand.</p>

<p><br> The sun rose in its arc, glowered from zenith, and fell
westward, growing more wrathful, more sultry. The vast plain
shimmered under the heat and above the undulating barren spaces
queer, phantasmic shapes formed and dissolved. To all this Tom
Lilly was unconscious. He traveled with Stubbins' map firmly
fixed in his head, and an unreasoning hatred in his heart. It was
Trono, always Trono who interposed his unlovely, killer's face
into the 2000481h-images/ that passed and re-passed Tom Lilly's vision.
Trono was a bad Indian; and never would be a good one until dead.
Where had the man got all this vindictiveness of spirit? What
could he hope to profit from his course of lawlessness? Well, he
was an outlaw by nature; made the more so by his training under
old Jim Breck in the days when the Octopus had given him hard
chores to do. Evidently, he had formed connections with
Stubbins&mdash;probably would be a chief heir of the looting of
the JIB.</p>

<p>"Even if there wasn't a cent to be made he'd be a renegade,
though," opined Lilly. Reviewing the course of events he slapped
one hand against the saddle skirts, saying, "It's him or me. If
he's laid one o' his dirty paws on Jill&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not, for all the glaring sun, keep her clear oval
face from his eyes. She was like no other woman he had ever
known. Old Jim Breck had given her a good measure of his sturdy
spirit and some of his uncomplaining fortitude. Never, in that
long night of flight, had she whimpered. Never had she traded on
the fact that she was a woman; seemed, in fact, reluctant to
admit that she couldn't do all a man could do. And she had smiled
at him in such a manner when she rolled up in the blankets, the
rosy color tinging her cheeks and some unfathomable emotion
moving in the sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>He swerved, climbed the bench on his left and presently was
threading his way among the pines. Shade here, but no coolness.
He struck a trail that slanted upward into deeper recesses of the
forest and of a sudden all things immaterial to the chase left
his head. The tracks of two horses were in the sandy course
before him. Not fresh tracks, but recent enough to still show a
clear imprint. These he followed, resorting to trailing tactics,
for he had followed men before and understood their slyness.</p>

<p>At intervals he left the trail and dived into the trees, going
a hundred yards or more before reappearing. Sometimes, confronted
by a barrier of rock or deadfall, he made a considerable detour
and came to a halt, sweeping the vistas, listening for out of the
way sounds. But the forest was silent, save for the drone of heat
and small insects. So, he pushed on until his eyes saw a thinning
of the pines directly ahead and when he dismounted and crawled
forward flat on his stomach, he saw a miniature meadow in which
sat a cabin and a small corral. Lush grass stood ankle-high; a
small path was beaten through it from the trees to the door. And
on the threshold of the door, squatted down like a massive,
sullen spider, was Theed Trono. The sun slanted against his face,
bringing into bold relief the cleft chin, the columnar neck;
shaded by the wide hat-brim his upper features were obscured. A
cigarette dangled from one corner of his mouth and he played idly
with his lariat, making loops on the ground.</p>

<p>He seemed so much off guard, so little expecting danger that
Tom Lilly tarried a while in his covert, shooting glances to all
corners of the clearing, seeking some manner of a trap. But
though he waited a good ten minutes, he could find nothing to
justify his caution. The girl was not to be seen; doubtless she
was inside the cabin.</p>

<p>He parted the grass before him, gun forward, and rose to one
knee. "Trono," said he, in a quiet voice, "you'll stay right
there. Hoist yore hands."</p>

<p>Trono's body stiffened. The hand holding the lariat stopped
its circular movement and the Stetson jerked upward, revealing
the flash of his green eyes. By and by he dropped the rope and
hunched his shoulders, moving his big arms above his head. Lilly
stepped from his shelter and walked half way across the meadow.
The burly one watching him from half closed eyes; an almost
lifeless tone emerged from his enormous chest&mdash;the tone of a
man discouraged and defeated.</p>

<p>"Knew yuh'd git here soon er late. Shore a persistent fella,
ain't yuh, Red?"</p>

<p>"Expectin' me?"</p>

<p>"Yeh." The green eyes flared. "I've had too much time to
think. Thinkin' ain't good fer a critter. A fack. Bust outa
jail?"</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Lilly, watching his man closely "No
fooling, now. You know what I'll do."</p>

<p>"I reckon," said Trono, wearily. "Nex' time Stubbins c'n do
his own chores. What a hell of a time I've had. Well, le's git
this over with."</p>

<p>Looking beyond the man, Lilly saw Jill Breck half-risen, dimly
visible, in the semi-darkness of the cabin. He saw some movement
of her lips and shook his head at her; whereupon she disappeared,
leaving him with his great problem. Trono was smiling slightly.
"Don't yuh know what to do with me, kid?"</p>

<p>"I see trouble in yore face, Trono. Turn around, face against
the logs. I came here to get you&mdash;bear it in mind, amigo. If
you want to take the chance, all right. I'm just warnin'
you."</p>

<p>Trono turned, muttering, "Oh, I've had plenty. I been thinkin'
Stubbins double crossed me. What would I do with this gal,
anyhow? Ain't it a hell of a chore fer a man? Him a-sittin' back
an' lettin' me run the danger. No, I won't raise a rumpus. I'm a-
goin' back with you an' turn state's evidence on that beef-
eatin', mealy-mouth fool. A fack."</p>

<p>"Change of heart, eh?" grunted Lilly, moving closer,
distrusting all this talk. Trono was a bundle of dynamite; a
vicious cross-grained man who liked to lull an opponent and
strike unawares. So he moved cautiously, arm reaching out for
Trono's revolver.</p>

<p>"Well, call it that," said Trono, his great body as straight
and rigid as he could carry it. The massive shoulders seemed to
fill and threaten the seams of his coat. "But what'd happen to me
when a posse got on my trail? I'll go with yuh, an' be thankful
it ain't a worse proposition. That gun don't slide out easy, Red.
Pull hard. Oh, pull harder!"</p>

<p>Lilly, his fingers touching Trono's gun felt the big body
tremble. He had jammed his own weapon into Trono's back. But the
feeling came over him all of a sudden that the man meant to make
a play; desperate as the case was, Trono had decided to fight.
And so, dropping his fingers, Lilly stepped back. Trono waited an
instant then swung about. The change in his face was striking.
Sweat poured down his swart cheeks and the glitter of evil was in
those green, sparkling eyes. Once more he carried the high,
triumphant, gloating grin.</p>

<p>"Nerve a-failin' yuh, Red? Caught on to my leetle trick, eh?
All right, I'm a-tellin' yuh, I won't go."</p>

<p>"I can't shoot you in the back, Trono," said Lilly. "And I'd
have to if you turned on me like that."</p>

<p>"I knew yuh didn't have no nerve," said Trono. "What yuh goin'
to do?"</p>

<p>Lilly nodded his head. "Walk over there ten yards. I'll give
you an even break."</p>

<p>"Fight it square?" bellowed Trono.</p>

<p>"Fight it square, or drop yore gun belt," announced Lilly.</p>

<p>Trono, without a word, backed away from the log house and
stopped. "Red, I shore take my hat off to yuh. But I ain't goin
to go back, see? Say when."</p>

<p>"Drop yore arms, slow, until they're to yore belt. All right,
that's good. Now I'm puttin' my gun in the holster. We're even."
Lilly's hand rose clear of the gun butt. "Last warnin', amigo.
You'd better give in."</p>

<p>Trono only shook his head. He was a sinister figure, this man,
with his thin lips but a white line in the dark face and the
nostrils contracted from inner excitement. Beads of sweat stood
out on his upper lip; he was swaying slightly, leaning forward,
arms spreading away from his body. Lilly felt the full impact of
that deadly gaze and there flashed across his mind the picture of
a rattlesnake coiled and about to strike. Trono the killer stood
forth in full panoply.</p>

<p>"No signal," said Lilly. His own nerves had jangled a moment
and then stopped. He was cold&mdash;very cold in this bright sun-
drenched clearing. Cold with the premonition of death. All his
senses focused themselves on the bulky figure ten yards away; he
heard nothing but the drone of his own words; saw nothing but a
patch of Trono's shirt where his eyes had centered; felt nothing
but the flexing of his right arm. "No signal," he repeated. "Go
to it when yore ready."</p>

<p>The world was remote. Time ceased to be. Trono seemed to grow
larger, bulk tremendously against the light. The patch of shirt
wrinkled and the man's right arm dropped. Lilly had no notion
what his own gun arm was doing; it appeared to be detached from
whatever mental motor guided it. Fretfully, he wondered why he
wasn't matching that swift, cat-like draw. The blue metal barrel
gleamed in the afternoon sun. As from a distance he heard a heavy
explosion&mdash;no, there was a double explosion and instantly
the world and all its bustling noises, its cheerful warmth, its
grateful light, flooded back. Trono was squinting across the
space, the tip of his gun slightly deflected. Lilly, watching the
weapon with a queer fascination, saw it dip, jerk upward, and dip
again. It dropped to the ground and Trono began to droop. The
starch of life was going out of him; quite slowly at first he
sagged, then, as if his will power had snapped, he collapsed and
lay sprawled, face turned toward Lilly. His thin lips were
fashioning words.</p>

<p>"I'll cash my chips, mister. Yuh c'n never tell&mdash;what a
redhead will do."</p>

<p>He was dead. It seemed altogether ridiculous to Lilly until he
looked down and saw his own gun in his hand. Why, he never knew
he had drawn, never had felt the recoil of firing! He returned it
to his holster and in a moment of thoughtfulness extended his arm
to full length. It seemed ice-cold; not a tremor moved his
fingers.</p>

<p>"Tom Lilly didn't fire that shot," he murmured. "I guess the
Lord shorely is providin' protection."</p>

<p>Jill Breck's voice issued from the cabin, high and electrical.
"Red&mdash;Red, did he touch you?"</p>

<p>Tom was at the door at one stride. "Lord bless you, no. I'm a
fool meant for a different end. Why, what's the matter with you?"
Rage jumbled his words together. "Did that swine hurt you?"</p>

<p>Her voice was of a sudden faint. For a moment he saw only an
outline in the semi-darkness. "No, Red. I'm all right. All right.
But he's kept me tied to this bunk most of the time."</p>

<p>His eyes, becoming accustomed to the shadows, saw that she was
half sitting, half lying on the bunk. Her feet were loosely tied
to the frame and her hands were bound behind her. She could move
two or three feet, no more. Lilly got his knife and cut the rope,
his hand beginning to tremble. Her arms went around him and he
lifted her up as if she were an invalid. It was then his
opportunity came and again his guiding angel helped him to do
something that he would never have been able to do otherwise. In
short, he kissed her, called her "Jill kid!"</p>

<p>Her body quivered. She was saying over and over again, "I
thought you'd never come. I knew you would, but it was so long
waiting. It was so long waiting!"</p>

<p><br> Dusk had settled around the 3Cross. Close harmonies
emerged from the bunkhouse, that is to say, harmonies as close as
the ensembled voices of the happy H-H crew could manage. It had
been a full day and a satisfying one; now they reclined on alien
bunks, sustained by 3Cross chuck. In the main house Joe Breedlove
was playing a close game of checkers with Lancelot Stubbins, his
mild eyes holding no greater care than a concern for the next
move. Stubbins seemed to have forgotten his own tangled, troubled
affairs. Pipe smoke curled high in the room and the mellow light
of the fireplace shimmered over the floor. Remington's bighorn
looked down from his high perch with a smug, defiant glance of
safety.</p>

<p>"Checkers," observed Joe Breedlove, "is a pastime from which
due observations regardin' life might be made. Yuh advance, then
yuh stop. Mebbe yuh are taken. But yuh don't go back unless yuh
reach the king row. Same in a man's life&mdash;only they ain't no
king row."</p>

<p>"Mr.," said Lancelot Stubbins. "D'ye know, you're a queer
cuss."</p>

<p>"It's been told me before," replied Joe, "only in less elegant
terms. Don't I hear hawsses?"</p>

<p>He abandoned his game and went to the door. And when he saw
Jill and Tom advancing out of the night he began to smile that
rare, sweet smile. He saw them dismount and observed the careful
manner in which Lilly lifted down the girl. At that he turned
back. "Guess JIB will have good management from now on."</p>

<p>The pair came into the room. Tom Lilly walked straight over to
Stubbins. "I'll keep my promise, amigo. Yore free as the air. But
I'm yore nex' door neighbor from now on and you'll shoot square
with the JIB."</p>

<p>"I guess," said Joe, "us boys won't have much more to do in
these parts."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you will," replied Tom. "Yore goin' to conduct a
roundup on 3Cross an' ketch JIB critters. Also I'll be needin' a
man to go to Powder an', have the sher'ff come out. He'll find
Trono in the line rider's cabin."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>"No, you son o' Satan, it ain't. Yore hired permanent as
foreman o' the JIB. I'd like the boys to stay with us, too. We
got to run the present crew off the range. Then we got to make a
skookum ranch of it. What'd you do with Mr. Stubbins' men?"</p>

<p>Stubbins slammed down the handful of checkers he carried and
rose, exploding a brief word. "Ran them to the county line, by
Gad!"</p>

<p>"Fair enough."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" persisted Joe, smiling.</p>

<p>Tom Lilly looked to Jill soberly; she had nothing to say.
"Well, you can be best man," he replied.</p>

<p>Joe's arm fell across his partner's shoulder. Nothing was
said, but a glance passed between the two of them such as only
loyal abiding friends would exchange.</p>
