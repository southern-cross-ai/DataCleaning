  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1</b></h2>
  <p>In the closing years of the last century there arose in the wooded highlands
    of Brazil a prophet whose name was Antonio Maciel. Of mixed Portuguese and
    Indian blood, this Maciel had been a store-keeper in his father&rsquo;s business,
    had totted up accounts of black beans, tobacco and coffee, and had made entries
    for so many milreis in his ledger. Had it not been for matrimonial troubles
    Antonio would probably have ended his days peaceably and monotonously in
    the small provincial town of Quisceramobim, with no excitement to disturb
    the even tenor of his ways, save an occasional cock-fight on a Sunday, or
    a mock combat in the market-place.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, in the backwoods of Brazil, as everywhere else, love has
    its comedies and its tragedies; and even in the Sertao, surely the most desolate,
    the most isolated, the most abandoned corner of God&rsquo;s earth, the same
    dramas of love, jealousy and hate are enacted as in the stately homes of
    England, or the boudoirs of Paris. It is only the <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> that
    is different. Antonio Maciel had the misfortune to marry a woman of no morality
    and an ungovernable temper, who indirectly became the cause of the most sanguinary
    religious conflict of modern times. Her intrigue with a police official of
    Bahia, a friend of her husband&rsquo;s, became the turning-point in the career
    of the peaceable store-keeper. It roused the hot Portuguese blood in his
    veins. He came of a stock that had always held human life very cheap&mdash;especially
    that of an enemy&mdash;and coming upon the treacherous police official at
    a moment when his embittered soul was thirsting for revenge, he fell upon
    the betrayer of his honour with holy fury, and though he did not succeed
    in killing him, he inflicted grave bodily injury upon the traitor.</p>
  <p>For this he was imprisoned, and from prison he escaped. Whither? No one
    knew. For ten years he disappeared and was duly forgotten. But ten years
    later he reappeared, no longer however as a simple-minded, hard-working storekeeper,
    but as a visionary and a prophet, preaching the Word of God, the Second Advent
    of the Lord, the Antichrist and the coming Day of Judgment.</p>
  <p>Now the <i>vaqueiros</i> of the Sertao, cattle-raisers most of them, primitive,
    illiterate and wild, have a strong vein of mysticism and superstitious religious
    fervour in their veins. Catholics nominally, but in reality professing what
    amounts to the simplest form of theism, they know nothing and care less for
    the hierarchy of their Church. They are intensely devout, and religion plays
    a very important part in their lives; but as far as sacerdotalism is concerned,
    all they trouble about is the one cur&eacute; of their district, who will
    absolve them of their sins, baptize them, marry and bury them; of Pope, hierarchy,
    and articles of faith they have only vaguely heard. Side by side, however,
    with their outward acceptance of the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s teachings, they
    keep up all the old beliefs of their mixed ancestry&mdash;the power of the
    snake-charmers, the Gri-gri men and devil-dancers from Africa, some Moorish
    practices, and Indian fetishes and totems, any superstition in fact that
    appeals to their imagination and to their mystic tendencies.</p>
  <p>Suddenly then, in the midst of these primitive men, there appeared&mdash;coming
    God knows whence&mdash;this tall, emaciated, unkempt creature, clad in a
    loose robe, with prematurely grey hair and beard fluttering around his parchment-coloured
    face, loudly proclaiming the imminent destruction of the world by the sword
    of the Antichrist, and the coming of the Kingdom of God, to which only the
    elect would presently be called. The appeal was immediate. Men flocked around
    the prophet like flies around a honeypot. Casting aside their lassoes and
    their goads, they followed him in their hundreds and their thousands with
    their wives and their children; they looked upon him as a new John the Baptist,
    of whom they had only vaguely heard, but who, they believed, must have looked
    just like this prophet with the flashing eyes and the tall pastoral staff.
    They followed him; they obeyed him; they echoed his prophecies that the world
    was now coming to an end, and that therefore, deeds&mdash;whatever they were,
    good or evil&mdash;no longer mattered; only prayer mattered, incessant prayer
    and abstinence which would help to open the portals of the Kingdom of God
    to His elect.</p>
  <p>Led by the erstwhile store-keeper, whom they now called Antonio Conselheiro&mdash;Antonio
    the Counsellor&mdash;they trekked as far as the shores of the Vasa Barris
    River; here they settled, and on a height overlooking the valley they started
    building an immense church, with their own homes and huts clustering on the
    surrounding slopes. They did no manner of harm to anyone, beyond consigning
    in their minds to everlasting damnation all those who did not hold the same
    beliefs as themselves. They spent their time in chanting hymns, listening
    to the prophet and building their church.</p>
  <p>Why the Brazilian Government should have looked upon them as rebels and
    revolutionaries, why it should have decreed the death of the prophet and
    the destruction of his followers, it is impossible to say. Antonio Conselheiro
    was a religious fanatic, as misguided as you like, probably with mind unhinged,
    but he was not out to make political trouble. He firmly believed that the
    world was shortly coming to an end, and that therefore it mattered not what
    men did, so long as they  &lsquo;kept in communion with God.&rsquo; This
    meant fasting and praying and chanting hymns. There was no occasion to give
    alms to the poor, to love your neighbour as yourself, to be faithful to your
    wife and provide for your children, because there was really no time to bother
    about such things. The world was coming to an end, and naturally the Almighty
    was only going to trouble about people who were in constant communication
    with Him&mdash;who never, as it were, allowed Him to forget them.</p>
  <p>Well! there might have been a good deal of harm in such a theory if preached
    in London, say, or New York, or Monte Carlo, but out there, where never foot
    of stranger treads, where never a word from the outside penetrates, where
    men live on horseback and have no thought of other occupations save cattle-rearing,
    what in the world did it matter what further superstitions made happier the
    lives of a few thousand ignorant vaqueiros? It must have been obvious to
    any sane official that these men knew nothing about politics, that the words &lsquo;Republic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Empire&rsquo;  had
    no meaning whatever for them, and that &lsquo;Dom Pedro&rsquo; or &lsquo;President
    X.Y.Z.&rsquo; were all the same in their sight. But, of course, when the
    Government sent a military expedition against them, with Krupp guns and other
    engines of war, they fought stubbornly, violently, cruelly. Some of their
    deeds rivalled the worst atrocities committed during the religious wars in
    medi&aelig;val times, but had they been left alone they would not have interfered
    with anyone; they would have remained content to chant their hymns and to
    build their church, a law unto themselves perhaps, but as they were so far
    away from anywhere and had little, if any, intercourse with the rest of the
    world, the State could not possibly have suffered at their hands.</p>
  <p>No fewer than four military expeditions&mdash;each one of vastly-increased
    strength&mdash;were sent out against these so-called rebels before they were
    finally subdued ... annihilated would be the more correct word ... and even
    then they were not subdued by force of arms, but by hunger and disease. They
    fought relentlessly to the last, giving no quarter, asking for none. Their
    women, wrapped in their blankets, starved to death with Indian stoicism.
    Their leaders were killed to a man. At last the prophet himself succumbed.
    He was found one morning, at early dawn, within the crumbling walls of the
    half-finished church, lying on the floor face downwards, a crucifix gripped
    tightly in his hand.</p>
  <p>To the last they chanted their hymns; and when the last of the walls of
    the church fell crashing over the prostrate body of their prophet, when their
    homes were nothing but a handful of smouldering ashes, the soldiers of the
    Government encamped upon the heights could still hear through the stillness
    of the night a murmur rising from the valley below&mdash;long, mournful cadences
    that rose and fell like the soughing of the wind through the scrub. It was
    the song of the dying warriors, still trusting in their God, still waiting
    to enter into His Kingdom, and content in the belief that those who had brought
    them down were speeding to eternal damnation.</p>
  <p class="note">The author is indebted to R. Cunninghame Graham&rsquo;s <i>A Brazilian Mystic</i> for
    all the facts relating to the life and death of Antonio Conselheiro.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</b></h2>
  <p>All this occurred little more than fifty years ago. Nothing for years was
    heard of the little band of fanatics who had given the Republican Government
    so much trouble at the time; only a very few of them could have survived
    the final suppression of that so-called rebellion, and they presumably went
    back to their hard life and their peaceful avocation of cattle-rearing.</p>
  <p>But, strangely enough, some twenty-five years later, a new turbulent element
    had sprung up in the Sertao. It seemed all of a sudden as if the strange
    events of the late &lsquo;nineties were being repeated, though in a different
    form. Again there arose a mystic leader with power to gather round him a
    band of enthusiastic and devoted followers recruited from among the half-civilized
    dwellers of these rocky fastnesses. Unlike Antonio Conselheiro, however,
    this new prophet&mdash;or whatever one chooses to call him&mdash;was not
    a religious enthusiast. He preached neither the coming of the Kingdom of
    God nor the end of the World and the Advent of Christ. In fact, he did not
    preach anything at all. He left this part of the business to his enthusiastic
    lieutenants. Nor was his life as ascetic or his aims as disinterested as
    those of the great Antonio. Who he was, or whence he came, no one knew. Everything
    was mere conjecture. But those of his followers whom the exigencies of business
    or labour brought into contact with the outside world spoke with bated breath
    of the man whom they called the Great Unknown.</p>
  <p><i>Vaqueiros</i>, farmers, herdsmen, as well as outcasts of every sort,
    Negroes, Indians, half-breeds, and a few gaol-birds, made up the sum total
    of the followers of this new prophet. The illiterate, uneducated, primitive,
    declared that he was Antonio Conselheiro come to life again: whilst those
    who were more enlightened, those who occasionally consorted with their fellow-men
    and who came from time to time to Bonfim or Joazeiro to sell their cattle
    or their hides, averred that the Great Unknown was the grandson of Dom Pedro
    II, the last Emperor of Brazil, come to claim the throne of his forebears.
    How they worked that out nobody could quite make out: certain it is that
    a political atmosphere as well as a religious one hung over this new version
    of an old story. The Sertao appeared now like a second Vend&eacute;e where
    men loyal to the old dynasty rallied round the person of their dispossessed
    sovereign and were apparently prepared to fight and die in his cause. The
    fact that the grandsons of the late Emperor over in France cared nothing
    about these fanatical upholders of their cause, nor for the throne of Brazil
    for that matter, would not have obtained credence in the Sertao for one moment.
    Nor did these new Vend&eacute;ans worry their heads as to the exact genealogy
    of the man they had decided to champion. They stood for a principle and a
    dynasty, not for an individual, and they believed in the Great Unknown. Heroes
    like Lescure and La Rochejaquelin were to find their counterpart in men like
    Gamalleria and Ouvidor, the fierce and fearsome lieutenants of the Great
    Unknown.</p>
  <p>At first nothing very serious happened to throw disquiet into the minds
    of the Government up at Rio. The only fact that could be called disquieting
    was that the number of recruits to the banner of the mysterious leader was
    growing with amazing rapidity. The two men, Gamalleria and Ouvidor, well
    known to the police as lawless marauders, escaped gaol-birds in fact, were
    daily pushing their way to outlying villages, farms, and even small towns,
    loudly heralding the Second Advent of the Lord and the last Day of Judgment,
    whilst proclaiming the Great Unknown as the prophet Antonio Conselheiro resurrected
    from the dead or, alternatively, as Dom Pedro III of Bragan&ccedil;a, rightful
    Emperor of Brazil.</p>
  <p>It was a clever way of rousing superstitious enthusiasm and allying it with
    supposed loyalty to the dispossessed dynasty. The more ignorant crowd took
    up with fervour the idea of the mysterious leader being the resurrected prophet,
    whilst to the more educated amongst them the thought of overthrowing the
    present Government, which insisted on levying and collecting taxes, made
    a strong appeal.</p>
  <p>And, generally speaking, the personality of the Great Unknown made an appeal
    stronger still to the mystically inclined minds of the Sertanejos. His band
    soon rose to a horde. He collected them about him and presently established
    his headquarters at Canudos, the spot where Antonio Conselheiro had built
    his mammoth church. Here he built himself a dwelling-house, using for the
    purpose the very stones which for over twenty years had stood, a crumbling
    mass, as a mausoleum over the body of the sacred Counsellor; and here he
    had dwelt for the past four or five years in barbaric splendour, with half
    a hundred women to serve him and half a thousand men to scour the country
    round, robbing, looting, stealing from peaceable farmers and town dwellers
    the food which he needed for his table and the luxuries which he required
    for his house.</p>
  <p>His face was never seen save by an intimate few&mdash;a dozen lieutenants,
    his body-guard&mdash;wild, marauding outlaws and escaped convicts with tempers
    more fierce than the rest, voices more authoritative and powers to compel
    obedience through ruthlessness and cruelty. They alone were privileged to
    see the face of the Great Unknown who, when he walked abroad, kept his head
    wrapped in a veil. He wore a long flowing robe which reached to his ankles;
    his feet were encased in sandals; his hand was often stretched out for greeting
    or benediction. Half a dozen Negroes walked before him to beat down the scrub
    and thorns in his path.</p>
  <p>Within the past year or two bitter complaints had reached Bahia of numberless
    depredations carried on with savage impudence on outlying farms and cattle
    ranches, of hold-ups&mdash;not only on the roads, but even on the railway
    north of Queimadas&mdash;of petty larceny and highway robbery. The police
    of the province, not being numerous, were powerless, and Bahia sent the complaints
    up to Rio. The Government, after saying  &lsquo;Damn!&rsquo; once or twice
    through the mouth of its officials, found itself compelled to give the matter
    more or less serious consideration.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We must do something about it, I suppose,&rsquo; one important gentleman
    said between two yawns.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Must we?&rsquo; said another.</p>
  <p>It was very, very hot&mdash;even in Rio. Great Lord! what must it be like
    in that God-forsaken hole, the Sertao? And on the road between the railhead
    and Canudos, where there is not a single tree to afford shade to panting
    mule or man, where every drop of water has to be carried for miles and invariably
    falls short of the needs of the moment, where ... but what is the good of
    talking about it all when it is so hot?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Must we?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Really! Must we?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Which is just what English Government officials would say in similar circumstances.
    Some there were here who had grown hoary in the service of their country
    and who remembered the many ill-fated expeditions that were sent out in the
    far-back &rsquo;nineties against Antonio Conselheiro.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We must not underestimate,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;the strength
    of these fellows. They are tough. They know every inch of their God-forsaken
    country, and they have stolen enough arms to equip three regiments. Do not
    let us repeat,&rsquo; they said,  &lsquo;the mistakes of the past.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They swore that they would not&mdash;but they did.</p>
  <p>They sent a couple of hundred men who, after indescribable sufferings, parched
    with thirst, half-dead with fatigue, their skin ravaged by insects, their
    clothing torn to shreds in the scrub, finally reached one of the outlying
    townships some forty kilometres from Canudos, in a condition that left them
    quite unfit to meet even the most despicable enemy, let alone a lot of wild
    men from the bush, well equipped with stolen rifles and other weapons, inured
    to every kind of hardship, burning with enthusiasm, and to whom a kind of
    guerrilla warfare was as easy as drawing breath.</p>
  <p>Disaster, complete and hopeless, overtook the first expedition. Disaster,
    even more complete and even more hopeless, overtook the second&mdash;one
    composed this time of five hundred men under the command of a colonel of
    Teuton descent, who was believed to be a genius in military tactics.</p>
  <p>The Great Unknown and his followers were unconquered still, and the two
    victories had enhanced their prestige and fanned their impudence.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They are invincible,&rsquo; said the ignorant and the superstitious;
    and while the Government busied itself in a desultory way with organizing
    yet another expedition against the brigands, recruits to the banner of the
    mysterious leader came in in shoals. The Sertao had become a La Vend&eacute;e
    in very truth, and an unconquered one at that. And as, previously, Antonio
    Conselheiro had preached the Second Advent of Christ, the Kingdom of God,
    and the destruction of the World, so now the followers of the Great Unknown
    prophesied the return of Dom Pedro III to the throne of his forebears, the
    fall of the Republic, and the re-establishment of the Empire of Brazil.</p>
  <p>It was time the Government up at Rio got a serious move on, or some of these
    prophecies might be coming true.</p>
  <p>There was a talk of sending out Colonel Perraz with two thousand men. Two
    thousand well-armed, well-trained, disciplined Government troops against
    a handful of uneducated, semi-savage cattle-raisers! It had to be done, of
    course, but in secrecy&mdash;or the rest of the world would laugh.</p>
  <p>No laughing matter, this Great Unknown and his fanatical hordes!</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</b></h2>
  <p>Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh, known to all his pals and his messmates as Tim
    O&rsquo;Clee, stood by the open window polishing his boots, and he sang&mdash;sang
    in a full-throated baritone, gloriously out of tune&mdash;a song of the old
    country:</p>
  <p class="note">I know not, I ask not<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If guilt&rsquo;s in thy heart...<br>
Tum, tum, tiddlee tum tum...</p>
  <p>Then a long pause while the note, a full half-tone flat, rose in an ascending <i>vibrato</i>:</p>
  <p class="note">Whatever thou art...</p>
  <p>And this last phrase he gave forth so lustily that the full-throated baritone
    seemed like a detonation out of a gun which went echoing and reverberating
    across the port and the bay from horn to horn, and away over the purple sea.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Listen to him!&rsquo; the little barefooted urchins said down below;
    and they looked up, gaping and wide-eyed, at the open window where a massive
    torso appeared above the sill, white and glistening from recent ablutions,
    with two powerful arms, one hand wielding a brush, the other buried inside
    a boot that had obviously seen many a better day.</p>
  <p class="note">Come rest in this boo-zum my own stricken deer....</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Englishman,&rsquo; was the dry comment made by a dark-skinned
    shock-headed youth who until this moment had been the centre of admiration
    of the crowd of street urchins. &lsquo;They are so white&mdash;pah! ... always
    washing themselves ... and they are mad.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Leaning against the railings, he was busy with a pocket-knife scooping out
    the inside of a luscious pomegranate, which he then transferred to his mouth.
    His star performance consisted in spitting out the many pips, some to an
    incredible distance, by an indrawing and outpouring of the breath: a skill
    which could obviously only be attained by the elect, and then only after
    considerable practice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Measure that one,&rsquo; he commanded. &lsquo;No, not that one ...
    the last.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And obediently one of the young scamps grovelled on the road and with a
    long stick carefully measured out the distance that lay between the toe of
    the star performer and the last expectorated pip.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Three and a half!&rsquo; he gasped, awestruck with the magnitude
    of the feat.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have done five,&rsquo; the star said negligently, and prepared
    for a repetition of the unheard-of feat.</p>
  <p>But somehow the attention of the public had wandered. That mad, shiny, white
    fellow up there, whose voice rose above the rattle and the squeaking of the
    tramcar up the street, and who took the trouble on this hot afternoon to
    do something to his boots with a brush, was a greater, because a more novel
    attraction.</p>
  <p>And now he put down boot and brush, and disappeared within the room, whence
    repeated sounds of splashing water and indeterminate snatches of song further
    roused the contempt of the local idol.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They must be dirty,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;or they would not wash
    so often. I don&rsquo;t like those English.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>One of the urchins, a knowing-looking little chap with small round eyes
    like a ferret and a sharp uptilted nose, ventured on contradiction.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is not English,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not English. I tell you...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Fra Martino says he is Irish.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Irish? What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And this time, to mark contempt still more complete and more withering,
    the star performer expectorated lustily. The next moment a basinful of soapy
    water drenched his tousled head and soaked through his dun-coloured shirt.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know, my young friend,&rsquo; came, with a stentorian
    laugh, from up above in somewhat halting Portuguese, &lsquo;that an Irishman&mdash;a
    real, fine, none-o&rsquo;-your-mongrel Irishman&mdash;is the most magnificent
    product of God&rsquo;s creation; and if you don&rsquo;t believe me, you just
    come up here and we&rsquo;ll have an argument about it, which will leave
    you with eyes so black that your own mother won&rsquo;t know you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh, with the empty basin in his hands, his face and
    body glistening with moisture, his brown hair an unruly shock above his laughing
    face, waited at the window for a moment or two, not really in order to see
    whether his challenge would be accepted&mdash;for he knew it would not&mdash;but
    because he liked to watch the keen, fox-like faces of those little urchins
    grinning, yet hardly daring to grin, at the discomfiture of their idol.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So much for the loyalty of the public,&rsquo; he murmured to himself,
    put the basin down again and proceeded with his toilet.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</b></h2>
  <p>The very first event in the thirty-two years of Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh&rsquo;s
    life that left a lasting impression on him&mdash;in more ways than one&mdash;was
    when at the age of three he chanced to toddle as far as the stable yard,
    unattended by his nurse, and caught Pat Mulvaney in the act of thrashing
    Sheilagh, the lovely Samoyed, who was one of Tim&rsquo;s most adored playmates.
    Pat had fastened a rope to Sheilagh&rsquo;s collar and tied this to a big
    hook in the wall, and he was lamming into her with a big stick. And, oh,
    horrors!&mdash;there was a dead chicken tied to Sheilagh&rsquo;s collar and
    another to her tail&mdash;at least Tim supposed that these chickens were
    dead.</p>
  <p>Sheilagh was making no sound as blow upon blow rained upon her poor back,
    but the look in her eyes crouching there, with those dead chickens tied to
    her, was more than Tim could stand. He was very, very small and he was only
    three, whilst Pat was old&mdash;at least twenty&mdash;and very, very big,
    but Tim&rsquo;s blood boiled at the sight. For the first second or two he
    had stood as if transfixed with horror, then head down he charged into Pat&rsquo;s
    legs. Now Pat had neither seen nor heard him; he was not prepared for the
    assault, being intent upon punishing Sheilagh. Anyway, he lost his balance,
    tripped and fell on the cobblestones of the yard, and of course Tim fell
    on the top of him.</p>
  <p>What happened after that was in Tim&rsquo;s recollection rather more vague&mdash;he
    was picked up by his nurse and carried, dumb and terrified, into the house.
    His misdeed was duly reported to Uncle Justin, who gave him a severe thrashing,
    and he was put to bed and deprived of his rice pudding. The next day Uncle
    Justin explained to him that Sheilagh had well deserved her punishment, because
    she had dug her way into the chicken-run when nobody was about, and had deliberately
    killed thirty-six young pullets; and this was a misdeed which had to be punished
    in a stern and exemplary way, lest it should occur again. On the other hand,
    Pat Mulvaney, the stud-groom, who had only done his duty in this painful
    matter, was now very, very ill, in consequence of Tim&rsquo;s assault upon
    him, and as soon as he was a little better Tim would have to go and see him
    and apologize to him for what he had done. Several days went by, and both
    Sheilagh and Tim had completely recovered from the effects of the chastisement
    which they had respectively endured, for they were having a glorious romp
    with a ball on the lawn, when Uncle Justin came and fetched Tim away and
    took him to a place in which there was a bed, and in this bed there was Pat
    Mulvaney, who had something white tied round the top of his head, and whose
    cheeks and nose were no longer of that nice, bright red colour with which
    Tim had been familiar&mdash;in fact they were almost as white as the pillow
    and sheet on the bed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here, Mulvaney,&rsquo; Uncle Justin said in his big, big voice, &lsquo;I
    have brought Master Tim to see you. He wishes to tell you how sorry he is
    for what he did the other day. He acted like a thoughtless little boy and
    had no idea that he would hurt you&mdash;&rsquo; or words to that
    effect. Tim didn&rsquo;t cry, though he was very sorry indeed, for he liked
    Pat very much, almost as much as Sheilagh. He shook hands with Pat, and was
    very glad when Uncle Justin took him home again.</p>
  <p>Uncle Justin was never lenient to Tim&rsquo;s misdeeds, certainly not to
    those which, as he said, were unbecoming to an Irish gentleman; so faults
    were never condoned, and punishments as Tim grew older were apt to be severe.
    But Tim nevertheless adored Uncle Justin. A very little time after the painful
    incident of Sheilagh and Pat, Uncle Justin bought a little tubby white horse
    and gave it to Tim for his fourth birthday, and it was Pat and Uncle Justin
    who taught Tim to ride&mdash;it was on his fifth birthday that he was first
    allowed to ride to hounds on his pony without her being on the lead, and
    on his ninth that he first rode a real Irish hunter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Elbows closer, Tim, look at your feet&mdash;damn it, boy, you look
    like a blasted dago on that horse.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Tim would grip the saddle with his little thighs, and square his young
    shoulders, trying to look as magnificent on a horse as Uncle Justin himself;
    and if at the end of a hard day&rsquo;s hunting Uncle Justin would say to
    him: &lsquo;You took that fence well, Tim, my boy!&rsquo; or &lsquo;I liked
    the way you picked yourself up after that fall,&rsquo; Tim&rsquo;s little
    heart would swell with pride and determination to do better still.</p>
  <p>For twenty-six years Tim had adored Uncle Justin. Born a posthumous child,
    his mother, too, had died before he ever knew he had one. But Uncle Justin
    had been for him father, mother, brother, friend&mdash;in childhood, in school
    days, during those terrible years of the war. When Tim lay wounded, almost
    dying in hospital in France, it was Uncle Justin who watched at his bedside
    more devotedly than any mother could have done, who cared for him when he
    was convalescent, who lavished all that money and thought could provide to
    hasten his complete recovery to health.</p>
  <p>Uncle Justin was for Tim the embodiment of everything that a gentleman should
    be&mdash;generous to a fault, and if quick-tempered, always just and kind;
    a magnificent horseman, a hard rider; a splendid all-round sportsman; a great
    admirer of the fair sex; fond of his glass and of good cheer. And of all
    the places in the wide, wide world, there was none in Tim&rsquo;s eyes to
    equal Castle Traskmoore, the stately Irish home on the hills above the lake,
    with the age-old elms and oaks mounting guard over the majestic grey pile,
    the crenellated towers and ivy-covered battlements that had seen the whole
    history of the country unfolded beneath their walls.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It will all be yours some day, my lad,&rsquo; Uncle Justin would
    say, with that cheery laugh of his which masked a deep emotion, whenever
    Tim &lsquo;enthused&rsquo; more than ordinarily over the beauties of Traskmoore.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I love it because you are here, Uncle,&rsquo; Tim replied. After
    which nothing more was said, because these two understood one another as
    no other friends in the world had ever done.</p>
  <p>Tim had sent in his papers after the Armistice, and since then had become
    his Uncle&rsquo;s right-hand man on the estate, in the stables, the stud-farm,
    the kennels. A busy life and a cloudless one. And then there were the equally
    happy, if somewhat more hectic days in London. Lord Traskmoore had a fine
    house in Grosvenor Square and he always went up to town for the season; this
    meant Epsom and Newmarket, Ascot and Goodwood; it meant Lord&rsquo;s and
    Henley. Tim joined him when he could, spent a few joyous days in London with
    Uncle Justin, and returned to Traskmoore to carry on the work on the estate.</p>
  <p>But Tim had one great weakness, one grave disappointment in life; he was
    under the impression that he had a fine voice, and that, given good tuition,
    he would become a great singer&mdash;not a professional singer of course,
    but one who could give his friends an infinity of pleasure. The trouble was
    that he had no ear, and not one true note came out of his lusty throat. A
    great teacher of singing in London, consulted on the subject, declared that
    nothing could be done for Major O&rsquo;Clerigh. An ear for tune was a gift
    of God which had been denied him.</p>
  <p>Tim was offended with the great musician, called him &lsquo;a blighter,&rsquo;  took
    a few lessons from a more accommodating personage and continued to delight
    Uncle Justin&mdash;who had no more ear than he had&mdash;by singing Irish
    ballads to him gloriously out of tune, to the accompaniment of the gramophone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</b></h2>
  <p>It had indeed been a happy life for Tim O&rsquo;Clee until that spring of
    1924, when the crash came. It was a catastrophe such as Tim, even in the
    wildest possible nightmare, could never have conceived.</p>
  <p>He ran up to town at the end of May, hoping to spend a month with Uncle
    Justin in Grosvenor Square for the Derby, Ascot, and so on. The very first
    day had not yet gone by before he realized that an extraordinary change had
    come over the old man. Something of his cheeriness had gone; he seemed at
    times strangely absent-minded and, when called to himself, equally strangely
    embarrassed. With Tim he appeared constrained, with occasional outbursts
    of devil-may-care joviality which were obviously forced. Tim, vaguely disturbed
    by what he felt was a presage of evil, groped in vain at first for the key
    to the mystery; but friends soon put him in possession of it. A man always
    has enough friends to do that job for him. Hadn&rsquo;t he heard? Didn&rsquo;t
    he know? Why, it was the talk of the town!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Great God! What?&rsquo; Tim exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hold-Hands Juliana! A positive infatuation, my dear fellow! Didn&rsquo;t
    you know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>If Tim had been told that the heavens had fallen into the middle of Hyde
    Park, he could not have been more dumb-founded than he was at this moment.
    Hold-Hands Juliana! Heavens above! And it was the talk of the town that old
    Traskmoore was infatuated with her! Oh! Tim knew the woman well enough. A
    Roumanian (or something of the sort) by birth, she was the widow of that
    eccentric fellow Dudley Stone, who before the war had been a good deal in
    the public eye through a series of wild and foolhardy adventures in which
    he had embarked at different times. He had flown from London to Vladivostok,
    had spent three months in Tibet disguised as a wandering fakir; at one time
    he fitted out an Antarctic expedition, at another he commanded a division
    of Bulgarian <i>comitadjis</i> during the Balkan War. It was said that he
    had seen the inside of eighteen different foreign prisons, including one
    in Siberia, all on a charge of spying. His great idea was the search for
    hidden treasure: he fitted out various expeditions for that purpose and went
    off to find the buried treasures of the Armada, of Captain Kidd, of the cities
    of Arabia. The ambition of his life was to find one day the land of El Dorado
    in the wastes of Brazil, where lay hidden the priceless treasures of the
    Incas of Peru.</p>
  <p>Of Dudley Stone himself the public had heard quite a good deal in those
    pre-war days, but of his wife&mdash;nothing. She was not Hold-Hands Juliana
    then, and but few people had ever seen the pale-faced, wide-eyed young girl
    whom that &lsquo;lunatic, Stone,&rsquo; had married somewhere out in the
    Balkans. He was in Bulgaria when the war broke out, and after that there
    were some very ugly stories current about him in connection with the rout
    of the Serbian army, due, it was said, to the machinations of an English
    spy. Be that as it may, Stone was never again seen in England. What became
    of him nobody knew and certainly nobody cared.</p>
  <p>And then one fine day Hold-Hands Juliana appeared upon the scene&mdash;no
    longer pale, no longer thin&mdash;with pearls round her neck and diamonds
    in her ears. She gave it out that her husband had gone out to Brazil after
    the Armistice to find the treasure of the Incas. He had succeeded apparently,
    though Juliana didn&rsquo;t actually say so, but she threw money about with
    a lavish hand in London, Deauville or Monte Carlo. Hardly a day had gone
    by during the last season or two without some mention of her in the Society
    columns of the <i>Continental Herald</i>. Tim had often heard her referred
    to by men of a certain set as &lsquo;Hold-Hands Juliana.&rsquo; She was no
    longer young: she was coarse, and loud and common. She had huge, goggled
    dark eyes, strongly-marked eyebrows and long, curved black lashes. Her mouth
    was very full and her teeth very white, like a row of marble tombstones.
    Her hair was black and glossy; she wore it parted very much on one side with
    a big, unnatural-looking wave falling over her left eye. Her dresses always
    looked too short, and her corsets too tight. Her fingers, short and thick,
    were smothered in rings. When Timothy first met her&mdash;somewhere or other
    in London&mdash;she had appeared to him like the true presentment of a cinema
    vamp.</p>
  <p>Oh, yes! Tim knew all about her. But that Uncle Justin should&mdash;</p>
  <p>The old man had met her, apparently, somewhere this season&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t
    much matter where&mdash;and, according to Club gossip, had at once fallen
    a victim to her wiles in the way that old men do when a clever adventuress
    sets a trap for them. Unfortunately, there was no doubt about it. Club gossip
    had not even exaggerated. With a sinking of the heart, which at times made
    him almost physically sick, Tim stood by and watched the growth of this fateful
    senile passion. He could note its every phase, whilst he himself was powerless
    in face of the coming catastrophe, which he would have given the best years
    of his life to avert.</p>
  <p>It came even sooner than he expected. By the end of June, Hold-Hands Juliana
    gave it out that her husband had died of malarial fever at Monsataz in Brazil,
    the small seaport town south of Pernambuco from whence he had been on the
    point of starting for the land of El Dorado, where lay buried the most marvellous
    treasures of the earth. She was seen shopping in Bond Street clad in deepest
    mourning. Later on, the Society columns of the daily Press announced that
    Mrs. Stone would sail from Cherbourg on the French steamer <i>Duguay-Trouin</i> for
    Pernambuco, and would not be back in London before the autumn. Tim was at
    Traskmoore when he read of these various social events in the London papers;
    his hopes rose at a bound. Absence, he argued with himself, might work wonders
    with Uncle Justin&rsquo;s infatuation for that blatant adventuress. Pity,
    he thought, that the hunting season was not yet on, but there was the fishing&mdash;Uncle
    Justin might try Norway this year&mdash;and the 12th was not so very far
    off now.</p>
  <p>Tim went to bed that evening happier than he had been for weeks. He had
    already made up his mind to go up to London at once. But the next morning
    he had a letter from Uncle Justin telling him that his beloved friend Juliana,
    the widow of Dudley Stone, had made him the happiest of men by promising
    to become his wife as soon as the period of mourning was over and she could
    return to England from her pilgrimage to the grave of her late husband.</p>
  <p>Well! The conventional period of mourning was apparently over the following
    October, for on the tenth of that month the Earl of Traskmoore was married
    at the registry office of St. George&rsquo;s to Juliana, relict of Dudley
    Stone, Esquire, and daughter of Dr. Brailescu of Bucharest. Hold-Hands Juliana
    was now Countess of Traskmoore. Heavens above!</p>
  <p>To Tim O&rsquo;Clee the catastrophe meant the loss of that friendship which
    for twenty-six years had been the light of his life. For even during the
    three or four months preceding his marriage to Juliana, Uncle Justin had
    been a changed man; but at first, especially while the woman was still in
    Brazil, the change had been very subtle. No one would have noticed it except
    Tim. But Tim knew. Lord Traskmoore was no longer Uncle Justin to him.</p>
  <p>It was after the marriage&mdash;and when the bridal pair returned to London&mdash;that
    the change appeared devastating. Uncle Justin, who had been Tim&rsquo;s beau-ideal
    of a sportsman and a gentleman, was a very different man now. For one thing,
    he drank harder than he used to, and when in his cups was morose and irritable.
    Tim would hearken in vain for that cheery laugh which was wont to raise the
    echo of the old grey walls of Traskmoore.</p>
  <p>Juliana, of course, hated Traskmoore. It was dull, she said, and gave her
    the creeps. Hunting did not appeal to her&mdash;she did not know how to ride,
    so it was London all the time now&mdash;theatres, dinner-parties, night-clubs.
    Tim carried on at the old place for a time for Uncle Justin&rsquo;s sake,
    but presently the hunters were sold, then several of the farms. What was
    the good of carrying on? It was London&mdash;London all the time, or else
    Deauville or Monte Carlo.</p>
  <p>Never again the meets on a cold frosty morning, with the keen air whipping
    your face, and a satin-skinned, iron-sinewed Irish hunter between your knees;
    never again the horn of the huntsman or the cry of hounds, the tramping of
    hoofs on the ploughed fields, the five-barred gates, the smell of earth and
    stables and woodland! Never again the cheery &lsquo;Well done, lad!&rsquo; which
    had thrilled so that it almost hurt! Never again the Irish ballads sung out
    of tune to the accompaniment of a gramophone! Uncle Justin had taken to tennis
    and even to dancing! The gramophone these days only turned out the newest
    jazz tunes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6</b></h2>
  <p>When it was that Tim first had the conviction that the woman had told a
    lie about her widowhood and the death of Dudley Stone, he could not have
    told you. But the Gaelic temperament is always more or less psychic, and
    resentment had sharpened Tim&rsquo;s perceptions.</p>
  <p>His first meeting with Uncle Justin after the return of the bridal pair
    from their honeymoon was, perhaps, the most miserable moment in the whole
    of the miserable affair. Tim longed to take that vile adventuress by the
    throat and force her to confess to the trickeries and the sortilege wherewith
    she had brought the noblest Irish gentleman that God ever put on the map
    down to a state bordering on degradation. Far, far sooner would he have thought
    of that fine sportsman meeting his death on the hunting-field than of seeing
    him as he now was, the wreck of his former self, both mentally and physically,
    with eyes bleared, and unsteady hand, and that furtive look which so pathetically
    avoided meeting Tim&rsquo;s glance. Whenever Tim caught that look he felt
    just as he had done when, at three years old, he caught Pat Mulvaney lamming
    into Sheilagh. He wanted to charge into Hold-Hands Juliana and trip her up,
    morally and physically, as he had done to Pat then. And gradually he realized
    what a shameless liar the woman was. From the first she told him lies&mdash;trifling
    ones for the most part, her age, the provenance of this or that jewel, an
    obviously false account of Dudley Stone&rsquo;s adventure&mdash;and when
    Tim taunted her, she only laughed, shrugged her fat shoulders and showed
    her large white teeth. And, as she lied over this or that, Tim became more
    and more convinced that she had lied when she gave him a circumstantial account
    of the death of Dudley Stone over at Monsataz, on the Brazilian coast, of
    malarial fever, in May, 1924.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rsquo; Tim said boldly, when
    she had finished her story. And again she just laughed and showed her big
    white teeth.</p>
  <p>The following year a boy was born of the marriage&mdash;quite a fine child,
    so people said. And thus was Tim O&rsquo;Clee robbed of title and inheritance
    in addition to the great loss of Uncle Justin&rsquo;s affection. And he could
    do nothing save grind his teeth in an agony of resentment. The conviction
    had now taken deep root in his mind that some mystery hung over the supposed
    death of Dudley Stone, but while Uncle Justin was alive nothing could be
    done. To break the old man&rsquo;s heart by unmasking the adventuress who
    had cast her spells over him was not to be thought of, especially as obviously,
    alas!&mdash;he had not many more years to live.</p>
  <p>Indeed, he died very soon after that at Traskmoore, whither he had begged
    to be moved as soon as he felt that his end was nigh. Juliana fortunately
    refused to go with him, declaring with her accustomed flippancy that he had
    nothing serious the matter with him; she, herself, she said, was much more
    ill and could not leave London or the doctor who attended her. So Tim was
    alone with Uncle Justin when he died, and alone he walked behind the farm
    wagon which conveyed the grand old sportsman to his last resting-place beside
    his forebears in the sanctuary of Traskmoore church.</p>
  <p>Tim&rsquo;s grief for many weeks and months transcended other emotions,
    so that for the time being he even ceased to think of the adventuress who
    had exercised such a baneful influence over his life. Only a year later did
    the reaction set in. The baby son of Hold-Hands Juliana had, in the natural
    course of events, slipped into the title, estates and immense wealth of the
    O&rsquo;Clerighs. She herself slipped equally naturally into her position
    as sole executrix under the will, and as guardian of her boy, with the magnificent
    jointure bestowed on &lsquo;my adored wife, Juliana,&rsquo;  by the over-fond,
    over-trusting old man. Tim&rsquo;s name was not even mentioned in the will.
    This neither surprised nor upset him; he knew that Hold-Hands Juliana would
    have seen to that. And in a way he was glad. The greater the wrong that she
    did him, the more relentless would he be when the hour of retribution struck
    at last.</p>
  <p>For he never doubted for a moment that that hour would come one day, and
    for this reason: the day before Uncle Justin died he placed a set of old
    diaries, which he had kept regularly for years, in Tim&rsquo;s hands. Why
    he did it Tim could not say, but anyway, Uncle Justin had then said, with
    a wan smile:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find many entries that will amuse you, my lad. You remember
    the day fat Mrs. Benham came out in a pink coat and brass buttons and then
    the rain came down ... and ... and ... You can read the things right through
    ... they&rsquo;ll remind you of some jolly runs we had, you and I ... together....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He rambled on for a time&mdash;already he was very weak; the immediate past
    seemed to have slipped out of his enfeebled brain; only the happy past came
    back with its pictures of huntsmen and hounds, of his favourite hunters,
    and Tim&rsquo;s first pony.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You may read every word, my lad,&rsquo; he murmured feebly, &lsquo;there
    never were any secrets between us until...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The sentence was never completed, and it was nearly a year later when, in
    an idle and melancholy mood, Tim turned over the pages of the old diaries,
    intending to consign them after that to the flames. They were mere records
    of a simple, uneventful, straight and clean life. A phrase here and there
    brought a smile to Tim&rsquo;s lips and a tear to his eyes, for the entries
    so often concerned him:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tim rode out on Wibbles. The boy has already a fine seat....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Or:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Had a grand run to-day. Killed twice. Tim took Farmer McBride&rsquo;s
    fence in fine style....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Or again:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that blighted piano-thumper can mean by saying
    that Tim can&rsquo;t be taught to sing. The boy has a splendid voice....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It was in the fateful year 1924 that Juliana&rsquo;s name first cropped
    up in the diary:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sat next Mrs. Stone at dinner. A charming woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And again:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;With Mrs. Stone to dinner at the Berkeley, afterwards to see the
    new play at Drury Lane....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Or:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have never in my life met a more beautiful or more intelligent
    woman. If I were not so old...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A few references to her past history, violent abuse of the unknown husband,
    Dudley Stone, ever-growing admiration for Juliana&rsquo;s beauty, charm and
    fascination, together with expressions of passionate adoration, made up the
    entries for April and part of May. And then came the fateful words:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My beloved is free. That blackguard, Stone, is dead. Thank God....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Followed soon after by:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My beloved tells me she must go to that outlandish place to see that
    the blackguard&rsquo;s grave is properly tended....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But there was one entry which set Tim&rsquo;s blood on fire and caused him
    to break into stentorian song:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have made a free gift to my beloved of the &pound;50,000 she wanted.
    I have asked no questions. Why should I? She knows that I would lay my entire
    fortune at her feet....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A free gift of &pound;50,000 in the year 1924&mdash;just before Hold-Hands
    Juliana started for Brazil, having given it out that Dudley Stone had died
    there of malarial fever! That &pound;50,000 had been used&mdash;for what?
    She went to Brazil ostensibly to visit her husband&rsquo;s grave; she did
    not require &pound;50,000 for mere travelling expenses. Already she had tricked
    Traskmoore into a formal promise of marriage.... What was &pound;50,000 to
    her, then, when the whole of the O&rsquo;Clerigh fortune was already as good
    as hers?</p>
  <p>Armed with Uncle Justin&rsquo;s diaries, Tim went to consult one of the
    foremost lawyers in London and laid the whole case before him. He declared
    his belief that when the Roumanian woman went through the formality of marriage
    with the late Earl of Traskmoore she had furnished no proof of the death
    of her lawful husband, Dudley Stone; that, presumably, that same Dudley Stone
    was still alive when the second marriage was contracted, and that therefore
    this second marriage was illegal, the child born of it illegitimate and he,
    Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh, the rightful Earl of Traskmoore. Immense sums were
    then paid out in fees for the opinion of the most eminent Counsel at the
    Bar, and subsequently an action was entered in the High Court.</p>
  <p>But discoveries revealed the existence of affidavits proving the death of
    Dudley Stone at Monsataz, in Brazil, of malarial fever in May, 1924, five
    months before Juliana&rsquo;s marriage to Lord Traskmoore. These affidavits
    had been sworn to before the British Consul at Pernambuco by persons of unimpeachable
    reputation, all of whom were ready to attest in the English courts of law
    that they had known Dudley Stone, and either been present at his death or
    otherwise known about it. There was the priest who had heard his last confession
    and conducted the burial service; there was the doctor who had attended him;
    and there was his intimate friend out there, Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, a
    gentleman of high social position, formerly an officer in the Brazilian army
    and at one time military attach&eacute; at the Brazilian Ministry in Paris.</p>
  <p>Of course, in such circumstances the action was bound to fail: the lawyer
    advised its immediate withdrawal before further expense was incurred. But
    Tim was unconvinced, and even while he took his lawyer&rsquo;s advice, he
    swore to himself that this would not be the end of this monstrous conspiracy.
    There was something in Juliana&rsquo;s blatant show of triumph that proclaimed
    not virtue victorious, but anxiety happily overcome. The lawyers did not
    see that, but Tim did. He knew.</p>
  <p>Fifty thousand pounds! What did Hold-Hands Juliana want with &pound;50,000
    save to bribe three dagoes out there to swear the affidavits that enabled
    her to become Countess of Traskmoore? The lawyers had pooh-poohed the idea.
    The whole thing was fantastic, they said; and, in view of the affidavits,
    could not possibly be proved; but Tim was not an Irishman for nothing....
    He had registered a vow that he would carry on the fight; and carry it on
    he did from that hour&mdash;not dreaming then of the amazing series of adventures
    which caught him up, as in a whirlwind, and tossed him hither and thither
    like a leaf in a tornado.</p>
  <p>His father had left him a few thousands. He had no one to consider but himself.
    Half his small fortune had gone in futile legal expenses: he put the other
    half in his pocket and started out for Brazil.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</b></h2>
  <p>And now here he was, actually and indubitably in Monsataz, standing at the
    window of a respectable hotel which had been recommended to him by the captain
    of the small coasting steamer which had brought him north from Rio. The hotel
    overlooked the wide bay and the beautiful harbour with the huge rocks that
    guard its entrance like giant sentinels, rising a hundred feet and more out
    of the water. Beyond the bay the ocean glistened smooth as a purple mirror,
    with the haze of the setting sun slowly spreading over the still, calm waters
    like a veil that held within its folds all the secrets and all the mysteries
    which Tim O&rsquo;Clee had come all this way to probe.</p>
  <p>Brazil! Monsataz! Those two names had been eating into his brain ever since
    the day when he swore to himself that, in spite of what the lawyers said,
    he would prove them wrong and Hold-Hands Juliana a liar and a thief. So here
    he was.</p>
  <p>A strange coincidence, which Tim at once put down to luck, had come to pass
    already. He had been shown into his room by one of the hotel servants. His
    luggage had been disposed about the room, and the coffee-coloured servant
    busied himself with undoing the straps of the valise. Tim had been studying
    Portuguese steadily for the past year. Already on the coasting steamer he
    had taken every opportunity of talking to the captain and exchanging words
    with the petty officers and the crew. He did not speak very correctly perhaps,
    but he made himself readily understood. His mind intent upon the one all-important
    subject, he remarked casually to the coffee-coloured valet:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is not often, I suppose, that you have foreign visitors here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But yes, senhor,&rsquo; the man replied, &lsquo;many Americanos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean them. I mean Europeans&mdash;English, for
    instance.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The man shook his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, senhor,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;not many English, they mostly
    go to the Hotel Americano. But there have been some who stayed here for a
    day or two, reverend gentlemen&mdash;mostly Protestants.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Seen any lately?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, senhor, last year. A reverend gentleman, he came with a lady
    who said she was his wife, but as he also called himself a priest, we could
    not understand how he could have a wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim did not happen to hold any views one way or the other on the subject
    of the celibacy of the clergy, but he allowed the man&rsquo;s tongue to run
    away with him and listened with half an ear to his dark-skinned friend&rsquo;s
    opinion of reverend gentlemen who travelled about in the company of ladies.
    It seems that all the reverend gentlemen, both English and Americanos, who
    had ever come to Monsataz had a lady with them, but what was very strange
    was that the lady never was beautiful, which perhaps made the matter all
    right from a moral point of view.</p>
  <p>It was all the more astonishing, was the man&rsquo;s final comment on the
    situation, that the two English gentlemen who had come to this hotel&mdash;and
    who were <i>not</i> reverends&mdash;did travel alone.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The two English gentlemen?&rsquo; Tim asked; &lsquo;who were they?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, there is yourself, senhor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. Who was the other?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A nice tall English gentleman like yourself, senhor. His name was
    Stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Of course Tim had expected this answer, and yet when it came it seemed to
    be like a hammer-blow hitting at his brain. Dudley Stone had actually stayed
    in this hotel, perhaps slept in this very room. If that was not a piece of
    the most stupendous luck, then he, Tim O&rsquo;Clee, didn&rsquo;t know what
    luck was!</p>
  <p>Dudley Stone here&mdash;in this very room, probably! The man whose life,
    or the date of whose death, might mean home, title, riches, everything that
    a man could possibly wish for in this world, to impecunious Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh!</p>
  <p>And Tim, brandishing a button-hook in the fashion of a shillelagh, executed
    a jig to the tune of the one and only Irish ballad which he knew:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;Come rest in this boo-zum&mdash;tiddly hi, tiddly hi&mdash;tum ti&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Nor did he desist when he caught the great black eyes of his friend fixed
    in a kind of wondering awe upon him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am so glad you think I&rsquo;m English, my friend,&rsquo; he said,
    solemnly,  &lsquo;because otherwise you might go about saying that Irish
    gentlemen are mad.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But undoubtedly the adventure had begun well; the thing to do now was not
    to waste time, tropical grass must not be left to grow under the feet of
    Tim O&rsquo;Clee.</p>
  <p>Knowing well that in every country, in every town and in every village throughout
    the world, the local clergy are the great channel for social intercourse,
    Timothy, in further conversation with another coffee-coloured employee of
    the hotel&mdash;the waiter this time who served him at dinner&mdash;inquired
    which was the principal church of Monsataz, and who was its incumbent. He
    learned that there were no fewer than two hundred churches in the city, but
    that of these the most important one was undoubtedly the church of Sao Felice,
    of which Fra Martino, a reverend gentleman of great eminence, was the incumbent.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, when Tim further inquired of his informant whether the latter
    knew anything of the church of Santa F&eacute; and its vicar, Fra Bartolomeo,
    he was told that that venerable priest had died some four years previously,
    leaving a comfortable fortune which he had amassed to his devoted friend
    and confessor, Fra Martino. Now Fra Bartolomeo was the man who had sworn
    an affidavit that he had heard the last confession of Dudley Stone and had
    subsequently buried him in the <i>cemiterio</i> of Santa F&eacute;, and the
    worthy priest must have died less than a year after that affidavit which
    had helped to shatter O&rsquo;Clerigh&rsquo;s hopes of regaining his inheritance.</p>
  <p>Thus did Tim stand on the very first day after his arrival in Monsataz,
    with two tricks to the good. Fra Martino he had already put down as his trump
    card. Fra Bartolomeo was dead; but here was his friend and confessor, the
    man to whom he had bequeathed a comfortable fortune, the provenance of which
    must have been known to its recipient, the incumbent of the fashionable church
    frequented by the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the city, who must, of course, have
    been in touch at one time with the English gentleman, Dudley Stone.</p>
  <p>A trump card, indeed!</p>
  <p>Besides him, and of equal importance for Tim&rsquo;s purpose, there was
    the doctor who had sworn that he attended Dudley Stone in his last illness,
    and who had signed the death certificate which Hold-Hands Juliana had triumphantly
    produced.</p>
  <p>The waiter knew the senhor doctor very well by name; he was, according to
    him, a very distinguished gentleman indeed, a member of the aristocratic
    Club Nacional and an intimate friend of Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao who was,
    as everyone knew, the President of the Club and the acknowledged leader of
    the fashionable world of the city.</p>
  <p>Those three men, then, formed the pivot round which Tim&rsquo;s adventure
    in search of Dudley Stone must revolve. He wished to God he had been endowed
    with diplomatic skill, with the art of gleaning information without seeming
    to ask a single question. All he had to rely on was just mother wit, which,
    as it came from Old Oireland, should give a good account of itself even when
    measured against the subtle brains of these dagoes.</p>
  <p>Seven days had gone by since Tim had landed at Monsataz&mdash;seven days
    spent in running the Reverend Fra Martino to earth. The worthy abb&eacute; was
    from home when he called; regretted most ardently that the exigencies of
    his parish work prevented his hastening at once to return the gracious visit
    of the distinguished Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, but the very first minute of
    leisure that the good God would grant him, he would give himself the infinite
    pleasure of coming to pay his respects at the hotel. And thus a week went
    by.</p>
  <p>Then, this afternoon, had come a note, couched in florid language, in which
    Fra Martino conveyed to the most distinguished Major an invitation from the
    President and prominent members of the Club Nacional to dine with them at
    the Club that evening. Being Thursday, it was a ladies&rsquo; night at the
    Club, Fra Martino went on to explain, and some of the most beautiful and
    most distinguished ladies of the city would grace the dinner with their presence.
    He, Fra Martino, would, moreover, give himself the pleasure of calling for
    the distinguished Major and taking him round to the Club.</p>
  <p>Tim&rsquo;s excitement had found vent in various ways, chief among which
    being his natural aptitude to break into song, despite his total inability
    to produce a single note that was not out of tune. But Tom Moore&rsquo;s
    ballad, set to music by the immortal Patrick McDougall, had the effect of
    steadying his nerves.</p>
  <p>Leaning out of the window, he looked down the length of the promenade with
    its row of tall, crested palm-trees and its sun-baked pavement. The star
    performer of a while ago had taken his pomegranate and other appurtenances
    of his star turn elsewhere, and one by one the crowd of admiring urchins
    had followed him. And now, stumping along on the cobbled road, on short,
    somewhat bandy legs, came Fra Martino himself&mdash;very much in the flesh,
    a figure such as an artist like the late Stacy Marks would have loved to
    depict.</p>
  <p>Tim watched his coming with ill-controlled delight. The old priest wore
    a black straw Trilby hat, very much the worse for constant baking in the
    sun, tilted far back above his domed, perspiring forehead. His soutane of
    black alpaca was hitched up around his waist, allowing for a generous display
    of two fat legs in black cloth trousers which he had tucked into a pair of
    stout, short Wellington boots. He carried a thick, gnarled stick which he
    brandished with much effect whenever a street urchin poked an impudent nose
    in his way.</p>
  <p>A real figure of fun&mdash;almost a caricature&mdash;yes, but that obese
    creature over there held, perhaps, in his fat, podgy hands the destiny of
    the last of the O&rsquo;Clerighs.</p>
  <p>Ye gods and little fishes, do not desert Tim O&rsquo;Clee now!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8</b></h2>
  <p>While Fra Martino came stumping up the short flight of stone steps which
    led to the front entrance of the Hotel d&rsquo;Angola, Tim suddenly remembered
    that he had not finished dressing. He turned to the mirror and busied himself
    with a recalcitrant collar-stud.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come in, my holy friend,&rsquo; he called, in response to a knock
    at his door; &lsquo;one more struggle with this d&mdash; save your
    reverence!&mdash;stud, and I am entirely at your service.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim was airing his best Portuguese, but Fra Martino, it seemed, spoke English
    fluently, with a throaty accent which would have been unpleasant had it not
    been so comical. He loved to hear it and, above all, to air his knowledge
    of it. It reminded him of the days of his youth, when in the seminary he
    had made friends with two young Irish students. He pushed open the door and
    halted for a moment under the lintel. The room felt almost cool as it faced
    east, and outside the heat had been unbearable. Fra Martino mopped his damp,
    expansive forehead with a gaudy red-and-yellow handkerchief. Then he came
    forward and extended a large and very sticky hand to Tim, who shook it cordially.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good of you to come, Padre,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A pleasure, Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, I assure you,&rsquo; the old priest
    responded pleasantly. He had put down his amazing hat, and his stiff white
    hair under the action of the cooler air slowly rose from his cranium until
    it stood up like a round mop encircling a pink bald place which was all that
    was left of his tonsure.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sit down, Padre, while I finish dressing,&rsquo; Tim went on; &lsquo;and
    let me get you a drink and a cigarette&mdash;or would you prefer a cigar?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Martino preferred a cigarette. He sat down and beamed on the whisky
    and soda which Tim carefully mixed for him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your very good health, my friend,&rsquo; he said jovially, raising
    his glass,  &lsquo;and may your stay in our city be a long and happy one.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He insisted on Timothy drinking too, and on the clicking of glasses:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wish me luck, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said with a slight touch of earnestness
    in his cheery voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But of course I wish you luck,&rsquo; the old priest responded, after
    he had taken a long drink, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. &lsquo;You
    cannot want much more,&rsquo; he said, with a short sigh, &lsquo;neither
    here nor elsewhere; you have all the best luck in the world, I&rsquo;m sure.
    You are young. You are very handsome. The ladies will always be on your side.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>No man dislikes being told that he is handsome, and Tim O&rsquo;Clee was
    no exception to the rule. But as he was not lacking in humour he was without
    personal vanity; nevertheless the frank admiration of the old priest pleased
    him. Amiability&mdash;the power to please&mdash;was going to be one of his
    most important assets in the adventure.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You look splendid in that black coat,&rsquo; Fra Martino continued
    with that na&iuml;ve flattery which passes for courtesy among several Latin
    races, &lsquo;and what a lovely white shirt! You will not see another like
    it in Monsataz, not even at the Club Nacional.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim looked politely incredulous.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, no!&rsquo; the old priest continued with a sigh. &lsquo;What
    would you? The people here&mdash;what do they know of style or fashion? Even
    the young men&mdash; The officers perhaps, sometimes. But these others&mdash; Municipality?
    Government?&rsquo; And Fra Martino shrugged his shoulders and sniffed. Sniffed
    again and said with solemn emphasis, as if stating an indisputable and all-important
    fact: &lsquo;Plebeians, my friend. That&rsquo;s what they are. All of them.
    You will see. No manners. No style. No what the French call <i>tenue</i>.&rsquo; (He
    pronounced it <i>tenoo</i>.)</p>
  <p>Timothy was intent on tying his tie. A black one, new from Bond Street,
    as was the soft-fronted exquisitely pleated and laundered shirt, the high
    collar slightly winged, not to mention the perfectly-cut smoking suit&mdash;fourteen
    guineas, and cheap at that&mdash;made in Savile Row.</p>
  <p>In the glass he could see the pot-bellied figure of the old priest, sipping
    whisky, his short fat legs, the huge feet encased in those awful Wellington
    boots, and his round forehead exuding moisture.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No <i>tenoo</i>!&rsquo; Tim murmured. &lsquo;Oh, my God!&rsquo; and
    turned to look elsewhere. The sight of Fra Martino perspiring copiously,
    and sniffing, was certainly not encouraging. Tim hoped that it was not customary
    in Brazil&mdash;as it is in some outlandish countries&mdash;for men to salute
    one another with a kiss. But now he stood up, ready, as straight and clean
    a figure of a man as ever came out of the Creator&rsquo;s hands. Irish eyes,
    blue, grey, sometimes green as the varying moods of a mercurial temperament
    swayed him. Crisp, brown hair inclined to be unruly. A clear skin, splendid
    teeth. No features to speak of, for the nose too was Irish, as was the upper
    lip, distinctly too long for classical taste, effectually disguised, however,
    by a small tooth-brush moustache. But the mouth below it redeemed every defect
    of the face, for it appeared always ready for a smile. Fra Martino looked
    at him with approval, and then drew a short sigh. Of regret? Perhaps. He,
    too, had been young once&mdash;and handsome&mdash;at any rate in some women&rsquo;s
    eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Senhor da Lisbao,&rsquo; he said presently, &lsquo;is sending his
    car round. As I already had the honour to tell you, he hopes that you will
    do him the honour, Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, of dining with him at our Club
    Nacional.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is more than kind. I had thought of getting some dinner at the
    Hotel Americano and then&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no. We will dine with Senhor da Lisbao. He is the president of
    our club. An influential man in the social world of Monsataz. You would like
    to know him. Not?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I should. I do not intend to lead the life of a hermit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You will stay here long, my dear Major?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Some considerable time. Yes! Unless&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Unless?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have come here on business, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said, &lsquo;private
    business. If I get through with it quickly, I should not be here long.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, you have business here, my friend?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke quite lightly as if the matter did not greatly concern him; but
    to Tim&rsquo;s perceptions, which just now were so very much on the <i>qui
    vive</i>, it seemed as if an invisible hand had, in the last moment or two,
    passed over the old priest&rsquo;s face, blotting out every expression. In
    its way, and so it had appeared to Tim when first Fra Martino had entered
    the room, that face was an intriguing one, full of contradictions. The small
    beady eyes revealed keen intelligence; but the mouth, loose and fleshy with
    heavy lines drawn down from the corners of nose and lips, the flaccid cheeks
    and cleft chin, betrayed venality, indolence and sensuality. But in spite
    of all these defects, there was a distinct trait of kindliness lurking somewhere
    in the florid face: kindliness born probably of weakness of character, and
    of indolence&mdash;the line of least resistance; nevertheless the old priest
    gave one the impression that in most circumstances of life he would try and
    help a lame dog over the stile.</p>
  <p>For the moment, then, all these traits had vanished. The lines of intelligence
    as well as of kindliness had all been merged in a smooth aspect of complete
    vagueness. Fra Martino did not wait for a reply to his last question; he
    said nothing for a minute or so, and then gradually his former expression
    of urbanity and friendly courtesy spread once more over his face. Once more
    he became suave and voluble, full of protests of unbounded hospitality. He
    and his presbytery, his servants, his friends and his parishioners were all
    at the disposal of the most distinguished Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, and all
    the while he spoke he did not ask another question that might seem indiscreet.
    It was a pleasure and an honour, he kept repeating, to have so distinguished
    an English gentleman in Monsataz.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not English, Padre,&rsquo; Tim put in whenever the volubility of
    the old man allowed; &lsquo;Irish.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But the difference held no meaning for Fra Martino. He certainly paused
    a moment as if to recapture the lost threads of his eloquence and then went
    on placidly, dolefully shaking his head:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We see very few English gentlemen out here. Rio? Yes! Pernambuco,
    even Bahia, but not in Monsataz.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You like to see them, when they come?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah! But yes! The great world&mdash;you understand&mdash;one is so
    shut away in this poor hole&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A beautiful city, Padre.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the port seems very active&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The priest gave a slight shrug. &lsquo;All Americanos. The English who come
    here are all reverends&mdash;Protestants, alas! It is so sad that that beautiful
    country should still be blind to the truth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Englishmen who come here are not all missonaries, Padre&mdash;for
    I suppose that is what you mean by &ldquo;reverend&rdquo;. Many have come
    here on business and some in search of adventure.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Martino puffed away for a time at his cigarette; then he had a long
    drink, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and said finally: &lsquo;Maybe;
    I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was thinking of a man I knew something about, who came out here
    quite a good deal,&rsquo; Tim said, with well-assumed carelessness; &lsquo;a
    man named Dudley Stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim, being the creature of impulse that he was, had suddenly made up his
    mind that he would fire off the name abruptly to see what effect it would
    have on the old priest. He tried his hardest not to appear to be watching
    the other&rsquo;s face. But Fra Martino did not flinch. His fleshy eyelids
    never quivered. He was holding the glass of whisky and soda up to the light,
    watching its sparkle with unconcealed delight. There was a lump of ice in
    the glass: it did not so much as click once. But that very indifference sent
    Tim&rsquo;s fancy wondering in the land of conjecture: &lsquo;You are playing
    a part, my friend,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;no one could be as unconcerned
    as you now look.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Martino took another long drink, put down his glass, smacked his lips,
    and then said lightly: &lsquo;Ah! you knew Mr. Stone?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only by reputation,&rsquo; Tim replied. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you,
    Padre?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, my dear Major,&rsquo; the priest rejoined lightly. &lsquo;No;
    I cannot exactly say that I did know Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Stone&mdash;only
    like yourself, by reputation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t that funny?&rsquo; was Tim&rsquo;s dry comment on
    this; &lsquo;I should have thought that you&rsquo;d know every stranger who
    comes to Monsataz.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Said Fra Martino: &lsquo;I do, mostly; but Mr. Stone didn&rsquo;t happen
    to come my way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Timothy decided within himself that this was a lie. A puzzling lie.
    Seemingly a useless lie, but a lie nevertheless.</p>
  <p>However, he left it at that, only said casually: &lsquo;How funny; now,
    as I say, I should have thought&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It was at this point that the honk-honk of a motor-car in the road below
    sounded a second time. Fra Martino struggled to his feet with marvellous
    alacrity, drained his glass to the bottom, and flung away the stump of his
    cigarette. He was not a very good actor, this obese old man, and though his
    florid, round face looked for the moment more like a bladder of lard than
    a human countenance, there was something in his manner as he picked up his
    hat and stick and said: &lsquo;There is the car, my dear Major,&rsquo; which
    more than suggested relief.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We must not be late for dinner,&rsquo; he went on jovially. &lsquo;You
    will find our <i>cuisine</i> at the club excellent, I may tell you. Our <i>Papa &agrave; Bahiana</i> is
    succulent. You will see ... you will see! We are not so behindhand in luxury
    and civilization as you Europeans imagine. And then, the ladies, my dear
    Major! The ladies...!&rsquo; He kissed the tips of his podgy fingers and
    made a gesture as of a butterfly on the wing. But his joviality now appeared
    forced, and his haste to get away evident. He gathered up his amazing hat
    and stick and turned to the door. A few more florid compliments and gestures,
    and he led the way out of the room. Timothy followed him downstairs.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9</b></h2>
  <p>A high-powered American car was outside, with a dark-skinned chauffeur in
    immaculate livery. Timothy, as soon as he landed in Monsataz and caught the
    first glimpse of the fine city with its magnificent custom-house, post-office,
    railway station and so on, buildings which would have put the London or Paris
    ones to shame, had already made up his mind that nothing here would astonish
    him. Monsataz, except for its cobble stones and the narrow streets of the
    old town, was just as much an up-to-date seaport city as Marseilles or Genoa.
    Neither the latest model Chrysler, therefore, nor the chauffeur&rsquo;s perfectly
    tailored livery caused him so much as to lift an eyebrow.</p>
  <p>He entered the car on the heels of Fra Martino, and the Chrysler went bumping
    along the cobbles until it turned into the beautiful wide Avenida, bordered
    with fine trees, with private houses on either side, and the handsome Hotel
    Americano with its outdoor caf&eacute; occupying a large portion of the sidewalk.</p>
  <p>Fra Martino&rsquo;s talk was chiefly of the people whom Timothy was to meet
    this evening; their host, Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, one of the most popular
    as he was one of the richest members of the fashionable set in Monsataz; &lsquo;and
    kind and generous, my dear Major! You haven&rsquo;t an idea! Speaks English
    like a native, better than I do, and French or German&mdash;anything you
    like. And a great favourite with the ladies&mdash;a wealthy bachelor, you
    see, so the mammas with marriageable daughters are all after him&mdash;but,
    so far, nothing&mdash;although there is talk that his engagement to Teresa
    da Pinto, the daughter of the senhor <i>doutor cavalheiro</i>, will shortly
    be announced. Oh! a lovely girl, the reigning beauty of Monsataz, and none
    of your modern young women who think they know everything. She has no mother,
    poor dear! And her father&mdash;well! well! He has led a rough life, in a
    remote province&mdash;only vaqueiros and peasants and half-breeds for company.
    But Teresa was educated in the Convent of the Visitation in Sao Paolo. And
    then the doctor had a great piece of luck ... Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao got
    to know him, took a liking to him and brought him to Monsataz, where he soon
    became the fashionable practitioner&mdash;still very rough in his ways, but
    some people like that in a doctor, the brusque manner, don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And while Fra Martino&rsquo;s talk meandered on and on in mellifluous tones
    Timothy&rsquo;s thoughts harked back on the business that had brought him
    to this far-away corner of the civilized world, where everything was strange,
    every man and woman a foreigner to him; their views of things, their ideas,
    their political and religious ideals as far removed from him as these tropical
    shores from the mist-bound coasts of his beloved Ireland.</p>
  <p>What chance would he have to get to the bottom of things? To the bottom
    of this amazing conspiracy which had deprived him of wealth and of home?
    That it was a conspiracy he felt somehow more convinced than ever before.
    He had not met anyone yet who had been directly connected with it, had spoken
    to no one on the subject, and yet he felt it in his bones that there was
    something&mdash;Fra Martino&rsquo;s name had never been mixed up with the
    affair; nevertheless, Tim O&rsquo;Clee was absolutely certain that the old
    priest knew something about the mysterious life or death of Dudley Stone.
    And as the car sped along from the old city to the new, from cobbled pavements
    to smooth tarred roads, Timothy seemed to see the enigmatical figure of Dudley
    Stone mocking him with its fancied appearances and swift evanescence at every
    street corner, under the awnings of the caf&eacute;s, in crowded tramcars
    or elegant motors. And, through the dust of the streets and the fast-gathering
    twilight, he saw the no less elusive and still more provocative face of Hold-Hands
    Juliana, grinning at him through the windows of the car, and taunting him
    with full, red lips that laughed, and gleaming white teeth ready to bite. &lsquo;Trace
    Dudley Stone?&rsquo; she jeered.  &lsquo;Find out when he died? Bah! You
    are a fool, Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh. Six years is a long time, and those
    who swore affidavits then are ready to swear again. Their wits are sharper
    than yours, my friend, and they are not likely to give themselves away for
    any Irish blandishments you may try upon them. The motive, my friend, was
    a strong one, remember.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The motive? Yes! That was it. The entry in Uncle Justin&rsquo;s diary: &lsquo;I
    gave my beloved the fifty thousand pounds she wanted.&rsquo; Uncle Justin&rsquo;s
    money had bought those perjurers, and there was nothing in the balance, save
    Irish wit, to force them to disgorge.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</b></h2>
  <p>The impression which Timothy retained of that evening at the Club Nacional
    always remained rather vague. He remembered the smart club servant, who took
    his hat and stick when he arrived. He remembered being ushered into the lounge,
    a room level with the busy street and with great windows&mdash;something
    like Harrods&rsquo; or Whiteley&rsquo;s&mdash;right down to the ground. He
    had a swift impression of large arm-chairs, small tables, ash-trays and cuspidors,
    of a bar groaning under an army of bottles of every colour, shape and size,
    and adorned with small flags of all nations, and large dolls fantastically
    dressed, such as he had seen and cordially detested in all the fashionable
    resorts in Europe; of a room full of people, terribly hot and airless, the
    atmosphere heavy with the scent of powder and perfume; of a crowd of men
    and women, of white-coated barmen flitting in and out amongst them, of the
    glitter of diamonds, the buzz of conversation interspersed with shrill ejaculations
    and ear-piercing bursts of laughter.</p>
  <p>It was the same impression that one invariably receives when entering the
    parrot-house at the Zoo, with the gay macaws and parakeets chattering and
    shrieking.</p>
  <p>Of the dinner itself, Tim&rsquo;s impressions were equally elusive and dim.
    The host, Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, was cordiality and hospitality personified.
    He introduced Timothy to all his friends. There was the Senhor This and the
    Conde That; there was Fra Martino, whom the dear Major already knew, and
    above all, there were the ladies: the dowager Marqueza Guimar&atilde;es,
    a bony image&mdash;smothered in diamonds which appeared too heavy for her
    meagre shoulders&mdash;but obviously the greatest power in this tiny social
    world. Whenever she raised her shrill high-pitched voice the younger people
    stopped talking and listened with deference to what she had to say. Her husband,
    the Marquez, was there; an insignificant, silent old man, whose most conspicuous
    characteristic was a huge blond beard, and a single stone diamond the size
    of a thrush&rsquo;s egg on his little finger.</p>
  <p>Two other ladies flashed dark eyes at Timothy as he was introduced to them;
    handsome, both of them, with perfectly shingled and water-waved hair, and
    the latest Paris creations that accentuated rather than veiled the somewhat
    full curves beneath. They were very cordial, very engaging, rattled off a
    whole series of questions at Timothy about the latest social events in Europe&mdash;Paris,
    London, Deauville, and especially Monte Carlo which they had both visited
    and liked extremely. They each had a husband&mdash;nice, gentlemanly-looking
    men, in well-tailored dress-suits, very amiable; and one had a son who had
    been up at Oxford and spoke English with a perfect Oxford drawl.</p>
  <p>But all these impressions remained vague, blurred; the people themselves
    like characters in a dream or in a play. Only four of those who were there
    that night left the impress of their personality on Tim&rsquo;s consciousness.
    There was the host, of course, pleasant, convivial, hospitable, speaking
    perfect English with just enough hint of foreign intonation to make it attractive.
    Well read and well informed too. Had travelled a great deal. Knew England
    well and had hunted in Ireland. Seemingly not a complicated character, with
    nothing sinister about the pleasant, rather prominent dark eyes, the sensuous
    mouth and somewhat fleshy jaw. Everyone at the table, even the ladies, drank
    freely and so did he; but obviously, he held his liquor well, for though
    he, like all the rest, became very hilarious towards the end of dinner, he
    never forgot his good manners, and his conversation as well as his gestures
    remained well within the bounds of propriety.</p>
  <p>An altogether different personage was the senhor <i>doutor</i> da Pinto,
    the man who, according to Fra Martino, had been an obscure practitioner in
    an outlying provincial city, and then had the good fortune to attract the
    attention and gain the friendship of Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, and forthwith
    became a fashionable consultant among the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Monsataz.
    Da Pinto was in every respect the antithesis of his friend and patron. In
    appearance he was more like one of his former patients&mdash;a <i>vaqueiro</i> rather
    than a doctor. His evening suit had very obviously not been cut by a London
    tailor, and sat ill upon his large, stocky figure. His shirt was already
    creased when he first entered the room; it was adorned with three large diamond
    studs. He wore a soft collar of Byronic shape, which gave free play to his
    thick neck, and displayed the powerful throat with its prominent Adam&rsquo;s
    apple. He wore patent-leather Oxford shoes of which the laces had turned
    green with age, red cotton socks and a voluminous black tie.</p>
  <p>His hair, once coal-black, now of a pepper-and-salt mixture, was cropped
    quite short and stood up like a stiff brush above his large, florid face.
    He had very small, deep-set black eyes, a nose shaped like the ace of spades,
    a stubbly beard, no moustache, and an immense square jaw.</p>
  <p>Certainly an ugly customer to have to deal with, thought Timothy, say in
    a street fight, or a quarrel over a card table. As for having him by your
    bedside when you were sick, he, Tim, was quite sure that for his part he
    would far sooner die. It was difficult to associate him in a parental capacity
    with the lovely Teresa. Of her, Timothy retained a very vivid impression,
    even on that first night, when everything was so blurred. She came into the
    lounge rather late, when the little party had already assembled round one
    of the tables and was drinking cocktails. She had had an accident with her
    dress, she explained, and had to run into the cloak-room to have a stitch
    put to the damage. She was small and thin and exquisite, with a perfect oval
    of a face, delicate features, and glossy dark hair which she wore in the
    old-fashioned mode in a loose knot at the nape of her neck. But it was her
    eyes that were arresting, for they expressed so many emotions all at one
    and the same time. All through dinner Timothy could not make up his mind
    whether those eyes were tender and feminine and appealing, or whether they
    were masterful and passionate. She had a trick of veiling her eyes without
    closing them, drawing an invisible veil over them so that all expression
    vanished from them and only a kind of mysterious light remained.</p>
  <p>She had adorable manners, girlish and graceful, without any shyness or self-consciousness.
    Though she entered the crowded room all alone and must have felt a whole
    battery of eyes turned upon her, she walked across to her host without any
    affectation or swagger. She kissed the hand of the old Marqueza, bobbed a
    little curtsy to Fra Martino, greeted the others with smile, nod or handshake,
    and paid very little heed to the newcomer; but to Dom Mano&euml;l she just
    gave a glance, which revealed a whole romance to the observant Irishman.
    He recollected what Fra Martino had told him in the car&mdash;the engagement
    between Dom Mano&euml;l and the pretty girl soon to be announced&mdash;but,
    in that one glance, Timothy had guessed which of the two it was who was still
    holding aloof&mdash;and put Dom Mano&euml;l down for a fool.</p>
  <p>The dinner went off splendidly; it was excellently cooked and excellently
    served. There was plenty of champagne and liqueurs, and the coffee was beyond
    praise.</p>
  <p>Throughout the dinner there was no mention of Dudley Stone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11</b></h2>
  <p>After dinner most of the company, including the ladies, went off to the
    Hotel Americano, where it seemed there was a good floor and a good band.
    Timothy managed to refuse the many invitations that were showered upon him
    to join one party or the other. He wanted to be alone and sort out his confused
    impressions. Fra Martino had gone some time ago, pleading parochial duties;
    but some of the men had remained behind, sitting in groups of twos or threes
    about the table, still sipping brandy. Timothy rose and took leave of his
    host.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have to thank you...&rsquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For nothing, my dear fellow. We are only too delighted to welcome
    you. The advent of a stranger in Monsataz is quite an event for us poor provincials.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Timothy made a second attempt at taking his leave.</p>
  <p>Said Dom Mano&euml;l casually: &lsquo;By the way, my dear Major, Fra Martino
    tells me that you knew my old friend, Dudley Stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only by reputation,&rsquo; Tim replied.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He was an interesting personality.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But terribly reckless ... that last illness of his ... you know...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He would go shooting up the river and stayed out too late in the
    evenings. Doctor da Pinto often warned him, but he would not listen. It was
    a certain way of catching malarial fever. He didn&rsquo;t believe, I suppose,
    what the doctor said. Many of us are like that. It was such a pity. I liked
    Stone very much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And he was genuinely fond of me. I was with him when he died.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Were you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He had been staying, funnily enough, at the hotel you are at&mdash;the
    Angola.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So I understand!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But about a month before he died he came and stayed at my house.
    I was very glad afterwards that he did. It would have been terrible for him,
    poor fellow, to have had the discomfort&mdash;the misery, really, of a long
    illness in an hotel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It would, indeed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dom Mano&euml;l did not appear to be disconcerted by Tim&rsquo;s laconic
    comments. It seemed as if, having embarked on the subject of Dudley Stone,
    he could not again tear himself away from it. He talked and talked about
    the Englishman&mdash;his dear friend, as he called him&mdash;and seemed as
    if he could not say enough about his charm, his courage, his interesting
    personality.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I first knew him in London,&rsquo; he said, at one time. &lsquo;I
    was a young attach&eacute; there for a few months, the year before the war.
    Stone had just returned from Bulgaria, where he had fought like the devil
    against the Turks. He must have been a wonderful fighter, I imagine, for
    he knew no fear.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; Dom Mano&euml;l went on, after a slight pause,
    during which he puffed away dreamily at his cigar, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know
    what happened during the war. I understand that poor old Stone fell very
    much into disfavour, but I never knew why.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never knew, either,&rsquo; Tim put in simply. &lsquo;I was only
    a schoolboy at the outbreak of the war. Something occurred then&mdash;but
    I only knew it from hearsay, some time afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Poor old Stone! I am confident, O&rsquo;Clerigh, that he never did
    anything shabby in his life. Isn&rsquo;t that so, doctor?&rsquo; he went
    on, half turning to da Pinto, in order to draw him into the conversation.</p>
  <p>But the senhor <i>doutor</i> was by now midway to the land of Nod. He had
    drunk copiously and talked a great deal; sipping cognac and smoking an excellent
    cigar, he had gradually become silent and detached. Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s
    mellow but authoritative voice called him back to the realities of life for
    a moment or two. He looked round, somewhat bleary-eyed, and passed his hand
    through his grey thatch.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; he queried vaguely. &lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You knew Dudley Stone? Do you think that he was capable of doing
    anything so mean as to be a traitor during the war?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor shook his big head with much energy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; he said, thickly. &lsquo;Fine fellow, Stone&mdash;knew
    him intimately&mdash;attended him when he had malaria....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were with him to the end, weren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Eh&mdash;what?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were with Stone when he died?&rsquo; the other insisted; and
    to Tim&rsquo;s sensitive ear, strained to note every inflection in the man&rsquo;s
    voice, the words, that had been obviously intended as a query, sounded more
    like an emphatic statement of fact, not to say a command.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, of course,&rsquo; the doctor said, roused for a moment
    out of his fuddled condition; &lsquo;when Stone died ... I was with him ...
    I said so ... I swore on my oath ... Yes! yes! of course....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dom Mano&euml;l gave a contemptuous shrug.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pity, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he said, turning again to O&rsquo;Clerigh
    and indicating the doctor, who had once more lapsed into semi-somnolence. &lsquo;He
    had a splendid practice and a fine position here until he took to drink.
    But, as you were saying, my dear Major...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything, but I was thinking that it is fully
    time I took my leave....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! but not yet ... I really cannot allow...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I must thank you and all the other members of the club for your marvellous
    kindness to me. I had heard something of Brazilian hospitality before, but
    had no idea...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear fellow, the pleasure was ours, you may be sure. But won&rsquo;t
    you change your mind and come along with me? I&rsquo;d like to show you some
    of our night-life over here&mdash;and I can promise you that you won&rsquo;t
    be dull. Come and have supper with me at the Americano&mdash;I can introduce
    you to one or two more charming ladies, and I am sure you are fond of dancing....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s awfully good of you, but not to-night, if you don&rsquo;t
    mind. I&rsquo;ve a lot of letters to write, and if I don&rsquo;t get through
    some of them to-night, when it&rsquo;s cool, I shall never do them at all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It would have been bad form to insist and Dom Mano&euml;l never did or said
    anything that was bad form. Timothy took his leave of those who had remained
    to the last, including the doctor, who by this time didn&rsquo;t know who
    it was who was bidding him good night and thanking him for a most pleasant
    evening. All the others were apparently intent on going on to some more lively
    form of entertainment. Night-life in the cities of Brazil is always of the
    gayest, and dancing goes on in every hotel, restaurant or caf&eacute;, big
    or small. Tim had all a young, healthy animal&rsquo;s love of exercise and
    jumping about, but he already felt rather ashamed of having accepted hospitality
    from these men, among whom there were at least three whom he looked upon
    as perjurers, forgers and thieves, and whom he had every intention of unmasking
    and bringing to book. This evening&rsquo;s affair had been necessary, of
    course, for the success of his venture, but by no possible standard of morality
    or honour could the acceptance of further hospitality from Dom Mano&euml;l
    be condoned.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12</b></h2>
  <p>In the days and weeks that followed, Timothy, strolling about the quay,
    the caf&eacute;s and places of amusement of the city, had entered into conversation
    with scores of men in every station of life; with soldiers and sailors, with
    stevedores and barmen, with half-breeds and <i>vaqueiros</i>, shop-girls
    and women in the streets. Discreetly, tactfully, always leading up by easy
    stages to the subject of past and present foreign visitors in Monsataz, he
    would put in a question presently about an Englishman&mdash;Dudley Stone.
    Quite a number of people knew about him, but more or less vaguely; he had
    not remained in Monsataz very long; an English senhor, who was not a reverend,
    had, it was admitted, visited Monsataz some six years ago, but he had not
    apparently remained long enough to leave his mark on the minds of those with
    whom he had not come into personal contact. But there were some here and
    there who had known him, spoken to him. At the bar of the Hotel Americano
    he had often been served with drink. A dancer at the Conquistador music-hall
    had lived with him for a month or two. He had hired a car at one of the garages
    and driven himself about all over the neighbouring country. These and various
    other traces of Stone&rsquo;s passage through Monsataz had been easy to pick
    up. But his stay here had only been a passage: coming one day by steamer
    from Pernambuco, he went off again some few months later&mdash;no one knew
    whither or how.</p>
  <p>When Timothy suggested that this Mr. Stone had died of malaria some time
    in May, 1924, they shrugged their shoulders and said that that was very likely&mdash;many
    people died of fever in Monsataz, especially in the old town, every year.
    There was a mound in a corner of the <i>cemiterio</i> of Santa Fe, with a
    broken wooden cross stuck at the head of it. The cross had once had a coat
    of white paint on it, with a name painted on in black, but both white and
    black paint had long since been washed off by the tropical rains. The girl
    from the Conquistador music-hall took Timothy thither one day and told him
    that she had been made to understand that her English lover was buried there.
    But there was nothing to prove that. Tim ran Fra Martino to earth and plied
    him with questions, but, as usual, the old priest had extraordinarily little
    to say on the subject. It might be; he did not know; he himself was away
    from Monsataz in the spring of 1924, and he had never taken any special interest
    in this Mr. Stone. On the other hand, the old verger at the church of Santa
    F&eacute; shook his head most emphatically at the suggestion that a foreign
    senhor had been buried in the <i>cemiterio</i>, either six years ago or at
    any time&mdash;and he had been verger of the church for the last forty years.
    The mound beneath which the foreign senhor was supposed to be buried was
    one of a number in which rested the bones of the many victims of a severe
    epidemic of yellow fever, which had carried away no end of people in the
    spring of 1924. A corner of the <i>cemiterio</i> had been set apart for the
    purpose, because burials had to be done very quickly by order of the Government.
    But a foreign senhor? No! no! Old Hermanos was quite sure about that&mdash;no
    foreign senhor lay buried in the <i>cemiterio</i> of Santa F&eacute;. All
    this, then, left the puzzle more acute than ever; for if Dudley Stone did
    not die of malarial fever in May, 1924, what then had become of him?</p>
  <p>The general opinion was that the English senhor, Mr. Stone, had gone up-country
    either on a shooting expedition or in search of adventure, and that in either
    case he had been killed and eaten by a jaguar.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</b></h2>
  <p>There was a caf&eacute; on the confine between the old and modern city called
    the Caf&eacute; Bom Genio; a promising sign. It was frequented mostly by
    commercial travellers and dealers of all sorts, men who traded with cattle-drovers
    and farmers up-country, who were pleasant and loose-tongued, and over a bottle
    of white rum discussed politics and the incidents of their trade.</p>
  <p>The girl, Inez, she who had lived for a time with Dudley Stone and was a
    dancer at the Conquistador music-hall, took Tim there one evening. &lsquo;There
    are a lot of foreigners always there,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;who go about
    all over the country. They may have heard something; one never knows. Their
    tongues are loose for they drink a lot of rum. They are not like us Brasilheiros,
    for we are silent people; we only talk to friends, because we are cautious&mdash;but
    they...&rsquo; She shrugged her pretty shoulders in very obvious contempt
    of the foreigner.</p>
  <p>The place was gaily enough lighted. There was nothing sinister about it.
    True, the atmosphere was so rank that it was almost solid; it reeked of spirits
    and stale food, of garlic and humanity and black tobacco. There were seats
    all round the room which had once been covered with leather; there were trestle
    tables and a few benches. The room was crowded and the sounds were deafening.
    Men were sitting at the tables, drinking and smoking, some were playing cards,
    others dominoes; there were only a very few women, four or five at most.
    They all greeted Inez with a cheery  &lsquo;Allo!&rsquo; as she entered,
    and eyed Tim with blatant curiosity.</p>
  <p>To Tim it seemed as if everyone in the room talked at once, while nobody
    listened. All the voices appeared jumbled, and that first evening he heard
    and saw nothing of interest. But he remembered what Inez had said: &lsquo;They
    go about all over the country and they may have heard something; one never
    knows&rsquo;; and he went again and again to the Caf&eacute; Bom Genio. He
    got to know all its regular customers: rascals, most of them, so he soon
    found out. Unblushing rogues, too, for one tale capped another of how the <i>vaqueiros</i> up
    in the Sertao district were induced to sell hides from which the branding
    mark had been carefully cut out, or cattle which had obviously been stolen.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, Tim made friends with them all, got them to talk to him about
    their affairs, their business; they were certainly loose-tongued, as Inez
    had told him, and an extra glass or two of rum would render most men there
    loquacious. There was a Dutchman who came regularly to the Bom Genio. His
    name was Van Smeet. He was a large, fat, florid rascal, whose clothes would
    have been a joy to a caricaturist. He seemed to be dressed just in what he
    happened to have; breeches or trousers, more or less patched, a khaki shirt
    which allowed of a generous display of a pink blond chest, a coloured handkerchief
    loosely knotted below a collar of Byronic amplitude, and a belt which seemed
    to wage constant warfare on his bulging waistline. Then there was a Portuguese
    cattle dealer, rather morose and taciturn, with fingers thickly stained with
    tobacco juice, hair and beard as black and shiny as anthracite coal, and
    eyes very close together over a beaky nose which gave him the appearance
    of a condor sitting pondering in his cage at the London Zoo. There were a
    couple of Germans who dealt in precious stones&mdash;illicit diamond buying,
    most probably&mdash;but were careful to avoid conflict with the law; and
    a few more of doubtful nationality and origin, touched more or less with
    the tar-brush, some gay, some taciturn, but all apparently engaged in the
    agreeable business of cheating with equal impartiality the man from whom
    they bought and the customer to whom they sold.</p>
  <p>But it was Van Smeet, the Dutchman, whom Tim liked best. He was so comfortable
    in his rascality. &lsquo;Why not make use of rogues if they are willing to
    take risks?&rsquo; he would say, beaming at his friends whom he had just
    treated to real Jamaica all round. &lsquo;I buy my hides cheap, not? ...
    then what do I care where they come from?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>One of the friends demurred: &lsquo;If you get found out?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well! I am covered. I buy the hides in good faith, not?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose you know where they come from?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I do&mdash;but it&rsquo;s no business of mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Such was invariably the commencement of a conversation which then, equally
    invariably, drifted into one of two channels&mdash;either politics and a
    general damning and cursing of the Government, taxes and so on, or the mysterious
    doings up in the Sertao.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is bound to be a row about it soon,&rsquo; the Portuguese would
    remark sententiously, and this remark made regularly every evening in a gloomy,
    sepulchral voice would then start the favourite topic of conversation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Great Unknown!&rsquo; one of them would say in the same tone
    of voice as if he were referring to a terrible and awesome god. After which
    there would be a silence for a moment or two until someone&mdash;a newcomer,
    like Tim, to these parts&mdash;would ask the inevitable question: &lsquo;Who
    is he, exactly?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Opinions varied as to that. It seemed that some thirty odd years ago there
    had arisen in the desert land of the Sertao a prophet, a seer, call him what
    you will, whom the <i>vaqueiros</i> and their like had named Antonio Conselheiro,
    and had looked upon as a second John the Baptist; and some would have it
    that this prophet had now come to life again, and that in the desert he was
    called the Great Unknown.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Funny for a resurrected prophet to become the greatest cattle thief
    in Brazil,&rsquo; the Dutchman then remarked dryly, but with a humorous twinkle
    in his eye and a wink at his friend Tim.</p>
  <p>But this did not upset the faith of those who chose to look on the Great
    Unknown with awe. Tim soon noticed that the foreigners and even the Brasilheiros
    were inclined to treat the story of the risen prophet with contempt, but
    that those of mixed blood&mdash;and there were many of those among the frequenters
    of the Bom Genio&mdash;appeared seized with a kind of religious fervour whenever
    there was mention of the Great Unknown.</p>
  <p>The Portuguese dealer put in a sententious word or two as a rebuke to the
    Dutchman&rsquo;s flippancy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is no cattle thief. It is his army who scour the country&mdash;and
    they do it, too. Why, the other week...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon would follow endless stories of the depredations carried on by
    this army of bandits, who owned no allegiance save to the mysterious prophet,
    and in his name descended on the villages around, robbed, stole anything
    they could lay their hands on. And latterly, it seemed they had become insolent
    in their daring and their defiance of the law. Ranch owners on the fringe
    of the Sertao were no longer safe, their cattle and their horses were driven
    off; their stores stolen, their tills robbed. And with it all the army grew
    in numbers week by week&mdash;almost day by day. The mysticism which surrounded
    the personality of the Great Unknown, as well as the free life of looting
    and pirating, appealed to these semi-savage dwellers of the Sertao, and the
    fair-haired Sertanejos, the dark Mesticos, the coffee-coloured Mamalucos,
    the innumerable mixtures of Indian, Negro and white blood in the desert all
    went to swell this horde who knew no law, save its desires and the word of
    the Great Unknown.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is his army&mdash;not himself....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; the Dutchman would argue, &lsquo;he benefits, doesn&rsquo;t
    he?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course he does,&rsquo; remarked one of the Germans; &lsquo;they
    say he is richer than any New York millionaire.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what is he going to do with all that money? He can&rsquo;t spend
    it out there in the desert....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Overthrow this d&mdash;d Government. He has an army of ten
    thousand men, armed and equipped....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bah! A lot of half-breeds....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Determined men ... I remember thirty years ago that Antonio Conselheiro
    held out in the desert against four military expeditions sent out by the
    Government....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What became of him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Killed. And every man in his army with him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But then this new man...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The conversation would then become general. All the same ground gone over
    every night. Some had one theory, some another; and while the foreigners
    jeered and made fun of the resurrected prophet, there were those who put
    their heads together and whispered. Tim caught snatches. A word here and
    there. It seems that this story of the mysterious Great Unknown had a good
    deal of political significance. The Portuguese trader who had business dealings
    direct with the <i>vaqueiros</i> on the Sertao insisted on the fact that
    the Great Unknown was a direct descendant of the last Emperor of Brazil,
    and that he was collecting all the money he could, and having his army trained
    by European officers with a view to marching presently on Pernambuco and
    there proclaiming the re-establishment of the Empire with himself as Emperor.</p>
  <p>And this turned the conversation at once into its political channel.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good luck to him, I say!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What has this d&mdash;d Government ever done...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Except taxes&mdash;and more taxes&mdash;and nothing but taxes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And officials poking their noses in everybody&rsquo;s business.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Everyone had a grievance, and there were always the secret foreign agents
    ready to stir up trouble. Tim ceased to be interested. His thoughts had gone
    roaming to the unknown desert land of the Sertao; he fell to wondering whether
    by any chance Dudley Stone, the adventurer, had drifted into the army of
    the Great Unknown. It would be just like him to embark on a career of instructor
    to a lot of <i>vaqueiros</i> and half-breeds, who were destined to upset
    the existing Government of the country and to restore the Empire of Brazil
    on the ashes of its young Republic. He had played that sort of r&ocirc;le
    in Bulgaria, where he had commanded a troupe of comitadjis during the Balkan
    War&mdash;so why not here and now? It was just the sort of adventure that
    would commend itself to Dudley Stone.</p>
  <p>The fact that his new friend Van Smeet let fall the remark once that he
    had some business dealings with Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, seemed like a
    link in a new chain of evidence which Tim had begun to forge. &lsquo;I take
    off my hat to Dom Mano&euml;l,&rsquo;  the Dutchman had said, with a thick
    laugh and a jovial smacking of the lips. &lsquo;I am only a babe in business
    compared with him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And when Tim asked him how and where this business was transacted, he replied: &lsquo;Oh!
    Up in that God-forsaken district, the Sertao&mdash;Dom Mano&euml;l has his
    ranch there&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t know? Oh! A magnificent ranch. I buy cattle
    and hides from him&mdash;hides that have no branding mark sometimes&mdash;and
    diamonds which ... But we won&rsquo;t talk about that. Our friend Dom Mano&euml;l
    has very long ears....&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</b></h2>
  <p>But there was yet another important personality in this drama of mystery
    and adventure&mdash;and a more than intriguing one at that. This was Teresa
    da Pinto, the doctor&rsquo;s daughter, whose engagement to Dom Mano&euml;l
    da Lisbao was said to be pending, but had not yet been officially announced.</p>
  <p>It was generally understood that the marriage would take place some time
    before the New Year. Dom Mano&euml;l, when twitted on the subject, neither
    denied nor admitted the impeachment. Teresa was reticence personified. On
    the other hand, the doctor, when he was sober, talked often and freely about
    his daughter&rsquo;s forthcoming marriage. &lsquo;Such a comfort it will
    be to me,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;to see her happily settled. It was
    her mother&rsquo;s dying wish that she should marry her old playmate ...
    she and Mano&euml;l were children together....&rsquo; Which everyone knew
    to be a lie, but no one took the trouble to contradict. Timothy could not
    understand why Dom Mano&euml;l hung back, for Teresa was very beautiful;
    she was the only child of a very rich man, who was Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s friend&mdash;his
    partner in felony&mdash;and, very obviously, she was deeply in love with
    him. No one could mistake the meaning of her glance when it rested on Mano&euml;l
    da Lisbao; those lovely dark eyes of hers would soften in an exquisite look
    of tenderness. But equally unmistakable was the indifference&mdash;sometimes
    the good-humoured mockery&mdash;with which he responded; and whenever she
    saw that smile of his&mdash;so pleasant and so cool&mdash;the look of tenderness
    vanished, engulfed at times in a spasm of intense pain, at others in passionate
    resentment which was almost hate. And Timothy would then wonder just how
    much she knew.</p>
  <p>She was very sweet and kind to Tim; prattled away in excellent English,
    danced a great deal with him, and accepted his obvious admiration as a homage
    due to her beauty. She had never been in Europe, and liked apparently to
    hear him talk of Paris, or Rome, or London. She was interested in many things:
    pictures, theatres, cinemas, or frocks, the gambling at Monte Carlo or the
    racing at Ascot. Tim even caught himself one day telling her about his beautiful
    home in Ireland: the old battlemented towers which had seen eight centuries
    flit by; he told her about the silvery lake and the mist-laden horizon above
    which peeped the green-sunbathed Irish hills; and about the age-old trees,
    and the woods that were carpeted with anemones in the spring, or ablaze in
    the autumn with a glory of russet and gold.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How you must love it!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>It was at <i>th&eacute; dansant</i> at the Americano. Dom Mano&euml;l
    was expected but had not yet arrived; so they danced together a good deal,
    Tim and she, and then sat down at a small table away from the rest of the
    crowd and were served with tea.</p>
  <p>She had listened to him with her great dark eyes fixed upon him while he
    talked&mdash;eyes, whose expression he tried in vain to fathom. And again
    he wondered how much she knew. And then Dom Mano&euml;l arrived. He strode
    up to their table, good-humoured, pleasant, full of apologies to Teresa for
    being late. &lsquo;But you have been in such excellent company,&rsquo; he
    said graciously. Then, with a polite: &lsquo;May I join you?&rsquo; he sat
    down at the table and ordered tea.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am sure,&rsquo; he said, in the interval of munching a chocolate &eacute;clair,  &lsquo;that
    our dear Major has been entertaining you with tales of his lost friend, Dudley
    Stone. I never saw a man so obsessed with a fixed idea, and as I tell him...&rsquo; He
    helped himself to another &eacute;clair and continued to prattle on in his
    pleasant, jovial way, chaffing Tim about his persistent inquiries after Dudley
    Stone. &lsquo;Our dear Major,&rsquo;  he said, &lsquo;must be contemplating
    writing the biography of my late lamented friend. I have told him all there
    was to know, as I knew Stone intimately. But still he is not satisfied&mdash;he
    must needs go into every disreputable tavern in the old city and enter into
    conversation with every bad character he comes across. And for what object,
    I ask you...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim took up the challenge with equal good humour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps, as you say, I may want to write a life of Stone. He was
    an extraordinary character, you know....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa had become unaccountably silent. She appeared chiefly interested
    in watching Mano&euml;l polishing off his third &eacute;clair.</p>
  <p>Said Dom Mano&euml;l: &lsquo;You are right there&mdash;Stone was an extraordinary
    character. A trifle <i>toqu&eacute;</i> is, I believe, the correct expression
    to describe the borderland between sanity and madness. He must, during his
    lifetime, have often spoken about me to his friends in England, because when
    a few years ago his widow wished to prove his death, I was approached, along
    with Teresa&rsquo;s father and the priest, who were with him when he died,
    with a view to certain affidavits which were required by the law of your
    country.... Naturally we all complied&mdash;it was a simple request.... You
    may have heard something of the whole affair?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did,&rsquo; Tim replied curtly; &lsquo;Mrs. Stone subsequently
    married my uncle.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But how interesting! ... Do you hear that, Teresa? ... You remember
    Mr. Stone? ... But, of course, you were just a child when he died ... I thought
    the lady had married an English nobleman ... Lord ... Lord ... I forget....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lord Traskmoore was my uncle&mdash;he was Irish, not English.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Irish ... Irish, of course ... how stupid of me.... We are all so
    stupid about that, we poor foreigners, not? ... And it is so difficult, too,
    with your peerage ... the title, and then the family name.... And so Mrs.
    Stone became your aunt? ... But how interesting!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My aunt.... Great God!&rsquo; Tim had very nearly uttered this exclamation
    aloud.</p>
  <p>The band struck up the opening bars of a tango. Mano&euml;l hastily gulped
    down his tea and, without saying &lsquo;by your leave,&rsquo; carried Teresa
    off to dance. Timothy watched them with delight. Never had he seen more perfect,
    more rhythmical dancing. The sensuous movements of the tango suited Teresa&rsquo;s
    lissom figure to perfection. Mano&euml;l held her tightly to him and she
    looked as if she were gliding along in his arms, her beautiful body seeming
    at one with his. At times Tim caught sight of her face: her eyes were half-closed,
    the long lashes throwing a softening shadow over her cheeks. But Mano&euml;l
    was just the male, holding that which was his by right of conquest. He held
    her so close that her spine was nearly doubled back over his arm; from time
    to time he touched her hair with his lips. The touch was as subtle, as delicate
    as that of a butterfly&rsquo;s wing on the petal of a flower, but it reached
    her consciousness nevertheless: a tremor would go through her body, the blue-veined
    lids fell over the eyes, veiling them completely, while the moist red lips
    were parted in an ecstasy of delight.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a fool that man is,&rsquo; Timothy thought; &lsquo;and how she
    loves him!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This started a new train of thought, and for the first time since the outset
    of his great adventure, he asked himself if it was all worth while. Was he
    grasping at a shadow while losing hold of the beautiful realities of life?
    With the money which his father had left him he might have settled down in
    the old country to farm his own bit of land. He might have had a simple home,
    a wife ... children. Life would have been easy....</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It would not, Tim, my lad,&rsquo; he said to himself. &lsquo;Easy?
    Rather not! ... You would have burst your guts with rage every time Hold-Hands
    Juliana passed you by in her Rolls-Royce, or you read of the marvellous gown
    she wore at Ascot.... No, my son! as you&rsquo;ve made your bed, so must
    you lie on it.... But I wish that lovely Teresa had not fallen in love with
    one of the greatest rascals unhung....&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15</b></h2>
  <p>After the tango Dom Mano&euml;l was obliged to pay his respects to other
    ladies present. The old Marqueza detained him in conversation, and once more
    Tim found himself with Teresa, slightly isolated from the rest of the crowd.
    She was flushed and breathless after the dance; her beautiful eyes shone
    dark and luminous in the pure oval of her face. Beautiful she was, and from
    a man&rsquo;s point of view, infinitely desirable; and though for some unexplainable
    reason she did not appeal to Timothy in that sense, nevertheless he was conscious
    of a great feeling of sympathy for her&mdash;almost of pity, for she obviously
    was not happy.</p>
  <p>She asked for an iced drink, and Tim got her an orangeade; while she sipped
    it through the straws she kept her eyes over the glass fixed upon Tim, with
    a look, so he thought, of anxiety. Presently she put her glass down and asked
    an abrupt question.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t all true, is it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That you go about in all sorts of low haunts in the city and talk
    to disreputable characters...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim laughed. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about &ldquo;low&rdquo; or about &ldquo;disreputable,&rdquo; but
    being a student of human nature...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She gave a quaint little smile. &lsquo;You need not study human nature in
    the drinking-booths of the old city....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But suppose I say that I find the drinking-booths of the old city
    more interesting than&rsquo;&mdash;with a glance he indicated the elegant
    assembly at the <i>th&eacute;  dansant</i>&mdash;&rsquo;than this sort of
    thing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa remained silent for a moment or two. Apparently she was pondering
    over what he had just said. Then all of a sudden she seemed to make up her
    mind.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go about to those places any more, Major O&rsquo;Clerigh,&rsquo; she
    said, with an earnest glance of her dark expressive eyes. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t
    safe, you know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know. I know. Men are all alike. They think women are cowards just
    because they are prudent. But foolhardiness is not bravery.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim smiled, with the indulgent contempt of the male at the girl&rsquo;s
    anxiety.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no question of foolhardiness or of bravery,&rsquo; he
    said; &lsquo;only curiosity.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then promise me...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She had spoken abruptly, and then, just as abruptly she paused, the eager
    sympathy died out of her eyes, and an expression came into them all of a
    sudden which Tim could not define. It looked almost like fear. He was sitting
    with his back turned to the rest of the crowd while talking to Teresa, so
    did not see Dom Mano&euml;l, who had worked his way back to their table.
    It was not until the pleasant, cheery voice struck on his ear that he understood
    why the expression in the girl&rsquo;s face had changed so suddenly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One more waltz, <i>cara</i>&mdash;then I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have
    to go. If our dear Major will excuse....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dom Mano&euml;l, as before, took possession of Teresa and led her to the
    dancing floor and Tim was left to ponder over the strange little episode.</p>
  <p>He did not see the girl again that day, but the next morning a barefooted
    urchin brought a small parcel for the senhor Inglez to the hotel. He didn&rsquo;t
    wait for an answer, but said he had orders to deliver the parcel into the
    senhor&rsquo;s own hands. Very much intrigued, Tim opened it. It contained
    a short dagger, with handle and sheath of exquisite Toledo workmanship, and
    with it a note written in quaint, rather stilted English in an ornate, foreign
    hand. It said:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A very dear friend gave me this toy once. I have no use for it, but
    it will serve you well whenever the study of human nature leads you into
    trouble. Promise me never to go out into the streets of this city without
    it. It is safer and more feared than a Browning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The note was not signed. Tim took up the dagger, drew it out of its sheath,
    and looked with admiration on the beautiful Toledo blade and the exquisite
    silver inlay in the finely-tempered steel. He laid it down upon the table
    and then re-read the note.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Funny girl,&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;Why she should ... &ldquo;safer
    than a Browning&rdquo;? I suppose she means that it makes no noise.&rsquo; And
    then, following a fresh train of thought: &lsquo;I wonder how much she does
    know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But that evening when he went to meet his friend the Dutchman, at the Bom
    Genio, he had Teresa&rsquo;s gift safely stowed away in his hip-pocket.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b></h2>
  <p>It was a couple of evenings later that Dom Mano&euml;l persuaded Tim to
    join him and Doctor da Pinto at the Hespanha music-hall.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not quite so elegant,&rsquo; he explained, &lsquo;as the Conquistador,
    where your friend, Inez, is the somewhat worn-out star, but far more amusing.
    Just now there is a Negro dancer&mdash;a girl who, I am told, is quite wonderful.
    Teresa very much wants to see the creature and I would like to take her.
    We&rsquo;ll have to have old da Pinto for a chaperon. We can have supper
    there&mdash;their <i>Vatapa &agrave; Bahiana</i> is superb&mdash;and, anyway,
    I can promise you a pleasant evening. You&rsquo;ll come, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only if you will allow it to be my party. The doctor and the senhorita
    have been very kind to me&mdash;it would give me a chance of making some
    return.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very well&mdash;just as you like. Will you book a table or shall
    I? It is better, as the place gets very crowded....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see to all that,&rsquo; said Tim.</p>
  <p>The Hespanha turned out to be a small place of the usual pattern of music-hall
    in that part of the world: a stage, a floor crowded with seats, a balcony
    on three sides of the hall. On the balcony, trestle-tables with benches and
    chairs, at which supper was served during the performance. Tim had secured
    a table for his little party and the evening began gaily enough. The doctor
    appeared less truculent than usual and Teresa was in one of her happy moods;
    her eyes sparkled with joy; she prattled away as gaily as a young bird. The
    Hespanha was evidently one of those Bohemian places which exist in most countries:
    neither salubrious nor comfortable, offering but a poor entertainment and
    indifferent food; the haunt, too, of many undesirables in the social world&mdash;they
    have, nevertheless, a strange attraction for fastidious and refined women
    of the world, such as Teresa da Pinto, and for reasons which they themselves
    could not explain. Is it that they like to rub their dainty shoulders against
    the coarse fibres of humanity? Is it the novelty of the surroundings? The
    tasting of fruit which, though no longer forbidden these days, still retains
    a certain savour of the unusual and the provocative? Who can say? Certain
    it is that the exquisite Teresa seemed greatly to enjoy the dish of <i>Vatapa &agrave; Bahiana</i>,
    the highly spiced national dish, something like an Indian curry, which is
    the favourite supper dish in these parts, served on a thick earthenware plate
    by a seedy-looking, chocolate-coloured waiter; and it was with obvious relish
    that she sipped iced champagne out of tumblers a quarter of an inch thick.</p>
  <p>She seemed to have totally forgotten her earnestness of the other day&mdash;her
    anxiety on Tim&rsquo;s behalf&mdash;and when, with mock ostentation, he drew
    the beautiful Toledo dagger from his pocket and placed it beside his plate,
    she appeared highly amused and pleased. Dom Mano&euml;l remarked on the pretty
    toy: apparently he had never seen it before and did not know that it was
    a gift from Teresa. She gave Tim a quick look and, unseen by Mano&euml;l,
    she raised a finger to her lips, which he took to mean that the gift and
    her note were to remain a secret between them.</p>
  <p>Neither Tim nor his friends paid much heed to the performance; it was very
    poor, the dancers were badly dressed and neither very young nor very pretty.
    The audience was not worth looking at. What Tim did enjoy was to gaze at
    Teresa. Never had he seen her look more beautiful, because for once she seemed
    perfectly happy. Dom Mano&euml;l was entirely lover-like, attentive, taking
    every opportunity to whisper in her ear&mdash;words unheard by anyone but
    herself and which had the effect of sending a soft blush up to her cheeks.
    The doctor made obvious efforts to talk amiably with Tim. He drank more than
    was good for him, however; more than he had done in public recently. Tim
    noticed that whenever he reached out for the bottle of champagne in order
    to fill his glass, Dom Mano&euml;l would give him a stern look, but the power
    of that look was evidently not great, for, after a shrug and a scowl at his
    friend, da Pinto would deliberately have yet another glass.</p>
  <p>At first there had been a good many free tables on the balcony, but towards
    midnight several hilarious groups came trooping into the hall. Among these,
    Tim caught sight of Van Smeet. He had a girl with him and, after some discussion
    with the seedy-looking waiter, took possession of a table close by. He wanted
    the table next to Tim&rsquo;s party, but the waiter assured him that that
    was booked. In the meanwhile, Tim had nodded to him, and Dom Mano&euml;l
    also condescended to give him a look of recognition.</p>
  <p>It was just after midnight that a set of very rowdy people invaded the balcony
    and with a great deal of talking, shrieks of laughter and stentorian commands
    to the waiter, spread themselves round the table nearest to Tim and his party.
    There were three men and a couple of girls&mdash;rough-looking fellows, whom
    Tim more than suspected of being some sort of half-breeds: the girls were
    showily dressed, and the whole party soon began to drink very freely, whilst
    smoking innumerable cigarettes.</p>
  <p>From the first these people made themselves objectionable to Tim and his
    friends. The girls, shrieking at the top of their strident voices, scrutinized
    Teresa with blatant impertinence. The men roared with laughter whenever the
    women made insolent remarks in loud whispers, evidently intended to be overheard.
    All of them drank and ate noisily and expectorated all over the floor. Tim
    complained to the waiter, who shrugged his shoulders and declared himself
    powerless to interfere. Accustomed to the ways of his own country, Tim then
    demanded to see the manager, who was nowhere to be found. Dom Mano&euml;l
    and the doctor were making very obvious efforts to avoid a row, although
    both of them&mdash;the doctor especially&mdash;were fast losing control over
    their tempers. Tim by now was boiling with rage.</p>
  <p>He rose from his seat and went over to the next table to expostulate with
    the offensive crowd, but the men, contrary to the custom of the country,
    where courtesy amounts to a virtue, were truculent and aggressive; they used
    words and gestures which further irritated Tim. The girls did not help matters
    either, for they went off from time to time into shrieks of hysterical laughter.
    There were a few angry &lsquo;Sh-sh-sh&rsquo; from the audience, but beyond
    that no one took much notice. Then suddenly, without any warning, one of
    the men hit out and struck Tim in the face. Tim, of course, at once returned
    the blow. The doctor and Dom Mano&euml;l jumped up from the table and hurried
    to his assistance, whilst the men at the other table seemed ready to back
    up their friend. The two girls remained seated, still laughing, talking and
    smoking cigarettes.</p>
  <p>Something of a scuffle ensued. More angry &lsquo;Sh-sh-sh&rsquo; on the
    part of the audience; but apparently a row of this sort between the patrons
    of the hall was not an uncommon occurrence at the Hespanha, and people did
    not do more at first than turn their heads in the direction whence came all
    the noise. The band, equally accustomed, probably, to this kind of incident,
    made a few ear-splitting attempts to drown the sound of the scuffle, while
    the dancers did their best to keep the attention of the audience concentrated
    on themselves.</p>
  <p>Up in the gallery the row had resolved itself into a bout of fisticuffs.
    Tim, as soon as he had been so violently and so unwarrantably attacked, landed
    out right and left with his fists, but with his fists only. He never gave
    more than a passing thought to Teresa&rsquo;s gift. Being a past-master in
    the art of self-defence, he was getting on very well, and his three adversaries
    pretty badly, when all of a sudden he saw da Pinto&mdash;who, he thought,
    had come to his aid&mdash;join in the fray against him. And not only that,
    but he saw the doctor&rsquo;s hand reach out for one of the knives on the
    table and then raise it with a gesture which could have but one object&mdash;murder.
    The man must have gone raving mad&mdash;drunk probably, and homicidal in
    his cups. But what was more amazing still, Tim suddenly caught sight of Dom
    Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s face leering at him above da Pinto&rsquo;s shoulder,
    with an expression that was no longer good-humoured and gently sarcastic,
    as was its wont; the lips were no longer smiling, the lips were drawn back
    like those of a feline, showing sharp white teeth and the gums above. It
    was, in fact, a face on which vice, rage and hatred had thrown their hideous
    imprint. Then Timothy saw red. As in a flash he realized that these two devils
    had brought him here in order to entrap him, in order to murder him. He hit
    out savagely at the man in front of him, who was in the way, caught the doctor&rsquo;s
    wrist in a vice-like grip and forced his hand to open convulsively and drop
    the knife.</p>
  <p>The next moment an amazing&mdash;a horrible thing happened: da Pinto&rsquo;s
    face became distorted in a spasm of agony, a gurgling sound came from his
    throat, he stretched out his arms, lurched forward, then sideways and fell
    like a log right across the table.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;You foreign devil, you&rsquo;ve killed him!&rsquo; Who uttered these
    words Tim didn&rsquo;t know. He was too dazed for the moment to do anything
    but stare down at the inanimate body, over which Dom Mano&euml;l was now
    anxiously stooping. The other men had hastily backed away; the girls had
    bolted down the balcony stairs; and there Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh stood staring&mdash;staring
    at that inert, rigid back and at the dark stain which rapidly spread from
    beneath it over the coarse table-cloth.</p>
  <p>And all at once confusion in the hall became chaotic. All the women seemed
    to shriek at once; the men jumped up from their seats, swore and shouted,
    tables and chairs were overturned, plates and bottles fell with loud clangs
    on the floor. After a strident crash of brass instruments, the orchestra
    was mute: the curtain had been hastily rung down.</p>
  <p>There were cries of &lsquo;Police!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And now by the side of Dom Mano&euml;l, who had succeeded in turning the
    body over and was trying to undo the fallen man&rsquo;s tie, collar and waistcoat,
    Tim saw Teresa da Pinto. She, too, was stooping over the body of her father,
    but at the moment that Tim caught sight of her she raised her head and their
    eyes met. To his dying day Tim never forgot the expression of her face just
    then. It appeared rigid and grey, as if carved in stone; there was not a
    drop of blood in her cheeks or her lips; and the eyes&mdash;those beautiful,
    dark, luminous eyes of hers&mdash;stared and stared vacantly, as if suddenly
    struck with blindness. Like an automaton she stood there, her back half-bent,
    one hand resting on the dead man&rsquo;s shoulder; and like an automaton
    she now raised the other hand and pointed to the top of the stairs. Through
    the white frozen lips came a half-articulate sound and, presently the words:  &lsquo;Go&mdash;go
    ... at once ... go!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>As soon as the words were uttered Dom Mano&euml;l looked up. Evidently he
    had not realized that she was still there, for the first thing he said was:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Teresa, stand aside. I&rsquo;ll see you home
    as soon as...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>By handling the dead man&rsquo;s clothes, his own, as well as his hands,
    had become stained: except for that, he might have been turned out of a bandbox.
    He looked up at Tim, and while Teresa still murmured like an automaton repeating
    a lesson: &lsquo;Go&mdash;it is better&mdash;go!&rsquo; Dom Mano&euml;l said,
    quite coolly:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything so foolish, Major&mdash;unless, of course...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim, indeed, had no intention of doing anything of the sort. After the first
    moment of bewilderment he was regaining all his self-possession. The incident
    was tragic in the extreme: horrible in view of Teresa&rsquo;s presence here.
    It was also inexplicable to a mind, ignorant of medical facts, why there
    should be all that blood, as it seemed obvious now to Tim that the doctor
    had suddenly died of heart failure, brought on by over-excitement. He did
    not feel in any way remorseful, as he certainly was not responsible for the
    catastrophe.</p>
  <p>A couple of gendarmes now appeared upon the scene, accompanied by a little
    dark man in a black frock-coat, who evidently was a medical man. They had
    forced their way through the crowd up the staircase, asking no questions,
    guided to the scene of the disaster by a dozen eager hands. An over-curious
    group of newsmongers gathered round them, awed and silenced by the magnitude
    of the tragedy. The rest of the hall was being rapidly cleared by two or
    three more gendarmes. All the noise and confusion had subsided; soon the
    hall, save for that compact group on the balcony, appeared dark and deserted.
    It seemed as if those that remained up there had been struck dumb.</p>
  <p>The man in the black coat was busy with the lifeless body. The gendarmes
    asked what had happened; and one of them produced pocket-book and pencil,
    while the other did the interrogating. He turned first to Tim, who, quite
    cool and unruffled now, did his best to give a clear and concise explanation.</p>
  <p>He had objected, he said, to the behaviour of some men and women at the
    table next to his: they had been very offensive to the lady in his party.
    He expostulated. One of the men struck at him, and he struck back. Then,
    all of a sudden, to his utter astonishment, Doctor da Pinto, whom he knew
    well in society and who was his guest this evening, seized a knife and would
    undoubtedly have struck at him had not he, Tim, grabbed him by the wrist
    and forced him to drop the knife; whereupon, without the slightest warning,
    the doctor seemingly fell dead.</p>
  <p>There were a few murmurs in the crowd, either of astonishment or incredulity,
    followed by a kind of shiver of excitement when Dom Mano&euml;l, respectfully
    questioned by the gendarmes&mdash;since he was a person of much consequence
    in the city&mdash;gave his version of the tragedy. As usual he was very self-possessed,
    very urbane, above all very helpful.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;in fact, I am sure that my friend,
    Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, is entirely wrong in one particular. Doctor da Pinto
    most obviously never raised his hand against him. If he did seize a knife,
    which I suppose he did, since the Major says so, it could only have been
    in order to defend our kind host of to-night, and not to attack him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where is the knife?&rsquo; the gendarme asked, and a dozen eager
    eyes immediately searched the floor. Unfortunately this by now was littered
    with debris of china, of glasses and bottles, with knives, forks and spoons:
    all scattered pell-mell when the dying man clutched at the cloth before falling
    prone across the table.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am quite certain of one thing,&rsquo; Tim was saying meanwhile, &lsquo;that
    Doctor da Pinto&rsquo;s mind was in a very confused state. He had been drinking
    a great deal all the evening and I don&rsquo;t suppose he had the least idea
    what he was doing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Can the senhorita give any other detail? It is very sad and very
    regrettable to have to ask you questions, senhorita ... but if you could
    help me...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I saw nothing,&rsquo; Teresa replied, with extraordinary selfpossession.  &lsquo;I
    heard the dispute going on, but preferred to look another way ... I was regretting
    that I had ever thought of coming here when...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; the gendarme said kindly, and then turned to the
    black-coated doctor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The immediate cause of death, senhor <i>doutor</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A knife thrust,&rsquo; the little man replied, &lsquo;in the neck,
    severing one of the jugular veins. Doctor da Pinto died instantaneously.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; Tim exclaimed, involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why impossible, senhor?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was at grips with him at the moment. I should have seen if anyone
    had...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But someone&mdash;we&rsquo;ll say someone unknown&mdash;did, senhor
    Inglez&mdash;and with this unpleasant looking little instrument.&rsquo; And
    the doctor held out to the gendarme a small dagger with an exquisitely inlaid
    blade and hilt of Toledo workmanship.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; Tim exclaimed, &lsquo;that is mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; the doctor queried, with a smile. The gendarme took
    the dagger from him and showed it to Tim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You recognize it?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, yes!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then how do you account for what the senhor <i>doutor</i> has just
    told us?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t account for it&mdash;the knife is mine&mdash;I have
    carried it about with me lately. To-night, during supper, I took it out of
    my pocket and put it on the table beside my plate. Senhor da Lisbao would
    remember....&rsquo; And he turned to Dom Mano&euml;l, who at the moment was
    intent on persuading Teresa to drink a glass of champagne. At the sound of
    his own name he turned.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear fellow&mdash;is there anything I can do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;you remember this knife? I put it on the table&mdash;you
    remarked on it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I remember&mdash;yes. What about it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Senhor <i>doutor</i> has just told us,&rsquo; the gendarme said, &lsquo;that
    senhor <i>doutor</i> da Pinto was stabbed in the neck with this knife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But the knife was on the table&mdash;you remember?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I do. I&rsquo;ve said so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When did you last see it, senhor?&rsquo; the gendarme asked. &lsquo;I
    mean at what moment during the dispute?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dom Mano&euml;l shrugged his shoulders till they almost touched his ears
    and threw out his hands with an expressive gesture.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That I am afraid I can&rsquo;t tell you. I know that at one time
    the knife was on the table. Major O&rsquo;Clerigh took it out of his pocket
    and laid it down beside his own plate, but what became of it afterwards I
    really couldn&rsquo;t say.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is the sheath, at any rate,&rsquo; somebody from the crowd
    remarked and pointed to the table, where, amidst the remnants of the supper
    party, among the forks and the spoons and glasses, lay the Toledo sheath.</p>
  <p>The two gendarmes were evidently embarrassed. It was the first time in their
    lives that they had been called upon to suspect a person of high social standing
    of being concerned in an ugly business of this sort. They did not quite know
    how to act. In cases like this, one just took the delinquent by the scruff
    of the neck and marched him off to the cells, pending inquiry before the
    justices of the peace. But to drag an illustrious stranger, who was a major
    in the King of England&rsquo;s army, through the streets of Monsataz, and
    to thrust him into the police cells along with a lot of vagabonds and half-breeds,
    was out of the question. And it was too late to telephone the Town Hall for
    instructions: on the other hand, the matter was terribly serious. If what
    the senhor <i>doutor</i> had said turned out to be a fact, then...</p>
  <p>Instinctively they turned for advice to Senhor da Lisbao: a prominent citizen,
    friend of the Governor of the province and of all the dignitaries of the
    city, he would better than anyone know just what to do. Dom Mano&euml;l was
    as usual most helpful.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I will be guarantee for the senhor Inglez,&rsquo; he said, in answer
    to the mute question put to him by the perplexed gendarmes. &lsquo;The whole
    thing is, of course, a tragic mistake. I don&rsquo;t pretend to know, but
    I&rsquo;ll guarantee that the cavalheiro Inglez will go straight back to
    his hotel now, and that he will be ready to appear before the magistrate
    in the morning, whenever you come for him. I&rsquo;ll see the Governor myself
    and explain; you won&rsquo;t be blamed, I promise you&mdash;so if you are
    satisfied...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They were. Not only satisfied, but much relieved.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right, isn&rsquo;t it, Major?&rsquo; Dom Mano&euml;l
    asked in English.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose so. It&rsquo;s very kind of you, of course, but I have
    no intention of running away. There&rsquo;s some ghastly muddle here which
    I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;against that I don&rsquo;t mind in the least
    spending the rest of the night in a police cell rather than...&rsquo; He
    had been on the point of saying: &lsquo;rather than owe anything to you,&rsquo;  but
    thought better of it. This was not the time for giving way to any sudden
    impulse, and any ill-considered speech might have unpleasant consequences.</p>
  <p>A couple more gendarmes had now turned up, and between them the four men
    jostled the crowd in order to make way for Senhor da Lisbao and the senhorita.
    Teresa had made almost superhuman efforts not to give way under the terrible
    strain; and Tim in his heart, and despite worry over his unpleasant position,
    gave ungrudging tribute to her marvellous pluck and endurance. Everything
    had been so sudden and was so terribly bewildering that he did not know what
    impression she had gathered of the awful catastrophe. Surely she did not
    believe him guilty of murdering her father: such a purposeless crime must
    to any sane person appear impossible, and Teresa was more than ordinarily
    sane&mdash;except where Mano&euml;l was concerned. That that smooth-tongued
    devil had a hand in the whole tragic incident Tim did not doubt for a moment;
    exactly what r&ocirc;le he did play in it was difficult as vet to determine.
    But somehow Tim already had the impression that Teresa knew certain things,
    which had brought that look of frozen horror upon her face and forced the
    words: &lsquo;Go!&mdash;go at once!&rsquo; from her lips. In view of what
    followed, those words, which had sounded like a command, were more than puzzling.
    Tim tried to meet her eyes once more as Mano&euml;l guided her through the
    crowd, but she was looking straight before her, leaning heavily on Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s
    arm, and despite the heat holding her shawl wrapped closely round her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shall I send the motor back for you?&rsquo; Mano&euml;l asked, as
    he brushed past Timothy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, thanks. I&rsquo;d sooner walk.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He followed down the stairs, the crowd closing in behind him; there was
    still a lot to see; the fourth act of the drama&mdash;the body to be conveyed
    to the mortuary&mdash;the <i>pi&egrave;ces de conviction</i> to be carefully
    collected, and so on. At the door of the hall Tim waited long enough to see
    Teresa and Mano&euml;l get into the motor and drive away. He supposed that
    she would go straight home, where probably she had a kind maid or nurse who
    would look after her. What a strange enigma was this whole affair! Tim, walking
    down the cobbled streets of the old city in these small hours of the morning,
    with the waning moon casting her mysterious light over this remote corner
    of God&rsquo;s earth, felt as if he were dreaming, as if all these events
    had not really occurred&mdash;not to him, Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh, Major
    in the Irish Guards, whose life hitherto had been so easy, so simple and
    straightforward, with every action mapped out and directed by convention.
    How could it be he himself who had just been led to the very edge of a precipice,
    made to gaze into an abyss wherein life or honour might conceivably have
    been wrecked?</p>
  <p>What did it all mean, anyway? What were the meshes of the net into which
    he had been driven and in which he might so easily have been caught? Had
    it been a <i>guet-apens</i> with a view to his receiving a casual knife thrust
    in a scrimmage? Were those men mere bravoes hired by Dom Mano&euml;l to get
    rid of him? And had one of them struck the doctor by mistake? That was, perhaps,
    the most likely explanation of the affair. And yet the longer did Tim think
    over every moment of the fateful evening, the more did a certain vision&mdash;a
    flash that did not last longer than a few seconds&mdash;thrust itself before
    his mind&rsquo;s eye. As he walked through the ill-lighted streets he saw
    that vision, marvelling if it was real; wondering if, at the very instant
    when da Pinto seized the knife and brandished it, he, Tim, had really caught
    a sudden glimpse of Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s face, distorted with rage and with
    passion, immediately behind the doctor&rsquo;s uplifted arm&mdash;or if he
    had dreamed it. But the longer he thought of it the more he was sure&mdash;although
    reason fought against the suggestion, for, in very truth, what object could
    one devil have in killing his partner in crime?</p>
  <p>And yet there was Teresa&rsquo;s frozen look of horror. She most certainly
    had seen something, which had filled her whole soul with a withering despair.
    Terribly tragic as would, in any case, have been the death of her father
    in such circumstances, there was something more desperate than mere affliction
    or even anguish in her attitude. She wanted Tim to go&mdash;to go away at
    once, lest he should hear or know&mdash;what? Lest he should be embroiled
    in a net of infamy, which she knew had been spread for him&mdash;and not
    only for him, but also for her father.</p>
  <p>God! What a tangle! Again Tim was assailed with doubts. Was the whole thing
    worth while? Whither would his mad desire for right and justice to himself
    lead him after this?</p>
  <p>When first he set out on his adventure he knew that he would have enemies
    to deal with, unscrupulous blackguards who would be prepared to commit any
    crime in order to conceal their past felonies. Well! here he was now in the
    midst of it all. The Irish fly had walked into the dago spider&rsquo;s parlour&mdash;and
    probably here he was, too, without a friend in the world to show him the
    way out again.</p>
  <p>Not that Tim felt any anxiety with regard to his own future over this affair.
    His conscience was so absolutely clear, his actions had been so entirely
    straightforward, that he had no fear of a flagrant miscarriage of justice.
    After all, he was in a civilized country, and Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh was
    one of those who still clung to the belief that there was some kind of magical
    power in being a citizen of the British Empire.</p>
  <p><i>Civis Romanus sum</i>.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18</b></h2>
  <p>Nor was there any flagrant miscarriage of justice. Even at the moment when
    Timothy heard the magistrates&rsquo; decision and realized that it meant
    the ruin of all his hopes, he could not, in the bitterness of his heart,
    do more than curse himself for his folly&mdash;for his senseless idiocy in
    walking straight into the trap so cunningly laid for him.</p>
  <p>Cunning? Of course it was cunning. A masterpiece of devilish craftsmanship.
    He, Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh, had to be got out of the way&mdash;by some means
    more or less foul. Murder might have proved inconvenient with a British Consul
    not so many miles way, so there must be something else. He had come here
    intending to unmask two rogues, who were not mere vagabonds and ruffians,
    but important members of a civilized community, rich and influential&mdash;therefore,
    away with him. What more easy for a resourceful brain, like that of Dom Mano&euml;l
    da Lisbao, than to devise a scheme whereby this meddlesome Irishman would
    be involved in a brawl in a low-class music-hall, get mixed up in an affray
    which would end in the death of a prominent citizen of Monsataz and be expelled
    from the country as an undesirable alien?</p>
  <p>For that is how the anxiety, the mental torture of the past few weeks culminated
    in the end. Expelled from the country! Ordered to quit Monsataz within forty-eight
    hours, as his presence there was undesirable! How often in the past few years
    had Tim read in his <i>Daily Mail</i> that this or that alien had been ordered
    by the magistrate to be sent back to his own country as an &lsquo;undesirable.&rsquo;  And
    here he was&mdash;Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, D.S.O., of the Irish Guards, an
    undesirable in the opinion of the provincial magistrate of this country,
    ordered to clear out within forty-eight hours.</p>
  <p>The British Consul&mdash;so kind and considerate&mdash;took a cheerful view
    of the situation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It might have been much worse,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How&mdash;worse?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Two or three years&rsquo; imprisonment&mdash;in a Brazilian prison....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bah! No worse than banishment....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>For this was the end of all Tim&rsquo;s hopes, of all his schemes. God!
    What a fool he had been! And yet&mdash;how in the world could he have guessed?
    The whole tragedy had been so magnificently planned and everything went as
    smoothly, as naturally as if he himself had helped to construct the drama
    until the final fall of the curtain&mdash;the sentence of banishment.</p>
  <p>Everyone had been most kind, most helpful. Bail was granted without demur,
    though the charge was serious; an advocate of renown in the province was
    at his disposal and burned the midnight oil to collect evidence in his client&rsquo;s
    favour. Medical evidence went to prove that Doctor da Pinto had died of heart
    failure, consequent on over-excitement, and that the knife-thrust had been
    delivered either at the very moment or immediately after the collapse.</p>
  <p>Dom Mano&euml;l did his best to be of service to the accused, who was his
    friend, just as the deceased had been. But as a matter of fact he had seen
    nothing really&mdash;nothing that would be of any use to the defence. He
    recognized the dagger, remembered its lying on the table at one time, but
    after that...? No! He could not in conscience recollect anything more. The
    shock he had experienced on seeing his friend fall so suddenly had almost
    unmanned him ... he had hurried to his side as quickly as he could. He did
    not realize that the doctor was dead until he ... oh! it was all very, very
    horrible. Senhor da Pinto had been one of his greatest friends. And the whole
    tragedy had been all the more horrible from the fact that the Senhorita Teresa
    had been there, not a dozen paces away from the scene. Fortunately, she had
    seen nothing&mdash;nothing. Dom Mano&euml;l could swear to that, because,
    although he had, from the first, tried to intervene between the accused and
    his opponents, he had never ceased to keep an eye on the senhorita to make
    sure that she was not being molested. No&mdash;no&mdash;there was no occasion
    to call her ... she had seen nothing, and it would be cruel to drag her into
    the affair. Dom Mano&euml;l, who throughout was a witness such as any examining
    magistrate would delight in&mdash;calm, lucid, ready to help in every way&mdash;concluded
    his deposition by reiterating his firm belief that Major O&rsquo;Clerigh
    was mistaken when he thought that Doctor da Pinto was threatening him with
    a knife.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was an unfortunate mistake, as it turned out,&rsquo; were the
    words the witness used, &lsquo;perhaps a natural one, under the circumstances,
    but I owe it to the memory of my friend to vindicate his character in this.
    Besides, what possible object could the unfortunate man have for attacking
    Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, whom he hardly knew and with whom he had no cause
    for quarrel?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Senhor da Lisbao was warmly thanked by both sides for the impartial way
    in which he had deposed. He stepped down from the witness-box, looking the
    perfection of well-groomed, well-bred manhood, anxious only for the truth,
    but ready to vindicate the honour of both his friends&mdash;the living and
    the dead. As he passed close to the accused, he gave him an encouraging nod.
    Tim, consumed inwardly with rage, nevertheless gave ungrudging admiration
    to the skill of his enemy. His was a complete triumph, for his name and reputation
    remained unscathed. The three ruffians whom he had paid to start the row
    at the Hespanha had served him well. Never for a moment had Senhor Mano&euml;l
    da Lisbao been involved in the affair, save as a sympathetic looker-on. They
    themselves played their r&ocirc;le of impartial witnesses to perfection.
    The accused, they said, had sought quarrel with them and they had been forced
    to use their fists in self-defence. They swore that they did not see Doctor
    da Pinto lift an arm against the cavalheiro Inglez. But then they were facing
    the accused, so could not have seen what went on behind their backs.</p>
  <p>Indeed, at one time during the inquiry, which lasted close upon a month,
    things looked very black for Tim. The general trend of evidence led to the
    conclusion that he had drunk too much champagne, that he became truculent
    and aggressive, assaulted three inoffensive persons at a neighbouring table&mdash;and
    they were the principal witnesses against him&mdash;and then, for no apparent
    reason, thrust at Doctor da Pinto with murderous intent. Timothy, very reluctantly,
    had put his advocate in possession of a few facts&mdash;not all&mdash;connected
    with his own life, which he thought might help his case: his right to a great
    peerage, the r&ocirc;le played by Doctor da Pinto and others in defrauding
    him of his heritage, his reasons for coming out to Monsataz. But the advocate&mdash;very
    wisely&mdash;came to the conclusion that such evidence would only be prejudicial
    to the defence; for, thought it might presuppose a motive for da Pinto&rsquo;s
    desire to be rid of Timothy, it might also turn out to be a two-edged sword
    and demonstrate that the accused, not having succeeded in proving that the
    affidavit sworn by the doctor was perjury, had the strongest possible motive
    for assassination&mdash;namely, revenge; a motive, by the way, most readily
    understood in this country.</p>
  <p>And thus did the inquiry pursue its wearisome way. The British Consul and
    Dom Mano&euml;l had gone bail for Tim and, though he hated the very thought
    of being beholden to his worst enemy for anything, he could not find any
    reasonable ground for refusal. And he passed his days in the dreary room
    of the Hotel Angola, gazing out over the sun-lit bay and the towering, sun-baked
    rocks that appeared now like two Titanic sentinels at the gates of this implacable
    prison. The pitiless sun, the harsh blue of the sky, the searing glare of
    the ocean, the tropical heat, all tended to aggravate the tension on his
    nerves, until he began to wonder whether he would not sooner be dead and
    have done with it all.</p>
  <p>In the end it was his friends from the Bom Genio who saved him from a really
    cruel fate. Van Smeet and the two Germans, who had been sitting at a table
    close by and had stood up in order to watch what they thought was just an
    amusing row, were quite positive that the deceased was brandishing a knife
    a few seconds before he fell. They had seen Tim&rsquo;s hand clutching da
    Pinto&rsquo;s wrist and the knife dropping out of the latter&rsquo;s hand.
    After that, persons and things intervened and they did not see exactly what
    happened, but their evidence enabled Tim&rsquo;s advocate to seize on the
    question of self-defence. This plea the examining magistrate accepted, but
    he held that a quarrelsome foreigner like this Major O&rsquo;Clerigh, who
    was evidently over-fond of champagne and then became aggressive in his cups,
    was an undesirable visitor to these peaceable shores, and had better be returned
    to his own country.</p>
  <p>The accused was ordered to quit the country within forty-eight hours.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19</b></h2>
  <p>Tim, sitting in the hotel, staring at his luggage, wondered if there had
    ever been on earth a bigger fool than himself, or a man more absolutely done
    in by a clever scoundrel. Mano&euml;l da Lisbao had indeed triumphed in the
    most thorough, most complete manner. He had even in one swoop rid himself
    not only of Timothy, his enemy, but also of his partner, da Pinto, who in
    all probability was becoming inconvenient.</p>
  <p>The more he thought the whole tragedy over, the more convinced he was that
    it was Mano&euml;l who had struck the doctor, that it was his face he had
    seen, distorted with rage and a sardonic grin, just above da Pinto&rsquo;s
    shoulder before the unfortunate man fell dead across the table. But what
    was the good now of brooding over that? What was the good of eating out one&rsquo;s
    heart in regret and bitterness? He had been enmeshed and had fallen a victim.
    He was the foreigner, unknown, unconsidered; Mano&euml;l the native, with
    riches and influence. It was all inevitable. Fate and his own folly had brought
    about the catastrophe. He might have done this or that; he should not have
    gone here or there; said one thing rather than another. All futile now. He
    was ordered to clear out of the place, and the last chance of probing the
    mystery of Dudley Stone would sail with him across the ocean.</p>
  <p>Late that evening Fra Martino came to see him. He appeared panting, breathless,
    and perspiring profusely, as if he had hurried through the streets.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; he began, as soon as he had put down his amazing
    hat and stick, and fell with a sigh of relief into the arm-chair which Tim
    offered him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bad luck, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said Tim with a smile. He had taken
    a liking to the old fellow, who, during the last wearisome month, had often
    been to see him, and had done his best to cheer and comfort him. His grudge
    against Fra Martino had soon died away. If the old priest had been the recipient
    of Fra Bartolomeo&rsquo;s confession, he was entirely within his rights&mdash;it
    was his sacred duty, in fact&mdash;to keep the secret of that confession
    inviolate. True, he had benefited through Fra Bartolomeo&rsquo;s crime, but
    would it have been in human nature to refuse a legacy, which meant a fortune
    to him, because he knew its provenance to be corrupt? There had been something
    in the priest&rsquo;s attitude towards him during the terrible ordeal of
    the inquiry which had been a real comfort&mdash;something kindly, sympathetic.
    He seemed to be the one friend Tim had in this crowd of enemies and callous
    lookers-on.</p>
  <p>He got the old man a whisky and soda, and said ruefully: &lsquo;The last
    I shall be mixing for you, Padre.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The priest had a long drink; after which he evidently felt better physically.
    But there was something on his mind. Tim knew the symptoms well: a troubled
    look, and then a blank expression, a steady avoidance of the other&rsquo;s
    gaze, and the thick, red hand fidgeting the cigarette.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It might have been much worse, my dear Major,&rsquo; he said at last.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not much, Padre.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim sat down beside the old man. The window was wide open, and they had
    before them a picture of the noble bay with the huge rocks, and the water,
    smooth as a mirror, reflecting in shades of rose and purple the marvel of
    the setting sun. And Tim gazed across that ocean which seemed so tranquil
    and yet to him so pitiless, since in a very few hours it would roll on forever
    between him and his vanished hopes. And suddenly the desire seized him to
    speak once more of those hopes and of his despair. He did not really know
    just how much the old priest knew of the affair which had brought him, Tim
    O&rsquo;Clee, to these shores. Like the beautiful Teresa, Fra Martino had
    always remained something of an enigma. His share in the profits derived
    from Hold-Hands Juliana&rsquo;s suborning hands was undoubted, but how much
    did he know of the whole conspiracy which had ousted Tim from his rightful
    inheritance?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did I ever tell you, Padre,&rsquo; he began, rather abruptly, &lsquo;why
    I came to Monsataz?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Martino hesitated; for a second or two it almost seemed as if there
    was nothing he longed for so much at this moment as to run away. At last
    he said tentatively:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No ... my dear friend ... that is&mdash;no&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think
    you ever...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I came here, Padre, because I hoped to discover something which would
    have given me back what is rightly mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what may that have been, my dear Major?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Whether a certain man named Dudley Stone did really die in Monsataz
    in May, 1924.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why should that...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because if Dudley Stone really did die on that date, then the marriage
    of a common, vulgar woman with my uncle, who was an Irish peer, was a legal
    one, and her son born of the marriage has a perfect right to the title and
    estates which I claim to be mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And if this Dudley Stone did not die on the day you name?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then the woman who went through the ceremony of marriage with my
    uncle had a husband living at the time: the marriage was illegal, the child
    illegitimate, and I the sole and rightful heir to one of the finest names
    in Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why should you think...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That the woman is a liar? I can&rsquo;t tell you why, but I know
    it. I am as sure of it as that I am alive. Three men over here swore an oath
    that Dudley Stone died six years ago&mdash;and I know that that oath was
    false.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim paused a moment or two: he was watching the old man intently. But up
    to now Fra Martino&rsquo;s face had remained an expressionless mask.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I came here, Padre,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;in order to find
    out exactly what had become of Dudley Stone. I had already made some progress.
    I held a thread&mdash;a very slender one&mdash;but a thread nevertheless.
    I know that in the end I should have succeeded. God is not always on the
    side of the wicked.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear friend!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know&mdash;I know. Forgive me, Padre, one does blaspheme sometimes.
    I know it is wicked, but just now I haven&rsquo;t any goodness in me. I was
    succeeding&mdash;I know I was succeeding&mdash;and now I&rsquo;m being kicked
    out of the country and have to throw up the sponge. The wicked do prosper,
    you see, Padre. They even did so in the Bible, or David wouldn&rsquo;t have
    said so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Martino had another drink before he spoke again, and there was genuine
    sympathy in the tone of his voice:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am really sorry, my dear Major. You never told me....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How could I?&rsquo; Tim retorted, somewhat roughly. &lsquo;The perjurers
    were your friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; came in protest at this from Fra Martino.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think you know that, too, don&rsquo;t you, Padre?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>To this the old priest made no reply. He thought it better to give this
    confidential conversation another turn&mdash;a less unpleasant one.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When you are back in your own country...&rsquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When I&rsquo;m back?&rsquo; Tim retorted. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m never
    going back to my own country, Padre&mdash;never!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only because in Ireland there happens to be an old, old grey house&mdash;a
    wonderful old pile it is, too&mdash;it has towers covered with ivy, and the
    oaks and beeches in the woods around have stood there centuries before this
    place over here was even dreamed of. I was born in that house, Padre, and
    so was my father, and his father before him, and grandfather and great-grandfather.
    You don&rsquo;t know about such things, Padre, do you? And what I say sounds
    idiotic, doesn&rsquo;t it? But to us a house like that means everything we
    hold most sacred.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Religion, my dear friend...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is a part of our religion, too. To me, that house, the woods,
    the lake, mean ... Well! they just mean my life, for God knows that they
    are mine, and I have been deliberately robbed of them by a lying wanton woman,
    who now sits in the arm-chair by the fire where my old granny used to sit;
    she sleeps in her bed; she eats off the old china plates; and pours her tea
    out of our old Irish silver teapot. I know you don&rsquo;t understand, Padre;
    but even that old Irish teapot means as much to me as the altar in your Lady
    Chapel perhaps means to you. Well! by coming here I thought I could unmask
    her trickery. With money which she got&mdash;wheedled out of a doting old
    man&mdash;she bribed three men to swear the false oath which enabled her
    to do me out of my rights. I know&mdash;and you know, Padre&mdash;who those
    three men are, or rather were, for two of them are dead. The third, the vilest
    of the lot, has got the better of me. He has triumphed, and I am down and
    out. I can do nothing once I am turned out of here. And I was so near succeeding.
    I shall become a wanderer now on the face of the earth, but I couldn&rsquo;t
    go back to Ireland. It would break my heart to see the old place again, now
    that I have failed so lamentably.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim was sitting opposite Fra Martino, his elbows resting on his knees, his
    hands sometimes clasped together, sometimes his fists supporting his chin.
    All the time that he spoke he stared straight out before him into the corner
    of the room where stood his luggage ready packed: the outward sign of his
    dismal failure. The old priest let him talk on. He had seen so much in his
    day of shipwrecked humanity: had, in his funny, rough way, comforted so many
    broken fortunes that instinctively he knew that the best solace for this
    man&rsquo;s trouble at the moment was to let him put all the bitterness of
    his heart into words, and just to listen in silence. To show neither sympathy,
    nor even understanding, only to remain the mute recipient of words&mdash;that
    meant a measure of comfort.</p>
  <p>It was only when, after a time, words were lost in a spasm of soul agony,
    and Timothy jumped to his feet and strode to the window in order to hide
    the tears which despite his every effort forced themselves into his eyes,
    that Fra Martino made up his mind to speak; and this he did, after he had
    very noisily blown his nose and cleared his throat.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, my young friend,&rsquo; said he,&rsquo; should you accept failure
    so easily?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim swung round on his heel.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Easily? Great God! Haven&rsquo;t I got to clear out of this place
    within forty-eight hours?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The magistrate ordered it&mdash;yes! But...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There are ways, you know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What ways?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So long as you disappear from Monsataz&mdash;go away for a time ...
    a long time even....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what would be the good of that, Padre? I should anyhow...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait one moment, my dear Major. What I meant was that the magistrate
    ordered you to quit the country. Good! But he did not say which way you were
    to go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What in the world do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim came and sat down beside Fra Martino. A strange excitement had suddenly
    crept into his blood, making his finger-tips tingle and his temples throb.</p>
  <p>Fra Martino went on placidly: &lsquo;You can go which way you like, not?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. But where to?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is your affair. To obey the magistrate you can just as well
    go north to Pernambuco as south to Rio.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>That the old priest had something definite at the back of his mind was,
    of course, evident. Tim by now was too excited to talk clearly: all he could
    do was to try by monosyllabic words to jog Fra Martino&rsquo;s slow diction
    along. Could he have dragged the words through the old man&rsquo;s mouth
    with his fingers, he would have done it. The trouble was that Fra Martino
    was still hesitating. Apparently he had begun to speak on impulse, but was
    now on the very verge of regretting what he had already said. And Tim was
    terrified lest a false move on his part, a mere word spoken at the wrong
    moment, would send the old man into one of his slippery moods&mdash;when
    nothing more could be got out of him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course, Padre,&rsquo; he said, as calmly as he could, &lsquo;I
    can go to Pernambuco by the coasting steamer.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not all the way, my dear friend&mdash;not necessarily all the way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what else can I do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You need not go all the way to Pernambuco. You might, for instance,
    land at one of the ports of call&mdash;there are two or three on the coast&mdash;and
    then ... the steamer might go on without you, eh? And you might find yourself...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where? In God&rsquo;s name, Padre, try and tell me just what you
    mean or my head will burst.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is very simple what I mean. You have been given your passport,
    not? It is possible that to-morrow when you are ready to start they will
    ask you how you intend to travel. You say to Pernambuco by the steamer, and
    from there to New York, or Europe&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Good! The authorities
    will be satisfied. Probably they will escort you to the steamer. And, of
    course, if you thought of returning, they would make it unpleasant for you.
    But you go&mdash;you go&mdash;you are on board the steamer with your luggage,
    bound for Pernambuco. But at San Christovao, where the steamer calls, you
    go on shore; and then you lose count of time; the steamer goes&mdash;and
    you are left behind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All very pretty, Padre!&rsquo; And Tim sighed, bitterly disappointed.
    He had begun to think that Fra Martino really had a scheme for helping him:
    he hardly knew what; it seemed impossible, of course, but still he had hopes.
    And now this futility! &lsquo;If I come back here, they&rsquo;ll only turn
    me out again. Dom Mano&euml;l would see to that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you need not come back here. You mustn&rsquo;t come back here.
    It is not here that you will find&mdash;what you seek.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Padre! In God&rsquo;s name, what do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Martino took a long drink. He looked terribly perplexed&mdash;unhappy
    even. Some kind of mental struggle was evidently disturbing his usual indolent
    complacency. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, took a long pull
    at his cigarette, while Tim felt as if during these few seconds he was living
    through eternity.</p>
  <p>Said Fra Martino at last: &lsquo;I should advise, you, my dear friend, after
    you have missed your steamer at San Christovao&mdash;eh?&mdash;to take a
    train up-country....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is a dreary journey&mdash;ten or twelve hours&mdash;a slow train&mdash;many
    wayside stations&mdash;till it gets to Bomfin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bomfin? Where is that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A long way&mdash;a long, long way&mdash;on the confines of the desert.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The desert?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We call it a desert because it is so dry, so lonely.... Yes ... the
    desert ... the Sertao.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Sertao? But what should I be doing there?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The priest did not reply. He appeared absorbed in thought: sipping the whisky
    and soda and taking long pulls at his cigarette. He avoided meeting Timothy&rsquo;s
    searching, inquiring eyes; and as Tim gazed on that large, florid, bloated
    face, it ceased to appear ugly to him. It seemed to him transfigured, like
    the face of a seer who had drawn aside for his benefit, and for one moment
    only, the veil which had fallen over his hopes. The &lsquo;Sertao!&rsquo; Gradually
    the word found its way to his inner consciousness. The vision of that dreary
    court-room, where he had sat day after day while the inquiry pursued its
    weary course, slowly faded from his ken. It had haunted him incessantly for
    these four miserable weeks; he could see nothing else, waking or dreaming,
    but those whitewashed walls, the tall bench where sat the overworked, perspiring
    magistrate, and the chink in the <i>persienne</i> with that one glint of
    sunshine which at a certain hour of the day struck him in the face and seared
    his eye-balls. But now at the magic word &lsquo;Sertao&rsquo; that ugly vision
    faded away. In its stead he saw the cheerful interior of the Bom Genio caf&eacute;:
    the jovial Dutchman, the fat-headed blond Germans, the surly, silent half-breeds.
    He heard again their murmuring voices talking of the mysterious desert, the
    resurrected prophet, the Great Unknown, who was such an audacious cattle-thief
    and the rightful emperor of Brazil, with the huge army of half-savage <i>vaqueiros</i> trained
    to arms by European officers. Tales! tales! He had heard them dozens of times,
    and paid little heed to them: only at times he used to wonder vaguely whether
    in that army of the Great Unknown he would one day come across the English
    adventurer, Dudley Stone.</p>
  <p>And suddenly, with Fra Martino&rsquo;s tentatively uttered words, it all
    came back to him: the tales whispered by the half-breeds, laughed at by the
    Europeans, and the wonder which had seized hold of him when he heard about
    this army commanded by European officers.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Sertao, Padre...?&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; Fra Martino replied. &lsquo;It is a strange, lonely,
    desolate place, but you could find shelter there for a time until...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only shelter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Martino ignored what the question implied. He had apparently fallen
    back on his favourite policy of &lsquo;back-pedalling.&rsquo; Having gone
    so far, timidity had seized on him; his natural indolence rebelled against
    this attempt at giving a hand to the foreign under-dog, because of the worry,
    the anxiety it would bring in its train. He had resumed that air of complacent
    bonhomie which became him so well and which in the past had so often been
    a source of irritation to O&rsquo;Clerigh. He drank and smacked his lips,
    and did not in any way hurry himself or take the slightest notice of poor
    Tim&rsquo;s impatience.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have a friend,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;a colleague, a saintly man,
    who is the priest in charge of the district round the Sertao. The villages,
    you understand, are so scattered, the population is sparse: the Church cannot
    afford to have a minister of God in every village, so there is one for a
    whole district, and my friend...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Does he live in Bomfin?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no, some way up the Sertao district&mdash;on the way to Canudos&mdash;you
    understand?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim had got hold of a note-book and was jotting down all these names.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And how shall I get to him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! at Bomfin anyone will tell you ... you will find Esteban, the
    local carrier ... he has mules ... he acts as guide if a foreigner wants
    to go up-country ... you will find him outside the station ... with his mules,
    or his cart ... Esteban, the carrier.... You won&rsquo;t forget?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Padre. I won&rsquo;t forget.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You just tell Esteban you want to find Fra Federico Evangelista:
    he will take you&mdash;he always knows where Federico is to be found. It
    will be another horrible journey ... the country is miserable....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And will Fra Federico help me to find...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is a saintly man. He will look after you&mdash;you will find shelter
    in his house. But there, I am staying too long. You have much to do to get
    ready. You must excuse an old man gossiping and taking up your time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He struggled to his feet. It was always a great effort for Fra Martino to
    get out of a comfortable chair. It took a lot of puffing and blowing and
    regaining of balance. On this occasion, as he finally steadied himself on
    his fat, stumpy legs, he found his hands imprisoned in Tim&rsquo;s firm,
    warm grasp.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Padre, I am not going to attempt to thank you....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To thank me, my friend? Whatever for? Fra Federico Evangelista is
    a saintly man, but he is very poor. Your stay with him will be a help, and
    it will cheer him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know. I know all that, and as I say, I am not going to attempt
    to thank you, because there are no words in any human language that would
    express what I feel. I know that the members of your Church think that we
    of the English community are not even Christians, but I can assure you that
    we do believe in God, and that it is from the bottom of my heart that I will
    always pray to Him to bless you and reward you for what you have done to-day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If I have comforted you a little...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A little? Heavens above!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But here am I gossiping again, and I have work to do to-night&mdash;no
    end of work, mine is a big parish.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He was ostensibly looking for his hat and stick, and doing so was snorting
    like a porpoise.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shan&rsquo;t I see you again, Padre?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Alas&mdash;no, my dear Major O&rsquo;Clerigh. To-morrow is a feast
    day, and you know how busy I always am.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I may write to you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Better not&mdash;better not. You see, the authorities must believe
    that you have left the country ... and sometimes in the post letters get
    opened and read by officials who...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps Fra Federico will find a way of letting you know that I have
    arrived.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps. That would be capital, and then...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! I will contrive to let you know if I have succeeded in finding&mdash;shelter,
    eh?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When you are back in Ireland&mdash;yes&mdash;then you can write,
    but...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be most careful, don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then good-bye, my friend. God bless you, and ... you have money?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes! In cash&mdash;a few thousand milreis.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Capital! Capital! And don&rsquo;t forget ... Bomfin ... Esteban ...
    Fra Federico Evangelista.... Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He was gone: and Tim remained for a long while gazing at the door through
    which that quaint, obese old scamp had just passed out of his sight. Old
    scamp? Who would dare call him that after this spontaneous act of unprecedented
    kindness? Of course, Fra Martino was a scamp in a way; his life and morals
    had been none too clean; he was living on the proceeds of an abominable act
    of perjury, and enjoying all the luxuries which it had showered into his
    lap, without a tinge of remorse. By his tacit silence he aided and abetted
    the crime of perjury every day of his life, and with it all was a minister
    of God and preached the gospel of purity and truth to a lot of ignorant peasants,
    who looked upon him as the pattern of all the virtues. But in his heart he
    had kept a feeling of pity for the downtrodden and the shipwrecked: his hand
    was stretched out to help a lame dog over a stile. And pity being akin to
    love, who shall say but that this venal and profligate priest would not find
    a full measure of mercy at the foot of the Throne of Him Who said that the
    greatest of all the virtues is Charity?</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="BookThree"></a>Book Three<br>
  </b><b>The Great Adventure</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20</b></h2>
  <p>It was with very mixed feelings that Tim O&rsquo;Clee set out on this last
    phase of his life&rsquo;s adventure. Somehow he knew that it was going to
    be the last phase. He felt it in his bones and, with a careless laugh, would
    at that time have assured you that those same bones would probably in the
    course of time become one with the dust of the desert.</p>
  <p>He was going into a country absolutely unknown to him&mdash;unknown even
    to most Brazilians. God alone knew what he would find if he ever got there,
    which was more than doubtful. But, heavens above!&mdash;what an adventure!
    And this was the point where his feelings got mixed. He was itching to go,
    certain of success, confident that out there in the wilds he would suddenly
    come nose to nose with Dudley Stone. What he would do with him when he did
    find him was rather more problematical. There was no collaring a man by the
    scruff of the neck and dragging him through a hundred miles of arid, waterless
    country. Dudley Stone&mdash;such as he was, such as he had become out there&mdash;would
    have to be a consenting party to Tim&rsquo;s desire to prove him still alive.</p>
  <p>And Tim O&rsquo;Clee began to think of himself as a kind of male Alice going
    down a well into Wonderland; and when he embarked on the coasting steamer
    which plied between Monsataz and Pernambuco he quite thought that the crew
    and his fellow passengers might suddenly turn into a large mad tea-party
    over which he, as the maddest of them all, would naturally preside. The authorities,
    though firm, had been quite kind. His passport and papers were handed back
    to him as he stepped on board, and so farewell to Monsataz and all the preliminary
    excitements it stood for.</p>
  <p>Tim thought over the events of the past two months with a grim smile. He
    had not done badly so far as adventures were concerned. Teresa, Dom Mano&euml;l,
    the murdered doctor, even Fra Martino, had proved to him that even the twentieth
    century could provide exciting adventures that vied successfully with those
    invented by the fertile brain of Jules Verne, or old Dumas.</p>
  <p>According to plan, and carrying his gun and a small suitcase, Tim went ashore
    at San Christovao. He duly missed the boat, where apparently and fortunately
    nobody missed him, and found his way to the station. Here he had to wait
    four hours for the first train that would take him up-country.</p>
  <p>A ten hours&rsquo; journey by rail&mdash;over the miseries and discomforts
    of which he never afterwards cared to dwell&mdash;and, finally, Bomfin, where
    he had no difficulty in finding Esteban the carrier; a well-known figure,
    Esteban, owner of two pack-mules and a couple of horses, the man who was
    the intermediary between the fringe of the desert and this outpost of civilization.
    (Bomfin was not much more than that, and civilization a mere comparative
    term.) And Esteban knew Fra Federico Evangelista, and he contracted for the
    modest sum of ten milreis to convey the crazy Englishman to Cumbe, where
    Fra Federico had a house.</p>
  <p>And ever since then, these two, Tim O&rsquo;Clee and Esteban, had jogged
    along on the hard-baked sandy track which marked the initial stage of their
    journey. Three days! They seemed like three years to Tim. They had eaten
    their provisions by the road-side; at night they had pitched their tent in
    the centre of the most convenient village they came across; and morning and
    evening they had ambled along, and at midday had taken their <i>siesta</i> wherever
    a clump of thick thorny palms gave them the necessary shade.</p>
  <p>One hundred kilometres, it seems, lay between the railhead and the village
    of Cumbe, where Fra Federico Evangelista had his dwelling-house. The road
    was a mere cattle-track, baked dry by the sun, rough and stony; at times
    it was non-existent save to the experienced eyes of Esteban. This was October
    and the nights were chilly, while the days were beginning to be insufferably
    hot. The water they found on the way was tepid and brackish; the approaches
    to it trodden into a sea of mud by the cattle brought hither by the <i>vaqueiros</i> for
    drink.</p>
  <p>Of human habitations there were only a few; a village here and there, bare,
    sandy; a few houses, little better than huts; women, gaunt-looking and dark-skinned;
    a few naked children all staring, as the mules and the horses, Tim and Esteban,
    ambled by. There were never any men to be seen in the villages; they were
    all out in the scrub looking after the cattle. A smell of coffee and of peat
    pervaded the atmosphere around the villages; clouds of dust obliterated the
    distance. Desolation, indescribable desolation, seemed to Tim the very keynote
    of this desert land.</p>
  <p>But in spite of this utter loneliness, perhaps because of it, Tim&rsquo;s
    spirits rose higher and higher as he followed his guide up the mountain trail;
    more and more did he become convinced that Fra Martino had not spoken mere
    idle words nor sent him on a fool&rsquo;s errand to this dreary land. Fra
    Martino knew something of the secrets of the desert, and knew it in connection
    with Dudley Stone.</p>
  <p>And, as weary even beyond definite sensation, saddle-sore, and eyes aching
    with the perpetual glare, Tim&rsquo;s gaze wandered across the thorny scrub
    and stunted palms to the elusive distance forever hidden behind a cloud of
    dust, his fancy peopled the dreary Sertao with a weird and fantastic multitude.
    The <i>vaqueiros</i> and <i>jagun&ccedil;os</i>, of which the patrons of
    the caf&eacute; Bom Genio were wont to talk almost with bated breath, seemed
    to have come to life now beneath the magic wand of this utter solitude; and
    with his mind&rsquo;s eye Tim saw them, centaur-like creatures at one with
    their horses, dressed in their panoply of leather, their only protection
    against the cruel thorny vegetation.</p>
  <p>They all seemed real to Tim now, as did their dead prophet, Antonio Conselheiro,
    with the flowing locks and the sandalled feet, preaching the Second Advent
    of the Lord and the coming Day of Judgment, whilst his centaurs rode before
    him, wielding their lassoes and iron-shod goads, like beings from that far-off
    region where the Valkyries ride and where Titans and demi-gods hold sway.</p>
  <p>The farther Tim plunged into the solitude, the farther he left behind him
    civilization and modern thought, the more real did those legend-like tales
    appear. The prophet! Why not? A kind of super-revivalist, with only the minds
    of ignorant, primitive people in which to kindle a semi-religious, semi-political
    fanaticism! Why not, indeed? Here, in this wilderness, miles away from the
    nearest outpost of civilization, with mile upon mile of desolate country
    entirely unknown to nine-tenths of the inhabitants of the very province in
    which it is situated: here, anything might happen&mdash;the most fantastic
    events at once appeared not only possible, but natural.</p>
  <p>And now the Great Unknown, with his alternate claim of resurrected prophet
    or heir to the throne of Brazil, highway-robber and cattle-thief&mdash;what
    had seemed beyond the bounds of credibility over in Monsataz was quite feasible
    in this mountain-girt desert. Civilization here was put back several centuries.
    Tim felt that he was back in the days of the robber-barons, who raided their
    neighbours&rsquo;  castles, stole their cattle, and successfully defied king
    and government. And what more likely than that an adventurer like Dudley
    Stone should elect to link his fortune with this mysterious Brazilian, half-breed
    or whatever else he might be?</p>
  <p>Tim tried to get as much information as he could out of Esteban, but the
    carrier was one of those unimaginative creatures, rare enough in this part
    of the world, who know nothing except what goes on under their very noses.
    The Great Unknown? Yes! he would say, the resurrected prophet who was the
    grandson of Dom Pedro, late Emperor of Brazil. Yes! he was going to overthrow
    the present Government and place himself upon the throne of his forebears.
    How this was going to be done, Esteban had only the vaguest notion. The Great
    Unknown had a huge army, all armed to the teeth, that much he did know; and,
    also, that in the surrounding district what was left of the inhabitants of
    the villages and so on, had over and over again petitioned the provincial
    Government to protect them against the depredations of this army of robbers.
    The Government did on two or three occasions send troops out to restore order,
    but every time these expeditions failed lamentably: the troops were decimated,
    hundreds of men perished, and the prestige as well as the impudence of the
    Great Unknown grew to immense proportions. Cattle ranches were constantly
    raided, live-stock driven wholesale, and the hides shamelessly sold to the
    foreign traders who bought them cheap and asked no questions. On the other
    side of the Sertao, where lay the diamond mines, matters were even worse:
    whole villages had been laid to the dust, mine-owners been massacred or driven
    away. Esteban had it for a fact that practically all the diamond mines west
    of the Sertao had been acquired by force by the Great Unknown: that he owned
    gold mines and ruby mines, and all the land where had lain buried for centuries
    the treasures of the Incas of Peru.</p>
  <p>Allowing for exaggeration, and the timidity of the narrator, the whole story
    was not unlikely&mdash;at least it no longer seemed so to Tim; and undoubtedly
    the whole affair&mdash;robbery, pillage, untold wealth, Great Unknown, and
    all the rest of the bag of tricks&mdash;was just what would appeal to the
    greedy and adventurous spirit of Dudley Stone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21</b></h2>
  <p>Three days of this terribly wearisome climb to the arid upland and then
    on the fourth day, in the late afternoon, Esteban turned in his saddle and
    pointed northward.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Cumbe,&rsquo; he announced laconically.</p>
  <p>Had he pointed to a new Garden of Eden, Tim could not have been more elated.
    Nor was he disappointed when he came in sight of the village, for it was
    neither better nor worse than those through which he had passed before; a
    couple of dismal-looking streets, lined with squalid huts, leading up to
    the usual kind of market-place, deserted just now, but which perhaps on certain
    days in the year might look lively enough&mdash;and that was all. On one
    side of the square was the inevitable  &lsquo;Commandacia,&rsquo; with the
    Republican flag hanging limp and caked with dust on its post; opposite to
    the Commandacia a stuccoed building, which had once been painted but from
    which most of the plaster had long since fallen away; the presence of a bell
    surmounting the sloping roof, and of a large wooden cross on the wall beside
    a door that hung loosely on its hinges, suggested that this broken-down building
    might possibly be a church. Immediately by the side of it there was a square
    hut, with a kind of wooden veranda in front of it, to which a couple of broken
    steps gave access.</p>
  <p>To this Esteban pointed and said in his usual laconic way: &lsquo;Fra Federico
    Evangelista&rsquo;s house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Over the whole place there hung at this hour a thick cloud of dust. A few
    stunted palms grew in a clump round the priest&rsquo;s house; another group
    flanked the tumble-down little church. The smell of peat and coffee was very
    pronounced. But none of these unpleasant aspects affected Tim&rsquo;s spirits
    in the least. Weary beyond expression, stiff and saddle-sore, his throat
    dry as a lime-kiln, his eyes smarting with the heat and the dust, his skin
    sore with stings of innumerable insects and flies&mdash;nevertheless he forgot
    all his troubles at sight of that miserable hovel to which Esteban had just
    pointed.</p>
  <p>Though the village had appeared deserted when they approached, it soon became
    alive with a crowd of dark-skinned women and children, who crowded round
    the strangers in silent wonder. The women, wrapped in blankets, all appeared
    to have reached the age of Methuselah, their coffee-coloured skins looked
    like old parchment; the children, large-eyed and pot-bellied, gazed open-mouthed,
    clinging to their mothers. As in all the other villages, there were no men
    to be seen.</p>
  <p>Esteban, seemingly, was well known in Cumbe. Several among the crowd of
    women greeted him with a dismal show of welcome. The first disappointment
    came when he asked whether Fra Federico was at home, and was told that his
    Reverence had been at Cumbe a week or so ago, but had gone on to some other
    village since then and would not be back for some time.</p>
  <p>Esteban turned inquiringly to Tim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What will you do, senhor?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;There is no one
    in the house when his Reverence is away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This sounded cheerful and comforting. Tim, with true Irish light-heartedness,
    could not help laughing at what seemed an impossible situation. To have travelled
    three hundred kilometres by rail, and one hundred on horseback, only to find
    that the man whom he had come all this way to seek was from home and would
    not be back for days, was an eventuality that would have seemed absolutely
    tragic did it not savour of the ridiculous.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anywhere I can get a bed?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, senhor. The store.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The store occupied the main portion of that side of the square which was
    opposite the church. It was a low stuccoed house, which had once been painted
    yellow, and had a red roof set askew upon it. Apparently it served the double
    purpose of village store and drinking-bar, with the possibility of a bed
    for a stranger thrown in. Esteban, the carrier, had brought some goods over
    on his pack-mule for the store-keeper of Cumbe. Taking Tim&rsquo;s acquiescence
    for granted, he now led the four beasts across the square, leaving Tim to
    come along or not, as he chose. The crowd of dark-skinned lookers-on did
    not attempt to move: they remained standing where they were, following with
    large, dark, melancholy eyes the movements of the carrier as he brought the
    animals to a halt outside the store and tethered them to the hitching-posts.
    Not a sign of life came from inside the building. Through the iron-grated
    windows Tim caught sight of various unsavoury-looking provisions hanging
    on strings, and as he neared the door the usual atmosphere of coffee and
    peat was supplemented by other scents, just as strong but far less pleasing.</p>
  <p>The door stood invitingly open. Tim allowed Esteban to precede him, and
    in his wake entered the low-raftered room. Only a dim afternoon light found
    its way through the grated windows, and Tim&rsquo;s eyes took some time in
    focusing the interior of the room. Stretched out upon his back on a rough-hewn
    bench a man was snoring loudly. Esteban&rsquo;s peremptory voice woke him
    from his slumbers, and he turned a lazy head in the direction of the intruders.
    At sight of them he blinked his eyes as if unwilling to trust in the reality
    of what he saw. Esteban he knew well enough, but the other one&mdash;the
    stranger! How often in a year did he, Filippo Vanzea, owner of the one and
    only store of Cumbe, see a stranger? And how many years was it since he had
    seen one so fine and clean as this one?</p>
  <p>He struggled to his feet with alacrity. Already the carrier, conscious of
    added importance as the guide, philosopher and friend of this wonderful stranger,
    had, in a lordly manner, demanded supper and beds for himself and the noble
    senhor whom he had escorted hither.</p>
  <p>As far as his own recollections of that evening were concerned, Timothy
    O&rsquo;Clerigh could not have written a book about them&mdash;not even a
    single chapter. All that he could have told you about it subsequently was
    that he ate what was put before him, and drank a good deal of white rum and
    black coffee. After sunset the men came back to the village, in straggling
    groups of twos and threes. Later on, some of them drifted to the store and
    sat round the bar, sipping rum and coffee, and smoking their long-stemmed
    pipes: all in absolute silence. Some of the men played cards, or dominoes,
    others looked on, but not one of them spoke more than three or four words
    on end. Nor did they take much notice of Tim. He was for them some kind of
    foreign trader who had drifted out here in order to purchase stolen hides.
    They certainly did not enter into conversation with him, but responded politely,
    if always laconically, to his greeting.</p>
  <p>Tim asked no questions. He saw at once that they would have been useless
    and would remain unanswered; also, he was too utterly weary to think coherently
    of anything. The men he only saw dimly: they seemed like the dream creatures
    whom in his mind he had seen peopling the thorny desert. How he ultimately
    got to bed he couldn&rsquo;t have told you, nor whether the bed in which
    he presently went to sleep was hard or downy, or even clean. But with only
    the third of a century behind one, what matter the bed, when dreams not altogether
    unpleasant haunt the watches of the night!</p>
  <p>Timothy dreamed that he wandered through the rocky fastnesses of the Sertao,
    and that in a deep defile he came face to face with Dudley Stone. Though
    he had never seen the man, he knew in his dream that this was Dudley Stone
    right enough. And somehow or other the scene in his dream immediately changed,
    and he was back in Old Ireland, in the old house which overlooked the lake,
    and he was lord of the house and of all the land around: and a dim figure,
    whom he could not clearly see, was pouring out tea for him from the old Irish
    silver teapot.</p>
  <p>And Hold-Hands Juliana, in cap and apron, was scrubbing the floor of the
    hall.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22</b></h2>
  <p>And the next morning Tim said to Esteban: &lsquo;Esteban, my friend, this
    is not the end of our journey. You&rsquo;ve got to take me on to Canudos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon the carrier, who at the moment was engaged in doing nothing at
    all over a cup of black coffee and a long-stemmed pipe, said with firm emphasis:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To Canudos? No, senhor, I do not take you to Canudos. Not I.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because, senhor&mdash;because no one goes to Canudos who values his
    life or his purse.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I value both, my friend; but I&rsquo;m going to Canudos, all the
    same.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you will have to go alone, senhor Inglez, for I will not take
    you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Esteban, by way of emphasizing the finality of his decision, knocked
    the ashes out of his pipe, finished his coffee and rose from the small trestle-table
    at which he had been partaking of his frugal breakfast.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I stay here a day,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to rest the mules; then
    I go to Joazeiro. You said you would like to buy the horse.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I will buy the horse and one of your mules,&rsquo; Tim said, &lsquo;and
    you can rest the other two beasts, and presently you can go to any other
    God-forsaken place you choose. But to-morrow you are going with me to Canudos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Esteban shook his head vigorously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not I, senhor; ask someone else.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather go with you, for I know you are honest. And you
    are coming with me because when we&rsquo;ve reached Canudos I will give you
    one hundred milreis.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not for five hundred.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;With one hundred milreis,&rsquo; Tim insisted, &lsquo;you can purchase
    a couple more mules and another horse; with four mules and two horses you
    can do twice the business you are doing at the moment; then, presently, instead
    of carrying a few cheap goods backwards and forwards to these out-of-the-way
    villages, you could set up for yourself in one of the big towns&mdash;Bahia,
    perhaps, eh? You would soon become a rich man, Esteban. All you&rsquo;ve
    got to do is to take me to-morrow to Canudos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Gradually, while Tim unfolded these rosy prospects, the look of obstinacy
    began to fade from Esteban&rsquo;s face. He was wavering. Greed, or perhaps
    the thought of a little chocolate-coloured family over in Bomfin, had already
    shaken the firm determination of a while ago.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But it isn&rsquo;t safe, senhor,&rsquo; he argued; &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t
    safe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Strangers are not made welcome in Canudos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take my chance of that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you can take it, senhor&mdash;alone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One hundred milreis, Esteban,&rsquo; Tim urged.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are one hundred milreis to a dead man?&rsquo; Esteban retorted.
    He remained silent for a little while after that&mdash;pondering apparently.
    One hundred milreis might be no good to a dead man, but they would be mighty
    acceptable to a poor one.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, senhor,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;Canudos is a hundred
    kilometres from here. I will take you along the trail to within twenty kilometres
    of it. We shall be on the height and you will look down on the city in the
    valley. If you want to go farther than that, you will do it at your risk
    and peril of your life, but you couldn&rsquo;t lose your way after that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good man!&rsquo; was Tim&rsquo;s only comment, and he gave the carrier
    a vigorous clap in the middle of the back, which sent poor Esteban coughing
    and spluttering across the veranda floor.</p>
  <p>Filippo Vanzea now appeared in the doorway of the bar. He was wielding a
    toothpick with much energy and sucking his teeth audibly.</p>
  <p>Esteban, who had picked himself up and shaken himself free of dust, like
    a frowsy old dog, turned to him and said: &lsquo;Did you hear, Filippo?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Filippo had heard every word: thought the stranger a complete fool&mdash;a
    crazy Englishman&mdash;but it seems would have thought Esteban a greater
    fool if he had refused the hundred milreis. He also had an eye to business,
    had Filippo Vanzea, and promptly fell to discussing with the carrier what
    provisions the store should supply for the expedition.</p>
  <p>Tim no longer listened: as he was going to have his way, he didn&rsquo;t
    care what arrangements Esteban chose to make. &lsquo;We start as soon as
    the heat of the day has gone,&rsquo; he announced.</p>
  <p>And Esteban gave a final shrug, as much as to say: &lsquo;Well! if you like
    to go and get massacred it&rsquo;s no longer my affair.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And suddenly while the two men were talking with unusual volubility&mdash;for
    they are silent men, these Sertanejos&mdash;they let fall a name which caused
    Tim to prick up his ears.</p>
  <p>Something was said about the supply of dried meat for the expedition, and
    Vanzea said: &lsquo;I have a good stock in hand. I bought some about five
    weeks ago from the Madre de Dios ranch.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; Esteban remarked, &lsquo;has the Senhor da Lisbao been
    up here lately?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I saw him, as I say, about five weeks ago, when I went down to the
    ranch for some goods I wanted.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim turned abruptly to the men.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you,&rsquo; he asked, &lsquo;by any chance speaking of Dom Mano&euml;l
    da Lisbao?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, yes, senhor,&rsquo; one of them said. And Esteban at once added: &lsquo;Now,
    if you happen to know the Senhor da Lisbao...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, what good would that do me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All the good in the world. He is hand in glove with the Great Unknown
    and...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It was Esteban who had spoken. But he suddenly paused, the sentence remained
    unfinished, and the man&rsquo;s face was distorted with a quick spasm of
    physical pain. What had happened was that Filippo Vanzea had suddenly given
    his friend a violent punch in the ribs. Tim saw it, and noted that Esteban
    did not pursue the subject but went off at a tangent, talking once more of
    provisions for the journey.</p>
  <p>All of which gave Tim O&rsquo;Clee furiously to think. Being a native of
    Ireland he had a ready faculty for jumping to conclusions&mdash;not always
    at the right ones, although his intuition did not often lead him astray.
    In this case, it was not difficult to put two and two together. Mano&euml;l
    da Lisbao, with the huge fortune mysteriously acquired, who owned a ranch
    in the immediate vicinity of the stronghold of the Great Unknown, could be
    no other than the middleman, the trader who bought from the resurrected prophet
    and his robbers the loot which he afterwards re-sold at an immense profit.
    Surely this was the key to the whole enigma. It also explained Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s
    attitude with regard to Dudley Stone&mdash;Dudley Stone, his partner and
    his tool&mdash;now probably the agent or emissary of the Great Unknown, sworn
    to as dead, erased off the face of the earth in order to evade any inquiries
    about him that might at the time have been set on foot. Tim felt that he
    held the key of the enigma at last, and his excitement gave itself vent in
    snatches of song from his limited repertoire. In a thunderous baritone, entirely
    out of tune, he sang:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come, rest in this boo-zum...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The two men listened open-mouthed, deeply impressed. A crowd of small dark-skinned
    picaninnies, their little pot-bellies draped in rough shirts of brilliant
    hue, came running out of the huts and stood gaping at this amazing phenomenon
    of Nature which emitted sounds such as they had never heard before. And the
    women, already busy with their cooking-pots, gazed with dark, melancholy
    eyes on this curious product from the great world outside, of which they
    had only vaguely heard.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23</b></h2>
  <p>They did not start the same afternoon, but on the following morning at early
    dawn. And once more they ambled up the mountain trail, Tim and Esteban, the
    two horses and the two mules. They carried provisions of water and food for
    man and beast for six days, and Tim had been duly rigged out at the store
    in the panoply of leather, which, with the tan on his face, made him as like
    a <i>vaqueiro</i> as made no matter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You leave me in sight of Canudos,&rsquo; he had said to the guide. &lsquo;After
    that I shall need nothing more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But on the way back, senhor...&rsquo; Esteban urged.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Great Unknown shall pack a hamper for me&mdash;a Christmas hamper,
    it shall be, my friend, with all the best that he himself feasts on....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But Esteban shook his head dolefully. He had taken a fancy to the crazy
    Englishman and was quite convinced that he would never see him alive again.</p>
  <p>All day horses and mules plodded on with hot sand up to their knees. Two
    nights they bivouacked in the scrub: they were icy cold; against that the
    days were baking hot, rendering a halt at noontide imperative. Pasture, such
    as it was, became more scarce as they neared the upland; fortunately, it
    was still moderately early in the season and the water-holes were not yet
    dry. There were very few habitations along the trail, or indeed within sight;
    those they did come across were deserted. Tim remarked on this, and Esteban,
    with his habitual shrug of indifference, said laconically: &lsquo;All gone
    to join the army of the Great Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The army of brigands, you mean,&rsquo; Tim retorted.</p>
  <p>But at this Esteban&rsquo;s face seemed to close up as with a snap. The
    nearer he came to the kingdom of the Great Unknown the more taciturn did
    he become. At one time, when Tim pressed him with questions, he turned quite
    nasty in his fright and threatened to leave the crazy Englishman to his fate
    then and there, as he himself had no cause for quarrel with the prophet and
    had no desire to molest him.</p>
  <p>After that brief but harrowing episode, there was nothing left for Tim but
    to possess his soul in patience and, above all, to hold his tongue on the
    one subject which absorbed all his thoughts. As Esteban did not offer any
    other subject, conversation necessarily flagged.</p>
  <p>After the second night, they had still some thirty or forty kilometres ahead
    of them.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are sure of the way, Esteban?&rsquo; Tim asked his guide.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know every inch of it, senhor,&rsquo; Esteban replied.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You come here sometimes, then?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have bought&mdash;various things from the <i>vaqueiros</i>&mdash;I
    sell them to the stores in the villages....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It was Tim&rsquo;s turn to shrug. Everyone apparently bought the loot from
    the army of brigands, and no one wished to molest them or to ask questions.
    Obviously it paid best to be friends with the robber-chief and his hordes.</p>
  <p>The trail now became very stony in places, and at times it was safer to
    walk and lead one&rsquo;s horse than to ride. There were several patches
    of forest land to traverse: of meagre palms, thorny bushes and thick undergrowth,
    where the path was narrow, and in one or two places the two wayfarers were
    obliged to set to and hack and cut and beat down the scrub in order to enable
    the beasts to get through.</p>
  <p>Tim, who at one time had the idea that he could find his way to Canudos
    without a guide, was thankful that Esteban had relented and decided to come
    with him, for this part of the journey presented difficulties with which
    no one unacquainted with the desert could have grappled successfully. The
    trail itself almost disappeared at times in the intricate defiles around
    the foot-hills: at others it was crossed and re-crossed again by cattle-tracks,
    so that the inexperienced eye could easily have lost the right direction.</p>
  <p>It was obvious that Esteban&rsquo;s eye was not inexperienced, for presently
    they came out into the open once more and, pointing to the high table-land
    on ahead, he said, with an attempt at cheerfulness: &lsquo;Nearly there now,
    senhor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This last stage of the journey was very trying, for the water-holes on the
    upland had become few and far between, and Esteban was unwilling to encroach
    too far on the water supply which he had brought along, as he wanted it,
    he said, for the journey home. Also, the vegetation became more and more
    scrubby and stunted, and there was little, if any, shade against the sun,
    whilst the sun-baked dust under foot was like a welter of hot ashes, through
    which they and their beasts plodded wearily.</p>
  <p>But, as a matter of fact, of all these discomforts and all the minor annoyances
    of flies and insects and prickly thorns Tim was hardly conscious. In his
    own mind he was riding towards the conquest of the patrimony that had been
    filched from him, and the final undoing of the thieves and liars who had
    done the nefarious deed.</p>
  <p>In the late afternoon of the third day they reached the summit of the table-land.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is as far as I can take you, senhor,&rsquo; Esteban said, as
    he made preparations for bivouacking for the night. &lsquo;Canudos lies the
    other side of that mountain yonder. I will put you on the right path, which
    winds round the foot of it; when you are the other side, you will see Canudos
    in front of you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The mountain yonder,&rsquo; to which he pointed, appeared strangely
    menacing. It seemed like a gigantic fortification guarding the approach to
    the mysterious city, with battlements and towers carved in the rock by Titanic
    hands.</p>
  <p>To Tim it was the land of mystery&mdash;the land of promise. In his folly
    he had thought at one time that he held the key to the enigma which those
    arid mountains kept wrapped in their stony bosoms. Folly, of course! Now
    that from the table-land he looked across that barren valley, with the yellowish
    ribbons of the two streams meandering through the dun-coloured earth, he
    felt a sinking of the heart, a presentiment of something abnormal, strange,
    monstrous even, perhaps&mdash;yet not altogether evil&mdash;which would happen
    to him over there in the city of the Great Unknown.</p>
  <p>When, guided by Esteban around the foot of the mountains he did at last
    obtain the first glimpse of the mysterious city, he could have laughed at
    these presentiments. What he saw was not calculated to strike awe into any
    Irish heart. Was that the land of rapacious brigands, the stronghold of strange
    and enigmatic personalities, the city wherein dwelt a mystic Cabalist whose
    sway over the multitudes was akin to that of a prophet? That agglomeration
    of mud huts and stony dwellings, all of a dull brown hue&mdash;the huts brown,
    the vegetation brown, the earth brown, and the dust&mdash;oh! the dust!&mdash;which
    made even the horizon appear brown?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t the senhor Inglez come back with me?&rsquo; Esteban murmured
    in a kind of hoarse whisper. Apparently that brown mass of teeming life tucked
    away in the midst of this arid desert filled the worthy guide with a kind
    of religious awe.</p>
  <p>Tim couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Believe
    me, my good friend, there is nothing very fearsome about those mud huts over
    there. The only evil thing about the whole place is this abominable climate.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah! the climate?&rsquo; said Esteban with a sigh. &lsquo;Yes! Terrible!
    The cold! And the heat! Only the natives can endure it. Come back with me,
    senhor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Away with you, you old croaker!&rsquo; Tim cried; and, breaking into
    song, he helped Esteban to transfer a few special necessities from the one
    mule to his own pack. &lsquo;You will see me back at Cumbe before very long.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;God and the Virgin grant it, senhor,&rsquo; was Esteban&rsquo;s final
    comment, as he dolefully shook his head, before he finally took leave of
    this mad foreigner. Even the hundred milreis which Tim now thrust into his
    hand failed to bring a smile to his furrowed face.</p>
  <p>Then he turned his own beasts and started ambling along on the dusty road
    back the way he had come.</p>
  <p>Tim did not watch him go. His eyes were fixed on the dun-coloured horizon,
    on the barren mountains that guarded this land of mystery, still a dozen
    miles or more away; already in the east the sun with swift darts of gold
    had overcome the dawn, whilst in the west the night still lingered secure
    in rocky fastnesses. In a moment now the brown molecules of dust turned to
    myriads and myriads of glittering atoms; a cloud of vaporous gems, veiling
    the life that teemed below. And all around&mdash;an ocean of mountains and
    rocks, of dull earth and sparse vegetation, and the mud huts and stone buildings
    that clustered around and atop of the table-land which was Canudos.</p>
  <p>Tim threw out his arms with a gesture of passionate longing for success.
    Through almost incredible adventures he had come thus far, almost unscathed.
    The scene of the last phase lay there behind those clouds of dust; the man
    who could be the means of restoring to him what he held dearer than anything
    on earth, lived, breathed, toiled, robbed and pillaged on this desert land.
    And Tim was here now to wrest that man&rsquo;s secret from him, to force
    him back into civilization and drag the truth out of him, even if life was
    to be the forfeit in the end.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24</b></h2>
  <p>The track, such as it was, wound in and out and round about the undulating
    rocky ground; anon it plunged abruptly into a thicket of scrub and dwarf
    palms and thorny aloes. Waterholes, as Esteban had indicated, became very
    scarce, and as far as Tim could judge he would have some twelve miles or
    so to get over before he came to the outskirts of the desert town. Of these
    twelve miles, at least five would be through the forest into which he now
    plunged, after recommending his soul to God, for he was indeed beginning
    to wonder if Esteban had not been right after all when he said that no one
    but a madman would venture alone within the precincts of the mysterious city.</p>
  <p>The trail which led through the forest was easy enough to follow, for cattle
    had trodden down the scrub, and signs of the passage of men and beasts were
    apparent all along the track. Tim had dismounted and led his horse, whilst
    the mule ambled along in the rear. He walked as fast as the roughness of
    the ground would allow, treading rock or hard-baked earth, up or down the
    incline, with weary, aching feet.</p>
  <p>His thoughts went roaming back to Old Ireland and stately Traskmoore, to
    Uncle Justin, that prince of sportsmen. What would he think of Tim now and
    this wild adventure, the end of which was still on the knees of the gods?
    From roving thoughts his brain switched off to day-dreams, and thence to
    a state of semi-consciousness, akin to sleep, peculiar to tired humans when
    wandering through the hot, damp atmosphere of the tropics.</p>
  <p>And Tim dreamed on until sudden contact with a prickly thorn-bush dragged
    him with a rude shock out of his meditations. He looked about him, surprised
    to see how the trail had widened, until some distance on ahead it finally
    curved out into a broad plateau, stony and scrubby as the rest of the landscape
    and hedged in at its farther boundary by bush, seemingly more impenetrable
    than any that Tim had traversed as yet.</p>
  <p>Hallo! Tim had advanced up the incline, confident now that on the plateau
    he would find one of the brackish lakes, or at any rate a water-hole, where
    his poor patient beasts could get a drink and a rest in the shade, when suddenly
    he saw at the farther limit of the plateau a herd of cattle, lean and wide-eyed,
    massed together around a pool of water, too muddy to mirror the deep blue
    of the sky.</p>
  <p>As Tim drew nearer, the beasts ceased drinking one by one, and looked up&mdash;more
    scared than savage&mdash;at the intruder. A kind of human Robot on horseback,
    a creature apparently made up of steel and leather&mdash;the usual panoply
    of the <i>vaqueiros</i>&mdash;appeared to be in charge. For the moment, he
    turned leisurely round in his curved saddle and gave Tim a careless glance.
    There was nothing threatening or even challenging in the glance, but a stranger
    being a rare sight in these parts, the <i>vaqueiro</i> did look twice at
    this one. The next minute, however, something&mdash;anything&mdash;scared
    his beasts; there was a sudden whirling of dry mud and stones, a padding
    of cloven hoofs, a snorting like that of a dozen engines letting off steam,
    a quick shout from the <i>vaqueiro</i>, a stampede&mdash;and in less than
    three minutes herd and <i>vaqueiro</i> disappeared as if the bush had swallowed
    them up.</p>
  <p>And Tim remained standing there, vaguely listening to the multitudinous
    sounds as they gradually faded away. The whole scene had appeared and then
    flitted away so quickly that he could scarcely believe that he had actually
    seen those lean, wide-eyed, frightened creatures and the Robot-like, leather-clad
    centaur, whose shouts had now turned to a quaint, soothing, melancholy song,
    which grew fainter and fainter&mdash;more and more like the murmur of wind
    through leaf-laden trees&mdash;and then died away altogether.</p>
  <p>And when the last of the murmur became softer than the whispering of ghosts,
    a strange, unaccountable silence descended on this corner of the wilderness.
    Silence, and a kind of expectant hush, with the distant, unknown city, screened
    from view by the bush, and all sounds stilled of that human life which must
    be teeming over there round the stronghold of the mysterious robber-king.
    The heat had become intense, but Tim was hardly conscious of that. His shirt
    clung to his chest and his back, and, at first, the sight of that brackish
    water had given him a longing for its embrace. But even that longing seemed
    to die away with the <i>vaqueiro&rsquo;s</i> song, and all that he was conscious
    of was just the immensity of the desert and of its absolute stillness.</p>
  <p>His eyes remained fixed upon the distant thicket: there, where far away
    a quivering of thorny branches, receding now farther and even farther, betrayed
    the pathway of moving cattle. At last, even that quivering ceased. Nothing
    stirred. No sound of bird or beast broke this Infinity of Silence.</p>
  <p>And suddenly, as Tim gazed out into the blue horizon far away, there rose
    in the distant haze a palace of cool white marble, with slender colonnades
    and wide terraces, mirrored in a lake that was crystal clear. He could not
    take his eyes off that fairy vision, although he knew it to be but a mirage:
    he had never seen such an exquisite one before. Coming on the top of that
    vivid picture of frightened cattle, on the top of that snorting and stampeding,
    this picture of clear water and cool marble was to him like the beauty of
    peace after the roar of strife.</p>
  <p>And while he gazed on this unreal vision he forgot all about his aims and
    his quest, about Dudley Stone and Hold-Hands Juliana: they no longer seemed
    real to him. Indeed, he did not seem real even to himself: so much so, that
    when presently he saw something exquisite, something that was both enchanting
    and bewildering, moving along his line of vision, he thought that this was
    just another manifestation of his dream state.</p>
  <p>The mirage had faded from the sky: the table-land lay arid and sun-baked.
    On one side a tallish clump of thorny palms, with pallid flowers drooping
    in the heat, threw a sheet of densely purple shadow upon the reddish earth.
    And out of this shadow a slender girlish figure moved towards Tim O&rsquo;Clee.
    Hair in colour like burnished copper framed a small oval face out of which
    shone a pair of dark, mystery-filled eyes. Some sort of dress, of a russet
    tint, fell straight and rather stiff from the slim shoulders, screening the
    figure and the limbs: feet and legs were encased in leather, only the hands
    were bare. On one of them a kind of leather cap hung by a strap. But of all
    this Tim was not, at first, aware. He only saw what he thought was the most
    beautiful woman he had ever seen in all his life, with a face like mellow
    ivory, and lips, full and cherry-red, parted in a smile. No wonder he did
    not think that she was real, but only a vision come to him in a dream.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Were you frightened?&rsquo; spoke the vision in Portuguese. And then
    the cherry-red mouth widened into a laugh. &lsquo;I think you are frightened
    now,&rsquo; were the words that accompanied the laugh, which to Tim&rsquo;s
    ears sounded like the tinkling of a silver bell.</p>
  <p>He had not moved. The sun was scorching his shoulders, his back, his chest,
    and now, with the instinct born in courteous Old Ireland, he raised his hand
    and took off his hat. The vision had come to a halt in the purple shadow
    of the scrub and stood there, with one arm gently swinging the leather cap
    to and fro.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Put your hat on again, quick&mdash;or you&rsquo;ll get a sunstroke.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim would not have cared if he had got a sunstroke, but, nevertheless, he
    obeyed and put his hat on again. So far he had not spoken one word. The vision
    had carried on the conversation entirely on her own.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come along here. It is nice and cool in the shade.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And again Tim obeyed like an automaton.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You understand what I say?&rsquo; the vision went on. &lsquo;Then
    why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I don&rsquo;t believe that you are real, and I am afraid
    that, now I have spoken, you will vanish like a sprite.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim said this in English, chiefly because he did not want the sprite to
    understand: as perhaps in that case she would not vanish away.</p>
  <p>But seemingly, and most amazingly, the sprite did understand, for the great
    mysterious eyes opened very wide and the cherry-red lips murmured: &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;&mdash;and
    then went on at once&mdash;&lsquo;so you are English?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very nearly,&rsquo; Tim stammered, &lsquo;that is ... no, I&rsquo;m
    not ... I&rsquo;m Irish&mdash;if you know what that means.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The sprite did know, for she nodded sagely and smiled. Smiles were never
    long absent from that cherry-red mouth. Then suddenly they emitted a peremptory
    command:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come and sit down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was a large flat stone close by: it was covered with parched moss
    and well screened from the sun. The vision sat down and beckoned to Tim to
    sit beside her. It certainly was moderately cool in the shade. Tim removed
    his hat and threw it on the ground. He had suddenly realized two great facts:
    one was that he was tired, footsore, dirty and unkempt; and the second, that
    he was no longer dreaming, and that a beautiful woman&mdash;and a real woman
    at that&mdash;was sitting within a few yards of him and actually commanding
    him to sit beside her. Now Tim O&rsquo;Clee had never been shy of a woman
    before. He would have thought his beloved Ireland disgraced were he tongue-tied
    when a beautiful woman was by, but even his hot-blooded Celtic ancestors
    would, I think, have forgiven him his clumsy shyness on this occasion. The
    situation was, to say the least, distinctly novel. How could any man, even
    an Irishman, be expected to fall into casual conversation with this exquisite
    being who had descended upon him from heaven knew where, and who looked about
    as incongruous in this inhospitable land as a bird of paradise would in a
    London slum?</p>
  <p>And suddenly she spoke again. Said she: &lsquo;My name is Marivosa da Gloria.
    What is yours?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim couldn&rsquo;t recollect for the moment what his name was, so he said:  &lsquo;Marivosa
    da Gloria! What a perfectly ripping name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But she insisted: &lsquo;What is yours?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Timothy,&rsquo; he contrived to reply. &lsquo;Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Timothy? Timothy? What a funny name!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is Irish, you know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes! you said you were Irish and I believed you. But what in the
    name of the Holy Virgin are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim for the life of him couldn&rsquo;t remember, so he said vaguely: &lsquo;I
    am travelling, you see&mdash;er&mdash;exploring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But she shook her head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No one travels in this wilderness,&rsquo; she said&mdash;and just
    for once the smile faded from her mouth&mdash;&lsquo;there is nothing to
    explore. Blue sky, ugly vegetation, dust and stones. Nothing else. Why, then,
    did you come here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She turned large inquiring eyes upon him, and Tim caught himself wishing
    that she would not look at him like that, for he felt that he was in danger
    of losing his head, and this impossible desert-land was not a place&mdash;he
    knew that&mdash;where an Irish gentleman could conveniently spare that commodity.
    However, with those eyes gazing inquiringly upon him and those lips smiling
    with such provoking challenge, what could he do but come a step or two nearer?&mdash;which
    he did, and then half-sat on the moss-covered stone, with one knee almost
    touching the ground.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it must have been because the hosts
    of Heaven came down to me once in my sleep and whispered to me that I should
    find you here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But at this, and perhaps at the glance in his eyes, which were grey, she
    edged slightly away from him, and an almost imperceptible shadow fell over
    her face, like an ethereal veil.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who taught you to lie so readily?&rsquo; she asked, dryly.</p>
  <p>He laughed and said: &lsquo;No one. It is a natural gift.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This brought the smile back to her lips, but only for a second or two: the
    next moment she became serious once more and her voice had a note of sharpness
    in its ring.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are not a Government spy?&rsquo; she asked; &lsquo;are you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Great Lord, no!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;What made you think...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There have been a few about lately,&rsquo; she said; then paused
    a moment, and added: &lsquo;But they have been no use to the Government....&rsquo; She
    paused a second time, and then continued coolly: &lsquo;There is a corner
    in the burial ground set apart for them&mdash;it is only a ditch.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She said this just as simply as if she wished to convey the fact that a
    couple of seats were reserved for some friends at a theatre; and now she
    plucked a drooping, pallid flower from the palm branch close to her, and
    Tim, puzzled, enchanted, bewitched, watched her slender fingers as they plucked
    the parched-up petals and then allowed them to drop to the ground one by
    one. She was extraordinarily beautiful: not so much a question of features
    as of marvellous colouring, the exquisite mellow look of sunset in the spring,
    a golden glow over her whole personality, and with it all that indefinable
    thing called <i>charm</i>, which no man has ever been able to define even
    whilst acknowledging that it fascinates him more than any other womanly attribute.</p>
  <p>It was not the tropical heat that made Tim&rsquo;s pulse beat at fever speed,
    or caused his temples to throb and his eyes to ache; it was just this girlish
    beauty and its nearness, the loneliness of this desert spot where, like a
    new Paul and Virginia, they might, if she so willed, dream away the rest
    of their lives together, forgetful of the world.</p>
  <p>How long the silence lasted between them, how long those perfect lips remained
    set with a curious air of determination and wilfulness, Tim couldn&rsquo;t
    say. He had gradually become conscious, even in the midst of his enchantment,
    of a feeling of wonder and puzzlement. Who and what was this extraordinarily
    beautiful girl? Not that he cared. She was just she&mdash;the eternal feminine&mdash;for
    the moment the one and only woman for him&mdash;but he did wonder. For the
    first time since first she had spoken, it struck him as strange that she
    spoke English&mdash;and such good English. He hadn&rsquo;t thought of this
    before, being spellbound, but now that she was silent, and he longing to
    hear her voice again, he asked, somewhat clumsily:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How is it you speak English so well?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have spoken it all my life,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But who taught you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t live in this God-forsaken hole, do you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And she replied quietly: &lsquo;I live here, yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why do you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because my father wishes it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The devil he does! What on earth for? He must be crazy to...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And then he paused, tongue-tied all at once, gazing on her, wide-eyed, for
    she had suddenly become absolutely transformed. All the winsomeness, the
    laughter, went out of her face. She threw back her head; her figure seemed
    to have grown taller, more majestic; she sat on the lichen-covered stone
    as if on a throne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How dare you talk like that?&rsquo; she asked coldly. &lsquo;Do you
    not know that my father is the direct descendant of Dom Pedro of Bragan&ccedil;a,
    the last Emperor of Brazil? He is the rightful emperor of this great country,
    and only waits for a fitting opportunity to enter into his own empire again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The deuce he does!&rsquo; Tim stammered in complete bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The people about here,&rsquo; she went on, still speaking in a cold
    and detached voice, like some sibyl instructing the ignorant, &lsquo;call
    my father the Great Unknown. No one has seen his face save his few privileged
    lieutenants; but there are five thousand men in Canudos to-day ready to fight
    to the death in his cause and mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yours?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am my father&rsquo;s only child and after him the rightful Empress
    of Brazil.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She paused, and turning her graceful head she gazed out over the sea of
    low scrub to the quivering blue ether beyond: and it seemed to Tim O&rsquo;Clee
    as if she saw there the golden mirage of rich palaces and stately terraces
    which had dazzled his eyes a short while ago, but which to her were very
    real indeed. He gave a long low whistle, which he devoutly hoped that she
    had not heard, because its flippancy, though unintentional, would jar upon
    the romanticism of the moment.</p>
  <p>What a situation! No wonder that poor Tim&rsquo;s aching head did not take
    it in, all of a piece. This adorable creature, this rose of the desert, the
    daughter of that mysterious charlatan in whose camp he hoped to find the
    elusive Dudley Stone! And she the deluded offspring of a highway robber,
    of a shameless pirate whom sooner or later an outraged Government would lay
    low, together with all his followers, whilst she&mdash;poor, lovely, helpless
    little pawn in this game of lying and of cheating&mdash;would be thrown as
    a sop to appease the wrath of an outraged countryside! The whole thing was
    unthinkable! After that one flippant whistle Tim could only groan and, resting
    his elbows on his knees, he buried his face in his hands, so that she should
    not catch the look of horror and distress in his eyes.</p>
  <p>Evidently she mistook this gesture for one of awe at this stupendous revelation,
    for she went on gently and more lightly: &lsquo;Perhaps you wonder why I
    am here alone, but I come most days to this silent and lonely spot. I love
    the solitude and the silence, for all about the city there is so much bustle
    and noise, and I like to dream sometimes. Do you sometimes dream, Mr. Timothy?&rsquo; And
    she turned once more her large inquiring eyes upon Tim.</p>
  <p>He looked up quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sometimes,&rsquo; he replied, and had the joy of seeing the faintest
    possible tinge of pink rise to her ivory cheek.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I love dreaming,&rsquo; she said simply, &lsquo;here especially,
    because some days, when it is very hot, there is a beautiful Fata Morgana
    in the sky, and the pictures which I see, although I know, of course, that
    they are not real, always seem just the right background for my dreams. Have
    you ever seen a mirage, Mr. Timothy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, truthfully, &lsquo;to-day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was a beautiful one to-day. I don&rsquo;t know when I have
    seen it so clear and so lovely.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nor I. That is why I&rsquo;ll come again&mdash;to-morrow, in the
    hope of seeing it once more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But at this she put up her thin small hand, with one finger up in a peremptory
    gesture:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! No!&rsquo; she reiterated several times vehemently, &lsquo;you
    must not come here again. This is my place&mdash;my solitude. I cannot allow
    you to....&rsquo; She checked herself and after a second or two continued
    more quietly: &lsquo;It was nice, of course, to see you. I am not a savage,
    you know. I like my fellow-men&mdash;better than the women: though I like
    the women also. And it was nice to speak English. I never speak English otherwise,
    except with my father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was a certain something about her now which gave him the impression
    that she was on the point of going away. Perhaps she was a sprite after all
    and would vanish as she had come&mdash;melt away in the purple shadows. Tim
    had the feeling that if she went something of his very life would go with
    her; that if he saw her pass out of his sight he would just draw his last
    breath and become one with the stony soil of the desert. He had an idea that
    while she spoke to him, answered his questions, she couldn&rsquo;t very well
    go away. It wouldn&rsquo;t be polite to go&mdash;or to vanish&mdash;and leave,
    say, a leading question unanswered. So he put an eager question to her, asked
    her whether she had ever been in England, which obviously was ridiculously
    out of the question. She said that she never had&mdash;not to her recollection&mdash;although
    when she was very small her father and mother had travelled about a great
    deal in different parts of Europe. Her father&rsquo;s nearest relations,
    she explained na&iuml;vely, were the sons of the late Emperor of Brazil and
    they lived in Europe, so she supposed that she had been taken sometimes to
    visit them.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was a long time in the convent school at Sao Paolo,&rsquo; she
    said,  &lsquo;while my mother was alive. But now she is dead, and my father
    had to devote himself to his country and to regaining his Empire. He brought
    me out here with him so that his people might get to know me, too.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How long ago was that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Some years ... I&rsquo;m not sure....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Again that intangible feeling that she was going. Tim racked his brains
    for something to say that would keep her here. He felt like one of those
    characters in fairy books who either must guess unsolvable riddles, or be
    forthwith transformed into a dragon or a bear. His gaze, for once, was withdrawn
    from the exquisite daughter of the biggest rascal unhung, and he allowed
    it to roam, unseeing at first, over the sunbaked plateau. And sure enough,
    far away, coming from the direction where the stampeding cattle and their
    Robot herdsman had disappeared, he saw three or four moving black specks
    which, drawing nearer, were gradually taking shape. He put them down as a
    group of centaurs with, among them, an ordinary horse carrying the small
    curved saddle usual in these parts.</p>
  <p>This, then, was the end. Obviously. Inevitably. Unless he could think of
    a question that would take her hours&mdash;days&mdash;to answer, she would
    be gone within the next five minutes. The centaurs had come&mdash;this he
    knew&mdash;to take her away to that abominable dust-laden city, where dwelt
    the arch-robber, the consummate charlatan and liar&mdash;her father. How
    and under what circumstances he would see her again, he could not as yet
    conjecture.</p>
  <p>In desperation he asked her a question which he felt at once was not very
    tactful: &lsquo;You said just now that no man is allowed to see your father&rsquo;s
    face save a privileged few. Why is that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because he is a man above all other men on this earth: a being almost
    sacred. In him there lives the reincarnated soul of our great prophet, Antonio
    Conselheiro. His life is spent in prayer for the liberation of his country
    from its vile oppressors, and for the day when the Archbishop Primate of
    Brazil will place the imperial crown upon my head. Did I not tell you that
    my devoted father has given up his right to the throne in my favour? Unseen,
    unheard, he wanders through the wilderness like the prophet, drawing men
    to him, and through him up to God. And the people venerate him. There is
    not a man in the Sertao who would not lay down his life for the Great Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Well! That was that. Tim O&rsquo;Clee had his answer with a vengeance, and
    he had just heard through the most exquisite lips in the world the <i>expos&eacute;</i> of
    a situation so insane, so fantastic, and&mdash;since he knew the underlying
    truth&mdash;to him so ridiculous, that words for once in his life completely
    failed him. The centaurs were quite close now. They came to a halt on the
    fringe of the shadow. They turned out to be men on horseback&mdash;<i>vaqueiros</i> such
    as his wanderings through these desert lands had rendered familiar to him.
    Two of them dismounted. They were swarthy of face, with very dark eyes and
    sharp, beak-like noses that betrayed their mixed blood. And now they waited,
    silent, solemn, like statues cast in bronze; their stolid faces, haughty
    and detached in expression, did not betray the slightest perturbation at
    seeing the Empress of Brazil in close conversation with a stranger.</p>
  <p>And within a very few minutes the girl had risen from the whinstone and
    was up in the curved saddle in the midst of her Robot attendants. One of
    them, before remounting, had helped her on with a long-sleeved leather coat
    and adjusted her leather cap over her head. She did not once turn her head
    to look at Tim; indeed, she seemed to have forgotten his existence. As the
    little cavalcade started off she took the lead, the men following some little
    way behind her. Soon horses and riders were mere black specks at the far
    end of the table-land. A few moments later they plunged into the scrub on
    the very spot where the stampeding cattle had disappeared a little while
    ago. Tim, with aching eyes, watched the spot as he had done before; he saw
    the quiver of the thorny palms as the horses passed beneath their boughs.
    The ground sloped away very gradually and so he could follow&mdash;or thought
    that he could&mdash;the progress of the cavalcade for some considerable
    distance. But anon the scrub was merged in a sea of impenetrableness. Nothing
    more moved. No sound emerged out of the thicket. The wilderness was, indeed,
    as the girl had described it, silent and infinitely lonely. &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; thought
    Tim O&rsquo;Clee, &lsquo;I am really awake now at last. This past hour&mdash;or
    day&mdash;or an &aelig;on of time&mdash;cannot have been real.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Indeed, this beautiful girl with the inquiring eyes and the cherry-red mouth,
    and all her wild talk of a saintly father and the crown of Brazil, did not
    belong to the world of everyday life. She was a being from another sphere
    altogether&mdash;from the world of Romance, of Poesy, and of Love.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; sighed Tim, &lsquo;what would any man give for just
    one kiss?&rsquo;  Tim felt that his blood was on fire; he ached in every
    limb with an intensity of longing for just another glimpse of her. Fool that
    he had been to let her go like that&mdash;unkissed! Fool not to have seized
    her in his arms, touched those exquisite lips with his own&mdash;lived, in
    fact&mdash;lived as he had never done before. Perhaps those centaurs would
    have risen from the ground after such sacrilege, seized him and crushed the
    life out of him for his daring. Well! why not? This was not reality: this
    was romance&mdash;and in the days of romance men before now had died for
    a kiss.</p>
  <p>Fool that he was! Fool to have let her go! The heat oppressed him: his temples
    throbbed, his lids, aching with the heat, fell over his eyes. It was close
    on noontide and he longed for sleep. The purple shadows still lay over the
    brackish pool. Tim remembered the two beasts. What would Uncle Justin say
    to a man who could forget his horse because of a woman? Tim smiled to himself.
    How far&mdash;how very far away did Traskmoore seem now: the silvery lake,
    the shady trees, the Irish walls and five-barred gates! Where was Hold-Hands
    Juliana? And what did she matter now?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll join the army of the Great Unknown,&rsquo; Tim murmured
    to himself,  &lsquo;and set Marivosa da Gloria on the throne of Brazil&mdash;see
    if I don&rsquo;t! ... Marivosa! ... Marivosa ... Even her name is music and
    romance....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Marivosa! ... Marivosa!...&rsquo; He kept repeating the name over
    and over again, rolling it on his tongue as the sweetest sound it had ever
    uttered. And he remembered a song&mdash;one of his favourite ones&mdash;which
    he used to sing to Uncle Justin at Traskmoore to the accompaniment of the
    gramophone:</p>
  <p class="note">Oh! if to lo-love thee more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each hour I number o-o-o&rsquo;er,<br>
    If this a pa-hash-hashion
    be<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worthy-hee of thee.<br>
    Then be ha-happy, for thus<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I adore thee-hee-hee.</p>
  <p>And surely never did the echo of these rocky fastnesses respond to more
    lusty song. Whether Tim had the vague idea that it would reach the ears of
    his lady fair it was impossible to say, or whether she in her turn would
    echo:</p>
  <p class="note">If pleasure&rsquo;s truest spell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be to love well,<br>
  Then be happy, for thus<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I adore thee.</p>
  <p>Tim led the two beasts to the pool and watched them drink; then he cast
    off his clothes and plunged into the water. He had to cool his blood somehow.
    The water, though muddy and none too sweet, gave a sense of comfort to his
    skin and limbs. He let the sun dry him and then resumed his clothes; after
    which he made his way back to the hallowed spot where first he had beheld
    his vision. He lay down on the hard ground, put his head on the parched moss
    as near as possible to the place where she had sat, closed his eyes, and
    presently dropped off to sleep.</p>
  <p>Just before he did drop off he remembered that the one question which interested
    him most, and which he had never thought of putting to Marivosa, was whether
    among her saintly father&rsquo;s proselytes there was a stranger&mdash;an
    Englishman&mdash;named Dudley Stone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25</b></h2>
  <p>It was late afternoon before Tim O&rsquo;Clee emerged out of the belt of
    forest land and scrub, and the city of Canudos burst in upon him like a scene
    on the stage when the curtain goes up.</p>
  <p>A background of towering, irregular mountain-tops, a valley watered by two
    streams, between them a gently sloping hill on which clustered a conglomeration
    of rudely-built houses and huts intersected by clumps of prickly palms and
    dwarf trees, and bare patches of rough grass; and towering on the summit
    of the hill a low outspreading building of rough stone, which gleamed mysterious
    and golden through a veil of dust in the glow of the setting sun.</p>
  <p>There was no beauty in the scene, no colour, no line; but it had a touch
    of grandeur in its very ugliness, its isolation, its amazing defiance of
    Nature in her most stern moods. Tim stood up in his stirrups and raised his
    hat, welcoming the sight. He and his beasts had had a rest; he himself had
    even had a wash in the brackish water, and he had succeeded in taking off
    a two days&rsquo; stubbly growth of beard from his chin. The last phase of
    his adventure found him refreshed and ready.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;is Canudos; you, Tim, my
    lad, have come to the end of your wanderings at last. Over there, inside
    that ugly city which you were beginning to think was only a legend, you may
    find the man whose existence would be the means of giving you Traskmoore
    and all it stands for. But, apart from that, inside that city there lives
    the most beautiful woman God ever made. She may be Empress of Brazil or she
    may not. Her father may be a saintly prophet, or the greatest blackguard
    unhung, but one thing is certain&mdash;she will one day be Countess of Traskmoore,
    or you Tim, my lad, are a damned fool and an unworthy son of Erin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He rode on past the first habitation he had encountered for days. It was
    the usual haphazard construction of poles and laths and muddy plaster, a
    wooden outside staircase, a veranda, a stockade around the courtyard, and
    several sheds; but in the courtyard there were a couple of dogs and they
    barked. Chickens, lean and mangy, strutted about and clucked; pigs over by
    the sheds grunted as they buried their snouts in their troughs; and all these
    sounds put further heart into Tim and assured him that he was not dreaming,
    that he was still on the familiar planet known as Earth&mdash;and not in
    Uranus, or Neptune, as he might otherwise have feared.</p>
  <p>As he neared the outskirts of the city, teeming life greeted him at every
    turn: <i>vaqueiros</i> driving their cattle home; rudely-constructed carts
    creaking on the dusty road; large-eyed, gaunt women wrapped in blankets sitting
    by the roadside guarding a herd of goats; naked, dark-skinned children darting
    out of the huts at sound of the horses&rsquo; hooves. So far nothing hostile
    had greeted him. The men, busy with their cattle, passed him by without a
    second glance&mdash;the women did not even appear curious.</p>
  <p>And suddenly the delicious odour of hot coffee struck his nostrils, and
    round the bend of the road he came on a long, low building with a tiled roof
    and the usual wooden veranda along one side of it. The welcoming word: &lsquo;Hospedaria&rsquo;&mdash;half-obliterated
    by the sun&mdash;and a weather-worn sign with the legend &lsquo;Bom Viagem&rsquo; gave
    promise of shelter and rest. A number of men stood about in the front yard,
    smoking and leaning against the veranda posts. There were a few horses, too,
    some of which were tethered to hitching-posts, others just hobbled; there
    were a couple of hooded carts, two or three curs unworthy the name of <i>dog</i>,
    and the all-pervading succulent scent of coffee. These men, gaunt of mien
    and very dark of skin, had probably been talking before Tim came into view,
    but as soon as he turned into the stockade and drew rein they became silent
    and, for the first time, Tim thought that he detected an inimical suspicious
    glance in their eyes. However, he greeted them all comprehensively in quite
    good Portuguese. They nodded in reply, and he then asked whether this was
    a house where he could get food and shelter for himself and his beasts; again
    they nodded, and Tim dismounted and entered the house.</p>
  <p>It seemed almost a replica of that other place over at Cumbe; flecks of
    dim afternoon light struggling in through chinks in the walls or narrow grated
    windows; the rough-hewn benches and tables lined up against the plastered
    walls; the smell of coffee and rank tobacco, the sacks of beans and farinha,
    the miscellaneous store of matches and cigarettes, goads, lassoes, tin pots,
    leather hats&mdash;even to the owner of this princely store stretched out
    on one of the benches snoring lustily. Some half-dozen men, all dressed in
    the usual panoply of leather, were sitting round the room drinking coffee
    and smoking cigarettes. They hardly glanced at Tim when he entered, for the
    place was dark and he looked at first sight like one of themselves. It was
    only when he sat down at one of the tables and rapped on it with the palm
    of his hand, demanding attention, that they realized he was a stranger. But,
    beyond staring stolidly and unblushingly at him, they did not molest him
    in any way.</p>
  <p>The store-keeper, or whatever he was, roused from his slumbers, also did
    some staring at Tim before he asked him what he wanted. Tim demanded supper
    and hot coffee, and as he did this in their own tongue the men withdrew their
    gaze from him for a moment or two in order to consult mutely with one another
    as to this amazing situation. Here was a stranger who was not a stranger
    since he spoke their language. What did that mean?</p>
  <p>The store-keeper, a lean fellow of immense height and very little breadth,
    with large hook nose, copper-coloured skin and very black hair, rolled his
    long lean body from off the bench, stretched out his arms so that they nearly
    touched the ceiling, and, without comment or second glance at Tim, sauntered
    off to an inner room. Tim waited patiently and in silence, returning the
    men&rsquo;s persistent stare with one equally unashamed. A few more men strolled
    in from time to time till the place was quite full, and when every seat was
    occupied the late-comers sat on the tables, or some of them on the hard-baked
    floor. A few stood about in and around the doorway, with arms folded, smoking
    cigarettes and staring. No one spoke. They were a silent lot, these <i>vaqueiros</i> of
    the desert; the Indian blood in them tending to introspection and a kind
    of coma of the brain.</p>
  <p>Presently the tall Indian returned, he had a wooden bowl in one hand and
    a platter in the other. These he placed in front of Tim, together with a
    wooden spoon and a tin fork. The platter was well heaped up with strips of
    dried meat stewed in rice, and in the bowl there was the ubiquitous mixture
    of black beans and bacon powdered over with farinha. To a capricious palate
    the food would have been uneatable, but Tim was young, he had an iron constitution,
    and he was hungry. He, also, had become used to these native concoctions
    by now and did not really dislike them. What was more, the coffee was excellent.</p>
  <p>By dint of dragging out a few words from his taciturn host he learned that
    he could get a bed for the night and stabling for his beasts.</p>
  <p>It was all very like Cumbe. He was dog-tired, and again could not have told
    you what kind of bed he slept in that night. Unlike Cumbe, however, his dreams
    were neither of Ireland nor Traskmoore, nor of Hold-Hands Juliana, nor even
    Dudley Stone; they were all of an exquisite vision carved in ivory and clad
    in gold, who looked at times like a beautiful woman with bright-red lips
    and disturbing eyes, at others like an image with an immense jewelled crown
    on its head, and surrounded by huge centaurs, half-men, half-beasts, who
    twitched lassoes above their heads and threw them at Tim and invariably missed
    him&mdash;until one of them, who was the thinnest and blackest thing Tim
    had ever seen, caught him round the shoulders and dragged him to the ground;
    whereupon Tim woke up with a yell, to find himself on the hard-baked floor
    in company with half a dozen cockroaches. But even so, he was so tired and
    sleepy that he contentedly rolled himself in his rug again and went once
    more fast&mdash;and this time dreamlessly&mdash;to sleep.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26</b></h2>
  <p>Tim stayed eight days at the Bom Viagem, trying with all his might to enter
    into the life of the place by mingling freely with the habitu&eacute;s of
    the inn. It was very difficult, for they were a taciturn lot. They would
    sit about or stand, sip their white rum and their coffee, or else play cards
    or dominoes, and stare at Tim&mdash;stare by the hour. Over and over again
    he would meet a fusillade of dark eyes, all directed at him at one and the
    same time, or else furtive glances above a hand of cards. But no one asked
    him any questions: when he volunteered information, they listened, but he
    could not for the life of him say whether they believed him or not.</p>
  <p>He had given his name as Tim O&rsquo;Clee, thinking it would be easy for
    them to pronounce. They translated it into <i>Timocla</i> and left it at
    that. There were two factors, fortunately, which stood Tim in good stead
    during his first acquaintance with the dwellers of this strange desert land:
    one was his working familiarity with their language, and the other his sound
    knowledge of cattle and horses. He could not be a real stranger, so these <i>vaqueiros</i> seemed
    to argue: this man who spoke their language and who appraised the points
    of a horse with unerring judgment.</p>
  <p>Without venturing on any definite statement, Tim let fall hints that he
    came from the other side of the Sao Francisco river, being attracted by the
    tales he had heard of fortunes to be picked up in the Sertao by trading hides
    and cattle with foreigners. On the whole, he hoped that they were taking
    him at his own valuation; certain it is that he detected nothing hostile
    in the men&rsquo;s attitude towards him, and as day succeeded day they stared
    less frequently and less persistently at him.</p>
  <p>But the news of his arrival at the Bom Viagem had apparently spread about
    the town, for evening after evening now there were strange faces to be seen
    among the habitu&eacute;s. Of these strange faces some gave Timothy plenty
    of food for thought. On the whole a villainous lot. Men who apparently had
    ascendancy over the rest of the crowd. His Indian host whom, in despair at
    obtaining information in any other way, Tim took to questioning with untiring
    obstinacy, did inform him curtly and with bated breath that these were the
    Lieutenants of the Great Unknown, the privileged guardians of his sacred
    person. After which, Tim studied the appearance of those men, marvelling
    if the fantastic clothes, the long hair and beard, the tan and the dirt,
    did not by chance conceal the personality of Dudley Stone. But they were
    every one of them half-breeds: mamalucos, mestizos, mulattos of every conceivable
    hue and cast of countenance. They went by curious names, which Tim tried
    to commit to memory. Flat-Face, Black-Fang, Lean-Shanks were some of them.
    They seemed to have been selected by the Great Unknown principally for their
    ferocity, probably for unavowed and unpunished crimes which had forced them
    into exile in the desert and allegiance to his cause. They were less taciturn
    than the common crowd, but their conversation consisted chiefly of highly-coloured
    accounts of their own prowess in the field of crime and their ruthlessness
    in face of their enemies.</p>
  <p>Tim, not being a fool, knew well enough that he was completely at the mercy
    of these men, who, according to their own showing, revelled in crime and
    took pride in savagery. They were not likely to spare him should they presently
    prefer to see him dead rather than alive. He was just Daniel in a den of
    ferocious lions. Yet it was this very sense of perpetual danger that thrilled
    Tim O&rsquo;Clee&rsquo;s adventurous spirit, but for this spice in his life
    he ran the risk of becoming an amorous dreamer. Thoughts of Marivosa haunted
    him day and night. Every day he rode out through the forest to the table-land
    where first he had met her, and there waited for hours, hoping for the sight
    of her. And while he waited he made plans for the future&mdash;all sorts
    of extravagant plans; he would, of course, succeed in finding Dudley Stone,
    through him he would regain possession of his Irish heritage, and end by
    laying his wealth and his life at his beloved lady&rsquo;s feet. It wouldn&rsquo;t,
    he thought, be difficult to persuade her that to be Countess of Traskmoore
    was a finer thing than to be crowned Empress of Brazil.</p>
  <p>Not only did Tim dream of this future by day in the solitude of the table-land,
    but in the evenings, with nothing to do in the coffee-room of the Bom Viagem,
    he would still dream on, and forget that at the moment he was no nearer to
    finding Dudley Stone than he had been over at Monsataz&mdash;until his wandering
    eyes caught one of those suspicious glances which warned him that it was
    not good to dream in the presence of these fearsome Lieutenants; an unguarded
    word, a look, even, might result in a knife-thrust and the ditch which the
    lovely lady of his dreams had described as reserved for traitors and Government
    spies.</p>
  <p>The most acute danger lay in a possible quarrel over cards, or dominoes,
    for the men were all gamblers: but as there was not much loose money about,
    the stakes over these games of hazard were never very high. Tim had been
    very careful to keep his small store of milreis concealed from prying eyes.
    Not that the men were thieves in the European sense of the word: to raid
    a farm, to drive a herd of cattle, to pillage a township, was their <i>m&eacute;tier</i>;
    but to put their hands in another man&rsquo;s pocket, or rob a stranger of
    a few milreis did not appeal to their virile nature. Living as they did in
    a community of pirates and highway robbers, and in an entirely democratic
    spirit, they had not much use for petty cash.</p>
  <p>To all appearances this Timocla was an out-at-elbows vagabond, who, like
    themselves, had been forced into exile by some misunderstanding with the
    laws of the country. A highly-coloured version which Tim gave one night of
    what actually took place at the Hespanha music-hall in Monsataz, including
    the murder of Doctor da Pinto&mdash;but with the names of places and persons
    carefully disguised&mdash;was received with much approbation. It was the
    kind of autobiography that the Lieutenants understood. As a fellow-criminal,
    driven to seek service with the Great Unknown as an alternative to the gallows,
    the newcomer was no longer an object of suspicion. He had at once become
    a man and a brother.</p>
  <p>His health was drunk in white rum. He was even slapped on the back by one
    man and embraced by another. His stock had risen a hundred per cent that
    night.</p>
  <p>While he told that tale, he had been aware of the presence and the attention
    of one man who in general appearance was unlike any of the others. He was
    small and spare, and though his skin was dark it had become so through the
    action of sun and weather, and was not the outcome of mixed blood. His face
    was thin and almost ascetic-looking, his hair was scanty and lank, of a nondescript
    colour. He had gentle, watery grey eyes. But, in spite of obvious physical
    weakness, amongst this crowd of stalwarts he seemed to be a person of authority.
    Whenever he spoke the others listened; and Tim had already noticed that when
    he entered the crowded <i>hospedaria</i> a chair was at once vacated for
    him, and the host hastened to attend to his wants.</p>
  <p>While Tim told his highly-coloured tale, this little old man gazed on him
    with an expression of indulgent irony which presently changed to one of gentle
    pity.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have I found a friendly lion in this den?&rsquo; thought Tim.</p>
  <p>It seemed so indeed, for when his story was ended and he had received the
    accolade from Lean-Shanks, Black-Fang and the others, and the company began
    to disperse, the strange old man beckoned him to his side and offered him
    coffee, which seemingly was a great honour, for the others all retired and
    left the two men isolated and free to talk together in whispers. Tim drank
    the coffee, conscious that the strange old man was scrutinizing him very
    closely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Since you came from the other side of the river, Senhor Timocla,
    how do you come to know so accurately what occurred in the Hespanha music-hall
    at Monsataz that night, a couple of months ago?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The voice was gentle, cultured, slightly ironic. Tim, on whom the question
    so tersely and quietly put had the effect of a sudden shock from a powerful
    battery, tried to meet the glance of the gentle, watery eyes with one equally
    frank.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I might retort with the same question, senhor,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Would your answer be as truthful as mine?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Try me,&rsquo; said Tim boldly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I had the story from my friend and brother, Fra Martino, cur&eacute; of
    Sao Felice in Monsataz.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Heavens above!&rsquo; Tim exclaimed, &lsquo;then you are...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am Fra Federico Evangelista, cur&eacute; of the district which
    embraces this city.&rsquo; Then, as Tim, bewildered and silent, stared at
    him in amazement, he went on, with a smile: &lsquo;It is your turn to reply
    to my first question&mdash;truthfully, remember.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I need not do that,&rsquo; Tim murmured, &lsquo;your reverence will
    have guessed....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old man nodded. &lsquo;I am not &ldquo;your reverence&rdquo; here,&rsquo; he
    said, with his gentle, ironical smile. &lsquo;They have not much use for
    religion over here. But it is my duty to visit this place, which is in my
    district, and so I come from time to time. I say Mass occasionally, though
    there is only a derelict hut in which to perform the holy office, and though
    the men go as readily to the Gri-gri man, or the witch-doctor, as they do
    to me. But there are just a few souls who have seen the truth and have not
    forgotten it, and I minister to them. On the whole they all respect me, for
    I know something of the lore of simples, and when I come I bring a few medicaments
    with me, which I apply for the relief of their bodies when they are racked
    by fever. For this they are grateful in their rough way. My predecessor tried
    to show them the wickedness of their superstition&mdash;the Great Unknown,
    the resurrected prophet, and all that folly&mdash;but they would not listen
    and drove him out of the place, and they threatened to kill him if he ever
    dared set foot in Canudos again. Then our Archbishop sent for me and gave
    me the cur&eacute; of these poor lost souls. I do what I can for them, but
    without the ministrations of the Church it is very difficult. So I just trust
    in God&rsquo;s mercy, for they are ignorant!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The gentle, tired voice died away. Tim was hardly conscious whether Fra
    Federico had really ceased speaking. His whole personality seemed so incongruous,
    his simple autobiography so out of place in this savage <i>milieu</i> of
    men and beasts. One by one the fearsome Lieutenants and the <i>vaqueiros</i> had
    gone. The Indian innkeeper was snoring on one of the benches: the whole of
    the <i>hospedaria</i> was silent, dark, and deserted. How like a dream it
    all was!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is getting late,&rsquo; Fra Federico resumed after a little while, &lsquo;though
    I daresay you have noticed that we do not mark time in Canudos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim partially woke out of his dream.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have you far to go, your reverence?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Less than a league. It is nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You will let me escort you...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not only that. You will pack up your valise and come with me to my
    house. It is not much, but it is better than this.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But, your reverence...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico put up a warning finger: &lsquo;Sh-sh! Did I not tell you that
    I am no &ldquo;reverend&rdquo; here? You will come with me, senhor, and your
    company will be a solace to me while I am here. When I go, you will come
    with me, for this is no place for Europeans.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim shook his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When you go, senhor, I will stay here and wait for your return. Did
    not Fra Martino tell you why I came out here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. When he sent me word, I was at Cumbe. He was interested in you:
    he was sorry you had had such misfortune, but he did not know why you wished
    to visit this God-forsaken hole.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shall I tell your reverence why I came here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You certainly must. While we amble along to my house on the hill
    you shall tell me all that you told my Brother Martino&mdash;all that caused
    him to send you out to me, with the thought, I suppose, that I could be of
    service to you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Without waiting for definite acquiescence from Tim, Fra Federico clapped
    his thin hands vigorously together until he had succeeded in rousing the
    Indian from his slumbers.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Senhor Timocla&rsquo;s mount and my mule,&rsquo; he commanded; and
    the Indian, obsequious and alert, rolled off the bench, picked himself up
    again and straddled out of the room.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Does your reverence really mean...?&rsquo; Tim ventured in protest.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you say those words again,&rsquo; the old man retorted, &lsquo;I
    leave you here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Happy and excited, Tim hurried across to his room. He felt that with this
    civilized, kindly friend as a stand-by his star was already in the ascendant.
    He packed up his few belongings, then ran out and saddled his horse, and
    hoisted his valise on his pack-mule: the Indian in the meanwhile looked after
    Fra Federico&rsquo;s mount, a lean, hungry-looking beast, which the old man
    straddled and set going with gentle words of encouragement. The innkeeper
    did not seem surprised at this sudden departure of his guest: the milreis
    which Tim had tendered him in payment of his week&rsquo;s board and lodging
    were apparently more than he had expected, for he was most profuse in his
    offer of himself and his house and everything he possessed for the future
    service of the Senhor Timocla.</p>
  <p>And it was while ambling in the moonlight along the dusty track that led
    up to the mountain city that Tim O&rsquo;Clee once more recounted the story
    of Uncle Justin, of Hold-Hands Juliana, and of Dudley Stone. Fra Federico
    listened. He was obviously interested and very sympathetic.</p>
  <p>When Tim had finished his story, he said: &lsquo;I still wonder, Senhor
    Timocla, why my Brother Martino sent you out here to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But obviously, your rev&mdash; I mean obviously, senhor, because
    he thought that as you know this place so well you would tell me all you
    know about Dudley Stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly I would, senhor, if I knew anything of such a person. But
    never in my life have I seen the man or ever heard such a name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know if there is a foreigner here, an Englishman
    ... a foreigner in the service of this ... this Great Unknown?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A foreigner? No. Where should he come from? What should he be doing
    here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But there must be, senhor,&rsquo; Tim insisted, unwilling to admit
    even to himself that black despair was hovering near, ready to seize upon
    his spirit,  &lsquo;there must be&mdash;there is&mdash;a foreigner ... an
    Englishman ... think again, senhor ... one of the Lieutenants, probably&mdash;or
    a member of that charlatan&rsquo;s household ... there must be, I say ...
    there must be&mdash;or Fra Martino would not have sent me....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But Fra Federico could only shake his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no one here, senhor&mdash;not in Canudos. I know every
    man in Canudos&mdash;all the important ones, that is&mdash;there never was
    a foreigner near the person of the Great Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And still they ambled on, sometimes side by side, and now and then, when
    the track narrowed, in single file. The old priest had pulled a rosary out
    of his pocket and, now that Tim had lapsed into silence, he muttered his
    Aves in a half-audible murmur. His mule needed no guiding: it knew its way
    through the maze of narrow, intricate streets which formed the city of Canudos.
    The moon looked down, placid and silvery, on the immensity of this desert
    land, smiling her wan, cool smile on thatch, or hut, or wigwam, as complacently
    as she did on stately European homes.</p>
  <p>A great patch of silvery light lay over the mysterious mansion of the Great
    Unknown, lending to the ugly, squalid city nestling in this vast amphitheatre
    of distant rocky fastnesses, a certain eerie grandeur. Tim rode on in silence,
    with tightened heart and an aching desolation of spirit. Had he come all
    this way, ventured so much, hoped so considerably, only to find failure at
    the goal? If so, what would be the end of it all? The fortune that he was
    going to lay at the feet of his beloved, the title that would compensate
    her for losing an imaginary throne: were they all to end in smoke&mdash;be
    swallowed up in the dust of this stony-hearted desert?</p>
  <p>Perish the thought! Perish despair! This was not stuff of which Irish adventurers
    are made! He had come all these thousands of miles to recover fortune and
    a title for himself. They had seemed dear then, when he alone would have
    tasted their joys; but now how doubly precious had they become, now that
    one unforgettable image filled his heart as it already had stirred his imagination!</p>
  <p>Surely, surely God had not led his footsteps all this way only in order
    to make him taste the bitter fruits of failure. It was unthinkable! Such
    things did not happen! not, at any rate, to an Irishman in whose lexicon
    hitherto there had not been such a word as <i>failure</i>.</p>
  <p>And Tim laughed aloud, a gay, defiant, confident laugh. &lsquo;God,&rsquo; he
    said,  &lsquo;does not do such things! He has too great a sense of humour.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27</b></h2>
  <p>The old priest had spoken the truth when he told Tim that though his house
    was a poor one, it was better than the Bom Viagem. Poor it certainly was,
    but it was built of stone instead of the usual laths and mud, and, though
    the floor was only beaten-down earth and the tiny windows were unglazed,
    the house actually boasted of three separate rooms. In the principal one
    of these there were chairs and benches, a table and a cupboard, all roughly
    fashioned of wood; a couple of hammocks were slung in another room, whilst
    the third was partly a lumber-room and partly a kitchen.</p>
  <p>The cupboard in the centre room contained an array of phials and pill-boxes
    and bundles of dried herbs, together with pestle and mortar, a primitive
    kind of retort, and various other implements for the pursuance of the old
    priest&rsquo;s simple pharmaceutics. And piled up on a couple of shelves
    there were a number of tattered and much-thumbed books. These were principally
    devotional in character, mostly of a very na&iuml;ve order; there were several
    medical treatises and pamphlets, and one or two ancient herbals&mdash;one
    of the sixteenth century&mdash;which would have fetched large sums at auction
    in London. There was an old &agrave; Kempis, a New Testament, and the Maximes
    of La Rochefoucauld, all in Portuguese translation and&mdash;wonder of wonders&mdash;the
    plays and sonnets of one William Shakespeare in the original.</p>
  <p>Fra Federico met his guest&rsquo;s astonished glance with a gentle self-deprecating
    smile.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, yes!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we all learn a little English in
    the seminary; there are always a few Irish students with whom we talk. I
    used to speak your beautiful language quite fluently at one time&mdash;even
    now I can stumble along and understand most of what is said&mdash;but I am
    old, and I have forgotten ... so much ... so much....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you read Shakespeare, Padre?&rsquo; Tim remarked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The greatest poet the world has ever known, senhor,&rsquo; the old
    man replied, with strange fervour. &lsquo;The greatest man who ever walked
    the earth since our blessed Lord.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The priest made the sign of the Cross, in case what he said might, perchance,
    be blasphemous; then he added, more lightly: &lsquo;At one time I could have
    recited the whole of Romeo and Juliet to you by heart.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And in the intervals, Padre, you studied medicine, and probably knew
    more about remedies than half the bigwigs in Europe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have studied herbs and the simples, senhor. I have no means of
    obtaining drugs in these wilds, so I go to Nature for my potions and she
    has yielded up to me some very precious secrets.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>With loving hands he fingered the phials and bottles in the cupboard, took
    up one or two of them and showed them to Tim with some pride.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It took me days and nights of search,&rsquo; he said, with reference
    to one of these, &lsquo;to find the one plant which that old herbal over
    there recommends as the supreme remedy for gangrene&mdash;a horrible affection
    of which these poor people here often suffer through dirt or neglect of wounds.
    I have used it often and it is infallible. This,&rsquo; and he held up another
    bottle to the light, &lsquo;I succeeded in concocting after two years&rsquo; patient
    search for a herb which only grows the other side of Sao Francisco river:
    it is a sovereign remedy against infantile croup, or whooping-cough. The
    formula dates from the sixteenth century.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He showed Tim a jar which contained a thick brown paste. &lsquo;The most
    perfect cure for every disease of the skin&mdash;it never fails in the very
    worst cases of scurvy or eczema.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are a wonder, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said, with genuine admiration
    for the modesty, the charm, the simplicity of his new friend. He could have
    listened for hours while the old man droned away in his gentle tired voice,
    recounting to him some of those marvels wherewith Nature, seemingly so cruel
    to her children, has placed at their disposal all her treasures to palliate
    the evils which they bring upon themselves.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what is this, Padre?&rsquo; Tim asked, as he picked up a bottle
    which contained a thick fluid of a deep golden colour. Instead of a Latin,
    or Greek name, such as the other potions wore upon their labels, it bore
    the strange legend: &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; and below that: &lsquo;Friar
    Laurence&rsquo;s potion.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That,&rsquo; Fra Federico replied, &lsquo;is the most precious tincture
    in my collection. I made it up from a recipe in that old sixteenth-century
    herbal over there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why that funny label?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because, senhor,&rsquo; said the old priest, with a return to that
    quaint earnestness which lent such dignity to his worn, ascetic face, &lsquo;because
    I firmly believe that your great Shakespeare had studied that old herbal,
    and had this same recipe in mind when he made Friar Laurence give to Juliet
    the potion which would cause a state closely resembling death. Do you remember
    his words to her when he gives her the phial?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment as if to collect his thoughts; then, in excellent English,
    he recited the immortal words:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>
    A cold and drowsy humour,
    for no pulse<br>
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease,<br>
    No warmth, no breath, shall
    testify thou livest;<br>
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br>
    To paly ashes; thy eyes&rsquo; windows
    fall,<br>
    Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;<br>
    Each part, deprived of supple
    government,<br>
    Shall, stiff and stark, and cold, appear like death.<br>
    And in this borrowed
    likeness of shrunk death<br>
    Thou shall continue two and forty hours.<br>
    And then awake as from a pleasant
    sleep.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The priest had long ceased speaking, and Tim still stared at him, amazed.
    Many a time, since he had embarked on his great adventure, had he believed
    himself to be in a dream-state, but never so much as now when, standing in
    a squalid hut, in the most forgotten corner of this world, hundreds of miles
    away from the outposts of civilization, he heard a Portuguese ambulant priest
    recite, in perfect English, words which he had last heard at the Old Vic
    in London.</p>
  <p>He could only stare at the funny old man with the sparse hair and domed
    forehead, with the sunken cheeks and trembling hands, and reiterate, with
    profound conviction: &lsquo;You are a wonder, Padre!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>After a moment or two he added: &lsquo;And do you mean to tell me that you
    have actually concocted a draught which will have the effect that Shakespeare
    talks about?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t concoct it, my son,&rsquo; Fra Federico said with
    a smile. &lsquo;I studied the old herbals and found a formula.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve actually got it in that bottle?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve actually got it in this bottle.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have you tried it on anyone?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;On myself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And&mdash;was it successful? I mean, what did it feel like?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Like Death, when he shuts up the day of Life,&rdquo;&lsquo; the
    old man quoted.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And when you woke again...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I felt rather giddy and sick, chiefly from want of food, I believe;
    but, as you see, I am here to tell the tale.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They might have buried you alive.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I went out into the scrub; no one knew where I was, so there was
    no danger.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico said this quite simply, as if that episode in his life had
    not in its sublime self-confidence and contempt of danger a spark of heroism.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;May I look at the stuff, Padre?&rsquo; Tim asked, and the priest
    gave him the bottle. The liquid was of a golden colour, semi-opaque. Tim
    sniffed it. It had an indefinable, aromatic, intoxicating odour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shall I tell you, Padre, what I&rsquo;m going to do?&rsquo; he said,
    after he had handed back the precious bottle to his old friend. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
    going to write an account of everything you&rsquo;ve just told me. You shall
    give me a small draught of the thing&mdash;enough, of course, to produce
    the right effect, say, on a dog&mdash;and as soon as I get back to England
    I shall send it to one of the medical bigwigs in London with a biography
    of you and of your life here. You shall become famous throughout the scientific
    world, Padre, as you jolly well deserve to be. And the Pope, or whoever has
    a say in these things, shall make you a Cardinal, or an Archbishop, or anything
    else you like. Now do, to please me, decant some of that precious liquid
    into a bottle small enough to go into this pocket inside my belt, where I
    keep what money I&rsquo;ve got left. I mean every word I say, Padre.... Men
    have become rich and famous for less than this.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old priest shook his head, smiling indulgently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for fame, nor money, my son&mdash;not now any
    longer.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not for yourself, of course. But as a man of science it is your duty
    to give your discoveries to the world&mdash;at least, I&rsquo;ve always understood
    that that was the unwritten law.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It took Tim a long time to bring Fra Federico over to his way of thinking;
    but his was a persuasive tongue, and not even in the desert is a man entirely
    free from vanity. Tim, being Irish, had kissed the Blarney Stone. He knew
    just what to say and how subtly to flatter his old friend into doing what
    he wished. Somewhat na&iuml;vely, perhaps, he believed that the concoction
    of an old potion culled from a medi&aelig;val herbal was one of the most
    marvellous discoveries man had ever made; and he had taken such a liking
    to the old priest, and thought it such a shame that so fine a fellow should
    end his days in these barbaric regions, that he was determined to do him
    what he called &lsquo;a jolly good turn&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>In the end, Fra Federico, obviously not good at an argument and, equally
    obviously, not obstinate of character, gave in to him. He filled a small
    phial with the liquid and gave this to Tim, who stowed it away carefully
    in the pocket inside his belt.</p>
  <p>Little did either of the two men guess what immense significance this simple
    act would have, not only on Tim&rsquo;s present quest, but on both their
    lives.</p>
  <p>For the moment, the subject was dropped. The priest, with the well-thumbed
    volume of the great poet&rsquo;s works on his knee, appeared to be living
    through some half-forgotten dream again. His quivering lips murmured the
    words which he knew by heart; his pale, watery eyes wandered round this narrow,
    squalid room, which meant home for him. Tim wondered what picture memory
    had traced for him on its dingy walls&mdash;a face? A smile? A picture out
    of the past?&mdash;which he lived again in the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,
    and which caused those faded eyes to look a little more sad, a little more
    resigned than they had been before.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28</b></h2>
  <p>Quite apart from his erudition and his enthusiasm for Shakespeare, Fra Federico
    Evangelista proved a delightful companion. Many days went by before Tim had
    dragged out of him the history of his eventful life; it was a life of disappointment
    and of resignation, from the time when he was in charge of a fashionable
    parish in Seville to the day when his superiors sent him as an ambulant priest
    to minister to the spiritual needs of a horde of savages in the desert. What
    had brought this cruel exile about, Tim never knew. He could only vaguely
    guess at a romantic adventure, the recollection of which would at times bring
    a strange look of yearning to the faded old eyes.</p>
  <p>That it was a woman who had played an important part in Fra Federico&rsquo;s
    life&mdash;a part which had wrecked his career&mdash;could not be doubted;
    the old man even now would lend a sympathetic ear to every tale of love and
    romance; and soon Tim found himself telling his friend of that first never-to-be-forgotten
    encounter with the mysterious lady of the woods&mdash;Marivosa da Gloria,
    Empress of Brazil.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a woman, Padre!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;You have seen her,
    of course&mdash;talked to her, perhaps, you lucky dog. She is exquisite!
    I have seen some beautiful women in my day&mdash;Ireland, you know, is famous
    for them&mdash;but never in my life have I seen such eyes, such a skin, and
    her mouth, Padre...! My gosh! just think of the first kiss from those lips...!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Thus Tim talked wildly, extravagantly, one day when, after the usual meal
    of black beans and farinha, he and Fra Federico sat over their cup of coffee.
    The air on that day was peculiarly oppressive; though Tim did not know much
    about the climate of the Sertao, he felt that in spite of the clearness of
    the sky a storm was drawing near. He felt the heat more than he had ever
    done since he had come to this part of the world: his temples throbbed painfully,
    and he felt rather light-headed. But the coffee was good and strong, and
    talking of the one subject which absorbed his thoughts seemed to ease the
    tension of his nerves.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I mean to unmask that blasphemous charlatan who calls himself the
    Great Unknown, poses as a resurrected prophet or whatnot, and is, unfortunately,
    Marivosa&rsquo;s father ... the abominable mountebank, with his talk of being
    Emperor of Brazil! ... I shall tear that veil from his ugly face, see if
    I don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They had gradually got into the habit of talking in English, even when they
    were alone. Tim&rsquo;s outspoken sentiments might have got his old friend
    into trouble if spying ears were about. And it was delightful to listen to
    the elegantly stilted diction of the priest, who had learned most of his
    English from Elizabethan authors.</p>
  <p>He smiled at Tim&rsquo;s vehemence. &lsquo;How will you accomplish that,
    senhor?&rsquo;  he asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rsquo; Tim replied. &lsquo;I must see Marivosa
    again first.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She is more closely guarded than a European queen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nevertheless, I shall take her away from here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take her away...!&rsquo; the old man gasped. &lsquo;Why in the world
    should you dream of taking her away?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because she is too pure and too good and far too beautiful to live
    in this den of brigands, and because...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and again the old priest smiled, gently, indulgently, and then
    spoke as if to a child who is crying for the moon: &lsquo;You are nearly
    two hundred kilometres here, my son, from the nearest railhead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know the country; and in this city there are ten
    thousand pairs of eyes to follow her movements wherever she may go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know all that, Padre,&rsquo; said Tim, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s going
    to be done in spite of all that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Even if she were willing....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me see her once more,&rsquo; Tim asserted boldly, &lsquo;and
    she will be willing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But Fra Federico again shook his old head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You forget,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that Marivosa da Gloria has been
    brought up to believe in her own exalted rank. That father of hers may or
    may not be a descendant of Dom Pedro&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know ... I am inclined
    to think that he is ... but, anyway, his daughter is firmly convinced that
    she is the rightful Empress of Brazil, and that the welfare of her country
    is bound up with her destiny. And she worships her father as she does the
    good God Himself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But, Padre, that story of the throne of Brazil is sheer humbug, I
    tell you. The only descendants of the last Emperor of Brazil live in Europe.
    This man has no connection whatever with the House of Bragan&ccedil;a: he
    is nothing but an impostor, and one day that bubble is bound to burst. Marivosa
    will then find out that her father is an arrant liar. He must know that....
    What does he propose to do then? What does he think will happen?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico sighed. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll work it,&rsquo; he
    said. &lsquo;If what you say is right, and I dare say it is, then, of course....
    But, in any case, by that time she will be married, I suppose....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim had given such a jump that the bench on which they were both sitting
    tipped up, and the poor old man rolled down upon the floor. Tim, full of
    humble apologies, helped him back to his feet, and all the while kept on
    exclaiming: &lsquo;Married! Married, Padre? Are you mad, or am I? Married?
    To whom?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Her father has pledged her to a rich Brazilian whom surely you have
    met in Monsataz; they all believe here that he will help her to gain the
    throne. Because of that, I think that she is quite willing....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who is the man?&rsquo; Tim insisted.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, he is called.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Great God!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim put his hand to his forehead; he wanted to steady himself, to hold his
    wits together, which he felt were scattering in all directions. Heavens above!
    What a tangle! What an inextricable medley of intrigues and of lies! Tim
    felt as if some Titanic spider had woven a gigantic web which held him captive,
    and that the Herculean task lay before him of struggling out of this web,
    of loosening each individual thread, and trying to join it to another which
    persistently evaded him; whilst outside the web, and free from the spider&rsquo;s
    trammels, he could see all those others&mdash;Dom Mano&euml;l, the murdered
    doctor, Teresa da Pinto, and that arch-charlatan, the mysterious Great Unknown;
    and they were holding Marivosa captive&mdash;Marivosa and Dudley Stone.</p>
  <p>Tim&rsquo;s state at this moment was almost like a trance. Ever since he
    had embarked on this mad Odyssey he had had the feeling that he was leading
    a dream-life, that he was a wanderer in a kind of Wonderland, and would presently
    wake to find himself in the placid and sedate milieu of European capitals;
    but never had the sense of unreality been so strong as now when this tangled
    skein of events and intrigues was, as it were, thrust into his hands to be
    unravelled by dint of foresight, of courage, and of tact. He swung round
    to see whether the funny old priest was really there, whether he had actually
    spoken&mdash;or whether, like a dream-vision, or a sprite&mdash;he had vanished
    after delivering that stupefying blow.</p>
  <p>But Fra Federico was once more sitting placidly on the rickety bench. Tim
    had, supposedly, been silent for some time, for the old man had taken up
    his rosary and was filling in time by counting his beads.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Forgive me, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said, and sat down beside him, doing
    his very best to calm his nerves and to speak in an even voice. &lsquo;I
    was so thunderstruck by what you told me that I forgot my manners. I suppose
    you know that this man, da Lisbao, whom you have just mentioned, is the greatest
    blackguard unhung?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sh-sh-sh! you must not say that, my son,&rsquo; Fra Federico put
    in quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I do say it&mdash;for I know. Mano&euml;l da Lisbao is a liar,
    a forger, a perjurer, and a murderer; and if you lend a hand in uniting that
    black scoundrel to the loveliest creature God ever made, then you&rsquo;ll
    commit a sacrilege.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena</i>,&rsquo; the old priest murmured, scared
    like a rabbit at Tim&rsquo;s vehemence.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Marivosa is a Christian&mdash;isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;<i>Madre de Dios!</i> of course she is: she was brought up at the
    Convent of the Sacred Heart in Sao Paolo&mdash;a most pious institution.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very well, then&mdash;you have no right to let her wallow in all
    this abominable superstition over here.... Please, please forgive me, Padre
    ... it is frightful cheek on my part to talk to you like this ... but I cannot
    understand how you can contemplate the idea of a sweet Christian girl being
    perpetually humbugged by a blaspheming father who poses as a resurrected
    prophet, surrounds her with an army of bandits, and wants&mdash;for some
    nefarious purposes of his own, of course&mdash;to throw her into the arms
    of one of the vilest scoundrels on earth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what can I do, my friend? I am only a poor priest of God. What
    can I do except try to save her soul...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can, at any rate, enlighten her about her precious father; you
    may think that he has some connection with the last Emperor of Brazil, but
    you must know that he is not a prophet, either resurrected or otherwise,
    but just a brigand and a cattle thief.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But Fra Federico only shook his old head dolefully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She would not listen to me,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Is it likely?
    She has been taught to worship that father of hers. If I tried to enlighten
    her, I should be driven out of this place like my predecessor&mdash;and the
    poor souls whom I am trying to save will be damned for want of guidance.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim gave an impatient sigh. He rose and went to the door to get a breath
    of fresh air, for the atmosphere in the narrow room had become stifling.
    What was the good of arguing with this timid old ascetic, whose very existence
    in this land of brigandage was an incongruity? Nor did Tim wish to scare
    the old man too much with his vehemence, or to set him against him by arguments
    and reproaches. He did feel that he had an ally&mdash;a friend&mdash;in Fra
    Federico; and though all his senses were on the rack with impatience, he
    knew that by trying to rush matters, by endeavouring to precipitate a crisis,
    he might be courting an early and perfectly futile death.</p>
  <p>His own life had become a precious thing. He felt that he, and he alone,
    stood between an exquisitely pure and beautiful girl and the venal passions
    of a crowd of blackguards, who wanted to use her for their own despicable
    ends, caring nothing if they wrecked her life, her happiness, even her faith
    in God. The old priest, absorbed in his orisons, took no further notice of
    his guest, and Tim was left to the bitter-sweet company of his own thoughts
    and of his dreams.</p>
  <p>Of these, the one that had most absorbed his thoughts and been the mainspring
    of all his actions, namely, his quest of Dudley Stone, seemed suddenly to
    have taken a secondary place in his plans for the future. It was not so much
    of Dudley Stone that he thought, of Uncle Justin, or Hold-Hands Juliana;
    whenever his mind conjured up those faces now, a pair of dark, mysterious
    eyes, ivory cheeks and cherry-red lips would superimpose their loveliness
    over every other mental vision and blur every image with the radiance of
    their own.</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29</b></h2>
  <p>Tim had wandered out into the open. The air had grown more and more oppressive,
    and heavy clouds now hung over the rockies in the west. The storm was drawing
    nearer: it would certainly burst before nightfall.</p>
  <p>The priest&rsquo;s house was one of a number situated on a large open <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>:
    a rocky table-land, over half a mile long and equally wide, dominated by
    a spur, on the summit of which stood the stronghold of the Great Unknown.
    The houses on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> were, like that of Fra Federico, of
    more substantial construction than the bird-cage-like huts in which dwelt
    the rest of the population: this was evidently the Mayfair of Canudos. Each
    house had its veranda and its stockade, and commanded a fine view of the
    jutting rock on which was perched the castle of the veiled prophet.</p>
  <p>Tim, oppressed by the heat, stood idly by for a long time, gazing up at
    that stone construction, which was the prison-house of the most beautiful
    woman on God&rsquo;s earth. At any rate, he chose to picture her to himself
    as a prisoner, her lovely eyes perpetually fixed upon the mountain-girt horizon
    beyond which lay a world which she must be longing to know.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I swear that she shall!&rsquo; Tim registered the vow, in spite
    of the hundreds of kilometres that lay between the desert and civilization,
    and in spite of the ten thousand eyes that were set to guard her every movement.</p>
  <p>It was after he had stood staring upwards for some time, and had heard the
    first distant rumblings of the coming storm, that he first became aware of
    an unusual animation in the city, like the shuffling of hundreds and thousands
    of feet on the rocky slopes behind him. He looked down the narrow streets
    which led up to the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> and saw a crowd of people tramping
    upwards in this direction&mdash;men in their full panoply of leather, others
    just in cotton shirts and trousers, with bare feet caked in mud. Hundreds
    of people, all tramping upwards. Men and women and children. The women wore
    cotton skirts; their heads and shoulders were wrapped in woollen blankets.
    Most of them dragged naked children up with them by the hand; others hugged
    babies against their breasts.</p>
  <p>Up they came, and up, from every street that converged on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> in
    their hundreds and their thousands; while Tim, lost in amazement, stood and
    watched this extraordinary spectacle. Never in his life had he seen anything
    like it. It seemed as if the earth had suddenly opened and disgorged this
    crowd of men and women and children out of its bowels.</p>
  <p>Up they tramped, and up, and came to a halt on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>:
    all in dead silence. Not one man spoke. Not a child cried. The narrow streets
    were black with this tramping, moving humanity, like ants wandering up their
    hill. And now the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> itself was black with that moving,
    oscillating mass: a silent, dun-coloured crowd, that stared with great dark
    eyes up at the mysterious castle on the hill-top, or at the great rolling
    clouds that presaged the storm.</p>
  <p>And suddenly from the top of the hill there came the rolling of drums&mdash;a
    dull, muffled sound, unlike any other kind of drum Tim had ever heard; a
    sound that made the silence of the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> seem more eerie, more
    weird than before.</p>
  <p>Fra Federico had finished his prayers. At the first sound of the drums he
    came out of his hut.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What have they all come up here for, Padre?&rsquo; Tim asked of him,
    thankful for the old man&rsquo;s companionship in the midst of this weird
    spectacle.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To take their oath of allegiance,&rsquo; the priest replied.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My God! To that charlatan up there?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, yes!&mdash;and also to his daughter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course&mdash;to his daughter. I suppose I am awake&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t
    a dream, is it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What, my son?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This crowd. This awful silence. Those drums....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old priest smiled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought also that it was a dream ... the first time I saw them
    all ... five years ago....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why to-day?&rsquo; Tim asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because the storm is approaching.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The storm? What has it got to do with this mummery?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A good setting, my son, when the Great Unknown comes out to bless
    his people.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To bless them? Great God! You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;<i>Miserere nobis</i>,&rsquo; the priest mumbled, &lsquo;<i>libera
      nos a malo</i> ... God forgive them, poor ignorant sheep....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And are you going to stand by, Padre, and lend a hand in this blasphemous
    rubbish?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I lend no hand in any blasphemy, my son,&rsquo; Fra Federico retorted,
    with a certain simple dignity. &lsquo;The men swear allegiance to Marivosa
    da Gloria di Bragan&ccedil;a, rightful Empress of Brazil, and give up their
    lives in her cause. I know nothing of politics, nor whether the man up there
    has any claim to the throne of this country. I dare say that to you it does
    seem rubbish, but it is not blasphemous.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But this business of the resurrected prophet...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They are poor, ignorant sheep.... They mean no harm....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No harm? But there are thousands of them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thousands, as you say. And new recruits come in all the time from
    beyond those mountains, and even from beyond the shores of the Sao Francisco
    river. The former prophet, Antonio Conselheiro, had an army of twenty-five
    thousand men; for years they defied the Government up at Rio, until the whole
    lot was exterminated, or driven back into the jungle and the swamps. This
    man&rsquo;s aim is to collect an army that will march on Pernambuco. If you
    are wise, my son,&rsquo; Fra Federico added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &lsquo;you
    will herd with the crowd and take your oath as a new recruit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What? ... I? ... Play that fool&rsquo;s game...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It will be a fool&rsquo;s game for you, perhaps, but if you value
    your life...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The hint was significant and the argument unanswerable. If Tim valued his
    life, there was only one way of safeguarding it&mdash;to fall in with the
    mummery, to merge his individuality as far as possible in this conglomeration
    of brigands, dagoes and half-breeds. But, heavens above!&mdash;what a situation
    for Major O&rsquo;Clerigh of the Irish Guards! All he could do was to thank
    his stars that it was to the lovely lady of his dreams that he was expected
    to swear allegiance, and this he was ready to do. She was welcome to his
    oath, to his life, to everything that he could lay at her feet for the furthering
    of her happiness.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Prudence is the mother of valour, my son,&rsquo; Fra Federico added,
    as if to clinch the argument.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are right, Padre,&rsquo; Tim admitted, with an impatient sigh; &lsquo;as
    I have made my bed so must I lie on it; and there is a good old Irish proverb
    which says that: &ldquo;Whoever has said A, must be prepared to say B.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And if you wish to see the Empress Marivosa, senhor,&rsquo; the old
    priest concluded, &lsquo;keep your eyes open and you will see her soon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>With that prospect in view, Tim would have walked straight into Hades.</p>
  <p>The crowd in the meanwhile had grown to astonishing proportions. The men
    were congregated in the centre of the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>; some were bareheaded,
    others wore large sombreros, others again had on the leather cap affected
    by the <i>vaqueiros</i>; the women formed the outer circle of the throng,
    mere bundles of shawls and wraps, their dark faces hidden in the folds of
    their blankets, their bodies huddled up against one another, or else leaning
    against the surrounding stockades.</p>
  <p>The priest had spoken of an army of ten thousand, and this crowd did not
    fall far short of that number: and yet, on the whole <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> hardly
    a sound. Occasionally the cry of a child quickly suppressed, or else a smothered
    groan of pain, and from the summit of the hill that roll of drums unlike
    any sound Tim had ever heard before.</p>
  <p>Overhead, heavy clouds came rolling up from behind the rocky heights; a
    dull, leaden light hung in the sky; the air was terribly oppressive. Tim,
    though clad in the thinnest cotton shirt and trousers, felt stifled. Taking
    Fra Federico&rsquo;s advice, he kept close to his side while the old priest
    threaded his way through the throng. For the most part respectful way was
    made for them, and occasionally one or other of the men or women would stop
    and raise the priest&rsquo;s robe to their lips. On the edge of the plateau
    where the ground rose sharply towards the summit of the hill, there was a
    kind of rough stone altar, raised on a couple of shallow steps. Around this
    altar the fringe of the crowd had formed a wide circle, in the forefront
    of which Tim recognized several faces with which he had been familiar at
    the Bom Viagem&mdash;the fearsome Lieutenants with the significant names
    that were so reminiscent of Fenimore Cooper and Wild West shows. Black-Fang
    was there, and so was Lean-Shanks. Tim noticed that the latter threw him
    a quick, suspicious glance, and then, drawing Fra Federico aside, spoke to
    him in a quick agitated whisper.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; thought Tim, &lsquo;that my engaging friend of
    the thin legs is hastily making up his mind whether I am to be killed at
    once or left to die presently in the good cause.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently Fra Federico had been equal to the occasion. What he said to
    Lean-Shanks was repeated to Black-Fang and seemed to carry weight, for no
    more notice was taken of Tim, who was left to mingle with the crowd. The
    occasion was too solemn to worry over a mere new recruit.</p>
  <p>From over the chain of mountains in the west the storm was fast advancing:
    already one or two distant rumblings presaged the approach of thunder and
    vied with the monotonous nerve-racking roll of those persistent drums. And
    suddenly the awesome silence was broken by a sound akin to the soughing of
    the wind in leaf-laden forest trees. A great sigh had risen to thousands
    of throats, a sigh that was both joyful and expectant, and yet strangely
    weird and impish; not only were all eyes turned up now towards the summit
    of the hill, but thousands of arms were outstretched as if in prayer.</p>
  <p>To say that Tim was thrilled would be to put it mildly. He pinched his arms
    to make sure that he was alive: he sighed and he groaned in sheer excitement.  &lsquo;Am
    I mad, or sane&mdash;awake or dreaming?&rsquo; he asked himself over and
    over again.</p>
  <p>Upon the hill-top a group of men now appeared. They filed out of the stockade
    which surrounded the dwelling-house, and then slowly came down the hill.
    First came the drummers, with their long cylindrical drums suspended from
    their necks; then came a number of men armed to the teeth with miscellaneous
    weapons, guns, rifles, bayonets, sabres, lances; then another group, who
    carried banners made of coloured rags. Slowly they came down the hill-side,
    drums rolling, but otherwise in silence. Tim got the feeling that he was
    in the Pavilion Theatre in London watching one of Mr. C. B. Cochran&rsquo;s
    revues.</p>
  <p>And all at once there appeared the majestic figure of the Great Unknown.
    Mountebank, cattle thief, brigand he might be, but he was certainly majestic:
    even Tim felt impressed, and he understood what a tremendous effect this
    strange personality was bound to have on superstitious, ignorant, and mystic
    folk. To begin with, in among this sturdy but rather stocky race, the charlatan
    appeared very tall, and he had very cleverly accentuated his height by the
    blue robe which he wore draped about his long, lean figure in the manner
    of a Roman toga. His head was entirely swathed in a thin cotton material,
    which only left the nostrils free for breathing. His right arm was outstretched
    as he walked, with two fingers of the hand and the thumb extended for benediction.
    It was difficult to imagine how an ignorant cattle dealer&mdash;or whatever
    the man had been originally&mdash;could have invented all this mummery.</p>
  <p>But soon Tim ceased to contemplate the Great Unknown for, immediately behind
    him, surrounded by a crowd of women, came Marivosa da Gloria. She was lovelier
    even than she had been when first Tim saw her in the forest. She no longer
    wore the panoply of leather which had given her such a quaint, almost boyish
    appearance. Like her precious father, she wore a kind of draped robe and
    mantle which made her look like one of those beautiful marbles of Diana,
    or Artemis, in the Vatican galleries in Rome.</p>
  <p>Her head was very small, and her brown hair, which had glints of copper
    in its waves, was cut quite short at the nape of the neck. Round her brow
    she wore a straight band of gold. She was taking herself very seriously,
    the poor darling. Tim just longed to make a wild rush through that crowd
    of mountebanks, to pick her up in his arms and to run and run and run away
    with her, through forest and desert lands, over rocks and swamps, and through
    the jungle, away from this wonderland of unreality where a set of unconscionable
    blackguards were scheming to break her heart.</p>
  <p>Down she came in the wake of her father, walking solemnly, like a lovely
    little idol. Tim never took his eyes off her; he felt that by the magic of
    his love he would draw her gaze to him, and that when their eyes met he would
    convey to her the adoration and the devotion of his soul. She would understand
    just by virtue of that one glance that here were two arms ready to defend
    and guard her, to embrace and to cherish, a breast on which she could lay
    her lovely head and rest, a brain that formulated schemes for her which a
    man&rsquo;s body could carry through. She looked so sweet and so innocent&mdash;so
    proud, too, the poor darling, unaware that that mummer whom she worshipped
    would soon lay her lovely head in the dust.</p>
  <p>Down she came in the wake of her father. The drummers and the armed men
    and the banner-bearers had already ranged themselves in a semicircle around
    the altar. Fra Federico stood there&mdash;the poor, timid old man, self-deluded
    in the belief that this ceremony to which he lent the authority of his priesthood
    was not a blasphemy. The veiled man had paused beside the altar, with his
    arm still outstretched. Everyone was prostrate. Tim, in response to a look
    of appeal from Fra Federico, had perforce to kneel also: this he did facing
    Marivosa, thus rendering this act of worship to her.</p>
  <p>And suddenly a vivid flash of lightning tore the leaden clouds asunder and
    a terrific crash of thunder shook the rocky foundations of the dream-city,
    and drowned the roll of drums. After which, it seemed as if the mighty voice
    of Heaven had loosened ten thousand tongues. The men beat their breasts with
    their clenched fists, or beat against the ground with their palms; the women
    shrieked and groaned, all the children started to cry and went on crying
    unchecked. Overhead, the very heavens seemed to be at war; thunder was almost
    continuous, one flash of lightning followed another at a mere second&rsquo;s
    interval; whilst down below the people groaned and shrieked and beat their
    breasts, and the veiled charlatan stood towering above them as if he were
    the supreme power that ruled over the storm, or commanded the hurricane to
    be still, and who at will could hurl this multitude into Gehenna, or raise
    it by his benediction to Elysian fields.</p>
  <p>How long this pandemonium lasted Tim didn&rsquo;t know. It may have been
    half an hour: for him it seemed like an endless stretch of time. His knees
    ached, his head ached, his back ached, and he was furious with himself for
    being an unwilling actor in this idolatrous pageant, and furious with Fra
    Federico for having thrust him into the r&ocirc;le. It was only the sight
    of Marivosa that calmed his nerves: to look at her was compensation for all
    that he endured in the way of humiliation and impotent rage. She seemed entirely
    detached from all this mummery, and just stood there beside her father, like
    an exquisitely carved statue of ivory&mdash;a perfect body, from which the
    soul had departed, gone a-roaming into a land of dreams. Tim imagined that
    he could read her thoughts&mdash;thoughts of her great destiny, of a vast
    Empire over which she would rule, dispensing faith, hope, and charity to
    starved and ignorant souls&mdash;and he was able to groan with the best of
    these devil-worshippers in the knowledge that all her beliefs, her own faith,
    and her every hope were fated to be shattered to dust by the impious hand
    of the father whom she worshipped.</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30</b></h2>
  <p>Apparently this orgy of shrieks and groans marked the last stage of this
    amazing pageant. While the uproar gradually died down, the veiled charlatan
    turned his back on his prostrate worshippers and, preceded by his drummers
    and his men-at-arms, marched slowly back up the hill.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The King, the King of France and his forty thousand men,&rsquo; Tim
    murmured to himself, &lsquo;marched up the hill, up the hill, and then down
    again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But Marivosa da Gloria with her female attendants still remained on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>,
    and so did the majority of the fearsome Lieutenants, while the banner-bearers,
    waving their bits of coloured rags, stood in a semicircle around the lovely
    Empress.</p>
  <p>Slowly, one by one, men and women struggled to their feet and resumed their
    attitude of passivity and of silence. The storm in the meanwhile had abated
    and the air was considerably cooler; only from the farther side of the mountains
    there still came muffled rumblings and occasional pale flashes of lightning.
    The leaden clouds, chased by a north-westerly breeze, left the sky clear
    and of a deep azure. In the west, soft tones of emerald and purple heralded
    the coming sunset. Tim, gazing on the people, had the impression of thousands
    of dogs shaking themselves after a beating. He also had the impression that
    the crowd was thinning: after such tempestuous emotions even these tough <i>vaqueiros</i> and
    brigands must be longing for the peace and quiet of their bird-cages and
    their wigwams and a dish of farinha or a cup of coffee to calm their nerves.</p>
  <p>The final tableau of the pageant was of a much more simple order. There
    were some twenty or thirty men, some of them with their women and children,
    who came up in single file, each accompanied by a local inhabitant who seemed
    to act as sponsor, as far as the altar steps, and there, facing Marivosa
    da Gloria, said a few words which Tim did not understand. He supposed that
    these were the new recruits, come from different parts of the country to
    join the army of the prophet, and that they each took some sort of oath in
    their own native tongue. Some of these men were full-blooded Indians or Negroes:
    others half-breeds of varying cast of countenance and diversity of colour.</p>
  <p>Fra Federico stood by the altar and seemed to be the one to administer the
    oath. Marivosa did not speak; nor did she make a sign until after each man
    had spoken, when she just bent her beautiful little head, looking every inch
    the Empress she believed herself to be. While this went on, there was a perpetual
    roll of drums proceeding from the hill-top, and the standard-bearers shook
    their ragged banners. The fearsome Lieutenants scrutinized each recruit as
    he took the oath, whispered with one another, exchanging their views. Sometimes
    the sponsor would be challenged and there was a long colloquy, while the
    recruit stood by, trembling with fear, for obviously his life was in the
    balance.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It will be my turn soon,&rsquo; thought Tim. &lsquo;Heaven, help
    me through this mummery!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He felt that the eyes of the Lieutenants were upon him. Would he pass muster
    as a desirable recruit?&mdash;failing which there was always the ditch reserved
    for traitors. All sorts of queer thoughts gave chase to one another in Tim&rsquo;s
    mind:  &lsquo;Will this Saturnalia end with human sacrifice, and shall I
    be the first victim?&rsquo;  was one; and then the other: &lsquo;While she
    stands there, I am safe. She won&rsquo;t allow me to be butchered. But then
    she&rsquo;ll go away presently and I shall be left at the mercy of these
    savages.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Finally, he wondered what would have been Uncle Justin&rsquo;s attitude
    in these circumstances. The prince of sportsmen! What would he have done?&mdash;struggled
    for his life, one against ten thousand, or accepted the inevitable?</p>
  <p>Fra Federico&rsquo;s voice roused him from this state of mental confusion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come hither, my son.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And then the man who was called Lean-Shanks asked an abrupt question:  &lsquo;Who
    is this stranger?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He comes,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;from the shores of the great
    river. He will swear to devote his life to the House of Bragan&ccedil;a.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you sponsor him, then, Federico Evangelista?&rsquo; another man
    asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This seemed to allay some of the Lieutenants&rsquo; worst suspicions: but
    still one of them was not quite satisfied.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What language does he speak?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He speaks our language,&rsquo; Fra Federico replied, &lsquo;and also
    his native tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Speaks our language, does he? The same that they speak in Pernambuco?
    What does that mean?&rsquo;&mdash;and he promptly answered his own question&mdash;&rsquo;That
    he has been in Pernambuco and consorted with our enemies&mdash;the Government?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There were ominous murmurs. Fra Federico protested: &lsquo;It is I who sponsor
    him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But how can you know that he is not a spy of the Republicans?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>More ominous murmurs, more dark suspicious glances directed at Tim; and
    then suddenly, like a silver bell, came the words from Marivosa&rsquo;s lips: &lsquo;The
    stranger is no spy. He will serve me devotedly, and I welcome him in my father&rsquo;s
    name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>That settled the matter. Fra Federico beckoned to Tim, who stepped boldly
    up to the altar. His excitement was intense. Marivosa&rsquo;s clear, bell-like
    voice, speaking the soft-toned Portuguese, had obscured his vision of everything
    but herself. He saw nothing but her. Drawn to her by invisible and irresistible
    bonds, he came forward and then stood still, facing her, with only the stone
    altar between her and him. Conscious of the imperative necessity of safeguarding
    his life as far as possible, he repeated mechanically the words suggested
    to him by Fra Federico.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I swear obedience, loyalty and devotion to Marivosa da Gloria of
    the House of Bragan&ccedil;a, rightful Empress of Brazil&rsquo;&mdash;and
    so on through the farce, which had in it now so much of reality. &lsquo;My
    life for her service, and in her cause I am prepared to shed my blood.&rsquo; All
    very true. While he spoke the extravagant words he held Marivosa&rsquo;s
    glance as surely as a hypnotist holds that of his medium, and he had the
    satisfaction of seeing the faintest possible tinge of colour mount up to
    her cheeks and her eyelids flutter like a butterfly&rsquo;s wing.</p>
  <p>Having become a personage of some consequence, he was permitted to go round
    and kneel at the Empress&rsquo;s feet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You may kiss Her Majesty&rsquo;s robe,&rsquo; he of the lean-shanks
    commanded, with lofty condescension.</p>
  <p>How gladly does a man perform such an act of humility towards the woman
    he loves! Tim would as soon have grovelled in the dust to feel her tiny foot
    upon his neck.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I adore you,&rsquo; he murmured in English, which, except for his
    friend, Fra Federico, she alone could understand. &lsquo;You are the loveliest
    being God ever made, and He made you for me.... Before long I shall take
    you in my arms, and with my lips on yours I will give you your first lesson
    in love.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was something impish in this situation which tickled Tim&rsquo;s fancy
    so that he could have shrieked with laughter. How he forbore to put his arms
    round her then and there was a miracle of self-control. But it was the strength
    and the reality of love that controlled his actions now. His life, he felt,
    had suddenly, by virtue of his love, become one of the most precious things
    on earth. It alone stood between her&mdash;his ideal, his beloved&mdash;and
    the band of brigands who had power over her very soul. This day of strange
    events had brought him close to her at last. She had ceased to be a dream,
    and had become a woman&mdash;the one woman on earth: and Tim was fatalist
    to the extent of believing that all this would never have happened&mdash;his
    quest after the elusive Dudley Stone, his journey to this land of sortilege&mdash;if
    this flower of the desert had not been created for him.</p>
  <p>That being so, he was content to wait. Apparently the Lieutenants had accepted
    him as one of the great army and had cast off all suspicion of him, at any
    rate for the present. And now the mad pageant was over: what was left of
    the crowd was only waiting, seemingly, until the Empress finally turned her
    back upon them. This she did presently, and preceded by the banner-bearers,
    with a bodyguard of armed Lieutenants about her, she marched slowly up the
    hill. Soon she and her escort disappeared within the stockade. But to Tim
    it seemed that in the end her last look had been for him.</p>
  <p>After her departure the crowd dispersed rapidly, and Tim soon found himself
    almost alone on the wide <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>&mdash;the scene of the most
    amazing spectacle he had ever witnessed in all his life. All he could do
    was to pass his fingers through his hair, to hold on to his brains as it
    were, for they were threatening to scatter in all directions. &lsquo;Well,
    I&rsquo;m dashed!&rsquo; was the most rational thing he could say. It had
    all been so ridiculous and yet he could not laugh: it had all been so abnormal,
    so mad, and yet he knew that it was real, that he had not dreamed it all.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well! I&rsquo;m dashed!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico, timid and gentle, touched him lightly on the shoulder:  &lsquo;Take
    care, my son, all may not yet be well.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim looked down at the quaint ascetic face, with the pale eyes so like those
    of a rabbit. To himself he said: &lsquo;Thank God for this one rational,
    sane human being&rsquo;&mdash;and then aloud: &lsquo;All is bound to be well,
    Padre, for Marivosa loves me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo; the old man ejaculated piously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;God is not going to do anything of the sort. He has brought me to
    this hellish place so that Marivosa should see me, love me, and come away
    with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come away with you? Heavens alive! my son, you are mad!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know I am&mdash;or I shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have heard tell that in other countries men have learnt how to
    fly,&rsquo;  the old man said, with a dubious shake of the head. &lsquo;I
    call it impious, because God never intended men to fly or He would have given
    them wings ... but unless you have learnt the impious art, my son, you cannot
    escape unseen from Canudos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The impious art of flying! Do say that again, Padre. It is the most
    refreshing thing I&rsquo;ve heard said in all my life. But joking apart,
    let me assure you that the impious art can certainly not be practised in
    this God-forsaken land.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go in, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said irrelevantly. &lsquo;I
    am sick of this place now Marivosa has gone. You shall read your Shakespeare,
    and I&rsquo;ll make plans for kidnapping the Empress of Brazil.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31</b></h2>
  <p>All night there was a rumbling of distant thunder. Tim hardly slept a wink.
    Just before dawn he rose and, slipping on his cotton shirt and trousers,
    he wandered barefoot down to the stream to bathe. It was very cold, but he
    welcomed this change from the oppressive heat of the day. After splashing
    about in the sweet, clean water, he felt better: his brain was clearer, his
    nerves were more steady. He slipped back into his clothes, meaning to wander
    back to the priest&rsquo;s hut, when a stirring in the tall coarse grass
    lower down the stream arrested his attention. All he thought at the moment
    was that a kindred spirit had, like himself, come down here to bathe, and
    as he did not think that many of the inhabitants of Canudos were much inclined
    that way, he felt rather curious to know who it might be. He tucked up his
    cotton trousers and waded down the shallow stream, peeping cautiously about
    him as he went, for he had already realized that in this place one never
    knew whence an unpleasant arrow or some other flying weapon might unexpectedly
    come.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he paused. He had heard a voice&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s voice&mdash;a
    laugh that was the most delicious music mortal ears could possibly hear.
    There were other voices, too&mdash;women&rsquo;s voices&mdash;but what did
    they matter? What did anything matter except the fact that the woman he adored
    was now within a few yards of this clump of tall grass behind which he, Tim,
    crouched like a criminal. In his school days he had been taught the story
    of the chaste goddess who struck a man with blindness because he had seen
    her in her bath. He quite felt that in this land of sorcery something like
    that might very easily happen to him. But that didn&rsquo;t matter either.
    All he knew was that he was not going away from here without seeing her,
    or without a word.</p>
  <p>Now, Tim O&rsquo;Clee believed in his luck, and in this instance luck did
    favour him. He waited for a time until there was no more splashing in the
    water and certain words, dropped at random, suggested that the Empress and
    her ladies were putting on their clothes. Then he peeped out cautiously from
    between the grasses. At some little distance a dozen or so young women, some
    of them of a deep coffee-colour, others almost white, were busy with clothes
    and blankets or whatnot. Isolated from them, and not more than twenty yards
    from where Tim was crouching, there was Marivosa, looking more like an image
    of carved ivory than ever: for she had draped a white cloth all about her
    exquisite body. She was doing nothing in particular, only gazing at the water,
    or now and then at the sky.</p>
  <p>Tim made a sound like the plaintive cry of some little beast in pain. The
    girl heard it: she turned her head and listened. The others were too far:
    they had not heard. Tim repeated the cry, a little more loudly this time,
    and gently stirred the grasses around him. Again she listened&mdash;paused&mdash;listened
    again: then when the cry fell for the third time upon her ear, she came slowly,
    cautiously, in the direction where the clump of grass still quivered in Tim&rsquo;s
    hand. He thought that his heart would burst with excitement. It was pounding
    away in his breast like a sledge-hammer. And now she was quite close. The
    first thing he saw was one exquisite little hand, as she pushed the grass
    aside, and then her foot.... Then she saw him, and uttered a cry&mdash;not
    a loud one, fortunately. The others didn&rsquo;t hear. She would have stepped
    back, and probably run away before Tim had the chance of freeing himself
    from the reeds, but he was too quick for her. He had her in his arms before
    she could move, and if she did intend to call to the others she could not
    do it, because he held her cherry-red mouth imprisoned with a kiss.</p>
  <p>Of course, she struggled. Of course, she was furious, indignant&mdash;hated
    him no doubt, at this moment, and would as soon have killed him as not. But
    it was the first kiss she had ever received; it was the first time that strong
    arms had held her close; the first time that between two hot kisses words
    came tumbling out, words she had never heard before: &lsquo;My divine lady,
    I adore you!&rsquo; And then those strong arms encircled her closer and she
    felt a heart-beat right against her own. The arms at first were round her
    shoulders, her arms were pinioned with inseverable bonds, and hot kisses
    seared her neck and throat; that was the moment when she felt most indignant;
    when, had her arms been free, she would have struck that arrogant male in
    the face. But now the steel-like bonds were around her knees, and the man&rsquo;s
    head was down in the very roots of the grass, and his hot lips were pressed
    against her foot.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My divine lady ... kill me if you wish ... I have lived my life
    ... I wish for nothing now!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He remained there crouching at her feet for a long, long time; and somehow
    her wish to kill him died away. She was still indignant, of course. Very
    indignant. And furious, because her cheeks were as if they had been scorched
    in front of the fire. She put her hands up to her face. Just for a moment
    she wanted to cry. But he looked up just then, and there was such a look
    in his eyes that all she could do was to turn her head away.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I worship you!&rsquo; he murmured. And he stretched out his arms
    and put his two hands around her head, and drew it down, down, so that she
    lost her balance and fell right up against his breast, with her head nestling
    upon his shoulder and her face quite close to his.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I will not steal another kiss, <i>madonna mia</i>,&rsquo; he whispered:  &lsquo;but
    give me your lips....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Nor did he steal that kiss the rapture of which made her not only forget
    how indignant she had been a short while ago, but also ashamed that she was
    no longer indignant now.</p>
  <p>Primitive man had gained the victory. Captive of his bow and spear, captive
    of his love and passion, the mysterious flower of the desert lay passive
    upon his breast.</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32</b></h2>
  <p>They both woke from their love-dream with the sound of voices quite close
    to their sheltering arbour of grass. Tim was more scared than she was; womanlike,
    having taken the plunge, she cared not one jot what happened after this.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your maids, or whatever they are,&rsquo; Tim whispered; &lsquo;they
    might come round.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let them,&rsquo; she retorted, smiling with lofty unconcern; &lsquo;they
    don&rsquo;t count.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You adorable thing! If they don&rsquo;t count, so much the better.
    The day is young&mdash;I have not even begun to make love to you yet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But, like a woman again, she back-pedalled at this.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There are plenty of other days,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and I must
    go now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Must you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I always go to my father at this hour. He likes to see me early in
    the morning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you do when you go to him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We talk.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What about?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The affairs of the country&mdash;our plans for the future&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She paused, and suddenly a cloud seemed to fall over her face; its gaiety
    died down, there was a troubled look in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The future,&rsquo; she reiterated vaguely.</p>
  <p>Obviously she had forgotten, in this new experience which had come into
    her life, what kind of a future her father had planned for her. She was standing
    close to Tim at this moment, while he still squatted upon the bed of grass:
    he held her two little delicate hands, and looked up at the exquisitely moulded
    face and into those dark, mysterious eyes in which he had kindled the first
    glow of love.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your future, my divine lady,&rsquo; he said slowly and earnestly, &lsquo;is
    no longer in your father&rsquo;s control. God has given you to me. Your future
    rests with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head slowly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We are not masters of our own destiny, senhor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Tim,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Say it, my dear, just
    like that&mdash;Tim.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled. It was a wan little smile this time, and tears gathered in her
    eyes. Now, to a lover like Tim O&rsquo;Clee there is a great deal of joy
    to be got out of tears that may be dried with a kiss, and Marivosa quickly
    learned the lesson that crying may be very sweet under certain circumstances.
    As a matter of fact, she soon came to the conclusion that she had never hated
    anyone so much as she did those women over there who were looking for her
    and calling her by name.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I must go,&rsquo; she said, and sighed; and then she added softly, &lsquo;Tim!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll only let you go if you&rsquo;ll promise to come to that
    place&mdash;you know&mdash;where first I saw you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When?&rsquo; she asked na&iuml;vely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You adorable thing! Why not to-day?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is difficult for me to go so far&mdash;alone!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anywhere else, then. I don&rsquo;t care, so long as I see you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I go to the chapel sometimes, to pray.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The chapel?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Fra Federico Evangelista knows. He will tell you. He says Mass there
    sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He never told me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps he thinks you are a pagan, or a heretic. The English are
    heretics, I know, so perhaps&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At this moment I am nothing but a pagan, for I am worshipping you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If Fra Federico says Mass to-morrow I shall know, and I will come.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But heavens alive! How am I going to live until to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said na&iuml;vely, &lsquo;sometimes he has Benediction&mdash;that
    is at sunset&mdash;and perhaps to-day&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If the old reprobate does not have Benediction to-day, I&rsquo;ll
    kill him!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Tim!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not yet!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-bye. Ask Fra Federico to have Benediction in the chapel to-day.
    You can let go my hands now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! I swear I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-bye ... Tim!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>How she managed to get away he didn&rsquo;t know, but suddenly she was gone,
    and only the trembling of tall grasses showed which way she went. Tim&rsquo;s
    first impulse was to struggle to recapture her; the thought of the hours
    which lay before him until sunset was in itself a kind of mild torture. But
    the cackling of the women brought a glimpse of common sense into his disordered
    brain.</p>
  <p>It were perhaps indiscreet to pry now into the secrets of Tim O&rsquo;Clee&rsquo;s
    soul. Alone between earth and sky he lay, with face buried in the grassy
    bed on which the exquisite body of Marivosa had rested. The love that had
    come to him in this desert land was the strongest and purest emotion of which
    a man&rsquo;s soul is capable: to him, Marivosa was a perfect flower, the
    delicate petals of which he had caressed with rapturous ecstasy. She had
    lain against his breast, pure and innocent as a child, whilst with his lips
    on hers he had kindled in her the first spark of passion.</p>
  <p>For the moment he had no thought of the future: he had taught her to kiss,
    and in time she would learn to love&mdash;two things that are co-equal and
    yet are a world apart. She, the half-civilized child of the desert, would
    one day grace his home in Ireland with her presence; and never for a moment
    could he doubt that she would be just as perfect in the stately surroundings
    of Traskmoore as in the mysterious solitude of Canudos.</p>
  <p>The remembrance of Traskmoore came to him while he lay in the grass dreaming
    of Marivosa ... Traskmoore! ... Between him and his home there still hovered
    the elusive personality of Dudley Stone. His love for this desert child,
    born as it were in a mirage, had certainly for the time being weakened his
    ardent desire to run that mysterious personage to earth. In this God-forsaken
    land, far from the haunts of men, surrounded by customs, spectacles, personalities
    that might as well have belonged to a prehistoric age, life over in Europe,
    Traskmoore, Hold-Hands Juliana were fading into insignificance. So entirely
    absorbing had been his desire to see Marivosa again, to speak to her of love
    and to kindle response in her heart, that nothing else in the whole wide
    world seemed to matter any more; and as day had followed day without another
    glimpse of her, and she remained as intangible as a dream, he had been ready
    to bargain with fate&mdash;had been, in fact, prepared to throw in his lot
    with all these brigands, and to swear allegiance to any mountebank, or unclean
    spirit even, if possession of Marivosa had loomed ahead as his ultimate reward.</p>
  <p>But those days were now past. Marivosa was no longer a dream product: she
    had materialized, lain in his arms, with her warm red lips clinging to his.
    He had conquered her, won her: she was his already by virtue of her love
    for him. Thoughts of home, of civilization, of Ireland, were the natural
    outcome of his victory. The knowledge, too, that she was the innocent pivot
    round which revolved every conceivable ghoulishness and crime: that, in fact,
    for some secret purpose of his own her abominable father was throwing her
    into the arms of that arch-scoundrel, Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, set Tim&rsquo;s
    imagination stirring for the means&mdash;the prompt means&mdash;of fleeing
    with her out of this Gehenna. Fra Federico might talk as he would of difficulties&mdash;of
    impossibilities even&mdash;in a lover&rsquo;s lexicon is there ever such
    a word as <i>impossible</i>? Tim, lying there in the grass, with the vision
    of his beloved still so vivid, that with closed eyes he could trace every
    line of her loveliness, laughed at obstacles, at rocky strongholds and fastnesses,
    at the trackless wilderness, and at the army of ten thousand brigands.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She belongs to me, and I&rsquo;ll have her,&rsquo; he declared. &lsquo;God
    gave her to me. He brought me here that I should take her away out of this
    hell. He won&rsquo;t go back on His purpose. God does not do such things.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33</b></h2>
  <p>The little chapel&mdash;it was hardly worthy of the name&mdash;was situated
    on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>, not far from Fra Federico&rsquo;s house. Tim
    had not noticed it before. It certainly was undistinguished. A square box-like
    construction, which had once been plastered over and painted, but from which
    the paint had long since faded and the plaster peeled away. The tiled roof
    was surmounted at one angle by a roughly carved stone cross.</p>
  <p>It was in this desolate little hole that Fra Federico ministered to the
    souls of a few Christianized barbarians. From time to time he would say Mass,
    and a hundred or so men and women would congregate round him and hear with
    due reverence the age-old words in a language they did not understand. Perhaps
    it was because they did not understand the words which Fra Federico mumbled
    at the improvised altar that they held him in such respect, and concealed
    from him the fact that they alternated attendance at the Mass with visits
    to their Gri-gri man. They would confess their sins&mdash;or such actions
    as they considered were sins&mdash;to Fra Federico, and take Holy Communion
    in much the same spirit as they swallowed a decoction of lizard-blood and
    toad spittle or other abomination brewed for them by the witch-doctor.</p>
  <p>Fra Federico did his best with them, and in some cases succeeded in inculcating
    Christian civilization into these barbaric minds. But it was a difficult
    task, for often after a morning spent in confession and atonement there would
    come an order from the Great Unknown to start off on an expedition which
    had for its goal the looting of some distant village store that had lately
    been supplied with provisions, or the driving of a herd of bullocks that
    had excited the charlatan&rsquo;s cupidity.</p>
  <p>The uphill task had its compensations, however, in the few simple souls
    that tried to keep away from the savage life of this desert community. Fra
    Federico in his na&iuml;ve way had taught them the elements of Christianity,
    had administered to them the Holy Sacraments: and when he saw a small crowd
    of these humble folk kneeling inside the tumble-down chapel he felt indemnified
    for all the heartache which he endured in this perpetual fight against superstition
    and idolatry. Marivosa gave him endless joy. She had been thrust into a convent
    at Sao Paolo when she was little more than a child. Pious, cultured women
    had brought her up and taught her all they knew. She had proved responsive
    and had absorbed eagerly all the knowledge which the nuns had been able to
    impart. True that knowledge of the world had not been part of the curriculum,
    and that the books which she had been allowed to read were only those that
    her father confessor had approved; but, even so, she had imbibed a great
    deal of general information and not a little of literary and artistic culture.
    She was not yet sixteen when that arch-reprobate, her father, dragged her
    out of the shelter of the Sao Paolo convent after he had made the discovery
    that he had an exquisitely beautiful daughter who would be a valuable asset
    to him in his many tortuous schemes. Since then her intercourse with Fra
    Federico had been the one bright spot in her lonely life. She worshipped
    her father because his mysterious personality had captured her imagination
    when she was at a most impressionable age, but she had nothing in common
    with him; she looked up to him, perhaps not as to a resurrected prophet,
    but certainly as to a man endowed with supernal powers and a scion of the
    Imperial House of Brazil. But intellectually he was no companion: he despised
    all books as the product of effeminate brains&mdash;nothing appealed to him
    but action and virile physical force.</p>
  <p>At the same time he did not object to his daughter&rsquo;s friendship with
    the old priest: he had, in fact, a certain amount of respect for Fra Federico,
    chiefly because Fra Federico knew how to cure him of his bodily aches and
    pains. It was because of his rudimentary medical knowledge, and not because
    of his priestly calling, that the old man enjoyed immunity among this tribe
    of brigands; if he chose to perform what the Great Unknown and his Lieutenants
    called <i>hocus-pocus</i> in his tumble-down little barracks&mdash;well!
    that was his affair. What he did there was no worse than what the Gri-gri
    man did over by the river bank, or the witch-doctor in front of his dog-hole.
    It was only the warriors of the Great Unknown, his fighting force, who were
    forbidden to take part in the <i>hocus-pocus</i>. It was all right for women,
    that sort of thing: even the Empress could listen to Federico&rsquo;s mumbo-jumbo
    if she chose; but any man who lent himself to that rubbish was little better
    than a woman, and there was no room for women in the army of the Great Unknown.</p>
  <p>With the result that in Canudos religious services could not be held very
    often during Fra Federico&rsquo;s brief visits to the place. Opportunity
    had to be snatched when the Great Unknown and his fearsome Lieutenants were
    either in a conciliatory mood or busy with other things: otherwise unpleasant
    interruptions, desecrations, even sacrilege might break in on the peace and
    solemnity of the service. But when an opportunity did arise, then the word
    would quickly go round and Mass in the early dawn, or Benediction at sunset,
    would see a procession of worshippers winding its way slowly up the hill.
    Were it possible to analyse the mentality of these mystic barbarians, it
    would probably be found that their attitude towards Fra Federico&rsquo;s
    form of worship was that it could not do any harm, Federico Evangelista being
    a good and learned man, who knew how to cure ague and subdue a fever: and
    there might, after all, be something in it, in which case it was best to
    be on the safe side.</p>
  <p>And so some came to worship and some just out of curiosity. There was room
    for about a hundred inside the chapel, but usually a couple of hundred and
    more would stand outside on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> listening to the thin,
    quaking voice of Fra Federico as he intoned the Latin words. A good many
    came also in order to catch sight of the Empress. She would come down from
    her castle with half a dozen women; and though some of these men were not
    far removed from savagery, though they lived a life of brigandage, with their
    cattle for chief company, and though their own womenfolk had nothing left
    of feminine charm, Marivosa&rsquo;s beauty had a strange power over their
    minds. For them she was not quite earthly: and though they did not believe
    in angels, they felt that she belonged to a spiritual world that was beyond
    their ken. As the daughter of the resurrected prophet she was in their opinion
    endowed with supernatural powers; and often as she passed the men would bow
    their heads down to the ground, and the women would push their piccaninnies
    forward so that they might lay their baby hands on her robe.</p>
  <p>Marivosa, who had remained ardently a Christian, knelt devoutly throughout
    the service. As a rule her thoughts never wandered from the holy texts expounded
    by Fra Federico, nor did her eyes stray from her book or from her reverently
    clasped hands. But to-day, during Benediction, she had the feeling that there
    was something at the back of the chapel which distracted her from her prayers:
    she had, in fact, the feeling that an invisible power got hold of her head
    and forced it to turn round and look behind her. This was at a very solemn
    moment of the service, when her eyes should have been riveted on the altar:
    instead of which, she turned and saw Tim. She only had a very brief glimpse
    of his dark head and of his blue eyes which seemed to shine through the gloom:
    for the next moment she was down on her knees, prostrate, begging the Holy
    Virgin to forgive her for this sin. It was strange how long the service lasted
    to-day: surely Fra Federico had interpolated several new prayers. It was
    very hot, too, and her knees ached: and it was with a real&mdash;though a
    sinful&mdash;feeling of relief that she knelt down for the final benediction.</p>
  <p>When it was all over, she called Fra Federico and begged him to tell the
    people to go.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell them not to wait for me, father. I am tired and want to be alone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico did his best. He transmitted the Empress&rsquo;s wish to her
    subjects as if it were a command. Obediently they dispersed. The chapel,
    too, was soon clear. The Empress&rsquo;s maids had been ordered to wait outside,
    for Her Majesty would now make her confession and it would be an hour or
    more before she would be ready to return to the castle. And Marivosa asked
    Fra Federico to let her pray and meditate alone. Her father had told her
    certain things, spoken to her of marriage: and she wanted to ponder over
    it all.</p>
  <p>It must be supposed that Fra Federico&rsquo;s eyes were dim and that he
    did not see that dark head vaguely outlined in the gloomiest corner of the
    little chapel: certain it is that in answer to Marivosa&rsquo;s desire for
    privacy all he said was:  &lsquo;Very well, my daughter. God bless you. Remember
    the Holy Virgin and your guardian angel never cease to watch over you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A pious admonition which caused Marivosa to blush. Her guardian angel, she
    thought, must have been rather startled this morning while he was watching
    over her in the grassy arbour. Fra Federico picked up her rosary which had
    slipped to the ground and placed it in her hands: then he softly stole away.</p>
  <p>The next moment Tim was by her side, his arm round her, her head upon his
    shoulder. The more sacred the place, the more holy the deed&mdash;if the
    deed be one on which God does not frown. And who shall dare say that God
    frowns on a kiss?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am so ashamed,&rsquo; Marivosa murmured.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ashamed of what, you angel? Not of this, surely?&rsquo; And the recreant
    kissed her again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is a sin,&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You get that out of your darling head. There is no sin in love&mdash;not
    in love like ours&mdash;and what would be the good of love if there were
    no kisses?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This will be the last time I shall ever see you, Tim,&rsquo; she
    said presently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is not,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;That is another thing that
    you must get into your darling head: that you belong to me, and that I am
    going to take you away from here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know that that is impossible,&rsquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing is impossible, my sweet, when one loves.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never take a step without I&rsquo;m seen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then we must steal away when it is so dark that not even a cat&rsquo;s
    eyes could follow us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My father&rsquo;s eyes are sharper than any cat&rsquo;s. He has spies
    everywhere: and we don&rsquo;t know the way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be done, nevertheless, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. I don&rsquo;t know yet. Since I&rsquo;ve seen
    you I&rsquo;ve thought of nothing but your beauty. But reason will come along
    presently, and then we&rsquo;ll make plans and go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wish I could believe you. But...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no <i>but</i>, my sweet. We are going away together, I tell
    you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She looked up at him. He was smiling with such sublime confidence in himself,
    and his Irish eyes flashed such power and so much resolution that, like a
    bird that has been frightened and now feels reassured, she edged nearer still
    to him and nestled closer still in his arms.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are quite sure?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite sure.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where shall we go?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At first, no farther than a place called Queimadas. We&rsquo;ll take
    Fra Federico with us. There is a real consecrated church in Queimadas, so
    he told me once, and we&rsquo;ll get married there, and Fra Federico will
    perform the ceremony.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have read the service for holy matrimony in my prayer book,&rsquo; she
    said na&iuml;vely. &lsquo;It is very beautiful.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are adorable! My God! what a lovely time we&rsquo;ll have!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;After we are married, what shall we do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll make straight for Pernambuco and sail for Europe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Europe? I was in Europe when I was a child. I told you, I think.
    My mother was alive then. I think she is dead now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you mean? You think she is dead? Don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not for certain. I haven&rsquo;t seen her for years and years. I
    used to ask my father about her, but he never seemed to care to say very
    much, so after a little while I gave up asking.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you remember her at all&mdash;or were you too young?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do remember her&mdash;she was very beautiful.... Would you like
    to see her picture?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I would&mdash;very much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I always carry it about with me&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s photograph,
    I mean&mdash;also my dear father&rsquo;s picture, and the few letters they
    wrote to me from time to time while I was at the convent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>While she spoke she drew a small flat packet from inside her gown; it was
    carefully tied up with a faded piece of blue ribbon and wrapped in a piece
    of thin silk. Marivosa undid the precious little parcel very carefully. It
    contained a few old letters and a couple of photographs. She took one of
    these and held it out to Tim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; she said softly, &lsquo;she must have been lovely,
    don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim took the photo and looked at it. Only a feeble light came through the
    tiny grated window, but he saw the picture well enough: the shock of dark
    shingled hair, with the one heavy wave falling over the left eye, the full
    lips and huge white teeth, and the large goggled eyes. <i>Hold-Hands Juliana!</i></p>
  <p>Marivosa&rsquo;s tiny hand came to rest upon his coat sleeve, her eyes turned
    to his and then back to the photo, mutely reiterating the query: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
    you think she must have been lovely?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim could not speak; all he could do was to stare down at the photo. Hold-Hands
    Juliana! Marivosa&rsquo;s mother! It seemed to him as if the ground had suddenly
    opened and that unless he held himself very stiff and erect he would fall
    headlong into a yawning abyss. Hold-Hands Juliana! The mother of this exquisite
    woman whom he adored. Surely there was laughter both in Heaven and Hell at
    this stark, naked fact. Why, he himself could have laughed and laughed, but
    for this feeling that he must hold himself stiff and erect for fear of tumbling
    headlong into a yawning abyss.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her for years and years. Perhaps, when we go
    to Europe, you will help me to find her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice recalled Tim to himself. He blinked his eyes and had another good
    look at the photo. He turned it over and looked at the back of it; there
    was an inscription, written in English in a handwriting he had often seen
    before: &lsquo;Your loving mother, Juliana Stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Juliana Stone? Why, of course! Amazement had addled his brain for the moment,
    but now it all came back to him. The stark, naked fact that must have provoked
    laughter both in Heaven and in Hell.... &lsquo;Your loving mother, Juliana
    Stone.&rsquo; Then ... then&mdash;or was he going mad?&mdash;then, in that
    case, her father, the arch-charlatan, the mountebank, the Great Unknown,
    was Dudley Stone, and ...</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tim, are you ill? Is it the heat?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, dear&mdash;why?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are so silent&mdash;so funny....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thoughts, sweetheart, thoughts&mdash;all sorts of queer thoughts.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you are all right?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perfectly all right. Let me kiss you once&mdash;no, never mind about
    the chapel and the altar&mdash;just one kiss, and I shall feel better ...
    I shall be ill if you don&rsquo;t kiss me....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then a pause&mdash;and Tim felt better.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Show me your father&rsquo;s photograph now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But she shook her head. &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; she said,
    in that quaint artificial manner she always assumed when she spoke of her
    father. &lsquo;No one is allowed to see his face. He is the Great Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She was adorable. But, God in Heaven! What a situation! Dudley Stone, the
    Great Unknown! Alive! Here in the desert! Playing the fool for all sorts
    of reasons, each more nefarious probably than the other&mdash;loot, piracy,
    treasure-hunt: all this mummery to keep his band of brigands tied to his
    fortunes by dint of mysticism and superstitious fear.</p>
  <p>Dudley Stone! And this adorable woman his daughter! And away in beloved
    Ireland, Hold-Hands Juliana enjoying life and fortune, not knowing that the
    house of cards which she had built up on the foundations of lies and perjuries
    was on the point of tumbling about her ears.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My beloved one,&rsquo; Tim said at last&mdash;and then again: &lsquo;My
    beloved one!&rsquo;  All he could do was to put his arms round her and to
    press her closely to his heart. No more trouble, no more fear now; and she
    would have no reason to regret the imaginary crown of Brazil, for he was
    in a position now to offer her a real sovereignty amongst his people at Traskmoore&mdash;far
    more brilliant, more stable, and more desirable than what she had been taught
    to expect.</p>
  <p>Indeed, the world went very well for Tim O&rsquo;Clee during this happy
    hour which he spent in this tumble-down barn with his beloved. Dudley Stone
    was found&mdash;he was alive! &lsquo;God&rsquo;s in His Heaven! All&rsquo;s
    right with the world!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Though Marivosa refused to show her lover the photograph of her mysterious
    father, she allowed him to look through some old letters which he had written
    to her while she was still a little girl at the convent of Sao Paolo. They
    were all signed: &lsquo;Your loving father, Dudley Stone.&rsquo; The last
    two or three referred to his going over to Sao Paolo to fetch her from the
    convent and take her to live with him in his new home in Canudos: &lsquo;Where,&rsquo; he
    said, &lsquo;a glorious and splendid life awaits you, worthy of your rank.&rsquo; These
    letters were dated 1925, nearly a year after his supposed death at Monsataz
    which had been sworn to by Hold-Hands Juliana and her accomplices.</p>
  <p>Holding Marivosa clasped in his arms, Tim talked to her of Ireland and of
    his home, of the stately elm trees, with their cool shadows in which it was
    so good to lie on hot summer afternoons: and of the chorus of nesting birds
    in the spring when the morning air shook with the melody of thousands of
    bird throats. He told her of the silvery lake and the plumed reeds upon its
    shores which sang such tender songs when the summer breeze stirred their
    stately heads, and of the water-lilies with the great shiny leaves on which
    little frogs sat and croaked; of the woods through which they would soon
    wander together&mdash;his arm round her, her head against his shoulder.</p>
  <p>And then about the satin-skinned Irish hunter on which she would ride, the
    meets in Traskmoore courtyard on a cold winter&rsquo;s morning, the fences
    and the water-jumps and the gallops across country and ploughed fields, the
    horn of the huntsman, the find&mdash;the kill; and about Uncle Justin, and
    the stables and the kennels, and the quiet evenings after a day&rsquo;s hunting&mdash;tired
    and happy&mdash;just the two of them alone in the snug boudoir at Traskmoore.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And then,&rsquo; he concluded, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll turn on the gramophone
    and sing to you the sweet Irish ballads which Uncle Justin loved.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Tim!&rsquo; she exclaimed, and turned great worshipping eyes
    upon him.  &lsquo;Can you sing?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Can I sing?&rsquo; he retorted. &lsquo;You shall hear me&mdash;not
    now, perhaps, because it might attract a crowd; and there&rsquo;s Fra Federico
    at the door, come to break up the happiest hour of my life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes! you must go now, Tim ... but to-morrow we will meet again....
    And you are sure, quite sure, Tim, that you can take me away from here without
    annoying my father?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am quite sure,&rsquo; he replied, with sublime self-confidence, &lsquo;that
    your father himself will elect to come with us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head and sighed. &lsquo;Not to Europe. In Europe they would
    not understand the Great Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are right there, sweetheart; they would not,&rsquo; and Tim was
    conscious of a swift vision of the veiled prophet arriving in the boat-train
    at Victoria Station with his fearsome Lieutenants&mdash;&rsquo;so perhaps,&rsquo; he
    added reassuringly, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll persuade him to assume the disguise
    of an English gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And in this mood they parted: she to dream of this newly-found happiness
    of which she had not even heard the nuns in the convent speak&mdash;it was
    unknown to the pious sisters seemingly&mdash;and she, Marivosa, thought it
    so wonderful that it should come to her; and he, Tim, to plan his interview
    with Dudley Stone which must come about on the morrow. Would the charlatan
    be amenable to reason? Was he sick of all this play-acting and only too ready
    to re-enter civilization again? Tim was prepared with munificent offers:
    the Traskmoore fortune was large enough to satisfy the greed of any adventurer,
    and after all said and done, the chief reason for this mummery was loot and
    brigandage&mdash;Dudley Stone himself could not believe in the possibility
    of a political revolution which would place his daughter on an ephemeral
    throne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is not such a blithering ass as all that,&rsquo; argued Tim to
    himself,  &lsquo;and I can make it worth his while to give up his fool&rsquo;s
    paradise for a life of luxury.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And for the first time for many a day he ceased to think of Marivosa for
    at least half an hour.</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;No one allowed to enter!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>These were the words which greeted Tim O&rsquo;Clee when on the following
    morning he made his way to the top of the hill to the castle of the Great
    Unknown. It stood entirely isolated, perched on the extreme summit of the
    hill, and surrounded by arid rocks and clumps of stunted palms and dwarf
    bushes. It consisted of a roughly-constructed stone dwelling, with a tiled
    roof: the whole built in the shape of a capital L. A high stone wall surrounded
    its extended courtyard. That much could be seen from the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> below,
    but once past the belt of scrub and palms only the encircling wall was visible,
    with heavy wooden gates hermetically closed. Nor did any amount of pounding
    and hammering on the gates bring the slightest response, although the sound
    of people moving about, of men&rsquo;s voices, and even the clatter of arms
    and pawing of horses&rsquo; hoofs, proved conclusively that there was plenty
    of life going on, on the other side of the stone wall.</p>
  <p>Since hammering on the gate was no use, Tim decided to enter the fortress
    by stratagem, recommending his wits to Saint Patrick for an inspiration.
    Safely hidden behind a clump of dwarf bushes he waited patiently for some
    event to favour him, but nothing happened for close on half an hour. No one
    came through the scrub, the gates remained closed, and the sound of men and
    horses still went on inside the courtyard.</p>
  <p>It was still early morning and the heat not too great. Tim, flat on his
    stomach peeping from behind the bush, waited, trusting in Saint Patrick&rsquo;s
    help. And presently he heard a steady tramping coming up the hill. &lsquo;Thank
    you, Saint Patrick,&rsquo;  he murmured and waited, on the alert. A few minutes
    later he saw a number of <i>vaqueiros</i>&mdash;a hundred or so&mdash;come
    straggling up the incline. Some of them were in their leathers, but quite
    a number were dressed the same as Tim, in cotton shirts, and trousers tucked
    into their high boots. They came up in groups of ten or a dozen at a time,
    silent as usual, and swinging their arms as they walked. And Tim, coming
    out boldly from his hiding-place, joined up with one of these groups and
    walked up with them, silent, and swinging his arms.</p>
  <p>The men all came to a halt by the gate; and when the last of the stragglers
    had assembled, they set up a call, which sounded not unlike the howl of a
    wolf. In response to this the gates were opened and the men filed in, with
    Tim among them.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well! I&rsquo;ve got that far, anyway,&rsquo; he murmured to himself
    with self-satisfaction.</p>
  <p>He found himself in a wide courtyard, with the castle in front of him. Along
    one side of the building was the usual wooden veranda, to which a flight
    of wooden steps gave access from the courtyard. A number of small barred
    windows and a number of doors gave on the veranda.</p>
  <p>The courtyard was already full of men&mdash;<i>vaqueiros</i> in their leathers
    who appeared to be on parade. Lean-Shanks and Black-Fang had seemingly inspected
    them. They stood at what might pass for attention, and Tim noticed that they
    all carried very modern-looking rifles. Their eyes were fixed upwards, all
    staring in one direction; and Tim, glancing up also, saw that the veiled
    mountebank was on the veranda. At the moment he was making a gesture of dismissal;
    and the men who had been on parade broke ranks and hastened out of the courtyard,
    whilst the new contingent took their place.</p>
  <p>Major O&rsquo;Clerigh of the Irish Guards had no intention of submitting
    to inspection by these bandits. He stepped boldly across the courtyard in
    the direction of the building, but was brought to a sudden halt at the foot
    of the wooden staircase by a vice-like grip on both his shoulders, and a
    couple of bayonets pointing at his lower chest, while a voice from somewhere
    or other called loudly:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No one allowed to enter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim offered no resistance; only said in a voice loud enough to reach the
    ears of anyone up on the veranda:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have an urgent message for the Great Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Give me the message. I will take it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This time Tim recognized the rasping voice of Lean-Shanks&mdash;a huge,
    loose-limbed half-breed, with a grip like steel, a cruel mouth, and furtive,
    piercing eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My orders are to deliver the message to no one save to the Great
    Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This was greeted with a sneer from Lean-Shanks and a derisive laugh from
    the other Lieutenants, who had strolled across the courtyard in order to
    have a closer look at this impudent intruder.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah! your orders are to deliver the message to no one save to him
    who is lord over us all,&rsquo; the half-breed said with insolent deliberation. &lsquo;And
    who has dared to give you such orders, I would like to know,&rsquo; he added
    with sudden violence.  &lsquo;Where does he live?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In Monsataz,&rsquo; Tim replied. &lsquo;I come from there with an
    urgent message from one who is known to your lord.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It is to be supposed that the followers of the Great Unknown were not often
    caught speaking with such self-confidence; certain it is that the mulatto,
    as well as the other Lieutenants, appeared doubtful at this point as to what
    they had better do. Two of them still held Tim tightly by the shoulders,
    and the bayonets were still pointed at him; but Lean-Shanks did start a whispered
    consultation with one of his colleagues, and Tim, through the corner of his
    eye, saw them looking up at the veranda as if waiting for orders, whereupon
    an impish idea seized him, and he said aloud in English:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have an urgent message for you. You&rsquo;ll be sorry if you refuse
    to see me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The fact that Tim spoke in a language that they did not understand did not
    worry the Lieutenants. They were used to men coming from all over the country,
    each speaking his own dialect. But apparently the Great Unknown had made
    them a sign, for suddenly the grip on Tim&rsquo;s shoulders was lifted, the
    ominous bayonets raised. Lean-Shanks and his pal continued their whispered
    conversation, wherein Tim felt that his fate was being discussed. For the
    first time since he had embarked on this final project of his, Tim realized
    that he had very effectually run his head into a noose and that at this moment
    his life was only worth a wave of the hand from that veiled charlatan up
    there. He certainly passed a few minutes of very unpleasant suspense, during
    which, for the umpteenth time in his life, he cursed himself for an impetuous
    fool. Then suddenly a peremptory voice from above called to Lean-Shanks,
    and there followed an animated conversation between the Great Unknown and
    his Lieutenant in a language which Tim did not understand. The conversation
    presently drifted into a one-sided oration from above, Lean-Shanks merely
    nodding his head from time to time and showing his large white teeth in an
    unpleasant-looking grin.</p>
  <p>However, the upshot of this was that the grip was lifted from Tim&rsquo;s
    shoulders and the bayonets vanished from his line of vision. Lean-Shanks
    then said:  &lsquo;Follow me!&rsquo; and led the way up the wooden stairs,
    Tim immediately following. Down in the courtyard a hundred pairs of eyes
    followed Tim&rsquo;s progress upwards; obviously the admittance of a mere
    nobody into the great presence had never been witnessed before.</p>
  <p>When Tim and Lean-Shanks reached the veranda, the veiled figure was no longer
    there. Lean-Shanks led the way through one of the doors, and as soon as Tim
    had followed in his wake, he closed that door behind him. Tim found himself
    in a small square room, with a grated window set high up in the wall facing
    him, through which he only caught a tiny glimpse of the sky. Lean-Shanks
    curtly ordered him to wait and then disappeared through another door on the
    left. While he waited, not without a feeling of nervous excitement, Tim heard
    again the peremptory voice speaking some dialect or other; and, after a moment
    or two, Lean-Shanks returned, held the narrow door open, and beckoned to
    him to enter.</p>
  <p>Tim walked in; the door was closed behind him, and he stood alone in the
    presence of the Great Unknown. He sat on a chair with a high back; there
    was a table in front of him littered with papers. His head was swathed in
    a veil, but he wore fairly ordinary clothes: flannel shirt and trousers,
    and a wide sash round his waist, and he had on a pair of brown shoes, and
    wore a wrist-watch&mdash;two things which added a strange note of incongruity
    to the surroundings. There was a carpet on the floor and several chairs ranged
    against the walls. All the furniture looked as if it had come out of a good
    cabinet-maker&rsquo;s hands. Tim had not seen any like it since he left Monsataz.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You claim to have a message for me?&rsquo; the Great Unknown said
    in Portuguese, after the first few moments of silence during which Tim felt
    that a pair of piercing eyes were scrutinizing him from behind the veil.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, we&rsquo;ll talk English,&rsquo; Tim retorted
    firmly, and, without waiting to be asked, he dragged a chair nearer to the
    table and sat down facing the veiled man.</p>
  <p>Rather to his surprise the latter replied in English also.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; he said, and then added: &lsquo;What is your
    message?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me begin by introducing myself to you. My name is Traskmoore.
    I am a Major in the Irish Guards, acting Brigadier-General during the War,
    now retired. Until I succeeded to the title on my uncle&rsquo;s death two
    years ago I was Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh&mdash;you have heard the name when
    last you were in England.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The veiled man did not take up the challenge; and after a few seconds he
    asked, speaking very slowly and still in English: &lsquo;And why have you
    come here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim answered boldly: &lsquo;To find you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>After which there was absolute silence in the room.</p>
  <p>The veiled man had not made the slightest sign nor uttered the faintest
    exclamation: he sat there, in his high-backed chair, like some strange and
    ghostly image. Tim kept his eyes fixed upon the veiled face before him, trying
    with all his might to guess at what went on behind those folds; but though
    he could vaguely discern the outline of a prominent nose and long, hard chin,
    and felt, rather than saw, the fixity of a searching gaze which rested upon
    him, he could not gauge how this sudden revelation had affected the mountebank.
    After a while the silence got on his nerves; it had become so tense that
    he almost thought he could hear the ticking of the other&rsquo;s wrist-watch,
    and the stertorous breathing of someone&mdash;Lean-Shanks probably&mdash;the
    other side of the door.</p>
  <p>When he could stand the silence no longer he said: &lsquo;Would you like
    me to lay my cards down on the table? We are Europeans, both of us&mdash;not
    half-civilized barbarians. Shall I tell you the purpose of my coming to this
    God-forsaken hole?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you please,&rsquo; the veiled man replied curtly.</p>
  <p>This attitude of aloofness on the part of the charlatan was certainly disconcerting.
    Tim wondered what he was playing at. He had already made it pretty clear
    to this play-actor that he, Tim, had no doubt as to his identity, and also
    that he was approaching him now in an entirely friendly European spirit.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Would you mind taking off that veil?&rsquo; he asked good-humouredly. &lsquo;I
    should find it easier to talk sense if you would.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You will have to talk sense, nevertheless, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Major&mdash;I
    forget your name....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Traskmoore is my name, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Dudley Stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>No! the man did not wince. He certainly had nerve. All he said was:  &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
    have to be brief, too, I have no time to waste&rsquo;&mdash;which nearly
    caused Tim O&rsquo;Clee to lose his temper. Fortunately he had tight hold
    over himself. His whole fortune and that of the woman he loved depended on
    this man&rsquo;s good will&mdash;not altogether, perhaps, because there were
    those photographs and the old letters which Marivosa had shown him, but difficulties
    could be got over so much more smoothly if only this abominable charlatan
    would be amenable to reason.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Mr. Stone,&rsquo; Tim said firmly, &lsquo;let us, in heaven&rsquo;s
    name, understand one another like two decent civilized Europeans. I have
    travelled thousands of miles for the sole purpose of finding you&mdash;alive,
    I hoped. God only knows what I haven&rsquo;t been through before I got here;
    but now here I am, and, thank heaven&mdash;here you are also. If you won&rsquo;t
    take off that stupid veil, you won&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s that; but do
    let me assure you, on the word of honour of an Irish gentleman&mdash;and
    you still remember what that means, don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;that my feelings
    towards you are entirely friendly, and that my greatest hope at the present
    moment is that when I go back to Europe it will be in your company and that
    of your&mdash;adorable daughter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The veiled man leaned forward in his chair and rested his arms on the table.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You really interest me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Mr.&mdash;or should
    I say Lord Traskmoore?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The latter, if you please,&rsquo; Tim replied cheerily. &lsquo;As
    a matter of fact, your being alive at this moment, sitting opposite to me,
    has made it possible. So you see ... But for God&rsquo;s sake take off that
    awful veil, or I shall begin to think that you are a leper, or something
    horrible.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Suppose you get on with what you have to say, Lord Traskmoore&rsquo;&mdash;and
    to Tim&rsquo;s sensitive ear there appeared to be an ironical emphasis on
    his name&mdash;&lsquo;I have already told you that you interest me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t much more,&rsquo; Tim went on, in a harsh, rather
    rasping voice, for his nerves by now were getting frayed. &lsquo;I have already
    told you that I came to this God-forsaken hole in order to find you. I sincerely
    hoped that you were still in the land of the living, but if you had gone
    west, I wanted a solid proof that you, Dudley Stone, were still alive in
    the month of October, 1924, when your wife, Juliana, went through a ceremony
    of marriage with my uncle, the Earl of Traskmoore, whose legitimate heir
    I had always held myself to be.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very interesting&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t quite see...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You will in a moment. I am taking it for granted that you, as an
    Englishman, still have that sense of justice and fair play for which your
    country, and mine, too, are famous. I don&rsquo;t want to pry into your affairs.
    They are no business of mine, but I am not such a fool as not to guess that
    you have amassed an immense fortune in this unhallowed spot. But, hang it
    all, man, you must be sick of it all by now, with no one but niggers to talk
    to! Well now!&mdash;what do you say? Come back to Europe with me: give me
    a hand in seeing justice done to my poor self. It is a big fortune that you
    will help to throw into my lap and all you have to do is to name your own
    price. You won&rsquo;t regret it, I swear you won&rsquo;t. I do believe,
    once you are back in England, and have met one or two of your old friends,
    you&rsquo;ll never want to get back here&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be far happier
    as plain Mr. Dudley Stone than as the mysterious over-lord of this horde
    of savages. Millionaires have a very good time in Europe these days....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim paused, chiefly because he was out of breath&mdash;he had never made
    such a long speech in all his life&mdash;but also because he felt that his
    nerves were getting more and more on edge, and that his voice grew more and
    more rasping, almost shrill; while the veiled man made no sign, nor uttered
    a word, only kept that veiled face of his turned fixedly upon him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, man, say something!&rsquo; he cried out at
    last, driven to exasperation by the silence, the statue-like stillness of
    that veiled and mysterious image. &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; he went on, with
    a forced laugh, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t talked all this time without making
    some impression upon you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What impression did you expect to make?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have appealed to your sense of fair play and justice, for one thing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not to mine&mdash;to that of an imaginary person whom you named Dudley
    Stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim gave a long, low whistle. So that was the game, was it? The rascal wanted
    a big price probably&mdash;bigger than he imagined Tim was prepared to pay,
    and thought that a little more of this mummery would prove the right kind
    of thumbscrew to apply in order to gain his own ends. Aloud, he said: &lsquo;Put
    it that way if you like. But anyway, I am now offering you&mdash;whatever
    you choose to call yourself&mdash;one-third of my entire fortune, which was
    sworn for probate two years ago at three million English pounds, if you will
    accompany me on a trip to Europe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A million English pounds! A princely offer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This time there was more than a suspicion of irony in the man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Which means, I suppose,&rsquo; Tim said dryly, &lsquo;that you count
    your wealth by the million and that one more or less does not tempt you&mdash;any
    more than an appeal to your sense of justice.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>No answer. Silence. Fixity. And now, in the atmosphere of the narrow room,
    the first sense of approaching danger. The man&rsquo;s statue-like calm had
    become ominous. Tim was conscious of a weird foreboding, a presage of something
    evil and mysterious which threatened him at the hands of this veiled, impenetrable
    image. But his mercurial temperament would not allow him to give way to any
    such fancies; fear for his own safety had never been a part of his character,
    and as soon as he felt the silence weighing his spirits down, he broke it
    with what might pass for a light-hearted laugh.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That being the case,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you had best hear my
    final argument. I admit that it is the strongest of all, but it means so
    much to me that I hardly like to speak of it at all ... I have seen your
    daughter ... I have spoken with her ... I love her beyond everything on earth....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim paused. For the first time since the beginning of the interview he had
    seen the statue-like figure give a distinct start. &lsquo;At last,&rsquo; Tim
    thought,  &lsquo;I have touched a vulnerable spot.&rsquo; Aloud, he said: &lsquo;I
    am not a vain man, but I do know that Marivosa loves me&mdash;she is a mere
    child and perhaps does not quite understand, but ... Well!&mdash;never mind
    about that. I know that she adores you, that she believes you, and that,
    poor darling!&mdash;she believes in all that rubbish about her being Empress
    of Brazil.... Now, I cannot imagine that you, her father, can fail to worship
    such an exquisite creature as Marivosa: therefore I put it to you, as one
    civilized man to another, do you really think it fair to go on hoodwinking
    her like this? She will have to be undeceived presently, and if she has nothing
    else to fall back on in the way of happiness, the poor darling will break
    her heart.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Once more silence and absolute calm.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My finding you here alive,&rsquo; Tim went on earnestly, &lsquo;has
    made me a rich man. I can give Marivosa all the luxury&mdash;everything,
    in fact, that any woman can desire, not to mention love and loyalty.... Well!
    never mind about that. She&rsquo;ll soon forget all this business over here.
    After a bit it&rsquo;ll seem like a dream, for she&rsquo;s not happy now.
    You know she is not, but I swear that as my wife she shall never know one
    moment&rsquo;s unhappiness. Now do you see why I just beg you to come to
    Europe and help me put everything right over there&mdash;for Marivosa&rsquo;s
    sake? If you don&rsquo;t...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo;&mdash;and the voice from behind the veil came loud and
    peremptory&mdash;&lsquo;why do you hesitate?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t see why I should not tell you straight
    that I am not really dependent on your good will for getting my rights. I
    came to you with a sporting offer, as man to man, and you refuse to listen
    to me. Well! you may have your reasons for that. I don&rsquo;t know what
    they are and I don&rsquo;t care. Just answer me one straight question and
    I won&rsquo;t trouble you again. Will you allow Marivosa to come away with
    me? I swear to you that she loves me. Will you let me take her away from
    here and make her my wife?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The answer had, at any rate, the advantage of being straight and to the
    point. The veiled man had not moved: he only spoke the word in a hard and
    peremptory tone.</p>
  <p>Tim rose, and said quietly and with a very good assumption of light-heartedness:  &lsquo;Very
    well! then there&rsquo;s nothing more to be said. I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;ve
    taken it that way. I hoped we might have been friends, for we have both of
    us suffered at the hands of the same woman&mdash;though each of us in a different
    way. However&mdash;now I shall have to fight my battles myself, which is
    all to the good as far as I am concerned. Don&rsquo;t vent any spleen on
    Marivosa, will you? It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair, would it? She loves me, and
    she&rsquo;s going to be my wife&mdash;that is a fact which is as unalterable
    as the laws of the Medes and Persians.... Well! s&rsquo;long, old man! We
    won&rsquo;t shake hands on it, will we?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>With a light laugh he turned and went to the door. Still the veiled man
    did not speak. Tim pushed open the door and stepped out. The next moment
    a loud oath broke from his lips: &lsquo;You devil! You treacherous devil!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Lean-Shanks and three of his colleagues had been waiting for him. Two pairs
    of hands seized hold of his arms and twisted them backwards with a violent
    jerk; two more were entwined round his legs, so that he lost his balance
    and came down on his knees. He struggled fiercely, desperately, but already
    his arms were being tied behind his back with a rope; then, when he knew
    that it was a four-to-one fight and that the game was up, he threw back his
    head and laughed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tim O&rsquo;Clee,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;you are the biggest
    fool that ever walked on God&rsquo;s earth.&rsquo; But he said nothing aloud,
    because one of those damned niggers was forcing his head back so that he
    thought his neck would break, whilst he stuffed a thick wad of something
    soft into his mouth.</p>
  <p>The last thing he was conscious of was the tall figure of the veiled charlatan
    standing over him and of his sepulchral voice saying slowly in English:  &lsquo;Fool!
    you utter, damned fool! You thought by chucking a few miserable pounds at
    me you would persuade me to give up wealth such as you with your silly brain
    never dreamed of ... and you dared make love to my daughter, did you? Well!
    she&rsquo;s not for you&mdash;see....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then he spoke to his Lieutenants:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Throw this garbage away,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If he&rsquo;s still
    alive to-morrow morning, you may shoot him or do anything else you like with
    him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim was just conscious enough to hear those beastly niggers chortle; then
    one of them struck him a violent blow on the head, and the last thing that
    reached his fading senses was a derisive laugh and an ironical voice calling: &lsquo;S&rsquo;long,
    old man!&rsquo;</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35</b></h2>
  <p>An eternity had gone by since Tim had regained partial consciousness. He
    was lying on a mud floor: his arms were tied behind his back and a thick
    rope was wound round his legs. His head ached furiously, and he was terribly
    hungry and still more thirsty.</p>
  <p>Eternity had been spent in vain, bone-breaking, nerve-shattering struggles
    to get his arms free&mdash;all in vain; those damned niggers knew how to
    truss a man securely. Once or twice Tim fainted: partly through the pain
    in his head, partly through the foul atmosphere and filthy exhalations from
    dank walls and earthen floor. The place was in total darkness: never since
    it had been built had any outside air penetrated within its walls.</p>
  <p>It was while he was slowly returning to his senses after one of these syncopes
    that a familiar voice came to his ears. At first he only caught a few disjointed
    sentences.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There were rumours on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> ... I feared it might
    be you ... Holy Virgin and all the Saints...! What incredible rashness...!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim slowly opened his eyes. The voice was Fra Federico&rsquo;s. Heavens
    alive! How welcome! A door somewhere had been left open and a streak of faint,
    grey light revealed the vague outline of the old priest bending over Tim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well! I&rsquo;m in for it this time, Padre,&rsquo; said Tim ruefully.</p>
  <p>The old man woefully shook his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Whatever induced you...?&rsquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To beard that cursed charlatan in his den?&rsquo; Tim broke in, with
    a shrug of his aching shoulders; &lsquo;I thought he was a white man, you
    see&mdash;and never dreamed he would be such a damned traitor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If only I could do something for you....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose you can&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No man alive can help you, my son.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Could you, at any rate, undo these cursed ropes, Padre? It is so
    awful being trussed like a bally fowl.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old man&rsquo;s weak and trembling fingers fumbled for a long time with
    the cords, but at last he succeeded in loosening them, and with a final effort
    Tim got his arms and legs free. He stretched them with a sense of ease, though
    his limbs still ached furiously. He sat on the mud floor, with legs stretched
    out, since there was no attempt at furniture in the dank cell. The old man
    squatted on his heels.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You must think me such a blithering fool, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said,
    with a shamed laugh.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Rash, my son,&rsquo; the priest replied, &lsquo;very rash. Your story
    is all over the town&mdash;a stranger, so they say, a spy of the Government
    of Rio come to assassinate the Great Unknown, and was caught in the act.
    He is to be shot in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shot or worse, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said dryly. &lsquo;I have no illusions
    on that score, and I wouldn&rsquo;t care&mdash;much, because such a fool
    as I am has really no business to live. But it is on her account....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When you see her, Padre, tell her that I ... tell her ... No; never
    mind, don&rsquo;t say anything to her. She&rsquo;ll understand, I think.&rsquo; He
    paused a moment, and then added: &lsquo;There will only be you now to look
    after her. And though I have behaved like the biggest fool outside Bedlam,
    I did just have sense enough not to carry what money I still possessed about
    with me when I went to visit that scurvy brigand. You will find a few thousand
    milreis in my pocket-book, Padre&mdash;you know, the old black one under
    my pillow in the hammock. Will you use that for the purpose of getting the
    poor darling into a convent? She will be better there, now that I can&rsquo;t...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But the old man only shook his head dolefully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You attribute powers to me, my son,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that I
    don&rsquo;t possess. I no more can stay the course of events in this place
    than I can, like Joshua, bid the sun to stand still. It was by the greatest
    miracle that I got here at all. One of the sentinels in charge of you had
    bad colic last night. I brought him some pills&mdash;they did him good and
    he was grateful&mdash;so I persuaded him to let me have a look at the prisoner
    ... I pretended it was curiosity ... and so...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>While the old man meandered on in a sad and dreary voice a strange change
    had come over Tim. Tired and stiff, he had struggled to his feet and started
    to pace up and down his murky prison cell; the habits of a lifetime caused
    him to re-adjust his shirt and trousers about his person, for they had been
    much damaged during his futile struggles with the Lieutenants. By the same
    token he unhitched and then re-buckled his belt, and it was while he did
    this that this sudden change came over him. He no longer listened to the
    old man&rsquo;s well-intentioned talk: actually, he forgot his aches and
    pains, the hopelessness of his position, his shame at his own folly ... his
    fingers had come in contact with a small phial which a few days ago he had
    tucked into the small pocket in his belt.</p>
  <p>And now, when Fra Federico ceased speaking, trying to find the right words
    with which to introduce a subject that lay very near his heart, Tim paused
    in his restless pacing and squatted down beside his old friend. Had the light
    been a little less dim the priest could have seen a smile&mdash;a real, happy
    smile&mdash;hovering round the condemned man&rsquo;s firm lips; nor would
    he have failed to note a twinkle and a glimmer of hope and self-confidence
    in the Irish blue eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As you were saying, Padre?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Even the voice was clearer, fresher: with a ring in it that to Fra Federico&rsquo;s
    sensitive ears almost sounded like triumph and joy. &lsquo;Though, alas!
    he is a heretic,&rsquo; thought the old man, &lsquo;God has touched him with
    His grace: he does not fear death, and has hopes of eternal life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Aloud, he said: &lsquo;I spoke too much of earthly things, I fear, my son,
    when my sole object in coming to see you was to try and help you to turn
    your thoughts now to God.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are the kindest friend man ever had, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said,
    still with that happy smile upon his face. &lsquo;Would it comfort you if
    I told you that my whole train of thought has changed, all within the last
    two minutes?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can see that God&rsquo;s grace, Padre&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;something
    else.... No! I&rsquo;m not blaspheming&mdash;I feel humble and thankful....
    Oh! you can&rsquo;t think how thankful ... and I&rsquo;ll listen to any sermon
    you like to preach to me. You can recite the prayers for the dying, if you
    like, and I&rsquo;ll listen to them most reverently ... and I&rsquo;ll hum
    the &ldquo;Dead March&rdquo; to you&mdash;I know most of it&mdash;and if
    you want me to confess my sins to you, I&rsquo;ll even try to do that....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t scoff, my son. Remember...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t scoff for the world. I swear that I have never been
    so earnest or so reverent in all my life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you feel that you have a grievous sin upon your conscience...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lots and lots, Padre ... lots of sins, but none very grievous, unless
    you&rsquo;d call a longing to strangle that damned mountebank a sin ... and
    there are at least two other human fiends I would murder to-morrow if I got
    the chance.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The prisoner was obviously getting light-headed. Fra Federico captured his
    hands, and spoke kind, soothing words to him. In his soft tired voice he
    said the things that lay nearest his heart: the brevity of this miserable
    life, the freedom from sorrow only to be found in death, the felicity of
    eternal life. Tim would sooner have choked than interrupt the old man. To
    this pious ascetic, pitch-forked by the most amazing fate into this lair
    of brigands and savages, to talk to a fellow-Christian was an infinite joy
    and comfort; and reaction had set in as far as Tim was concerned: after hours
    of nerve-strain, sleeplessness, physical pain and mental anguish, this soft
    droning of a sympathetic voice acted as a soporific; his eyes closed, his
    head fell forward, and, still squatting on his heels, his hands imprisoned
    in the kindly grasp of his friend, he slept.</p>
  <p>When he woke again, after a very few minutes, he was once more in total
    darkness, and Fra Federico had gone.</p>
  <p>His fingers at once returned to the small pocket in his belt: they found
    the small phial and drew it out cautiously. With his teeth he loosened the
    cork, and holding the phial to his nose he sniffed it. Some of the last words
    which the veiled mountebank had spoken came ringing back to his ears.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Throw this garbage away. If he&rsquo;s still alive to-morrow morning
    you may shoot him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And what he, Tim, thought at this moment amounted to this: &lsquo;It is
    a chance, anyway.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He was still smiling. That Celtic, optimistic temperament was not playing
    him false: nor did the Irish sense of humour. He kept thinking of the Old
    Vic in London. Fancy thinking of the Old Vic in London while squatting in
    this pitch-dark, filthy hole, waiting to be shot&mdash;or something&mdash;on
    the morrow!</p>
  <p>But he did think of the Old Vic and of a performance he had seen there of <i>Romeo
      and Juliet</i>: of Juliet taking the draught given her by the Friar, which
      was to simulate death for her, so that she need not marry Paris and could
      remain faithful to her Romeo. And he also thought of Fra Federico as another
      Friar, dispensing the precious liquid, showing him the row of little bottles
      and saying in his gentle, tired voice: &lsquo;It interested me to gather
      all the herbs which your great Shakespeare mentions in his plays, and to
      concoct those potions which play such an important part in some of his
      tragedies.&rsquo; Then Fra Federico had talked of Romeo and Juliet, and
      recited the piece when the Friar gives Juliet the precious phial:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And then again:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;... thy eyes&rsquo; windows fall,<br>
    Like death, when he shuts up the
    day of life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Tim had been so interested: the whole thing had so fired his Irish imagination
    that he had begged the old man to give him a small bottle of what he called &lsquo;Juliet&rsquo;s
    cold poison.&rsquo; He had not really believed in it then&mdash;just an old
    dreamer&rsquo;s hobby, he thought&mdash;and he did not altogether believe
    in it now.... It was just a chance&mdash;and Tim, being Irish, liked to take
    his chance, especially with the prospect before him of being handed over
    to Lean-Shanks &amp; Co., to do what they liked with him.</p>
  <p>Well!&mdash;old Shakespeare, who knew most of what there is to know of human
    nature, did not make Juliet a coward. She took her chance; and Tim O&rsquo;Clee,
    tossing down the contents of the phial at a draught, took his also.</p>
  <h2><b><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36</b></h2>
  <p>There are moments in the life of every adventurer worth his salt that he
    would give years of his life not to have gone through: moments when manhood
    is at its lowest ebb, when humiliation begets shame, and the wish to die
    becomes so strong that it is akin to despair. There is no brave man living
    who has not had his moments of cowardice: who has not once in his life felt
    the pangs of physical fear, or shrunk from facing the horrors of an unforeseen
    doom.</p>
  <p>Tim, when he woke out of the coma into which Fra Federico&rsquo;s potion
    had thrown him, went through such an experience&mdash;felt the cold sweat,
    not of fear, but of unspeakable horror. He woke, at first only to semi-consciousness,
    to find himself lying on his back, under the clear star-lit canopy of night,
    on a bed, the feel of which he could not define. What he was chiefly conscious
    of was the awful stench that poisoned the midnight air and brought about
    a violent fit of nausea. He was frankly and horribly sick; and it was when
    he turned over on his side that he realized what the bed was on which he
    lay. It was composed of hundreds of corpses in a varying state of decomposition.
    A nightmare, such as Dante in his wild imaginings could alone have dreamed!
    And he, Tim, was lying on the top of these dead men; and as he turned over
    on his side, pieces of rotted flesh fell away from the bones, and skeletons
    rattled beneath his weight. A pale moon issuing from behind a veil of clouds
    shed a dim light over this Inferno, and Tim, luckily, fell into a swoon before
    its full horror was thus revealed to him.</p>
  <p>When he awoke, the first streak of lemon-coloured light had rent the banks
    of clouds in the east. It was bitterly cold. Tim, clad only in cotton shirt
    and trousers, shivered until his teeth chattered, and his limbs felt as if
    they were encased in ice.</p>
  <p>Dawn! What dawn? Was it only an hour ago that he had been thrown out like
    offal into this ditch?&mdash;the ditch reserved for traitors, and spies of
    the Government&mdash;or had he laid here two days and two whole nights, the
    only living thing in this open, unclean sepulchre? Had he been left here
    as dead, and as dead been left to rot, or become the prey of carrion?&mdash;or
    would the bodyguard of the Great Unknown come round presently to see whether
    among this heap of garbage there was still a spark of life extant which it
    was their duty to quench?</p>
  <p>This was the moment in the adventurer&rsquo;s life to escape which he would
    have bartered all his best years: the moment when an overwhelming shame deprived
    him of the very desire to live, when the wish to die killed the very sense
    of hope. To be dead before these fiends returned: to close his eyes in the
    last long sleep before the rosy dawn drove away the night.</p>
  <p>The rest is silence. Who shall dare probe the secrets that lie hidden with
    a brave man&rsquo;s soul? Horror, despair, a nameless, numbing fear: and,
    above all, the bitter humiliation, the shame of folly and of failure&mdash;Tim
    O&rsquo;Clee knew them all during this agonizing hour, and shared the knowledge
    only with his Maker.</p>
  <p>Then came the reaction. It came with the sudden lighting up of the desert
    by the risen sun, by the torrid heat of day that came instantly on the top
    of the iciness of the night, and turned the shivers of cold that shook Tim&rsquo;s
    spine into an ague-like fever. With the fever came a rush of blood to the
    head: a certain light-headedness, followed by a sense of bravado, a defiance
    of fate and a contempt of self, all of which are peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon
    and the Celtic temperament. Had Tim been really and fully conscious, he would
    probably have put his feelings into some such words as: &lsquo;I am dashed
    if those savages are going to get the better of me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>As it was, he took his bearings, set his teeth, and crawled out of the noisome
    ditch. Fortunately it was neither deep nor precipitous: hands and knees did
    all that was required. Again, fortunately, the rascal who had robbed him
    of his boots, and of his leather belt, had not thought it worth while, apparently,
    to take his shirt and trousers: at least he was not naked and could dare
    to creep out into the open. But he proceeded cautiously before he ventured
    to glance over the top. There was no one about&mdash;no reason, of course,
    to mount guard over the dead, and the ditch of traitors was a long way out
    of the city, facing the north and in the rear of a rocky promontory, which
    Tim presently tried to scale.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I must look a disgusting object,&rsquo; he said to himself, when
    after much effort, much scraping of hands and knees and considerable damage
    to cotton trousers, he reached the stony eminence, from whence he was able
    to survey his own position and the lie of the city. It lay before him like
    a map; the narrow streets, the bird-cage huts, the stone habitations of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> in
    this land of brigands, the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> where he had witnessed the
    most astounding spectacle of superstition and sorcery, and the so-called
    castle where dwelt that mighty charlatan, that arch-traitor, mountebank,
    devil incarnate, whom Tim now cursed up and down with all the forceful language
    which his state of weakness had left at his command.</p>
  <p>When he had done cursing, he felt again very sick; the sun was blazing down
    upon him, his skin was burning, and he felt icy cold; his legs would hardly
    bear him. Spying a clump of scrubby palms, he crawled into their shade.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Something has got to be done, Tim, my lad,&rsquo; he said to himself. &lsquo;And
    to begin with, food of sorts and drink must be got somehow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He knew by now something of the Sertao, and his brief but close friendship
    with Fra Federico had revealed to him some of the secrets of this arid land.
    He had learned how to look for water-holes, and where these were most likely
    to be found: and where there was a water-hole, there also would the deep-rooted <i>patatas</i> be
    found. Naked, monotonous, inhospitable as was this desert-land, it furnished
    food and drink for cattle, and what was good for cattle was in Tim&rsquo;s
    present desperate condition good also for him.</p>
  <p>Throughout the ages the greatest incentive for man&rsquo;s enterprise and
    courage has been the necessity to feed himself, and Tim found that he had
    quite a good deal of strength left in him to go in search of a water-hole.
    When he found one, he drank of the water first, and washed himself in it
    afterwards: then, having found a clump of <i>patatas da Vaqueiro</i> close
    by, he pulled some up and ate, recommending his digestion to the tender care
    of Saint Patrick. After which sumptuous meal, he stretched out his aching
    body in the shade and went to sleep.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing to be done till nightfall,&rsquo; he murmured, as he slipped
    away into the Land of Oblivion. &lsquo;After that, we shall see.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37 </b></h2>
  <p>Fra Federico&rsquo;s time at Canudos had come to an end, and to-morrow would
    see him on his way to another less strenuous scene for his activities. He
    felt very sad because there were one or two strong sentimental ties that
    bound him to this arid, inhospitable spot. There was Marivosa for one&mdash;a
    pure, sweet soul, whom he implored the Holy Virgin to take under her protection:
    and there were, perhaps, a score of Christian souls, who he hoped had learned
    to resist the many temptations to sin and crime which were so constantly
    thrown in their way. As for that nice rash young heretic&mdash;Fra Federico
    caught himself shedding a tear over his terrible fate. He had been too defiant,
    too sure of himself: had not been content to follow humbly in God&rsquo;s
    Will. Thank God! he, Fra Federico Evangelista, had had the privilege of receiving
    his last confession and had spoken the comforting words of absolution in
    his ear.</p>
  <p>And Fra Federico busied himself packing up his books, and his phials and
    pill-boxes; and in the interval, when he was tired, he recited his rosary,
    and asked God to bless the Christian souls who lived in the Sertao&mdash;with
    special reference to the nice young heretic who at the last had no doubt
    seen the truth&mdash;and to forgive all those who sinned against His laws.</p>
  <p>And suddenly the open doorway of his humble abode was darkened by the appearance
    of a figure, which caused the pious old priest to throw up his arms and to
    fall upon his knees, praying God to have mercy on his soul, for he beheld
    a ghost.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go, Satan, go!&rsquo; he ejaculated, &lsquo;in the name of the Father,
    and of...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But a whole-hearted if somewhat harsh laugh broke in upon his orisons.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t Satan, Padre; only a miserable shred of humanity.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The voice was unmistakable&mdash;and surely a ghost neither laughed nor
    talked. It was the young heretic, no doubt; but had he risen from the dead,
    or...?</p>
  <p>Tim was already by the side of the old man, and his arms were round the
    thin, bent shoulders.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me help you up, Padre,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you are all of
    a tremble.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>With Tim&rsquo;s aid, Fra Federico struggled back to his feet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My son!&rsquo; he exclaimed feebly, for his fright had upset his
    weak old heart, so that it pounded away in his chest and deprived him of
    breath, &lsquo;where in heaven&rsquo;s name do you come from?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;From the grave, Padre,&rsquo; Tim replied seriously. Then, seeing
    that the old man&rsquo;s cheeks had become the colour of ashes and that his
    poor thin lips were quivering, he went on more lightly: &lsquo;They thought
    I was dead, and did not waste either their time, or powder and shot on me,
    but just treated me like hog-wash and threw me into a ditch, on the top of
    decaying corpses and rattling skeletons.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sit down, my friend,&rsquo; Fra Federico said more calmly, &lsquo;and
    tell me more clearly ... I am a little bewildered ... that is, I don&rsquo;t
    really understand.... You say that...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim O&rsquo;Clee embarked upon a succinct narrative of everything that had
    befallen him from the time when his old friend left him alone, fast asleep
    in the murky prison cell, until the happier moment when, unable to contain
    his impatience any longer, he had braved detection and made his way, with
    infinite precautions, to the door of Fra Federico&rsquo;s abode. Long after
    he had finished his story the old man sat with clasped hands entwined in
    his rosary, murmuring his Pater Nosters and Ave Marias. Tim was loath to
    break in on his meditations; but at last the priest drew a long, deep sigh,
    and he said: &lsquo;Ah!, he is a wonderful man, your great Shakespeare. Next
    to the good God Himself, it is he who saved your life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Next to God and you, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said earnestly. &lsquo;Do
    you remember giving me that little bottle?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, I do. But I never thought...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nor did I. I meant to take it back with me to England and send it
    to the bigwigs of the medical profession, with notes about you, Padre, and
    what a wonder you really are ... and now I have drunk it all, and I can swear
    what a wonderful thing it is ... so you will have to give me another bottle.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You make fun of me, my dear young friend. My poor experiments wouldn&rsquo;t
    interest the great ones of the world.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they just? You give me another bottle, Padre, of your
    wonderful liquor and I&rsquo;ll guarantee that your fame will be all over
    the world in no time. You&rsquo;ll have to come to Europe, and they&rsquo;ll
    give you a splendid appointment&mdash;something to do with the Pope in Rome&mdash;with
    lots of money and a beautiful house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim babbled on, half-intoxicated with his own eloquence, and his jaded nerves
    taking the form of excited loquaciousness. He felt light-headed, very sick,
    very giddy, and had but little idea of what he was talking about.</p>
  <p>Fra Federico smiled indulgently, and passed quivering fingers over his precious
    phials.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am too old, my son, for splendid appointments, for money, or beautiful
    houses,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is that the bottle?&rsquo; Tim said, as the old man paused and with
    loving eyes gazed on a small phial which rested in his hand almost as if
    it were alive.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes! This is it. The last draught I possess.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will you trust me with it, Padre?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I will, my son. Not for my sake&mdash;I care no more for
    fame now&mdash;but for the honour of your great Shakespeare, to prove that
    in this, as in everything else, he was always learned and always right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He handed the small phial to Tim, just as if he were parting from something
    more precious than life. Tim took it and clasped it tightly in his hand.
    It was with a tightening of the heart that he watched his old friend tottering
    about among his few belongings; the poor old knees were very shaky, and the
    thin, frail hands trembled all the while that they fingered the books and
    the phials that had been the solitary ascetic&rsquo;s only source of joy.</p>
  <p>After a little while Tim rose and said: &lsquo;A wash and a shave is what
    I need most now, Padre, and with your permission...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you must be hungry, too. How remiss of me not to have thought....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When I am clean I&rsquo;ll eat, my friend. Just for the moment I
    feel as if I could never touch food again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you must refresh yourself as best you can. You are young, and
    physical troubles with the young are soon past and forgotten. You know the
    poor resources of this small house, but I have a nice supply of fresh water
    just now from yesterday&rsquo;s rain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! It rained yesterday, did it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A storm, my son ... you didn&rsquo;t know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How could I, Padre? I was a dead man, lying on a mattress of corpses.
    I don&rsquo;t even know how long I lay there, dead to the world.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Two days and two nights have gone by since I said farewell to you
    in your prison cell.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good Lord! What a sight I must look! Where is that water you speak
    of? I shall want bucketsful before I&rsquo;m clean.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take all you want, my friend; and when I&rsquo;m back, you must tell
    me more fully just how you felt when you took the draught.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re going out, Padre?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To say farewell to my flock.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then ... you will see her?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Most likely.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old man&rsquo;s reply came half-hesitatingly and obviously troubled.
    He fidgeted, too, looking for his hat and stick, and avoided meeting Tim&rsquo;s
    glance.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is something on your mind, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said abruptly,
    and seized hold of the priest&rsquo;s wrists. &lsquo;Out with it!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is much on my mind, my son.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then, tell me....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Great Unknown leaves Canudos to-morrow....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What? For good?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no! He often goes on great expeditions, with his Lieutenants
    and an escort&mdash;a different escort every time. No one knows his destination,
    nor the day of his return.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The old devil! And he goes to-morrow ... you are sure?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite sure. I go part of the way with them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then, while he is gone, I shall see Marivosa!&rsquo; Tim exclaimed,
    his voice quivering with excitement.</p>
  <p>The old man shook his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She goes with her father,&rsquo; he said softly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Goes? ... goes? ... where?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No one knows.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you go with them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Part of the way. I go on to Cumbe, where I have a house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can guess, though&rsquo;&mdash;and Tim&rsquo;s hold tightened
    on the old man&rsquo;s wrists&mdash;&lsquo;you can guess ... you know!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico made no reply. Tears gathered in his dim eyes and rolled slowly
    down his withered cheeks.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell me, Padre,&rsquo; Tim said calmly. &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t
    be afraid. It is just possible that I have already guessed; and, in any case...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Her father,&rsquo; the old priest said slowly, and his voice was
    half-choked with the sorrow that he felt, &lsquo;her father is taking her
    to the <i>quinta</i> of Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, whom she is to marry almost
    immediately.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim allowed Fra Federico&rsquo;s hands to fall from his grasp. He stood
    quite still for a few seconds, meeting his old friend&rsquo;s sorrowful gaze
    with a firm glance; then he said slowly: &lsquo;I swear by God that she is
    not.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico shook his head dolefully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You cannot prevent it, my son. She is guarded day and night now;
    and what are you among these thousands?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You ask me that, Padre,&rsquo; Tim retorted impulsively, &lsquo;you,
    the minister of God! I am the minister of His will,&rsquo; he went on boldly,
    and threw back his head with a superb gesture of self-confidence and defiance, &lsquo;and
    His will is that Marivosa shall not be thrown to the wolves, but be given
    to me, to love and to cherish, and to cause her to forget this abominable
    life of brigandage and cruelty. She is mine, Padre, I tell you. God gave
    her to me. She is mine, and I&rsquo;ll not give her up to ten thousand devils,
    or to that arch-fiend, Dom Mano&euml;l. Now then,&rsquo; he said more calmly, &lsquo;what
    you&rsquo;ve got to do, Padre, is to bring her here. I must see her ... talk
    to her...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico sighed. &lsquo;She will not listen to you, my friend. They
    have poisoned her mind against you ... they&rsquo;ve persuaded her that you
    tried to assassinate her father ... half a dozen of them have sworn that
    they caught you in the act, and killed you as you struck at the Great Unknown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The lying devils! But all the more reason, Padre, why I should see
    her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t come if she thought you were here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell her. Say nothing. Don&rsquo;t name me. Don&rsquo;t
    speak of me. But for God&rsquo;s sake, bring her here, or I swear I&rsquo;ll
    scale the walls of that damned palace of hell and carry her off in my arms&mdash;and
    then let all those devils do their worst with us both.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico had already experienced some of these wild moods of his friend.
    He had put them down to the Irish temperament, and realized before now that
    nothing he could say or do would check them. Frankly, also, some of the young
    adventurer&rsquo;s enthusiasm had fired his dormant imagination. Perhaps
    he remembered the day when he, a young theological student, had laughed at
    bars and bolts, and penetrated to the very presence of the woman he loved,
    regardless of husband, brother, father, or the disgrace which, in consequence
    of his audacity, had fallen upon him and blighted his career. Because of
    the velvety eyes of a lovely Andalusian, he had lost all chance of benefice,
    of preferment, or of consideration. By orders of superior authorities he
    had been relegated to this distant corner of the earth, where ambition could
    find no scope and where temptation could not hold sway. And remembering all
    that, his atrophied heart went out in affection and hope to this young lover,
    who, like himself, was prepared to hazard everything for a woman&rsquo;s
    sake.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rsquo; he murmured softly. &lsquo;Wait
    for me here. Promise you&rsquo;ll wait, and not venture out ... for my sake....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I promise.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Fra Federico picked up his hat and stick. It was late afternoon: the hot
    sun was sinking down behind the range of mountains in the west. In this land,
    where there is no twilight, darkness treads hard on the heels of light.</p>
  <p>And there would be no moon to-night, for the sky was heavy with clouds.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38</b></h2>
  <p>And Tim waited for what seemed an eternity. He washed and he shaved; fortunately
    he did possess another belt to replace the one which had been stolen from
    him: into his pocket he reverently stowed the precious phial given to him
    by Fra Federico. Then he brewed himself some coffee and drank that, though
    he could not force himself to eat.</p>
  <p>The veil of night had fallen over the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> when he heard
    Fra Federico&rsquo;s voice outside the hut.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will you honour my poor house?&rsquo; the priest was saying; &lsquo;your
    Lieutenants can wait outside.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There followed a certain clatter and din which more than suggested that
    the Empress of Brazil was under an armed escort. However, the priest&rsquo;s
    house had always been looked upon, even by the worst of these brigands, as
    something akin to holy ground. There was not one man among this crowd of
    semi-savages who would dare to cross the threshold unbidden. From what Tim
    could hear, the Lieutenants who accompanied Marivosa settled themselves down
    on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>: probably one or two of them mounted guard outside
    the door. He drew back into the darkest corner of the room and waited. A
    second or two later she came in, closely followed by Fra Federico.</p>
  <p>She came in, and stood quite still and expectant while the old man busied
    himself with lighting the small oil-lamp, and then placing it in the centre
    of the roughly hewn table in the middle of the room. This still left the
    corner where Tim was standing in darkness, though he could see the priest&rsquo;s
    glance wander timorously round the room. But Tim made no movement: he just
    feasted his eyes on his beloved. By a happy chance she had on the same quaint
    leather suit which she was wearing when first he saw her coming towards him
    in the forest clearing. Since then she had completely absorbed his thoughts;
    her beauty had captured both his senses and his imagination, and her personality
    had thrust itself within the innermost recesses of his heart. With unappeasable
    hunger his eyes devoured her loveliness: the small head, with its crown of
    auburn hair, the dark, unfathomable eyes, the cherry-red lips that were fashioned
    for kisses, and the straight slimness of her beneath the tough leather, the
    skin like ivory, the slender hands that he had held imprisoned while her
    small head nestled upon his shoulder.</p>
  <p>As she stood there with the feeble light of the oil lamp outlining her beautiful
    profile, she appeared so young, so innocent, so unprotected, that an immense
    tenderness for her welled up in the adventurer&rsquo;s heart&mdash;a tenderness
    greater than the intense physical longing for another touch of her lips and
    hands. And when she turned suddenly to Fra Federico and asked: &lsquo;Is
    anyone else here?&rsquo; he came forward out of the shadow and, with head
    bent, knelt down at her feet.</p>
  <p>She saw him before he had sunk on his knees and at once she stepped back,
    as if she was afraid of contact with something ugly and obnoxious; and again
    she turned to Fra Federico, and she asked: &lsquo;What is this man doing
    here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But the old priest had already tiptoed out of the room.</p>
  <p>Marivosa looked around her with an expression on her face as of a trapped
    young animal. The next moment she would obviously have turned and fled from
    the room, but that Tim was the quicker of the two and already held her imprisoned
    in his arms. She had entire mastery over herself and made no effort to free
    herself; bred as she was amongst a race of strong men she had a very clear
    knowledge of what physical force could do, and was, moreover, far too deeply
    conscious of her own dignity to attempt the impossible. But she did look
    Tim squarely in the face, and what he saw in her eyes and the curl of her
    lips caused a hot flush of mingled shame and anger to rise to his forehead.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Heavens alive!&rsquo; he murmured, &lsquo;what have I done? Why do
    you look at me like that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; she said coldly, and with complete self-possession, &lsquo;I
    am wondering at this moment whether I hate you or despise you most.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But, God in Heaven!&mdash;what for?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You came like a miserable sneaking thief to this place, where no
    one wanted you ... God knows why you came, or who paid you to spy on us all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Even then he did not let her go: in fact, he held her tighter than ever.
    Fortunately Fra Federico had prepared him for her attitude of mind, or he
    might have thought that something had unhinged her brain.</p>
  <p>Now, when she paused, obviously&mdash;alas!&mdash;because tears were choking
    her voice, he said, with all the gentleness, the tenderness that he could
    command:  &lsquo;My beloved one, Fra Federico has already warned me that
    those devils up there have told you lies about me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Fra Federico was mistaken,&rsquo; she interrupted calmly, &lsquo;there
    are no devils up there and no one has told me lies. It is from my dear, dear
    father&rsquo;s own lips that I heard what happened at the castle three days
    ago.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what did he tell you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The truth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did he tell you?&rsquo; Tim insisted.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That with subtle cunning you wormed yourself into his presence and
    there raised your murdering hand against him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The wicked old liar!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The words had escaped before Tim could check them. Marivosa heard them without
    flinching, only the look in her eyes became harder, more fully charged with
    contempt than it had been before.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; thought Tim, &lsquo;but she knows how to hate,&rsquo; and
    manlike, he added to himself: &lsquo;She would not hate me so if she did
    not love me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you think you will gain by blasphemy?&rsquo; she asked him
    coolly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Whoever told you that I raised as much as a finger against your father,&rsquo;  Tim
    retorted, &lsquo;lied&mdash;lied abominably. I went to him as one white man
    to another. I put a proposal before him which was fair and straightforward.
    I told him that I worshipped you. He listened to me, and then treacherously
    let his beastly niggers seize me and throw me into a filthy dungeon. He ordered
    me to be shot&mdash;or worse than shot.... How can you say that there are
    no devils up there?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They told me that you were dead: that God had been good to you and
    allowed you to escape the punishment that you deserved.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Would you rather I had been tortured to death by those unclean niggers
    ... I, a white man&mdash;and your lover?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>For the first time she struggled, and, as he was taken unawares, she succeeded
    in freeing herself, and turning to the door would certainly have run away
    only that Tim, quick as lightning, forestalled her and stood firm as a rock
    between her and the door. Just for the space of a few seconds he wondered
    if she would call for help, in which case, of course, the game would have
    been up; but she had not done it yet, and all she did now was to draw herself
    up to her full height and to give him another dose of her withering, contemptuous
    glance. It seemed to sweep him up and down, as if such contempt as she felt
    must annihilate anything that dared to go on living. After which, she said,
    with a shrug and in a tone of bitter irony:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My lover....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; Tim retorted coolly. &lsquo;I am your lover, and you
    are mine. We belong to one another as surely as the moon does to the night
    and the sun to the day.... We belong to one another: you to me and I to you,
    because of that wonderful hour when you lay in my arms by the bank of the
    stream, and your lips received and gave that first kiss. Do you think that
    after that I would allow any power on earth or in hell to take you from me?
    ... that after that I would stand by and see you married&mdash;married, my
    God! to that disgusting swine, da Lisbao?&mdash;now that I know what it feels
    like to hold you to my heart, to see the light of love kindled in your eyes,
    to taste the sweetness of your kiss ... that I should ... Great God! I would
    be a miserable fool...!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A fool, or a madman, I think,&rsquo; she said, still apparently with
    absolute self-possession.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;a madman. But, my dear, how can I help going
    crazy now that I have found out just how much you love me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Love you?&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;I?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, you! you beautiful, adorable, worshipped woman, you love me....&rsquo;  He
    came a step or two nearer to her: &lsquo;If you do not love me&mdash;if you
    hate and despise me as you say you do, why do you not call to those beastly
    niggers out there and let them drag me out of your sight ... let them mete
    me the punishment which you say I deserve? ... Call to them, my dear, if
    you hate me&mdash;for if you hated me really, I would as soon be dead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>His voice had sunk to a whisper, so soft and so low that it scarcely rose
    above the sound of the distant murmuring stream, or the mumbling of Fra Federico&rsquo;s
    orisons in the next room. He came nearer to her and nearer, and suddenly
    seized her once more in his arms, and hungrily his lips sought hers, her
    eyes, her hair, her throat and chin. Nor did he let her go till he had had
    his fill. When his arms fell away from her, he threw back his head and gave
    a low, triumphant laugh. &lsquo;Now send any dirty nigger in here, and tell
    your precious father that I am alive&mdash;very much alive&mdash;and let
    him do his damnedest with me.... Go, for God&rsquo;s sake, my dear, as I
    might forget that I am a white man and that the dream of my life is still
    to make you my wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He stood away from the door, and, like a man dazed or dreaming, went slowly
    back into the gloom. He no longer looked at her. What gesture she made then,
    or how she looked, he never knew: all he did know was that presently he heard
    the soft patter of her feet upon the floor, the opening and closing of the
    door, and then nothing more.</p>
  <p>She had gone; and Tim, crouching in the gloom, buried his burning head in
    his hands, and a queer kind of sob rose to his throat and nearly choked him.
    A moment or two later, Fra Federico came shuffling back into the room. The
    old man seemed to bring an atmosphere of peace and common sense back into
    the place. Tim, after a while, watched him moving about the room, once more
    sorting out his phials and pill-boxes ready for packing for the coming journey:
    and the sight comforted and soothed his nerves.</p>
  <p>After a few minutes he asked his old friend: &lsquo;What about this expedition
    to-morrow, Padre? You start with them, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, my son. We start as soon after dawn as possible. The Great Unknown
    and his daughter ... some of his Lieutenants, a mounted escort, and the carriers
    with the pack mules.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know the destination?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. But I can guess.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That swine, da Lisbao, has a ranch somewhere in the Sertao...?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And that is where they are going?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you go with them as far as there?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. And from there I go to Cumbe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you travel, Padre?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Like they all do&mdash;on horseback.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I see.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim said nothing more, but sat musing in the darkness, while Fra Federico
    muttered a few Aves in the interval of collecting his scanty possessions.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the old priest spied something that was lying on the ground. He
    stooped, picked it up, and held it to the light to see what it was. It was
    a small packet wrapped up in a piece of silk and tied together with a bit
    of faded ribbon.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sua Excellen&ccedil;ia must have dropped this,&rsquo; he said, and
    turned the packet over and over between his trembling fingers.</p>
  <p>Tim, at once impelled by curiosity, came out of his corner and looked over
    the priest&rsquo;s shoulder. He recognized the packet which Marivosa had
    undone for his benefit one day: it contained photographs and letters which
    meant the possession of Traskmoore to him. Without saying &lsquo;by y&rsquo;r
    leave,&rsquo; he took the packet out of the old man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is mine as much as hers, Padre,&rsquo; he said quietly, in response
    to Fra Federico&rsquo;s protest. &lsquo;Your finding it here is the greatest
    proof of all that God is on my side in this business.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I shall have to give it back to Marivosa da Gloria, my son,&rsquo; the
    old man objected.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So you shall, Padre. With your own kind hands you shall give it to
    her on her wedding-day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And in spite of Fra Federico&rsquo;s reiterated protests, he broke open
    the packet and examined the contents. Once more the goggling eyes of Juliana
    seemed to jeer at him from the photograph; but it was not on her face that
    he gazed so intently, as on that of a man with narrow, hatchet face and hollow
    cheek, with deep-sunk, penetrating eyes, a beak-like nose, and large, protruding
    chin. &lsquo;From your loving father, Dudley Stone,&rsquo; was inscribed
    on the back, with the date 1926&mdash;two years after the marriage of Uncle
    Justin to that woman with the large teeth and goggling eyes.</p>
  <p>The letters were there, too&mdash;the last one dated 1925, all signed &lsquo;Dudley
    Stone&rsquo;; which went to prove that in that year the adventurer had not
    yet embarked on his career of charlatanism, and had not yet thought of burying
    his identity in a maze of blasphemous appellations.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; thought Tim, &lsquo;if these proofs would appear
    absolutely conclusive in a court of law.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He did up the packet carefully once more and hid it in the pocket of his
    belt. Leaving his old friend still fussing over pill-boxes, he went out on
    the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i>. The night was very dark. He climbed to the top of
    a rock, from which he had a good view of the castle on the summit.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If there is anything in thought transference,&rsquo; he murmured
    to himself,  &lsquo;my lovely one up there must know that her precious packet
    is in my hands now, and that, please God, she&rsquo;ll be Countess of Traskmoore
    before the month is out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>After that, as his nerves were still very much on edge, he went for a long
    tramp along the bank of the stream.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39</b></h2>
  <p>Slowly, through dust and sand, over stony tracks and winding bush paths,
    the company of <i>vaqueiros</i> detailed to guard the sacred person of the
    veiled prophet in his travels wound its way eastward. There were about a
    score of these men, magnificent riders, knowing every inch of this desert
    land, and inured to its pitfalls and dangers; dressed in their leather panoply,
    they looked more than ever like centaurs, at one with their splendid horses,
    which, but for the want of grooming, could have more than held their own
    at any European horse show.</p>
  <p>The Great Unknown himself, with the Empress of Brazil beside him, rode in
    the van, with his bodyguard of fearsome Lieutenants both in front and behind
    him. With them rode Fra Federico Evangelista.</p>
  <p>In the rear came a couple of covered wagons drawn by mules, and laden with
    provisions and all the paraphernalia necessary for the night&rsquo;s encampment.
    It was under the hood of one of these wagons that Tim had scrambled at the
    last moment of departure, when the multitude assembled on the <i>pla&ccedil;a</i> was
    down on its knees receiving the final blessing of that abominable mountebank,
    who had used this opportunity for the display of some of his most blasphemous
    bits of play-acting.</p>
  <p>Fra Federico alone knew what Tim&rsquo;s intentions were, and had spent
    most of the night in prayer for the safety of this young adventurer whom
    he had learned to love as a son. As soon as Tim had finally assured himself
    that his beloved would indeed ride away with that limb of Satan, her father,
    he carried out the plan which he had devised in the night. He joined the
    crowd which was massed around the horses and the wagons, and boldly lent
    a helping hand to the carriers, who were busy loading and packing. No one
    took any notice of him. That was one of the most salient characteristics
    of this amazing place: the rank and file of the army of the Great Unknown,
    and the mass of the population, neither knew nor cared about one another.
    They were so introspective, so detached and mystical, that they had no knowledge&mdash;nor
    desire for knowledge&mdash;of their fellow-desert-dwellers. It was only the
    immediate bodyguard of the veiled prophet who kept a sharp look out on strangers
    or possible spies: the others, in spite of their disconcerting habit of staring,
    and staring hard for hours at a time, did not seem to be memorizing the person,
    or thing, on which their dark, melancholy eyes had rested for so long.</p>
  <p>Tim had not been in Canudos much longer than a month. He had never become
    a prominent member of this community of brigands: and in Canudos Nature provides
    all the black mud necessary for effectual make-up and disguise. Tim, unrecognizable
    even to Fra Federico, with a coating of grime over his face and hands, the
    rest of him encased in his leather suit, worked stolidly with the carriers&mdash;who
    took him for one of themselves&mdash;until the moment when the final order
    for departure was given and the cavalcade set in motion, when, along with
    two or three half-breeds, he scrambled into the rearmost wagon. Marivosa,
    riding beside her father, passed so close to him that he could have touched
    her stirrup with his hand.</p>
  <p>It seemed strange to go over the ground again which he had traversed such
    a little while ago with Esteban the carrier. From where he sat, as the mule-drawn
    wagon went jolting over the stony track, he saw receding slowly from his
    sight the landmarks which a very few weeks ago had appeared to him like portents
    of triumph. The mysterious city, dominated by the castle on the hill-top,
    with the houses and huts massed below seeming to stretch upwards like human
    arms extended in an eternal appeal&mdash;the panorama became smaller and
    smaller, more and more lost in that cloud of dust which hung over it like
    a drab shroud, masking for ever all the cruelties, the superstitions, and
    the crimes which were the life of that city of dreams.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dante, on his way home from the Inferno,&rsquo; Tim said to himself,
    as the vista slowly faded from his sight.</p>
  <p>The cavalcade had gone past the Bom Viagem which had been Tim&rsquo;s first
    halt in sight of Canudos; the Indian storekeeper was in his doorway&mdash;staring;
    one or two of his usual clients trooped out into the compound to see the
    horses and wagons go by. Landmarks all. Tim saw them go by with a faint sense
    of regret. Please God, he never would see this terrible place again; but
    there is always something sad in absolute finality ... and, after all, this
    God-forsaken hole was also the hallowed spot where he had met the one woman
    in the world, and where he had learned, even while teaching her, the first
    lesson of love.</p>
  <p>The vanguard side-tracked before the road plunged into the scrub where Tim
    had beheld that wonderful mirage out of which Marivosa had come towards him
    like an angelic vision out of a dream. He was glad in a way not to have to
    jog along through it, sandwiched as he was between two niggers, and needing
    all his wits not to come in too close contact with their filthy bodies. By
    this time the sun was high in the heavens, and soon the halt was called for
    the midday <i>siesta</i>.</p>
  <p>Tim, fated to feed and sleep with a lot of half-breeds, did his best to
    gulp down his own feelings and to appear normal in his behaviour. Fortunately
    they were a taciturn lot and took no notice of Tim&rsquo;s silence and abstraction.
    After a meal of black beans, followed by the ubiquitous farinha, he found
    a bit of shade under a clump of rough palms: and there, stretched out upon
    his back, his clasped hands under his head, he gazed upwards into nothingness
    and dreamed of Marivosa da Gloria.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter40"></a>Chapter 40 </b></h2>
  <p>Though the road was different from the one along which Esteban had guided
    Tim on his way to Canudos, it was every bit as dreary, every bit as monotonous,
    as dusty, and as stony as the other. Three days and two nights of this awful
    monotony. Tim, who was inured to many hardships since first he landed in
    this southern hemisphere, did feel at times, while the wearisome jogging
    of the wagon lulled his senses into a state of semi-consciousness, that he
    had never suffered physically so much as he did now. After the second day
    he lost count of time: felt as if he had gone on like this since &aelig;ons
    of time and would still go on throughout eternity.</p>
  <p>He never once caught sight of Marivosa.</p>
  <p>It was on the third day, after the midday <i>siesta</i>, that the whole
    landscape appeared to wake up as if from a cataleptic sleep: the road widened,
    stones were less to the fore, there was less dust, and water-holes were more
    frequent. In the distance, large patches of coarse grass became visible in
    the foot-hills, and immense herds of cattle could be seen grazing on the
    slopes. From time to time on the road the cavalcade would encounter a <i>vaqueiro</i> on
    his way home to his village, or even a cattle-dealer with pack-mule and a
    guide. Whenever this happened, Tim noticed that the traveller, whoever he
    might be, dismounted, uncovered his head, and stood respectfully by the roadside
    till the vanguard had gone by. The fame of the Great Unknown, his supposed
    miracles and reputation of sanctity, apparently extended even beyond the
    confines of the desert, and Tim remembered how, in the native quarters of
    Monsataz, even a few of the foreign traders spoke of the so-called prophet
    with bated breath.</p>
  <p>Just before the sunset great excitement prevailed. The end of the journey
    was in sight. The half-breeds in charge of the wagons set up a chattering
    like a herd of monkeys, all the more marked after their habitual taciturnity.
    It seemed as if with this exit out of the desert most of these men were ready
    to follow Nature&rsquo;s lead, to shed their churlishness, and to don a new
    garment made up of good-fellowship and good-humour.</p>
  <p>The <i>quinta</i> was in sight. All was well with the world. As soon as
    Tim understood this, he jumped down from the wagon, thankful to be able to
    walk a mile or two, and stretch himself out as it were both mentally and
    physically.</p>
  <p>Soon he caught sight of the house where lived the man whom he hated most
    in all the world. Memories, which during the past hectic months had become
    somewhat dim, crowded in upon him once more, thick and fast. A number of
    faces flitted quickly past his mental vision: Dom Mano&euml;l, the thief
    and perjurer; Doutor da Pinto, victim of abominable treachery; Fra Martino,
    the genial rascal who had been his best friend; and amongst these, the sweet,
    sad face of Teresa, bending over the dead body of her father, her great dark
    eyes filled with unuttered horror. Memories of the days at Monsataz: his
    search for Dudley Stone, the Caf&eacute; Bom Genio, the Dutchman, the Portuguese,
    the fantastic tales of the Great Unknown, who turned out to be Dudley Stone
    after all.</p>
  <p>Ah, well! the Odyssey was ended: the mad adventure was drawing to a close.
    Would the play finish on a tragic, or a happy note? Would all that knavery,
    that blasphemous play-acting, triumph in the end, or would God stand by the
    adventurer who, single-handed, meant to outwit it all?</p>
  <p>When Tim O&rsquo;Clee in the wake of the last wagon finally turned into
    the stockade, the night had already closed in. The horsemen had dismounted
    and were leading their horses to the rear of the house, where supposedly
    the stables were situated. Tim only took a cursory glance at his surroundings:
    noted that the principal dwelling-house was large and substantially built
    on the brow of a hill, with verandas running along the outside walls, that
    two smaller houses nestled close by, that there were a number of outhouses
    and huts all inside the stockade, and that the whole group of buildings was
    backed by a grove of palms and acacias, beyond which stretched out as far
    as the distant range of hills innumerable cattle-pens, with cottages interspersed
    among them here and there.</p>
  <p>But he was in no mood to study the landscape. He was only vaguely conscious
    of the beauty of the night: a clear, starlit, moonless night. Gradually the
    noise and bustle inside the stockade had subsided. Every man was busy with
    his own affairs, and Tim, after he had helped with the unloading of the wagons,
    was left to do very much as he pleased. He could only bless the happy disposition
    of these <i>vaqueiros</i>, with their habit of lounging against anything
    that was convenient, smoking endless cigarettes, and staring without comprehension,
    or desire to interfere.</p>
  <p>He took a leaf out of their book, and, taking his stand against the shafts
    of an empty wagon, he, too, lounged and stared. He had chosen a position
    from whence he had a good view of a row of doors and windows which gave on
    the veranda. Three of these windows were brilliantly illuminated from within:
    they were wide open. Behind a thin mosquito-net stretched across the windows
    Tim caught sight of a table spread out obviously for supper. Places were
    laid for four, and there was a profusion of flowers and of silver. A couple
    of coffee-coloured servants in white coats, immaculately turned out, were
    putting the final touches to what was obviously the table of a rich man accustomed
    to European luxury.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Strange that we should meet here, senhor!&rsquo; The voice came to
    Tim out of the gloom&mdash;a familiar voice. He turned quickly, and met a
    pair of dark eyes that gazed with an expression of astonishment not unmixed
    with respect into his face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Esteban!&rsquo; he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At your service, senhor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Great God! what are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My business, senhor, is as it always was.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course. Stupid of me. But how did you know me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t forget you, senhor, even though you have changed&mdash;greatly
    changed. But good times came to me after I had the privilege of escorting
    you to Canudos.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Esteban spoke in a whisper. He had, moreover, taken a good look round to
    make sure that there were no prying eyes about.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have done well, have you?&rsquo; Tim remarked; &lsquo;I am glad.&rsquo; Then
    he added, with a short laugh: &lsquo;You see, I have come back alive after
    all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So far, senhor,&rsquo; the guide remarked dryly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You shall take me to Queimadas to-morrow, Esteban,&rsquo; Tim rejoined
    lightly.  &lsquo;You have a cart now, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Two, senhor. I do twice the business I used to before I met you,
    and it grows week by week. This is one of my wagons,&rsquo; he added, and
    struck the shaft with the palm of his hand. &lsquo;I have four good horses
    now ... half a dozen mules.... To-morrow I have contracted to take Fra Federico
    Evangelista as far as Cumbe&mdash;you remember Cumbe, senhor?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I do. Rather!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can go round by Cumbe,&rsquo; the carrier went on, &lsquo;it is
    not much out of the way. If you agree, senhor.... You see, I have contracted
    with Fra Federico....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Fra Federico will come to Queimadas with us, Esteban. So have your
    wagon ready, for we start at dawn. Plenty of provisions, you know ... blankets
    ... everything for the journey ... and no halt on the way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At your service, senhor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And remember, my friend ... no questions ... not a word ... not even
    to Fra Federico.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, senhor...!&rsquo; the guide uttered in protest.</p>
  <p>And Tim knew well that Esteban had sufficient Indian blood in his veins
    to be a model of discretion and of silence. Even now, without another word,
    he seemed to melt away into the gloom: at any rate Tim saw him no more. His
    eyes were fixed once more upon the lighted window, behind which he now saw
    the company filing into the room. In they came, these four people around
    whose life or death Tim&rsquo;s whole existence was entwined. Marivosa da
    Gloria, exquisite in a European dress that might have hailed from Paris:
    her sweet face very pale and with an expression of bewilderment, perhaps
    even of fear, which caused Tim to curse under his breath and to grind his
    teeth with inward rage. Her little hand rested on the arm of Dom Mano&euml;l
    da Lisbao, faultlessly dressed, just as he would have been for a dinner-party
    in London or Paris, suave, urbane, making himself agreeable to his beautiful
    companion, who did not respond with as much as a smile. Behind them towered
    the tall figure of Dudley Stone. This was the first time that Tim had seen
    the impudent charlatan unveiled: but there was the hatchet face, the beak-like
    nose, the deep, penetrating eyes of the photograph: &lsquo;From your loving
    father, Dudley Stone.&rsquo; Tim&rsquo;s heart was pounding away in his breast
    like a sledge-hammer. Within the next few hours his wearisome and exciting
    Odyssey would culminate either in triumph or in death. The man actually stood
    there, within easy reach of him, the man whose existence meant everything
    that he, Tim, had ever longed for&mdash;his inheritance in Ireland, and the
    possession of the one woman in the world who could make that inheritance
    worth while.</p>
  <p>The company sat down to table. Then only did Tim recognize in the fourth
    person Teresa da Pinto. Teresa, with the tragic eyes, the set mouth, the
    whole beautiful face indicative of burning passion, hatred, vengeance: all
    that Tim had seen in it that evening in the music-hall at Monsataz when da
    Pinto fell assassinated, and she, Teresa, alone knew whose was the hand that
    had struck her father.</p>
  <p>It was, indeed, strange to see those two beautiful young girls sitting there,
    silent, self-absorbed, hardly touching the food that was served them, and
    each harbouring in her heart a nameless fear and an unspoken sorrow. Teresa
    from time to time threw a glance across the table at Marivosa, and to the
    watcher in the night those glances boded evil and danger for his beloved.
    The two men on the other hand ate heartily, drank copiously, and carried
    on an animated discussion in English. Only a few snatches of this reached
    Tim&rsquo;s ears, but he heard enough to know that cattle-driving, loot,
    brigandage, money, diamonds, and the vast profits made through all these
    villainies were the sole topic of conversation. The men made no attempt to
    modulate their voices. No one, they believed, outside the room could understand
    what they said, and apparently in their eyes the two young girls did not
    count. Teresa paid no heed to them; probably she had known long ago of this
    criminal association between Dom Mano&euml;l and the English adventurer.</p>
  <p>But to Tim the gradual unravelling of a skein which had seemed to him in
    such a tangle was intensely thrilling. Details of that association, at which
    he had only vaguely guessed, became clear even though he only heard fragments
    of conversation. He understood now the reason of the gigantic hoax which
    had caused plain Mr. Dudley Stone to assume the r&ocirc;le of a resurrected
    prophet or, alternatively, of the rightful ruler of Brazil. A band of ignorant
    savages had to be held together by means of mysticism and superstition; they
    were made to obey by means of terror of an unknown, deified power, and the
    veiled prophet&mdash;the Great Unknown became part of their religion&mdash;the
    fetish whom they revered and feared.</p>
  <p>Given a temperament, hard, cruel, and cynical, and a certain talent for
    play-acting, such as Stone evidently possessed, the r&ocirc;le was not difficult
    to assume or to keep up. There was also his predilection for adventure, and
    his obsession for the search after buried treasure: all these characteristics
    made him a willing tool in the hands of that far cleverer scoundrel, Dom
    Mano&euml;l. It was Dom Mano&euml;l, obviously, who was the brain of the
    association: Dudley Stone merely the tool. Monsataz had been the setting
    wherein the nefarious partnership was first discussed and entered into. Fate
    had indeed played into the hands of these brigands by sending Hold-Hands
    Juliana along, with money wrung from an old dotard which she was only too
    ready to spend in the purchase of false affidavits to prove that Dudley Stone
    was dead. The disappearance of Dudley Stone off the face of the earth was
    the keystone of the enterprise. Traskmoore&rsquo;s fifty thousand pounds
    became the initial capital. Since then these two blackguards had amassed
    untold wealth: cattle-driving, illicit diamond buying, raids on farms and
    homesteads, were their chief sources of revenue. Dudley Stone brought the
    loot to his partner, who disposed of it to the foreign traders who, in their
    turn, were ready to buy anything and everything and ask no inconvenient questions.</p>
  <p>All this and more, Tim O&rsquo;Clee had guessed during his sojourn at Canudos,
    and through conversations with Fra Federico. What he overheard now only confirmed
    what he already knew. It was the effect of all that cynical talk upon Marivosa,
    of these elaborate plans for more brigandage, more piracy and murder, openly
    discussed, which wrung her lover&rsquo;s heart till he could have groaned
    aloud. Gradually he saw the look of bewilderment in her dear eyes turn to
    horror and loathing; once or twice she tried to speak, but evidently horror
    of what she heard choked the words in her throat.</p>
  <p>Was she not witnessing at this moment the total shattering of the great
    illusion of her life&mdash;the tearing down from a self-raised pedestal of
    the idol whom she had worshipped? Her father&rsquo;s soul was being laid
    bare before her in all its hideous nakedness. She saw him at last as he was&mdash;cynical,
    vicious, cruel: and herself as the miserable pawn in this money-making game,
    thrown across from one partner to the other so as to make the criminal bond
    more lasting and more secure.</p>
  <p>And Tim was forced to get a real stranglehold over himself, lest he should
    yield to the temptation of rushing across the courtyard, forcing his way
    into that room and seizing one of those two miscreants by the throat. He
    felt that this world could hold no greater satisfaction than that of squeezing
    the life out of those rascals. Unfortunately, Nature had only provided him
    with one pair of hands, and these were required for guarding his beloved
    and saving her from those brigands: whilst his own life had become the most
    precious asset for bringing about her safety and ultimate happiness.</p>
  <p>And so he forced himself to remain on the watch and to gaze mutely on the
    soul-agony of the woman he worshipped. He saw her turn with an expression
    of pathetic appeal to Teresa da Pinto&mdash;a young girl, her own age, who
    must, she thought, have felt the same horror as she did at what they were
    both made to hear. But in Teresa&rsquo;s glance she saw nothing but indifference
    for what she obviously knew already, and when she met her eyes, there was
    nothing in them but detestation for herself.</p>
  <p>With a half-suppressed sob she rose and fled quickly from the room. At a
    peremptory sign from Dom Mano&euml;l, Teresa reluctantly followed.</p>
  <p>The two men were left alone, wholly indifferent to the storm of misery which
    their baseness had provoked. They drank, and smoked excellent cigars, and
    Tim heard Stone say cynically: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s that damned convent education&mdash;she&rsquo;ll
    be all right presently.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Dom Mano&euml;l retorted, with a suavity far more loathsome than the
    other&rsquo;s frank brutality: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, my dear fellow.
    I like &rsquo;em like that. I like a woman with some spirit in her. Teresa
    fawns too much. She adores me&mdash;women do as a rule&mdash;Your
    lovely Marivosa&rsquo;s hatred will be refreshing ... while it lasts.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Tim heard and saw no more for a moment or two, because his gorge had risen
    and he was seeing red. A mist which was the colour of blood spread before
    his eyes, and his hand wandered to the place in his belt where an automatic
    should have been. Fortunately there was none there, or the temptation would
    have been too strong to resist, and the consequences of such an act would
    have meant the end of everything&mdash;of his last hope of saving the woman
    he worshipped.</p>
  <p>When he looked about him once more, the two men had strolled out upon the
    veranda. The light was behind them and Tim could only vaguely distinguish
    their silhouettes in the gloom; the odour of two excellent cigars came wafted
    to his nostrils on the evening air, and made him curse with a longing for
    a good smoke, after the rank tobacco which had been his only solace for the
    past few weeks.</p>
  <p>The conversation between those two villains up there had drifted to the
    events of the past few days, and Tim heard snatches of the charlatan&rsquo;s
    version of his own adventures.</p>
  <p>Dom Mano&euml;l appeared incredulous. &lsquo;That fellow O&rsquo;Clerigh,&rsquo; he
    said,  &lsquo;who would like to be Earl of Traskmoore, was turned out of
    the country as an undesirable alien nearly a couple of months ago. I had
    to engineer that, for he was after you, my friend, and was beginning to be
    troublesome.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All I know is,&rsquo; Dudley Stone rejoined, &lsquo;that he turned
    up at Canudos, and that he was fool enough to seek an interview with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A graphic description ensued of how he, Tim, had died in gaol and been thrown
    to the carrion in a ditch.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So that&rsquo;s the last of him,&rsquo; Stone continued. &lsquo;The
    damned fool thought, I suppose, that I would give up this business for the
    sake of the few thousands which he promised me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t very well do that, could you, my friend?&rsquo; Dom
    Mano&euml;l retorted dryly. &lsquo;They have not forgotten in England, I
    imagine, that little transaction, during the War, with the Austrian High
    Command which caused the rout of the Serbian Army, what?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Forgotten or not, with money one can disprove anything....&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Except the correspondence on the subject, signed by yourself, which
    I hold as a guarantee of your loyalty.... But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel,
    my friend,&rsquo; Dom Mano&euml;l went on glibly, &lsquo;I only wanted to
    remind you that it is out of your power to leave me in the lurch. We work
    together for our common good, and as yours is the harder task you get the
    lion&rsquo;s share.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am not going on with it for ever, you know, my friend. I am getting
    rather sick of my r&ocirc;le in that God-forsaken desert.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For ever? No!&rsquo; Dom Mano&euml;l rejoined, with a shrug; &lsquo;but
    a good many years must elapse yet before we have made our pile and can retire
    to our respective homes ... then we&rsquo;ll destroy the incriminating correspondence,
    my friend; and as your lovely Marivosa will be old and ugly by then, I will
    even return her to your loving arms, and you can then build yourself a palace
    anywhere you choose, and forget that you ever were a resurrected prophet
    and potential Emperor of Brazil.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence after that between the two partners in infamy; and Tim,
    troubled as he was over the future of his beloved, could not help chortling
    at thought of these two brigands each holding the other, figuratively, by
    the throat, threatening one another, each prepared to murder the other, if
    only he dared.</p>
  <p>Then, after a few minutes of this silence, Stone curtly proclaimed that
    he was tired and wanted to go to bed. Dom Mano&euml;l, in the r&ocirc;le
    of a polite and attentive host, at once went back into the dining-room with
    his guest, offered him a last drink, called to his dusky servants to attend
    on him, and finally bade him a cordial good night.</p>
  <p>But for some time after that Tim remained leaning against the shaft of Esteban&rsquo;s
    wagon, staring up at the house. Somewhere behind those walls the woman whom
    he worshipped moved and breathed. Perhaps she was crying her eyes out with
    shame and disappointment: and he, Tim, not there to kiss away those tears
    and swear to her that all-conquering love would inevitably triumph over treachery
    and perfidy. Perhaps she was asleep: and he not there to watch over her slumbers.
    But he had it in his mind that his love and longing were so strong that presently
    they would pierce those stone walls and reveal to him the room where his
    beloved lay. And as he stood there, watching, he saw a light suddenly peep
    through the chinks of a shuttered door at the farthest end of the veranda;
    and a moment or two later the shutters were thrown open, then the door, and
    Marivosa stood for a moment under the lintel and looked out into the night.
    For one minute, not more, she stood there, and even at one moment turned
    her head in the direction where Tim was on the watch; the next moment she
    was gone, and the door was closed once more.</p>
  <p>But Tim had his wish: he knew where she was, knew the door at which he could
    stand guard over her and the spot on which her foot had rested. Creeping
    noiselessly in the shadow, he made his way across the courtyard and up the
    veranda steps. He found the door which had just closed on that which was
    dearer to him than life; he pressed his lips against the panel, and murmured
    the words of love which could not reach her ears.</p>
  <p>Then he lay down across the threshold and waited for the dawn.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter41"></a>Chapter 41 </b></h2>
  <p>For the rest, it is all so strange, some of it so inexplicable, that it
    seems at first glance almost impossible to disentangle the truth from the
    many extravagant versions of what occurred on that fateful dawn&mdash;the
    dawn which followed on the arrival of the Great Unknown and his escort at
    the <i>quinta</i> of Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao. Of that <i>quinta</i> nothing
    remains to-day but an agglomeration of ruined buildings: only the stone walls,
    blackened with soot, are left to testify that a prosperous homestead flourished
    here some time, not so very long ago, with its verandas and stockade, cart-sheds,
    cattle-pens, stablings and outhouses.</p>
  <p>A devastating bush fire, mysterious in its origin, kindled some say by a
    vengeful hand, laid waste the <i>quinta</i> as well as several hundred acres
    of forest and of cultivated land. This catastrophe was coincident with those
    other events which have remained more inexplicable and far more mysterious
    than the destruction by fire of the place where they occurred.</p>
  <p>On the whole, I am inclined to agree with those who place the greatest credence
    on Esteban&rsquo;s version of the affair. The carrier had been at the <i>quinta</i> when
    the Great Unknown arrived there with his daughter and his train of armed
    men and wagons: and he had actually held conversation with the mad stranger,
    whom he had, it seems, escorted to within sight of Canudos a month previously.</p>
  <p>This he related to a group of sympathetic listeners in the coffee-room of
    the station inn at Bomfin, when the events of that unforgettable morning
    were still fresh in his mind.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I left him at the turning-point,&rsquo; he said, speaking of the
    mad stranger&mdash;English, he believed he was, though some people said he
    was something else, equally mad&mdash;&lsquo;at the point from which there
    is a good view of that accursed city, and I warned him then that if he ventured
    any farther he would never return alive.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But he did return, Esteban,&rsquo; one of his hearers argued, &lsquo;since
    you spoke with him that night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did speak with him,&rsquo; the carrier rejoined. &lsquo;He was
    leaning against the shaft of one of my wagons, staring up at the house, which
    was all lighted up. I had been busy loading the wagon, because I had engaged
    to take Fra Federico Evangelista as far as Cumbe on the morrow, when I saw
    the senhor Inglez. I knew him at once, though he had smeared his face over
    with dirt to make himself look like a Mamaluco; but I owe all my good fortune
    to the hundred milreis he gave me when I put him on the way to Canudos; he
    was good to me, he was genial and not proud, and I never forget a face.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So you talked?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only a few words. He made me promise to have a cart and horses ready
    for him in the early dawn to take him to Queimadas, and I promised, because
    I could still fulfil my contract with Fra Federico Evangelista by going round
    the way of Cumbe. I arranged all this with the stranger, and after that I
    lay down under the hood of my wagon and went to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did the Inglez do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I left him still leaning against the shafts and staring up at the
    house, though I told him that if he liked he could get some sleep beside
    me in the wagon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then what happened?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I had just dropped off to sleep when someone pulled me by the leg.
    It was Barbosa; you know him, he is Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s body-servant.
    He came to tell me that his master wished to speak with me. So out I scrambled.
    It may have been half an hour before midnight then, or perhaps more. The
    waning moon was still low down in the sky. I do not like a waning moon,&rsquo; Esteban
    remarked, with a shake of his lean shoulders, &lsquo;all the ill-luck I ever
    had came to me while the moon was on her decline.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He drank down a glass of rum in order to shake off that sense of superstitious
    fear, always on the alert in the temperament of a half-breed. The others
    waited until he had smacked his lips and appeared more content; then they
    encouraged him to proceed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you have not had ill-luck this time, Esteban, have you? It was
    Dom Mano&euml;l who...&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is it, my friends. The cursed moon was bound to bring ill-luck
    to someone, you see. Well! as I say, I scrambled down from the wagon, ready
    to follow Barbosa. He was going towards the house, and I just stopped to
    see if the stranger was still leaning against the shafts. But he was no longer
    there. I peeped under the wagon, thinking that perhaps he had crawled there
    to get some sleep, but I saw no trace of him, and seeing that Barbosa was
    making me signs to hurry up, I ran after him. I followed him up the stairs,
    and he pushed open the tall window of one of the rooms and told me to go
    in.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dom Mano&euml;l was there, sitting at a table where he and his guests
    had been dining. There were a lot of empty bottles about, I noticed, and
    I saw at once, that he had been drinking very hard. Well!&mdash;that was
    no business of mine, was it? He began by ordering me to look to the windows
    and the door to see that there were no eavesdroppers about, and then to come
    and stand close to him so that he need not raise his voice. And he gave me
    the most extraordinary orders I had ever received in all my life: &ldquo;You
    will have a wagon ready at dawn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;harnessed with three
    of your best horses, and well supplied with provisions.&rdquo; Imagine my
    surprise, for these were the same instructions so far that the senhor Inglez
    had given me; and already I was wondering how I should manage to satisfy
    both my clients when Dom Mano&euml;l went on, and, as I say, he gave me the
    most extraordinary orders I had ever received in this life. &ldquo;La Sua
    Excellen&ccedil;ia Teresa da Pinto will travel in your wagon, and you will
    drive her straight to my house outside Queimadas, which you know. You will
    drive straight into the courtyard, and directly you arrive you will ask to
    speak with the Senhor Silva Givareira, and you will give him a letter from
    me. La Sua Excellen&ccedil;ia, I must tell you, will be escorted by a female
    servant. Two of my own men will accompany you. On the way you must halt only
    at places where there are no habitations within sight: never in a village,
    nor near a <i>quinta</i>. On no account must Excellen&ccedil;ia be allowed
    to speak to anyone on the road, nor must you take or deliver any message
    from her to anyone. Is that understood?&rdquo; I did understand well enough;
    but, putting my amazement aside for the moment, I just wondered how I could
    fulfil my obligations at the same time to Fra Federico Evangelista, to the
    mad stranger, and to Dom Mano&euml;l. I certainly had two wagons available.
    I had horses and mules, but I myself could not possibly drive both. Fortunately
    I am a man of resource; and, thought I, so long as Dom Mano&euml;l does not
    insist on there being no one else in the wagon except La Sua Excellen&ccedil;ia
    and his servants, he need know nothing about Fra Federico Evangelista and
    the senhor Inglez until afterwards. For the moment all I did was to assure
    His Excellency that I was entirely at his service; whereupon he gave me the
    letter for Senhor Givareira, who is the governor of his estates, and whom
    I have the honour of knowing, and finally he said: &ldquo;If you carry out
    my orders in every respect, and arrive at my house on the third day from
    this, Senhor Givareira will give you two hundred milreis. And now you can
    go.&rdquo; He waved his hand. I assured him once more that I was entirely
    at his service, and then bowed myself out of the room.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You must have felt very queer, Esteban,&rsquo; was the universal
    comment on this part of the story. But Esteban had more amazing things yet
    to relate, and after more refreshment he went on:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did feel queer, I can assure you, my friends, but I had confidence
    in myself, and I still thought that I would ultimately find a way to satisfy
    all my customers. You see, Dom Mano&euml;l had promised me two hundred milreis;
    but I was sure that I could get another two hundred from the stranger; and
    Fra Federico, though he pays me very little, does give me absolution for
    my sins and a passport up to Heaven, which is very comforting. As I felt
    rather troubled and wanted to think rather than go to sleep again, I did
    not scramble back into the wagon, but followed the example of the stranger
    and leaned against the shafts, thinking. The moon was well up in the sky
    now, and the night was very still. There was no one about, for it certainly
    was past midnight then, and scarcely any sound broke the silence of the night
    except in the far distance the snorting of horses in the sheds, or the stirring
    of the cattle in their pens. I had a good view of the house from where I
    was standing, and of the veranda with the row of doors and windows opening
    on it. All of these were closed, but through the chinks of two of the shuttered
    windows I could see a faint streak of light. One came from the room where
    I had the interview with Dom Mano&euml;l, and the other from another room
    a good deal farther along the veranda. One strange thing struck me at that
    moment, and this was that up against the door of that distant room I could
    see a man lying across the threshold.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And suddenly I saw Dom Mano&euml;l come out on the veranda. The light
    of the moon was full on him. His beautiful clothes looked all crumpled, and
    his hair was untidy. He was stooping a little and stumbled in his walk. He
    crept along the veranda in the direction of that other door against which
    the man was still lying. Never in my life have I seen such an evil look on
    any man&rsquo;s face as there was on Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s then. And all
    at once he saw the man who was lying across the threshold, and the man saw
    him and jumped to his feet, Dom Mano&euml;l ordered him to get out of the
    way, but the man would not budge. He was tall, taller than Dom Mano&euml;l;
    that was all I could see of him, for he was in the shadow caused by an angle
    of the wall. The next moment those two were at grips with one another. I
    tell you, my friends, it was terrible. Dom Mano&euml;l, of course, was the
    weaker of the two&mdash;he had been drinking, you understand&mdash;but the
    other was unarmed, and Dom Mano&euml;l had quickly drawn a dagger out of
    his hip pocket. At first they fought in silence, and it was that silence
    which made it all seem so horrible: one heard nothing but a kind of snorting,
    like two bulls in a fight. But when, after a few moments, Dom Mano&euml;l
    was brought down to his knees and was forced by an iron grip on his wrist
    to drop the dagger, he gave a terrific cry for help.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I had been on the point of doing that myself, I can tell you, but
    I hadn&rsquo;t dared. Of course, in one moment the <i>quinta</i> became alive.
    You heard footsteps, shouting, calls from everywhere. Just for a few seconds
    I suppose my attention wandered from that terrible scene up on the veranda.
    When I looked again, Dom Mano&euml;l was still down on his knees, but the
    other now had him by the throat. Down he forced him, my friends, and down,
    and would have killed him the next minute for sure, but it was just too late,
    for the house was alive, I tell you, and half a dozen of Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s
    servants were already on the veranda. They rushed to their master&rsquo;s
    aid: they tried to seize that other man, but he hit about him, fighting like
    a lion. Still it was six to one, you understand, and more men rushing up
    the stairs. I was sorry for him in a way; though I am not a brave man myself,
    I like to see a good fight, and six to one did not seem to be a just one.
    I deliberately turned my head away then, as I did not wish to see that fine
    lion brought down. At the moment there had been a terrific din, men shouting,
    stamping, banging, an awful scramble there was on stairs and veranda; but,
    suddenly, there was a dead hush, and back I turned to see what had happened.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My friends, it was just a flash: a wonderful sight, I tell you. The
    door immediately behind the man was suddenly opened from within, and in the
    doorway appeared the most beautiful lady you ever saw in all your life. Like
    ivory she was, and her hair was like gilded copper. She put out a hand and
    grasped the man by his ragged shirt-sleeve, and drew him into the room away
    from Dom Mano&euml;l, who had recovered his breath and was snarling and crouching
    like a jaguar ready to spring, and away from the crowd who at sight of her
    had stopped yelling and stamping, and stood there as if they had suddenly
    been turned to stone. I heard a voice&mdash;I think it was Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s&mdash;cry
    out hoarsely: &ldquo;Marivosa!&rdquo; And I, too, felt then as if I had been
    turned to stone as I looked for the first time on the daughter of the Great
    Unknown, the real Empress of Brazil&mdash;Marivosa da Gloria.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what had happened to the man?&rsquo; listeners demanded eagerly,
    while others added: &lsquo;I, too, like to see a brave man fight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened to him,&rsquo; Esteban replied, &lsquo;and
    I don&rsquo;t know to this day who he was and what became of him. The last
    I saw of him he was streaming with blood and still fighting with his back
    to the wall: then I saw the lovely lady and her ivory hand dragging him in
    by his shirt-sleeve. I think he was so dazed and so exhausted that he did
    not know himself what had happened. The room behind the lady was all in darkness,
    but that rascally moon did play the happy trick of lighting up her beautiful
    pale face, so that she looked like the Holy Virgin. No wonder the men couldn&rsquo;t
    move: they just stood transfixed. Some of them dropped on their knees. But
    she ordered them to go, and obediently they all slunk off. You see, some
    of them were the men from Canudos, and they look upon her as a heavenly being,
    the daughter of their prophet; even Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s servants wouldn&rsquo;t
    dare to touch her, because for them she is the Empress.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What I thought was strange at the time was that Dom Mano&euml;l let
    them all go away; in fact, when some of them seemed to want to hang back,
    he snarled at them and ordered them to go. The beautiful lady would have
    stepped back into the room then, but Dom Mano&euml;l was too quick for her.
    The next thing I saw was that he had lifted her off her feet and held her
    in his arms. My friends, this is where the terrible thing occurred. I saw
    it all; indeed, I was the only one to see everything, for the men were all
    slinking back to their own quarters and not one of them seemed to dare to
    glance back. But I saw it all; I saw another door close by softly open, and
    the Senhorita Teresa da Pinto come out on the veranda. When she saw Dom Mano&euml;l
    with the Empress Marivosa in his arms, she stood for two seconds like a statue,
    stiff and stark, and her eyes were like those of a wild cat when it is in
    a rage, and her white teeth shone like a jaguar&rsquo;s: then, suddenly she
    darted back into the room and out again. This time, my friends, she had a
    glistening steel blade in her hand. Dom Mano&euml;l had his back to her.
    She ran to him, and without a sound or cry, she drove that blade into him.
    Horrible it was, my friends! Horrible, I tell you! and she, the senhorita,
    no more than a young girl. Jealousy had maddened her, and when she saw Dom
    Mano&euml;l loosen his hold on the beautiful Marivosa, when she saw him reel
    and fall and heard the death-rattle in his throat, she cried out: &ldquo;As
    you did to my father&rdquo;&mdash;or some words to that effect&mdash;and
    she stepped over the still body of Dom Mano&euml;l, and with the dripping
    dagger still in her hand, she stood over the Empress Marivosa. My God!&mdash;but
    I did find my voice then. I gave a cry, I tell you, fit to wake the dead.
    I suppose it was that cry which brought the unfortunate senhorita to herself.
    She dropped the dagger and ran back into her room; and it was the Empress
    Marivosa who, forgetting that Dom Mano&euml;l had planned to do her the greatest
    wrong that any man can do to an innocent girl, ministered to him as best
    she could until some of his own men had realized what had happened and went
    back the way they had just come. But, as you know, my friends, Dom Mano&euml;l
    was past all help. They carried him to his room, and he died within the hour!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But the Empress?&rsquo; some of the listeners inquired eagerly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The veiled prophet, her father, had come out by then&mdash;the Great
    Unknown. He said no word, but beckoned to his daughter. She came along the
    veranda to him, and he then took her by the hand and led her away to his
    own apartments. I saw her no more that night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the senhorita?&rsquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She was in a raging fever for two days and two nights, and could
    not leave her bed, or the <i>quinta</i>. But at noon, following the dawn
    on which she started on her journey to Monsataz, a terrific fire broke out
    in the <i>quinta</i>. It started in the room where the body of Dom Mano&euml;l
    was lying in state before being conveyed to the family graveyard in Bahia.
    Some say that it was caused by the upsetting of one of the tall candles,
    the flame of which caught a corner of the lace coverlet. That&rsquo;s as
    it may be. All I know is what Barbosa himself told me, which is, that the
    last person to enter the death chamber, in order to look on him who had been
    her lover and whom she had sent to face his Maker, was the Senhorita Teresa
    da Pinto. No one else entered the room after that.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter42"></a>Chapter 42 </b></h2>
  <p>But, of course, that was not the end of the story. They all wanted to know
    about the departure of the Great Unknown and of the Empress of Brazil from
    the <i>quinta</i>, where Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, the owner and the host,
    now lay dead, and Teresa da Pinto in a raging fever. And no one could tell
    that part of the story better than Esteban, the carrier; for he had been
    there all the time, from the moment when the messenger of evil tidings arrived
    at full gallop with the alarming news, until that when the Great Unknown
    himself&mdash;the resurrected prophet and mysterious chieftain&mdash;deigned
    to enter into his, Esteban&rsquo;s, wagon and allowed so humble a guide to
    take him to his destination.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;After that terrible hour,&rsquo; Esteban resumed, as soon as he had
    refreshed himself with hot coffee and a drink of rum, &lsquo;most of us did
    not feel much like sleep, I can tell you. The night was bitterly cold&mdash;you
    know what they are like in the Sertao this time of year after scorching hot
    days&mdash;so we lit a fire in the courtyard and squatted round it, smoking
    and drinking, for one of the men of the house had brought out a jar of rum,
    and it was welcome, I assure you. But there wasn&rsquo;t much talk between
    us: it seemed as if what we had seen had stiffened our tongues. The waning
    moon was smiling down placidly on all the mischief she had wrought, for surely
    it was she who had muddled the brain of Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, and turned
    the senhorita into the paths of madness.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose that presently the warmth of the fire outside, and of the
    rum inside our stomachs, made us all drowsy. I, for one, curled myself up
    in a blanket and must then have dropped off to sleep. When I awoke, the moon
    was still up, but the Southern Cross had begun to pale. It must have been
    an hour, or less, before dawn; the fire was out, and the men round it all
    fast asleep. I had seen nothing of the English stranger since I left him
    leaning against the shafts of my wagon, whilst I scrambled inside it. I wondered
    what in the world had become of him. Some of the men were snoring, and in
    the distance I could hear the hobbled horses fidgeting and the cattle far
    away snorting in the pens. I was feeling cold and dazed; the terrible events
    which I had witnessed seemed unreal, like a horrible nightmare, which I hoped
    presently to forget. What had roused me, I do not know. I sat up and listened.
    All the sounds were familiar enough: animals and men breathing, the rustling
    of leaves, the soughing of the night breeze in the tall grasses&mdash;they
    were all familiar to me. All save one.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was a strange sound, my friends, that struck my ear, strange to
    every dweller in the Sertao when heard in the night. No wonder it had roused
    me, for I am a light sleeper. It was the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hooves
    galloping full tilt in this direction. A horse broken loose, I thought at
    first, maddened, perhaps, by the sight of a jaguar and tearing about in blind
    fear. But no!&mdash;for the sound of those hooves came nearer and nearer,
    never swerving to right nor left: not like a frightened beast, or a <i>vaqueiro</i> rounding
    up his cattle.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I had been the first to be wakened by the sound, but gradually one
    man woke and then another; and presently we were all of us astir, and all
    of us gazing across the courtyard in the direction from which those thundering
    hooves were drawing nearer and nearer. Such amazing and terrible events had
    marked the early part of this night, that in the hearts of most of us there
    came the dread that this rider galloping in the night was none other than
    one of the four horsemen of which the Holy Scriptures speak.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But he turned out to be a huge Mamaluco, riding a white horse&mdash;at
    least, we all put him down as a Mamaluco, for what we saw of his face was
    of a dark, reddish-brown colour: it was streaming with sweat. He had obviously
    been riding very hard. His horse, as he drew rein outside the stockade, was
    snorting and panting like a wild beast and was covered with lather. The man
    shouted loudly, demanding admittance. By now the whole <i>quinta</i> was
    astir, and the gatekeeper out with his keys. And there were we all, crowding
    round to see the gates swing open and the horseman enter the stockade. This
    he did without dismounting, rode to the very centre of the courtyard, and
    then threw up his left hand and shouted loudly: &ldquo;Treachery! Where is
    the prophet?&rdquo; His poor horse, maddened with the noise and with the
    lot of us all crowding round, reared and plunged in a way that would have
    thrown any rider I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a horse, but the way that Mamaluco
    sat that horse, you never saw anything like it. He was dressed like a <i>vaqueiro</i> from
    the Sertao, with leather hat and visor to shield his face, and leather clothes
    head to heel, which they all wear to protect themselves against the thorny
    scrub.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And there he was, my friends, in the very middle of the courtyard,
    a dark figure on a white horse, holding up one hand and shouting: &ldquo;Treachery!
    I must speak with the Great Unknown.&rdquo; This brought Lean-Shanks, the
    huge Negro whom you all know, and who is one of the chiefs of the prophet&rsquo;s
    bodyguard, out on the veranda of the house. As soon as the Mamaluco saw him,
    he swung himself out of the saddle and strode across the courtyard, with
    all of us close on his heels, eager to know what would happen next.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lean-Shanks by this time was half-way down the steps, shouting louder
    than the Mamaluco: &ldquo;Silence! What is this noise?&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;Silence!
    The prophet sleeps!&rdquo; And the Mamaluco raised his voice and yelled louder
    still: &ldquo;Wake him! Wake him! There&rsquo;s treachery in Canudos, and
    I must speak with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; was what Lean-Shanks said, but he ran down
    the steps and seized the Mamaluco by the arm. &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;To
    no one will I speak,&rdquo;  the Mamaluco said, &ldquo;save to the prophet:
    for treachery is loose in Canudos....&rdquo;  &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; the
    Negro declared again. But the other retorted loudly: &ldquo;I started at
    sunset yesterday and have not drawn rein since. If I do not speak with the
    prophet now, Canudos within a week will cease to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I cannot, of course, repeat to you the very words that they both
    spoke,&rsquo;  Esteban, the carrier, continued; &lsquo;but that was the substance
    of what they said: the Mamaluco insisting on speaking with the prophet, and
    Lean-Shanks declaring that that was out of the question. The Mamaluco was
    not shouting quite so loudly now. In fact, his voice got weaker and weaker,
    and he was gasping for breath&mdash;which was not to be wondered at if he
    had ridden all the way from Canudos without drawing rein. Lean-Shanks was
    holding him by the arm all the time. I could see the Negro&rsquo;s face turning
    grey and his eye-balls rolling in their sockets. He is very full of his own
    importance as a rule, and they say that he is the right-hand man of the Great
    Unknown and a monster of cruelty, but I am sure that at this moment he was
    scared out of his wits. Of course, all of us who had nothing to do with him,
    and all that horde of brigands over in Canudos, were not sorry to hear that
    treachery had crept into their camp. We had all hoped for some time that
    the thing couldn&rsquo;t go on, and that the Government would one day send
    out sufficient troops to break up that abominable thieving crowd, or else
    that they would quarrel among themselves and just devour one another like
    so many caged beasts. This we hoped had happened now: and there was not one
    amongst us, decent men, who did not rejoice to think that all that looting
    and plunder and rapine would perhaps find its own punishment at last.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Sertanejos who had come over with their Great Unknown jostled
    us and pushed us about in order to get nearer to those two men, and hear
    what else the Mamaluco had to say. In the meanwhile that cursed moon, who
    had already done so much mischief, had hidden herself behind a cloud&mdash;and
    you know how dark that last hour can be just before the dawn: we could only
    vaguely see the two men now at the foot of the steps. They were still arguing
    whether the Mamaluco should be allowed to enter the presence of the Great
    Unknown, and at one moment Lean-Shanks threatened him with a machete if he
    did not deliver his message then and there. But the Mamaluco was firm: &ldquo;I
    will speak with the prophet and no one else,&rdquo; he said. He stood up
    boldly to the Negro, I can tell you, and to us he appeared tall and fine
    and lean, while Lean-Shanks, who, as you know, is a giant, seemed more fleshy
    about the body and with limbs less firm and straight.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;However, there was never any question of a fight between them, and,
    after a few minutes of all that arguing, Lean-Shanks suddenly turned and
    ran up the steps, shouting: &ldquo;The prophet himself shall decide!&rdquo; At
    the top of the stairs he turned and loudly ordered the Mamaluco to stay where
    he was at peril of his life: he alone, he said, was privileged to enter the
    presence of the Great Unknown. But the Mamaluco was not to be done. He, too,
    ran up the steps. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s black treachery in Canudos,&rdquo; he
    shouted once more at the top of his voice, &ldquo;and what I have to say
    is for the prophet&rsquo;s ear alone.&rdquo; And this he bellowed in a voice
    that resembled a bull&rsquo;s&mdash;no doubt in order to attract the attention
    of the Great Unknown.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And in this he succeeded, for presently one of the doors was opened,
    and there stood the tall figure of the Great Unknown in his long flowing
    robes, his head and face all hidden by a veil. At once the Mamaluco fell
    on his knees, with his forehead touching the ground. Lean-Shanks began talking
    very glibly, telling the story of what was happening, but the veiled prophet
    ordered him to be silent, and then looked down at the kneeling figure, and
    with one word ordered him to speak. The Mamaluco made no movement; there
    he knelt, with his forehead touching the ground, and when the prophet repeated
    the command: &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; he said, in a funny kind of husky voice: &ldquo;What
    I have come to say is for the prophet&rsquo;s ear alone!&rdquo; The Great
    Unknown said, for the third time: &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; And when the Mamaluco
    still remained silent and motionless, he turned to Lean-Shanks and said,
    in a way that made us all shudder: &ldquo;Take him away and make him speak.&rdquo; For
    a second or two the Mamaluco still remained motionless, then he put out his
    right hand towards the prophet, and in his hand there was a murderous-looking
    dagger. He did not speak, but he pulled the visor of his hat right down over
    his face, threw back his head, bared his neck, and said the one word: &ldquo;Strike!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We all held our breath, for anything more awful I had never seen,
    although I have travelled in many places in that desolate part of the country.
    The veiled man took the dagger and held it for a time in both his hands.
    Of course, mind you, though he is a prophet and all that, he is no fool,
    and I daresay he realized that nothing would be gained by threatening this
    Mamaluco. But I suppose that the habits of years are difficult to shake off,
    and the Great Unknown had been so accustomed to hedge himself round with
    bodyguards, and all sorts of paraphernalia, that he had no more pluck left
    in him to face any man alone; and he must have known that he had so many
    enemies&mdash;desperate men, some of them, whom he had robbed and outraged&mdash;that
    the fear of assassination must always have been present in his thoughts.
    In the end, he seemed to make up his mind all of a sudden. He turned to Lean-Shanks
    and said: &ldquo;Strip him, and search him: then send him in to me.&rdquo; After
    which, he turned on his heel and went back to his room.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Esteban, the carrier, was coming to the end of his story. His mouth was
    very dry and had frequently to be moistened with coffee or white rum. It
    was marvellous how much of the latter he could imbibe without losing the
    thread of his narrative, or the clearness of his diction. His listeners,
    too, were thirsty through sheer excitement and eagerness to know more of
    the last of the series of events that had marked that unforgettable night.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did it all end, Esteban?&rsquo; some of them cried, while others
    threatened the carrier with a hiding if he did not immediately proceed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It ended,&rsquo; Esteban resumed after a moment or two, &lsquo;as
    it had begun, in a most amazing manner. All of us down in the courtyard waited
    to see what would happen. There were a good many of the Sertanejos there,
    and a number of men belonging to the <i>quinta</i>; we were, so to speak,
    two camps, getting more and more hostile towards one another. Up on the veranda,
    the Mamaluco had risen to his feet. Lean-Shanks curtly ordered him to strip,
    which he began to do by taking off his leather coat. He had a white shirt
    on underneath, and as soon as his coat was off, Lean-Shanks&rsquo;s huge
    black hands wandered over his body in search of hidden weapons. And suddenly,
    all in a flash, the Mamaluco took off his leather hat and clamped it down
    over the Negro&rsquo;s head right down to his ears; then, with a jerk of
    his knee he sent him staggering backwards, and before Lean-Shanks could possibly
    recover from such a sudden assault, he forced him against the balustrade,
    with his spine bent right over the woodwork. Of course, although the two
    men were fairly equal in strength, the Negro was handicapped through that
    tight hat over his eyes, and through his being taken completely by surprise.
    Moreover, the whole thing had occurred so quickly, in far less seconds than
    it takes to relate, and Lean-Shanks had not even the time to bellow before
    the other had him by the legs and just turned him over the balustrade, down
    into the courtyard below, where his big, fleshy body came down with a thud.
    Then we heard a door bang, and when we looked up again the Mamaluco had disappeared.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now I must tell you that there was not one of us there who was not
    convinced by this time that the Mamaluco was just an assassin, who had come
    with the intention of killing that murderous prophet up there, and who in
    all probability now would succeed; and I can assure you that those of us
    who did not belong to that gang of pirates rejoiced at the idea that we had
    seen the last of the Great Unknown, and that, with his death, the murdering
    horde would in all probability soon be dispersed, and honest farmers be allowed
    to live in peace for the future. So when the Sertanejos and <i>vaqueiros</i> who
    belonged to the Great Unknown showed signs of going first to the aid of Lean-Shanks
    and then, perhaps, to swarm up the veranda for the protection of their prophet,
    we all did what we could to prevent them: and a short, sharp, free fight
    ensued.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Our party held the veranda steps against the Sertanejos, who could
    not fight so freely as our men did because of their stiff, bulky leather
    clothes, but they were more numerous than we were, and also had more at stake.
    They fought desperately, I can tell you, and at one time knives were freely
    used. The battle had commenced in silence&mdash;those Sertanejos are always
    a silent lot&mdash;but in the heat and excitement of the fight some of us
    did begin to shout, and there was the tramping of feet, too, on the veranda
    steps as the defenders were gradually being forced up the stairs. Our party,
    I certainly thought, was getting the worst of it. I was watching the fight
    from a splendid vantage ground&mdash;not being a fighting man, you understand&mdash;nevertheless
    I had already rendered our cause signal service, for when Lean-Shanks, after
    his heavy fall, began to wriggle again, I just stamped on his face first,
    and then on his hands, and finally sat down upon his chest. And from there
    I could see everything beautifully. I saw the door upon the veranda open
    once more, and the veiled prophet standing there in his long robe, as calm
    as you please. Immediately behind him I caught sight in the gloom of the
    beautiful Empress of Brazil.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And there he was, the villain, still veiled and still the Great Unknown.
    At sight of him the Sertanejos stopped fighting, and all fell on their knees,
    with their foreheads touching the ground; and I must admit that I could not
    shake off a feeling of awe, and even of a certain reverence, when I saw that
    tall mysterious figure extend an arm and raise a hand as for a benediction.
    The Sertanejos groaned and struck the ground with their foreheads. I felt
    the Negro&rsquo;s big body wriggling beneath me, so, as he was still helpless
    and only half-conscious, I gave his thick black throat a good squeeze, just
    to keep him quiet. And then I heard the Great Unknown say in a kind of hoarse,
    sepulchral voice: &ldquo;To horse! We start for Canudos at once.&rdquo; The
    Sertanejos all struggled to their feet, and off they went to get their horses
    and wagons. There was a good deal of confusion about the place by that time,
    I can tell you. Just think of all that had happened in the last few hours.
    Up in that house its master lay dead; the senhorita who had killed him was
    in a raging fever, with half a dozen distracted women to look after her,
    and as I heard later, Fra Federico Evangelista doctoring her with his potions;
    and one shuddered to think what had happened in that other room, on the threshold
    of which the veiled prophet still stood, with his lovely daughter by his
    side. Did the Mamaluco lie in there dead? Had that innocent young girl witnessed
    yet another murder, a few more horrors? What had she seen? What did she know?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know how quickly day follows night in these parts? Well! It was
    broad daylight by now. I thought that I had best set to work, too, and get
    my team ready, and my wagon, for the journey to Cumbe and Queimadas. True,
    I had seen nothing of the English stranger for the best part of the night,
    but I supposed that, like myself, he was not a fighting man, and that he
    had found shelter somewhere, while all that uproar and clamour were going
    on. However, I had promised him that I would be ready with wagon, provisions,
    and horses, and in any case I had contracted to take Fra Federico Evangelista
    to Cumbe; so I was making up my mind to set to work and get things straight,
    when I heard the Great Unknown call once more in his sepulchral voice: &ldquo;Lean-Shanks!&rdquo; The
    sound of his name caused that filthy Negro to give such a jerk of his big
    body that I fell off my perch, but I soon recovered myself, and just to teach
    him a lesson I gave his throat another squeeze, and as the Mamaluco&rsquo;s
    hat had rolled off his head, and lay close by, I picked it up and clamped
    it hard over his face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Great Unknown called once more for his faithful Lean-Shanks,
    and, when one of the men in the courtyard said in reply: &ldquo;Lean-Shanks
    is sick and cannot move,&rdquo; he called out loudly: &ldquo;Is Esteban,
    the carrier, there?&rdquo; Imagine my surprise! I can tell you that a bird
    could have knocked me down. I wished I could have crawled under the hood
    of my wagon. I do not pretend to be a man of courage, and the idea of being
    asked for by that awesome creature up there sent a cold shiver down my spine.
    I kept as still as a mouse. Unfortunately, some busybody had already pointed
    to me and called out: &ldquo;Here is Esteban!&rdquo; I thought I should just
    have time to creep out of sight, and would have done it, only that the prophet
    had already seen me. To my amazement what he said was: &ldquo;Come here,
    Esteban. Do not be afraid.&rdquo; And what filled me with greater amazement
    still, I heard a lovely, sweet woman&rsquo;s voice saying:  &ldquo;Do not
    be afraid, Esteban.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As I say, I never made pretence to be a brave man, but there was
    something reassuring about that girlish voice, and after a few more moments
    of reflection, I got to my feet. I took the precaution of stamping once more
    on the Negro&rsquo;s face and on his hands, and then I walked boldly across
    the courtyard and went up the veranda steps. The Great Unknown and the lovely
    Empress had gone back to their room, but the door stood open and, after a
    great deal of trepidation, I ventured at last to knock. Someone said: &ldquo;Enter!&rdquo; And
    in I went. The Great Unknown was standing in the middle of the room, and
    I caught a glimpse of the Empress standing near the window opposite. On a
    couch in one corner of the room lay what was obviously the body of the unfortunate
    Mamaluco, covered over with a sheet. It was the Empress who spoke to me. &ldquo;Go
    down, Esteban,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and fetch two strong men. They must
    come here and carry the body of this man down into the yard, and lay him
    on the floor of your wagon. He is a man of great consideration, and you must
    treat his body with the utmost respect. Then wait and watch beside it, and
    allow no one to come near. After that, Esteban, you will be greatly honoured
    because my father, the Great Unknown, and I, myself, as well as the saintly
    Fra Federico Evangelista, will travel in your wagon to Cumbe.&rdquo; She
    waited a moment. I suppose she saw how scared and agitated I was. I did not
    relish the idea, I can tell you, of driving that king of brigands through
    places where his men had committed most revolting crimes. But this I would
    not have said to the lovely innocent girl, who, after all, could not help
    being the villain&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;However, she knew well enough, apparently, what was going on in my
    mind, for she came nearer to me. In her stretched little hand I saw a heavy-looking
    purse. &ldquo;Here are a thousand milreis for you, Esteban,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If
    you are discreet and watchful, if you hold your tongue and obey my father&rsquo;s
    orders without question, there will be another thousand milreis for you when
    we reach Cumbe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Two thousand milreis, my friends!&rsquo; Esteban went on excitedly. &lsquo;Why!
    I did not even know before then, that there was such a sum in the whole countryside.
    I took the purse quickly enough, I can tell you, and would have kissed her
    hand, only I did not dare. She also gave me ten milreis for each of the men
    who would come up and fetch the poor Mamaluco&rsquo;s body away. Of course,
    I knew now that he was no Mamaluco, or the Great Unknown&mdash;who is the
    most cruel and arrogant devil in creation&mdash;would not have treated his
    would-be murderer with so much consideration. Amazed I was, I can tell you.
    I did not know if I was awake or dreaming, but the purse was real enough,
    and for two thousand milreis I would have driven Satan from earth back to
    hell.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well! I got two of Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s <i>vaqueiros</i> to come
    up and give me a hand with the body. I didn&rsquo;t tell them that the Great
    Unknown was still up there, or maybe they would have been as scared as I
    had been. When we got to the room, however, the prophet and the Empress were
    no longer there. We lifted the body, still wrapped in a sheet, and carried
    it down the stairs. It was heavy, I can tell you: the body of a large, powerfully-built
    man. The courtyard, of course, was full of bustle. The Sertanejos were getting
    to horse, and the carriers had finished loading the wagons: they were all
    waiting for the order to start. It was a curious fact, which struck me at
    once, that Lean-Shanks, who was obviously a very sick man now, was left without
    anyone near him. I think he was hated by all the other brigands, and that
    they were actually hoping that he was dead.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anyway, at the same moment that the three of us, carrying our gruesome
    burden, reached the foot of the steps, the Great Unknown reappeared upon
    the balcony. In his deep, sepulchral voice he ordered his men to make way
    for us, which they did, and we passed quietly between them to my wagon, and
    laid the body down on the floor on a blanket. I remained there sitting under
    the hood with the dead man, watching over him and waiting. From the movement
    in the courtyard, from the noise and the tramping of hooves, I gathered that
    the order for departure had been given; and sure enough, when, after ten
    minutes or so, I ventured to peep out from under the hood, I saw the troop
    of Sertanejos ride out of the stockade, followed by a couple of carts. And &ldquo;Thank
    God!&rdquo; I said to myself when I saw the backs of those brigands,  &ldquo;the
    air in the <i>quinta</i> will be cleaner now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I still had the greatest ordeal in front of me. As soon as the
    Sertanejos had all gone, I ventured to get down from the wagon&mdash;just
    in time to see the Great Unknown, with his veil and his robes, come down
    the veranda steps. The Empress was with him, and Fra Federico Evangelista,
    whilst Barbosa, and half a dozen of Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s servants were
    hovering round them, very obsequious and offering horses, carriages, all
    sorts of things in their dead master&rsquo;s name, but at the same time obviously
    mightily glad to see their unwelcome guests depart. I thought to myself: &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll
    be some looting done in the house presently, as good as what the Great Unknown
    and his pirates have ever done.&rdquo; However, that was no business of mine.
    I got blankets ready in the wagon for my three distinguished passengers,
    who evidently meant me to start immediately. What in the world induced that
    mysterious and wonderful prophet to travel in a humble carrier&rsquo;s cart
    with his daughter, who, he claims, is Empress of Brazil, I cannot think.
    But there they were, anyway. I helped the Empress into my wagon, and made
    her as comfortable as I could, which was not easy with that dead body lying
    full length on the floor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Great Unknown came next. He tried on some of his benediction
    business with the crowd of Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s servants, but though they
    were most respectful in their attitude, and not a little scared of him, they
    did not beat the ground with their foreheads as the Sertanejos had done.
    However, when I had seen him installed beside his daughter, and Fra Federico
    also as comfortable as possible, I got up into the wagon, ordered my man
    to sit beside me, and slowly we swung out of the stockade. We left behind
    us a dead man, a sick woman, and a lot of scared and distracted servants.
    I never saw them or that <i>quinta</i> of evil again.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter43"></a>Chapter 43 </b></h2>
  <p>That was as far as Esteban knew of the tragic events of that memorable affair,
    and that was the substance of the story which he related for the twentieth
    time to his friends in the coffee-room of the station at Bomfin while waiting
    for a train. In detail the story varied at times; with reiteration it gained
    in picturesqueness, but in the main facts, it never varied, and was always
    listened to with eagerness and deference. For Esteban was a rich man now.
    He was still a carrier by trade, but what a carrier! He owned a large number
    of horses and mules, and wagons: and what&rsquo;s more, he had recently acquired
    a motor lorry, which went lumbering on the impossible roads that led inland
    as far as the Sertao.</p>
  <p>But though he was now a man of consideration, and though his friends and
    sycophants hung upon his lips when he told his exciting tale, there were
    one or two points which he had never been able to elucidate to his own satisfaction.
    The chain of events was there right enough, but there were one or two missing
    links in it, and Esteban often puzzled his head over those mysteries. This,
    however, he would not for worlds have admitted to his friends.</p>
  <p>Yes! there were one or two things which Esteban did not know: one or two
    fragments which he never could piece rightly together.</p>
  <p>He did hot know, for instance, that when Tim O&rsquo;Clee, after his fight
    on the veranda with Dom Mano&euml;l da Lisbao, found himself so unexpectedly
    out of the reach of Dom Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s servants who were thirsting for
    his blood, he had not the least idea at first where he was, nor how he had
    got there. Marivosa da Gloria had closed the door upon him, and the room
    was in almost total darkness, and as the stone walls of the house were thick
    and solid, he heard nothing of what was going on outside&mdash;neither Dom
    Mano&euml;l&rsquo;s cowardly attack on Marivosa, nor Teresa&rsquo;s swift
    act of revenge. Moreover, after the strenuous fight, and the blows which
    he had received and dealt, his brain was not in a sufficiently clear state
    to enable him to think and to recollect exactly what had happened.</p>
  <p>But this muddled condition passed away after a few minutes spent in darkness
    and in solitude. He remembered now that earlier in the evening he had had
    a brief vision of Marivosa at a certain door which gave on the veranda, that
    he had crept across the courtyard and up the steps, and then lain down across
    the threshold to watch unseen over her in the night. He had had his plan
    already in mind then, but the time had not yet come for putting it into execution.
    He had taken off his leather coat and used it as a pillow, but he did not
    sleep. Thank God that he had been able to locate the room where Marivosa
    lay helpless at the mercy of the most devilish blackguard that had ever defiled
    God&rsquo;s earth. Then had come the fight, and his unexpected and unexplainable
    rescue. And, since then, confused sounds of heavy, tramping feet, of thuds,
    of swinging and closing doors, and a few vague mutterings, had alone reached
    his consciousness. He wondered what was happening out there. Had he been
    lucky enough to send Dom Mano&euml;l to Hades, or so far injured him that
    he could do no more mischief for some time to come? He knew not. He waited
    for some time till the tramping outside on the veranda had subsided: then
    he opened the door cautiously and peeped out. There was no one on the veranda
    now except at its farthest end: and there he saw Dudley Stone standing in
    one of the doorways, with his arm round his daughter&rsquo;s shoulders. Satisfied
    that his beloved was, at any rate, in safety with her father for the moment,
    he turned his attention to the courtyard. Vague forms were flitting soundlessly
    about. The men, after the excitement of the fight, were making ready to light
    a camp-fire and to snatch a little rest before the dawn.</p>
  <p>Tim hesitated. His plan was clear and ready in his mind, but secrecy was
    his only sure ally, and the more men there were about when he started, the
    greater the risk of failure. And fail he would not. Not on your life! His
    beloved. His mate. The better part of his very soul. Out of the jaws of death,
    out of the clutches of fiends he would snatch her this night, and resting
    in his arms she would forget the cruel past, the lies, the deceptions&mdash;all
    that she had endured&mdash;and learn at last how fair God&rsquo;s earth could
    be, and how exquisite was love.</p>
  <p>Tim looked about him. His eyes were growing accustomed to the gloom, and
    he saw that exactly opposite the door there was a window. It was shuttered,
    of course, but he soon had it open and peeped out. It gave on a grove of
    palms and acacias, and beyond this was the open country: cultivated fields,
    with a few huts dotted about, some outhouses, stables, and the horse and
    cattle-pens. The height from the window to the ground was fifteen feet, perhaps,
    not more. Tim swung himself over the sill and dropped down.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now for a bit of luck, and a horse,&rsquo; he said to himself, as
    he plunged into the belt of trees. The waning moon was a tiresome enemy,
    for she shed a brilliant radiance over every exposed bit of ground, but,
    guided by ear and nostrils, Tim found his way to one of the lean-to sheds
    where a dozen or more horses were tethered. With a quick and practised eye
    he adjudged their respective qualities, selected the one most suited to his
    purpose and saddled it. In one of the stalls there was a pile of leather
    clothes. He found a coat that was not too small for him, slipped it on, led
    the horse out to a piece of soft ground, mounted and rode away.</p>
  <p>He rode at random. For hours. Over fields and cultivated land, till his
    horse was covered with lather, and its flanks shook with excitement and exhaustion.
    Only once did he draw rein and dismount by the bank of a narrow stream, where
    grew the huge dock-like leaves which yield a dark brown juice. He gathered
    an armful of these: then stripped to the skin, and rubbed his face and his
    body all over with the stain. Carefully he did it, and thoroughly. It was
    one of the many tricks which he had learned from his kind old friend, Fra
    Federico. All over his body did he rub the juice, for he would take no risks
    this night.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I look like a bally nigger now,&rsquo; he said triumphantly, examining
    his fine long limbs, his hands, his feet. &lsquo;Bless Fra Federico for this
    and many other things.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He swung himself up in the saddle once more. Weary? Not a bit of it! And
    again he rode and rode round and round over fields and cultivated lands.
    What would Uncle Justin have said to this? &lsquo;Always save your horse,
    boy, never weary him.&rsquo; And here was he, Tim, riding his horse nearly
    to death.</p>
  <p>And when the waning moon after reaching her zenith began her downward course,
    he made his way to the stony road which gleamed white and dusty in her light,
    and rode, still at breakneck speed, back to the <i>quinta</i>.</p>
  <p>Nothing of this did Esteban guess when he talked of the Mamaluco, of Lean-Shanks,
    and of the Great Unknown. How could he guess that the Mamaluco who threw
    Lean-Shanks over the balustrade down into the courtyard below, and then entered
    the presence of the veiled prophet, was none other than the English stranger?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now speak!&rsquo; the veiled prophet had commanded, as soon as Tim
    had followed him into the room. He was standing with his back to a large
    table littered with papers, and Tim came close to him. &lsquo;Stand back!&rsquo; he
    added suddenly, but that command came just a second too late, for Tim had
    learned many tricks from the finest sportsman in Ireland. With the swiftness
    of lightning his left shot out and caught the charlatan under the jaw; he
    staggered and fell prone across the table, with Tim all at once on the top
    of him, squeezing his long, lean throat to the point of unconsciousness.
    Dudley Stone was no longer a young man. What chance had he against this other,
    who had everything on his side; youth, training, knowledge, and, above all,
    incentive&mdash;the greatest incentive of all, the safety and happiness of
    his beloved?</p>
  <p>And Tim was of set purpose. He had thought it all out, planned it, and schemed
    and estimated every eventuality. Marivosa&rsquo;s presence, her non-presence:
    how he would act in either case. Well! she was not here. Not at the moment.
    So it was all quite simple. One hand firmly clamped on the old villain&rsquo;s
    face, finger and thumb holding the nostrils tightly pressed together: then
    the phial in the pocket of the belt, the precious potion concocted by Fra
    Federico Evangelista, which had already saved Tim&rsquo;s life&mdash;saved
    it for the means of escape of his beloved from the hell which her own father
    had prepared for her. And now it would do its work again, finish the great
    work it had begun. The nostrils held tightly: the phial pressed to the half-conscious
    man&rsquo;s lips, the precious potion poured into his mouth. Then the convulsive,
    mechanical movement of the sinews as the fluid slowly trickled down the throat.</p>
  <p>A second later Tim looked up. Marivosa had come into the room. At first,
    probably, she could not make out what was happening; she did not see her
    father, only Tim&rsquo;s back. But when he looked up and straightened himself
    out, she recognized him immediately. In spite of the dark stain on his face
    she recognized him. Had she been for a moment in doubt, she would have called
    for help. But seeing him, she remained silent, even though she saw her father
    lying prone right across the table, with the veil torn from his face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have killed him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The words came like a hoarse murmur from her throat. Her face was whiter
    than any ivory, and her eyes dilated in a look of horror.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I swear that I have not,&rsquo; Tim replied in a hurried whisper. &lsquo;By
    my love for you, I swear that I have done him no harm. If you trust me&mdash;if
    you love me, help me now, and within the hour you and I will be miles away
    in safety.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as for a second or two she still remained motionless, standing there
    and staring at him, he said once more: &lsquo;If you love me, help me now&mdash;or
    else we must both perish.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Confused sounds came from the outside: fighting, shouting, tramping. Tim
    knew that he had less than three minutes to spare: three minutes in which
    to lift the inert body from the table, take off the long robe, wrap it round
    himself, pick up the veil, and swathe his face and head with it. He had not
    glanced again on Marivosa. He dared not look at her again. On her trust in
    him, now, at this supreme moment, depended his life and hers: in her tiny
    hands she held both their destinies. And the moment of uncertainty was so
    tense that he dared not look on her and learn what their fate was to be.</p>
  <p>There was plenty of noise down in the courtyard: greater and louder did
    it grow every moment, but it seemed to come from very far away. Here in the
    room it seemed so still&mdash;so still, that Tim thought he could hear the
    beating of his own heart in his breast. And then, all of a sudden, a sound
    broke that stillness, a sound so strange that Tim must needs catch his breath
    and marvel if excitement had not addled his senses: for the sound was not
    only strange. It was like the most delicious music that comes from a choir
    of angels&mdash;the music of a girlish laugh. A sweet, low, rippling laugh,
    like the trill from a warbler&rsquo;s throat. And then, the words: &lsquo;Oh,
    Tim! you don&rsquo;t know how funny you look!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Thus did he learn that all was well. But there was no time now, not even
    for a kiss. She understood everything. Guessed at what she did not know.
    She fetched a sheet from the next room and helped him to lay it over her
    father&rsquo;s body. She also put a wad of milreis into his hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll need it,&rsquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>For a second, then, did he look into her sweet face, and, resting his hand
    on the body of that cruel mountebank, who was her father, he said earnestly:  &lsquo;He
    will sleep for forty-eight hours, as I did once. I swear to you that he is
    not dead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then he went out on the veranda in full sight of all the men, while Marivosa
    went to find Fra Federico.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter44"></a>Chapter 44 </b></h2>
  <p>But Esteban knew nothing about all that. All he knew was that the Mamaluco
    had forced his way into the chamber of the Great Unknown&mdash;presumably
    with murderous intent&mdash;but that it was the Great Unknown who came out
    of the chamber unscathed: while he, Esteban, was ordered to lay the dead
    body of the mysterious Mamaluco on the floor of his wagon.</p>
  <p>That the Mamaluco was a mysterious personage was patent to Esteban. Had
    he not been ordered by no less a person than the Empress Marivosa herself
    to treat that inert form under the sheet with every care and respect? But
    Esteban had not done with surprises and puzzlement yet. Indeed, the next
    few hours were richer in excitement than any that had gone before; for what
    occurred during the previous night were matters that pertained to man and
    woman&mdash;such men and women as Esteban was acquainted with&mdash;wild,
    primitive, savage natures, with primal instincts of hate, jealousy, and revenge,
    culminating in outrage or murder: whereas what occurred in the course of
    the next two days savoured of the supernatural. And although it was all made
    clear to Esteban subsequently, he never could quite repress a shudder of
    superstitious awe when he thought over the events of those two days.</p>
  <p>That the beautiful Empress of Brazil and her extraordinary father should
    choose to travel in a carrier&rsquo;s wagon was in itself a strange occurrence.
    An inexplicable occurrence really: for why did they not go back to Canudos
    with their own escort of armed brigands? However, there they were, under
    the hood of Esteban&rsquo;s cart, and whenever Esteban looked over his shoulder
    at them, the arm of the veiled prophet was round his daughter&rsquo;s shoulders
    and her little head was resting against his breast. That, of course, was
    right and proper, and even understandable. Though the man was an arch-pirate
    and a cattle-thief, he loved his daughter apparently: and even the fearsome
    mother jaguar cares for her progeny.</p>
  <p>At intervals, too, the lovely Empress would stoop over the inert body on
    the floor of the wagon, raise the sheet, and look down on the face beneath
    it. And once Esteban caught sight of her face after she had done this, and
    he saw that there were tears in her eyes. But then the veiled prophet said
    something in a language which Esteban did not understand, whereupon the Empress
    smiled through her tears. This, again, was both natural and understandable.</p>
  <p>The puzzle came when, on another occasion, Esteban looked over his shoulder
    and saw that the Great Unknown held the Empress in both his arms, and that
    he was kissing her in a way that to Esteban&rsquo;s knowledge no man had
    ever kissed his own daughter before: he kissed her on the mouth, the eyes,
    and just between her throat and chin; and to Esteban it seemed as if he would
    never leave off kissing the beautiful Empress of Brazil.</p>
  <p>But apparently the sight of those two kissing in that way had no ill effect
    on Fra Federico&rsquo;s peace of mind. He sat opposite the Empress, with
    the inert body of the Mamaluco lying between them on the floor. The priest
    had an open book on his knee, the contents of which he must have known by
    heart, for despite the jolting of the wagon he kept his eyes fixed upon the
    book, and went on murmuring words and words and words, not one of which did
    Esteban understand, and which no man living could possibly have read out
    of the book, which bumped and bumped on Fra Federico&rsquo;s knee as the
    wagon went lumbering over the stony road.</p>
  <p>What already then struck Esteban as extraordinary was that during this period
    of kissing, the prophet had drawn aside his veil. Esteban, however, could
    not see his face, but it struck him as odd that the man&rsquo;s hair should
    be crisp and brown, like the hair of a young rather than old man. Also what
    Esteban saw of his hands and arms suggested the hands and arms of a young
    and vigorous man. Strangely, also, they appeared to have been stained recently
    with dock leaves: some of the stain had worn off and looked streaky, showing
    lines of singularly white skin between the dark ones&mdash;all of which gave
    Esteban a great deal of food for thought.</p>
  <p>And suddenly, there came the greatest surprise of all. This was just about
    midday, when a rest for the horses and men had become imperative, also food
    and drink. Esteban drew rein in a small coppice, where a few coarse palms,
    tall scrub, and acacia trees afforded welcome shade from the glaring sun.
    He knew of a water-hole close by, and, jumping down from the wagon, he ordered
    his man to do the same, to unhitch the mules and take them for a drink. He
    was busy for a time with his man, the mules and the wagon-shaft, and it was
    only after a few minutes that he turned round, with a view to receiving further
    orders from his exalted passengers.</p>
  <p>And that was the moment in Esteban&rsquo;s life when he felt more pious,
    because more terrified than he had ever been before. All he could do was
    to try and remember the prayers to his guardian angel and to his patron saint
    which the cur&eacute; of his native village had taught him, for he needed
    protection from Heaven in face of what looked neither more nor less than
    black art. What did he see? He saw the Great Unknown standing there in the
    dusty road, busy divesting himself of his flowing robes. His veil he had
    already cast aside. And a moment later, there stood revealed before Esteban&rsquo;s
    astounded gaze the face and form of the mad English stranger!</p>
  <p>Esteban fell on his knees, and murmured: &lsquo;Lord, have mercy on me,
    for I am but a miserable sinner!&rsquo; Whereupon the stranger laughed in
    the happy, hearty way which Esteban knew of old, and he came round to where
    Esteban was kneeling, raised him to his feet as if he were a child, slapped
    him on the back with such a thump that the poor man saw a constellation of
    stars, and said, with another equally loud laugh:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, man, that I would come away from Canudos
    laden with a hamper provided for me by the Great Unknown? There&rsquo;s the
    hamper, friend Esteban. Spread out the feast for the loveliest Empress the
    world has ever known: then go and feed yourself. Eat your fill, and drink
    your fill, for you see before you the happiest man on God&rsquo;s earth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Esteban&rsquo;s senses were positively reeling. How and when had the sortilege
    occurred? Was the mad English stranger in reality the Great Unknown&mdash;the
    impudent cattle-thief, the hellish brigand and pirate? Was he the Mamaluco,
    and had he slain the Great Unknown? Was he father or lover of this Marivosa
    da Gloria, Empress of Brazil? These were puzzles to which Esteban has never
    found a completely satisfactory answer to this day. All he could do at the
    time was to obey the commands of the great and mysterious personage, encouraged,
    and in a way comforted, by the presence and kindly smile of the beautiful
    Empress.</p>
  <p>And while Esteban carefully unpacked the hamper and laid the provisions
    in the dense shade of a clump of tall scrub, he could see through the corner
    of his eye the English stranger and the lovely Empress standing under an
    overhanging acacia tree. He had his arm round her, and every moment she would
    look up into his face; whereupon Esteban, being a man of discretion, promptly
    looked another way.</p>
  <p>But poor Esteban could not bring himself to eat. Thoughts of that inert
    body lying on the floor of his wagon worried him into a lack of appetite.
    If the veiled prophet whom he had seen walking out of the <i>quinta</i> and
    entering the wagon at dawn to-day was the English stranger, whose body was
    it that he, Esteban, had carried down the veranda steps and laid reverently
    on the floor of the wagon? That, again, was a puzzle, the true solution of
    which Esteban has never found to this day. That the man was not dead became,
    of course, evident as the two days of the long, wearisome journey went by.
    He just lay there on the floor of Esteban&rsquo;s cart, rigid and still,
    for a day and a night, and then the whole of the next day. What power on
    earth, heaven or hell, kept him thus Esteban dared not conjecture. It was
    comforting to see Fra Federico sitting there so quietly all the time, telling
    his beads or murmuring orisons at intervals, or else muttering to himself
    words out of his big book. It made Esteban feel that if the worst came to
    the worst and Satan had, in very truth, something to do with all that sortilege,
    then Fra Federico would be there ready to shrive him, Esteban, and his driver
    from participation in the black art.</p>
  <p>It was towards the close of the second day&rsquo;s journey that the inert
    mass under the sheet first began to stir. Esteban by now had become accustomed
    to his surroundings. The English stranger, with his laughter and his jokes,
    had done his best to put him at his ease, Fra Federico had been encouraging
    and kind, and the lovely Empress gracious and merry. At the first stirring
    of the man under the sheet Esteban was ordered to halt. His three passengers
    at once ministered to the revitalized corpse, plied him with drink, then
    laid him down to rest once more. Esteban did not dare to look round too often.
    During the remainder of the way to Cumbe he was ordered alternately to halt
    and to move on, which he did obediently, smothering his curiosity as best
    he could. That the inert mass had become a living person was, of course,
    patent: that he was a man of great consideration was equally so. What puzzled
    Esteban was that the beautiful young Empress ministered to all his wants
    with such obvious tenderness and affection.</p>
  <p>But the man did not respond: neither by word nor sign did he respond to
    Marivosa da Gloria&rsquo;s gentleness, nor to the English stranger&rsquo;s
    solicitude, and he repulsed Fra Federico&rsquo;s attempts at ministration
    with rude words and contemptuous gestures. He hardly ever spoke: gave no
    reply when the others spoke to him. Most of the time he still lay on the
    floor of the wagon, almost as stark and certainly as silent as before. He
    spent the intervening night on the floor of the wagon, and the best part
    of the next day. In the afternoon he sat up for a time, but still he did
    not speak, although the lovely Empress would often look at him tenderly with
    tear-filled eyes.</p>
  <p>Puzzle? Of course it was a puzzle, an unsolvable riddle. Surely it could
    not be the Great Unknown himself, the mysterious chief of an army of five
    thousand lawless brigands, the resurrected prophet, the claimant to the throne
    of Brazil, who had travelled for two days and two nights, still and stark
    on the floor of a carrier&rsquo;s wagon? No wonder that Esteban no longer
    knew whether he himself was alive or dreaming.</p>
  <p>Cumbe was reached on the evening of the third day. Esteban brought his wagon
    to a halt in the centre of the village, opposite Fra Federico&rsquo;s dwelling-house.
    With what wonderful feelings of joy and triumph did Tim O&rsquo;Clee jump
    down from the wagon and look once more on the squalid huts, the dusty square,
    the stuffy store which had been the setting for the first act in his romantic
    adventure; the old familiar smell of coffee and peat pervaded the atmosphere.
    The same actors in that scene were still here: the naked, pot-bellied children,
    the dusky, wide-eyed women. They all gazed on him, on the wagon, on the lovely
    girl beside him, with the same silent, melancholy wonder as before.</p>
  <p>Fra Federico had offered the hospitality of his dilapidated, musty abode
    to his fellow-travellers. The English stranger and the Empress accepted with
    gratitude. A woman was pressed into doing some cleaning in the two rooms
    before the hammocks were slung up for the night. But, as before, the mystery
    man refused to leave the wagon. He took no food: just lay there like a log,
    obstinately shutting his ears to every word of hospitality and solicitude;
    presumably he was already asleep.</p>
  <p>By order of the Empress, Esteban placed a few simple provisions inside the
    cart within easy reach of the sleeper. Then he bade good night to everyone,
    drew the wagon across the square close to the store, where he and his man,
    and his horses, found shelter for the night.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter45"></a>Chapter 45 </b></h2>
  <p>At dawn the next morning in the dilapidated little church of Cumbe, far
    from the haunts of civilization, Fra Federico pronounced a blessing on the
    Empress of Brazil and the English stranger. Esteban, who had contracted to
    take them to Queimadas, where they wished to take the train to Pernambuco,
    declared that he witnessed the simple little ceremony with tears running
    down his cheeks, and when those two beautiful young creatures subsequently
    said farewell to the old priest, Esteban sobbed like a child.</p>
  <p>Never had he seen anything so affecting. The Empress kissed Fra Federico&rsquo;s
    old, withered hand, and the English stranger begged him to come away with
    them.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let us make a home for you, Padre, in good Old Oireland,&rsquo; he
    said,  &lsquo;where you can live your life in peace, with your orisons and
    your books. I promise you that your fame will be spread all over the world,
    and that the bigwigs from every part will come in pilgrimage just to have
    a talk with you, and the Pope will make you a cardinal or whatever else you
    wish to be.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But all that the lovely Empress said was: &lsquo;Come with us, dear Father
    Federico, and we will love you and care for you, and never cease to be grateful
    to you for all you have done for us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But the old priest only smiled and gently shook his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thank you both, my dear, dear children,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but
    I want no home on this earth. I look forward very soon to my last home in
    Heaven. Until then, I have the few books which I love, and there are a few
    simple souls in these lonely byways whom it has been my privilege to bring
    a little nearer to God. I could not now leave them to become once more a
    prey to Satan. What few more years it pleases God to grant me, I will devote
    to His service.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Thus they parted, with many more words in a tongue which Esteban did not
    understand. Their eyes were full of tears: only the old man&rsquo;s face
    remained serene and irradiated with unuttered happiness.</p>
  <p>Together the little group now walked across the square to where Esteban&rsquo;s
    driver was busy attending to the horses; the storekeeper stood by, staring
    and offering no assistance. It seemed as if the thought of her father suddenly
    roused Marivosa out of the sadness which her parting from Fra Federico had
    brought about. She ran along despite the heat, outdistancing the others.</p>
  <p>A cry of alarm from her soon brought Tim to her side.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He went about an hour ago,&rsquo; Esteban&rsquo;s driver said in
    answer to mute looks of anxiety from Tim and Marivosa, &lsquo;while you were
    in there.&rsquo; He pointed to the little church, and then added, with a
    careless shrug: &lsquo;I thought you knew.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;An hour ago!&rsquo; Marivosa exclaimed, and looked appealingly at
    Tim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We wait, then, till the senhor returns?&rsquo; Esteban asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course we wait,&rsquo; Tim replied; &lsquo;but find out at once,
    Esteban, which way the senhor went.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Esteban did his best. He interrogated the wide-eyed, melancholy women who
    sat in front of their huts, stirring their cooking-pots. He also interrogated
    the biggest of the pot-bellied <i>pequenos</i>. All of them agreed that the
    senhor had got out of the wagon about an hour ago, and that he had wandered
    out into the scrub. A certain number of coffee-coloured arms were extended
    to show in which direction the strange senhor had gone.</p>
  <p>Tim and Esteban and the driver, as well as one or two of the taller <i>pequenos</i>,
    went off in search of the missing man.</p>
  <p>They found him within a few hundred yards of the village. Tim and Esteban
    found him. He was lying in the scrub, face downwards, with a terrible gash
    across his throat. The knife, which belonged to one of Esteban&rsquo;s provision
    baskets, had fallen out of his convulsed right hand and lay near by. Close
    by, also on the ground, a dirty scrap of paper, held down by a stone, fluttered
    feebly in the breeze.</p>
  <p>Tim lifted the stone. Four words were scribbled on the paper in pencil above
    the initials &lsquo;D.S.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;<i>Now do your damnedest!</i>&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Esteban went back to fetch his driver and a couple of boys. They borrowed
    the tools from the storekeeper, and they buried the mysterious adventurer
    on the spot where they had found him. Fra Federico&mdash;gentle, understanding,
    Christian-spirited as always, murmured the prayers for the dead above the
    lonely grave.</p>
  <p>Dudley Stone, cruel, vengeful, arbitrary to the end, had chosen to face
    his Maker rather than face the complications which his downfall from his
    proud position of Emperor and Seer, the death of his associate and the loss
    of his daughter, would bring into his life.</p>
  <p>The one man who had defied and outwitted him, the man who had humbled his
    arrogance and had stolen his daughter, was, like a conqueror of old, taking
    him captive and in chains to witness his triumph. Well!&mdash;the adventurer,
    after having staked his all, had lost. The story of his capture and of his
    humiliation, known already to Esteban the carrier, would be all over the
    countryside very soon. Never again would his prestige as the resurrected
    prophet rally the scum of humanity round him. Never again could he, with
    uplifted arm, wander across the desert in the midst of thousands kneeling
    with heads in the dust at his feet.</p>
  <p>To the adventurer it was not the loss of fortune that mattered: that might,
    no doubt, have been recovered to a very large extent. It was the mummery,
    the bodyguard of fearsome Lieutenants, the oaths administered while the heavens
    rolled out their thunders: it was the r&ocirc;le of Seer and Emperor that
    had been the breath of his life. Hatred of the man who had robbed him of
    it all guided the knife which brought about the supreme end.</p>
  <p>That, at any rate, was to Tim O&rsquo;Clee the only plausible explanation
    of Dudley Stone&rsquo;s dying message to him. But, as a matter of fact, the
    mystery that brought about the adventurer&rsquo;s death remained as unsolvable
    as that which had guided his life. The Great Unknown remained the Great Unknown
    to the end.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter46"></a>Chapter 46 </b></h2>
  <p>Often now Tim and Marivosa talk of those far-off days on the arid lands
    of the Sertao&mdash;the dangers, the mysteries, the horrors of that never-to-be-forgotten
    time.</p>
  <p>And Marivosa da Gloria looks up with a smile at her husband and murmurs
    the question: &lsquo;Was it worth while after all?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It would be indiscreet to put on record Lord Traskmoore&rsquo;s reply to
    that question. Suffice it to say that it was not couched in words. &lsquo;Was
    it worth while?&rsquo; The most glorious adventure that had ever come a man&rsquo;s
    way, culminating in the possession of the most exquisite woman that had ever
    come out of the Creator&rsquo;s hands! Was it worth while? Even though, when
    on landing in England, Tim O&rsquo;Clee learned that the child born of the
    illegal marriage of Uncle Justin and Hold-Hands Juliana was dead, and that
    he, Timothy O&rsquo;Clerigh, had therefore automatically succeeded to the
    title and estates of Traskmoore: even though the life or death of Dudley
    Stone meant nothing more now, it still was very much worth while.</p>
  <p>A marriage in the English church at Pernambuco, a year&rsquo;s honeymoon
    in Italy and France, and Marivosa da Gloria, woman-like, adapted herself
    as easily to European conditions and the r&ocirc;le of a great lady in Ireland
    as she had done to that of potential Empress of Brazil.</p>
  <p>Anyway, she was the finest horsewoman in Ireland&mdash;a sure passport to
    the love and admiration of the old country&rsquo;s many gallant sportsmen.</p>
  <p>And Hold-Hands Juliana has found her right milieu in Cannes and in Deauville.
    She is rich, with a superb jointure and the undisputed title of Dowager Countess
    of Traskmoore&mdash;a still surer passport to the love and admiration of
    cosmopolitan crowds.</p>
  <p>For the sake of Uncle Justin&rsquo;s beloved memory, the legality of his
    marriage was never touched upon after Tim&rsquo;s return from Brazil: though
    he would have loved to have seen one more dream of his come true&mdash;the
    one which he had dreamed that night at Cumbe, when he saw Hold-Hands Juliana
    in cap and apron, on her hands and knees scrubbing the floors of Traskmoore.</p>
