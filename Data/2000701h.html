  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnOldMateOfYourFathers"></a>An Old Mate Of Your
      Father&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>You remember when we hurried home from the old bush school how we were sometimes
    startled by a bearded apparition, who smiled kindly down on us, and whom
    our mother introduced, as we raked off our hats, as &ldquo;An old mate of
    your father&rsquo;s on the diggings, Johnny.&rdquo; And he would pat our
    heads and say we were fine boys, or girls&mdash;as the case may have been&mdash;and
    that we had our father&rsquo;s nose but our mother&rsquo;s eyes, or the other
    way about; and say that the baby was the dead spit of its mother, and then
    added, for father&rsquo;s benefit: &ldquo;But yet he&rsquo;s like you, Tom.&rdquo; It
    did seem strange to the children to hear him address the old man by his Christian
    name&mdash;considering that the mother always referred to him as &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; She
    called the old mate Mr So-and-so, and father called him Bill, or something
    to that effect.</p>
  <p>Occasionally the old mate would come dressed in the latest city fashion,
    and at other times in a new suit of reach-me-downs, and yet again he would
    turn up in clean white moleskins, washed tweed coat, Crimean shirt, blucher
    boots, soft felt hat, with a fresh-looking speckled handkerchief round his
    neck. But his face was mostly round and brown and jolly, his hands were always
    horny, and his beard grey. Sometimes he might have seemed strange and uncouth
    to us at first, but the old man never appeared the least surprised at anything
    he said or did&mdash;they understood each other so well&mdash;and we would
    soon take to this relic of our father&rsquo;s past, who would have fruit
    or lollies for us&mdash;strange that he always remembered them&mdash;and
    would surreptitiously slip &ldquo;shilluns&rdquo; into our dirty little hands,
    and tell us stories about the old days, &ldquo;when me an&rsquo; yer father
    was on the diggin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; you wasn&rsquo;t thought of, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sometimes the old mate would stay over Sunday, and in the forenoon or after
    dinner he and father would take a walk amongst the deserted shafts of Sapling
    Gully or along Quartz Ridge, and criticize old ground, and talk of past diggers&rsquo;  mistakes,
    and second bottoms, and feelers, and dips, and leads&mdash;also outcrops&mdash;and
    absently pick up pieces of quartz and slate, rub them on their sleeves, look
    at them in an abstracted manner, and drop them again; and they would talk
    of some old lead they had worked on: &ldquo;Hogan&rsquo;s party was here
    on one side of us, Macintosh was here on the other, Mac was getting good
    gold and so was Hogan, and now, why the blanky blank weren&rsquo;t we on
    gold?&rdquo; And the mate would always agree that there was  &ldquo;gold
    in them ridges and gullies yet, if a man only had the money behind him to
    git at it.&rdquo; And then perhaps the guv&rsquo;nor would show him a spot
    where he intended to put down a shaft some day&mdash;the old man was always
    thinking of putting down a shaft. And these two old fifty-niners would mooch
    round and sit on their heels on the sunny mullock heaps and break clay lumps
    between their hands, and lay plans for the putting down of shafts, and smoke,
    till an urchin was sent to &ldquo;look for his father and Mr So-and-so, and
    tell &rsquo;em to come to their dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And again&mdash;mostly in the fresh of the morning&mdash;they would hang
    about the fences on the selection and review the live stock: five dusty skeletons
    of cows, a hollow-sided calf or two, and one shocking piece of equine scenery&mdash;which,
    by the way, the old mate always praised. But the selector&rsquo;s heart was
    not in farming nor on selections&mdash;it was far away with the last new
    rush in Western Australia or Queensland, or perhaps buried in the worked-out
    ground of Tambaroora, Married Man&rsquo;s Creek, or Araluen; and by-and-by
    the memory of some half-forgotten reef or lead or Last Chance, Nil Desperandum,
    or Brown Snake claim would take their thoughts far back and away from the
    dusty patch of sods and struggling sprouts called the crop, or the few discouraged,
    half-dead slips which comprised the orchard. Then their conversation would
    be pointed with many Golden Points, Bakery Hill, Deep Creeks, Maitland Bars,
    Specimen Flats, and Chinamen&rsquo;s Gullies. And so they&rsquo;d yarn till
    the youngster came to tell them that &ldquo;Mother sez the breakfus is gettin&rsquo; cold,&rdquo; and
    then the old mate would rouse himself and stretch and say, &ldquo;Well, we
    mustn&rsquo;t keep the missus waitin&rsquo;, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, after tea, they would sit on a log of the wood-heap, or the edge of
    the veranda&mdash;that is, in warm weather&mdash;and yarn about Ballarat
    and Bendigo&mdash;of the days when we spoke of being on a place oftener than
    at it: <i>on</i> Ballarat, <i>on</i> Gulgong, <i>on</i> Lambing Flat, on <i>Creswick</i>&mdash;and
    they would use the definite article before the names, as: &ldquo;on The Turon;
    The Lachlan; The Home Rule; The Canadian Lead.&rdquo; Then again they&rsquo;d
    yarn of old mates, such as Tom Brook, Jack Henright, and poor Martin Ratcliffe&mdash;who
    was killed in his golden hole&mdash;and of other men whom they didn&rsquo;t
    seem to have known much about, and who went by the names of &ldquo;Adelaide
    Adolphus,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Corney George,&rdquo; and other names which might
    have been more or less applicable.</p>
  <p>And sometimes they&rsquo;d get talking, low and mysterious like, about &ldquo;Th&rsquo;  Eureka
    Stockade;&rdquo; and if we didn&rsquo;t understand and asked questions, &ldquo;what
    was the Eureka Stockade?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what did they do it for?&rdquo; father&rsquo;d
    say: &ldquo;Now, run away, sonny, and don&rsquo;t bother; me and Mr So-and-so
    want to talk.&rdquo; Father had the mark of a hole on his leg, which he said
    he got through a gun accident when a boy, and a scar on his side, that we
    saw when he was in swimming with us; he said he got that in an accident in
    a quartz-crushing machine. Mr So-and-so had a big scar on the side of his
    forehead that was caused by a pick accidentally slipping out of a loop in
    the rope, and falling down a shaft where he was working. But how was it they
    talked low, and their eyes brightened up, and they didn&rsquo;t look at each
    other, but away over sunset, and had to get up and walk about, and take a
    stroll in the cool of the evening when they talked about Eureka?</p>
  <p>And, again they&rsquo;d talk lower and more mysterious like, and perhaps
    mother would be passing the wood-heap and catch a word, and asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who was she, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Tom&mdash;father&mdash;would say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t know her, Mary; she belonged to a family Bill
    knew at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Bill would look solemn till mother had gone, and then they would smile
    a quiet smile, and stretch and say, &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; and start something
    else.</p>
  <p>They had yarns for the fireside, too, some of those old mates of our father&rsquo;s,
    and one of them would often tell how a girl&mdash;a queen of the diggings&mdash;was
    married, and had her wedding-ring made out of the gold of that field; and
    how the diggers weighed their gold with the new wedding-ring&mdash;for luck&mdash;by
    hanging the ring on the hook of the scales and attaching their chamois-leather
    gold bags to it (whereupon she boasted that four hundred ounces of the precious
    metal passed through her wedding-ring); and how they lowered the young bride,
    blindfolded, down a golden hole in a big bucket, and got her to point out
    the drive from which the gold came that her ring was made out of. The point
    of this story seems to have been lost&mdash;or else we forget it&mdash;but
    it was characteristic. Had the girl been lowered down a duffer, and asked
    to point out the way to the gold, and had she done so successfully, there
    would have been some sense in it.</p>
  <p>And they would talk of King, and Maggie Oliver, and G. V. Brooke, and others,
    and remember how the diggers went five miles out to meet the coach that brought
    the girl actress, and took the horses out and brought her in in triumph,
    and worshipped her, and sent her off in glory, and threw nuggets into her
    lap. And how she stood upon the box-seat and tore her sailor hat to pieces,
    and threw the fragments amongst the crowd; and how the diggers fought for
    the bits and thrust them inside their shirt bosoms; and how she broke down
    and cried, and could in her turn have worshipped those men&mdash;loved them,
    every one. They were boys all, and gentlemen all. There were college men,
    artists, poets, musicians, journalists&mdash;Bohemians all. Men from all
    the lands and one. They understood art&mdash;and poverty was dead.</p>
  <p>And perhaps the old mate would say slyly, but with a sad, quiet smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got that bit of straw yet, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Those old mates had each three pasts behind them. The two they told each
    other when they became mates, and the one they had shared.</p>
  <p>And when the visitor had gone by the coach we noticed that the old man would
    smoke a lot, and think as much, and take great interest in the fire, and
    be a trifle irritable perhaps.</p>
  <p>Those old mates of our father&rsquo;s are getting few and far between, and
    only happen along once in a way to keep the old man&rsquo;s memory fresh,
    as it were. We met one to-day, and had a yarn with him, and afterwards we
    got thinking, and somehow began to wonder whether those ancient friends of
    ours were, or were not, better and kinder to their mates than we of the rising
    generation are to our fathers; and the doubt is painfully on the wrong side.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SettlingOnTheLand"></a>Settling On The Land</b></h2>
  <p>The worst bore in Australia just now is the man who raves about getting
    the people on the land, and button-holes you in the street with a little
    scheme of his own. He generally does not know what he is talking about.</p>
  <p>There is in Sydney a man named Tom Hopkins who settled on the land once,
    and sometimes you can get him to talk about it. He did very well at his trade
    in the city, years ago, until he began to think that he could do better up-country.
    Then he arranged with his sweetheart to be true to him and wait whilst he
    went west and made a home. She drops out of the story at this point.</p>
  <p>He selected on a run at Dry Hole Creek, and for months awaited the arrival
    of the government surveyors to fix his boundaries; but they didn&rsquo;t
    come, and, as he had no reason to believe they would turn up within the next
    ten years, he grubbed and fenced at a venture, and started farming operations.</p>
  <p>Does the reader know what grubbing means? Tom does. He found the biggest,
    ugliest, and most useless trees on his particular piece of ground; also the
    greatest number of adamantine stumps. He started without experience, or with
    very little, but with plenty of advice from men who knew less about farming
    than he did. He found a soft place between two roots on one side of the first
    tree, made a narrow, irregular hole, and burrowed down till he reached a
    level where the tap-root was somewhat less than four feet in diameter, and
    not quite as hard as flint: then he found that he hadn&rsquo;t room to swing
    the axe, so he heaved out another ton or two of earth&mdash;and rested. Next
    day he sank a shaft on the other side of the gum; and after tea, over a pipe,
    it struck him that it would be a good idea to burn the tree out, and so use
    up the logs and lighter rubbish lying round. So he widened the excavation,
    rolled in some logs, and set fire to them&mdash;with no better result than
    to scorch the roots.</p>
  <p>Tom persevered. He put the trace harness on his horse, drew in all the logs
    within half a mile, and piled them on the windward side of that gum; and
    during the night the fire found a soft place, and the tree burnt off about
    six feet above the surface, falling on a squatter&rsquo;s boundary fence,
    and leaving the ugliest kind of stump to occupy the selector&rsquo;s attention;
    which it did, for a week. He waited till the hole cooled, and then he went
    to work with pick, shovel, and axe: and even now he gets interested in drawings
    of machinery, such as are published in the agricultural weeklies, for getting
    out stumps without graft. He thought he would be able to get some posts and
    rails out of that tree, but found reason to think that a cast-iron column
    would split sooner&mdash;and straighter. He traced some of the surface roots
    to the other side of the selection, and broke most of his trace-chains trying
    to get them out by horse-power&mdash;for they had other roots going down
    from underneath. He cleared a patch in the course of time and for several
    seasons he broke more ploughshares than he could pay for.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the squatter was not idle. Tom&rsquo;s tent was robbed several
    times, and his hut burnt down twice. Then he was charged with killing some
    sheep and a steer on the run, and converting them to his own use, but got
    off mainly because there was a difference of opinion between the squatter
    and the other local J.P. concerning politics and religion.</p>
  <p>Tom ploughed and sowed wheat, but nothing came up to speak of&mdash;the
    ground was too poor; so he carted stable manure six miles from the nearest
    town, manured the land, sowed another crop, and prayed for rain. It came.
    It raised a flood which washed the crop clean off the selection, together
    with several acres of manure, and a considerable portion of the original
    surface soil; and the water brought down enough sand to make a beach, and
    spread it over the field to a depth of six inches. The flood also took half
    a mile of fencing from along the creek-bank, and landed it in a bend, three
    miles down, on a dummy selection, where it was confiscated.</p>
  <p>Tom didn&rsquo;t give up&mdash;he was energetic. He cleared another piece
    of ground on the siding, and sowed more wheat; it had the rust in it, or
    the smut&mdash;and averaged three shillings per bushel. Then he sowed lucerne
    and oats, and bought a few cows: he had an idea of starting a dairy. First,
    the cows&rsquo; eyes got bad, and he sought the advice of a German cocky,
    and acted upon it; he blew powdered alum through paper tubes into the bad
    eyes, and got some of it snorted and butted back into his own. He cured the
    cows&rsquo; eyes and got the sandy blight in his own, and for a week or so
    be couldn&rsquo;t tell one end of a cow from the other, but sat in a dark
    corner of the hut and groaned, and soaked his glued eyelashes in warm water.
    Germany stuck to him and nursed him, and saw him through.</p>
  <p>Then the milkers got bad udders, and Tom took his life in his hands whenever
    he milked them. He got them all right presently&mdash;and butter fell to
    fourpence a pound. He and the aforesaid cocky made arrangements to send their
    butter to a better market; and then the cows contracted a disease which was
    known in those parts as &ldquo;plooro permoanyer,&rdquo; but generally referred
    to as &ldquo;th&rsquo; ploorer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Tom sought advice, acting upon which he slit the cows&rsquo; ears,
    cut their tails half off to bleed them, and poured pints of &ldquo;pain killer&rdquo; into
    them through their nostrils; but they wouldn&rsquo;t make an effort, except,
    perhaps, to rise and poke the selector when he tried to tempt their appetites
    with slices of immature pumpkin. They died peacefully and persistently, until
    all were gone save a certain dangerous, barren, slab-sided luny bovine with
    white eyes and much agility in jumping fences, who was known locally as Queen
    Elizabeth.</p>
  <p>Tom shot Queen Elizabeth, and turned his attention to agriculture again.
    Then his plough horses took bad with some thing the Teuton called &ldquo;der
    shtranguls.&rdquo;  He submitted them to a course of treatment in accordance
    with Jacob&rsquo;s advice&mdash;and they died.</p>
  <p>Even then Tom didn&rsquo;t give in&mdash;there was grit in that man. He
    borrowed a broken-down dray-horse in return for its keep, coupled it with
    his own old riding hack, and started to finish ploughing. The team wasn&rsquo;t
    a success. Whenever the draught horse&rsquo;s knees gave way and he stumbled
    forward, he jerked the lighter horse back into the plough, and something
    would break. Then Tom would blaspheme till he was refreshed, mend up things
    with wire and bits of clothes-line, fill his pockets with stones to throw
    at the team, and start again. Finally he hired a dummy&rsquo;s child to drive
    the horses. The brat did his best he tugged at the head of the team, prodded
    it behind, heaved rocks at it, cut a sapling, got up his enthusiasm, and
    wildly whacked the light horse whenever the other showed signs of moving&mdash;but
    he never succeeded in starting both horses at one and the same time. Moreover
    the youth was cheeky, and the selector&rsquo;s temper had been soured: he
    cursed the boy along with the horses, the plough, the selection, the squatter,
    and Australia. Yes, he cursed Australia. The boy cursed back, was chastised,
    and immediately went home and brought his father.</p>
  <p>Then the dummy&rsquo;s dog tackled the selector&rsquo;s dog and this precipitated
    things. The dummy would have gone under had his wife not arrived on the scene
    with the eldest son and the rest of the family. They all fell foul of Tom.
    The woman was the worst. The selector&rsquo;s dog chawed the other and came
    to his master&rsquo;s rescue just in time&mdash;or Tom Hopkins would never
    have lived to become the inmate of a lunatic asylum.</p>
  <p>Next year there happened to be good grass on Tom&rsquo;s selection and nowhere
    else, and he thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea&mdash;to get a few poor
    sheep, and fatten them up for market: sheep were selling for about seven-and-sixpence
    a dozen at that time. Tom got a hundred or two, but the squatter had a man
    stationed at one side of the selection with dogs to set on the sheep directly
    they put their noses through the fence (Tom&rsquo;s was not a sheep fence).
    The dogs chased the sheep across the selection and into the run again on
    the other side, where another man waited ready to pound them.</p>
  <p>Tom&rsquo;s dog did his best; but he fell sick while chawing up the fourth
    capitalistic canine, and subsequently died. The dummies had robbed that cur
    with poison before starting it across&mdash;that was the only way they could
    get at Tom&rsquo;s dog.</p>
  <p>Tom thought that two might play at the game, and he tried; but his nephew,
    who happened to be up from the city on a visit, was arrested at the instigation
    of the squatter for alleged sheep-stealing, and sentenced to two years&rsquo; hard;
    during which time the selector himself got six months for assaulting the
    squatter with intent to do him grievous bodily harm-which, indeed, he more
    than attempted, if a broken nose, a fractured jaw, and the loss of most of
    the squatters&rsquo; teeth amounted to anything. The squatter by this time
    had made peace with the other local Justice, and had become his father-in-law.</p>
  <p>When Tom came out there was little left for him to live for; but he took
    a job of fencing, got a few pounds together, and prepared to settle on the
    land some more. He got a &ldquo;missus&rdquo; and a few cows during the next
    year; the missus robbed him and ran away with the dummy, and the cows died
    in the drought, or were impounded by the squatter while on their way to water.
    Then Tom rented an orchard up the creek, and a hailstorm destroyed all the
    fruit. Germany happened to be represented at the time, Jacob having sought
    shelter at Tom&rsquo;s hut on his way home from town. Tom stood leaning against
    the door post with the hail beating on him through it all. His eyes were
    very bright and very dry, and every breath was a choking sob. Jacob let him
    stand there, and sat inside with a dreamy expression on his hard face, thinking
    of childhood and fatherland, perhaps. When it was over he led Tom to a stool
    and said, &ldquo;You waits there, Tom. I must go home for somedings. You
    sits there still and waits twenty minutes;&rdquo; then he got on his horse
    and rode off muttering to himself; &ldquo;Dot man moost gry, dot man moost
    gry.&rdquo; He was back inside of twenty minutes with a bottle of wine and
    a cornet under his overcoat. He poured the wine into two pint-pots, made
    Tom drink, drank himself, and then took his cornet, stood up at the door,
    and played a German march into the rain after the retreating storm. The hail
    had passed over his vineyard and he was a ruined man too. Tom did &ldquo;gry&rdquo;  and
    was all right. He was a bit disheartened, but he did another job of fencing,
    and was just beginning to think about &ldquo;puttin&rsquo; in a few vines
    an&rsquo; fruit-trees&rdquo; when the government surveyors&mdash;whom he&rsquo;d
    forgotten all about&mdash;had a resurrection and came and surveyed, and found
    that the real selection was located amongst some barren ridges across the
    creek. Tom reckoned it was lucky he didn&rsquo;t plant the orchard, and he
    set about shifting his home and fences to the new site. But the squatter
    interfered at this point, entered into possession of the farm and all on
    it, and took action against the selector for trespass&mdash;laying the damages
    at &pound;2500.</p>
  <p>Tom was admitted to the lunatic asylum at Parramatta next year, and the
    squatter was sent there the following summer, having been ruined by the drought,
    the rabbits, the banks, and a wool-ring. The two became very friendly, and
    had many a sociable argument about the feasibility&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;of
    blowing open the flood-gates of Heaven in a dry season with dynamite.</p>
  <p>Tom was discharged a few years since. He knocks about certain suburbs a
    good deal. He is seen in daylight seldom, and at night mostly in connection
    with a dray and a lantern. He says his one great regret is that he wasn&rsquo;t
    found to be of unsound mind before he went up-country.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="StiffnerAndJim"></a>Stiffner And Jim<br>
        <font size="+1">(Thirdly, Bill)</font></b></h2>
  <p>We were tramping down in Canterbury, Maoriland, at the time, swagging it&mdash;me
    and Bill&mdash;looking for work on the new railway line. Well, one afternoon,
    after a long, hot tramp, we comes to Stiffner&rsquo;s Hotel&mdash;between
    Christchurch and that other place&mdash;I forget the name of it&mdash;with
    throats on us like sunstruck bones, and not the price of a stick of tobacco.</p>
  <p>We had to have a drink, anyway, so we chanced it. We walked right into the
    bar, handed over our swags, put up four drinks, and tried to look as if we&rsquo;d
    just drawn our cheques and didn&rsquo;t care a curse for any man. We looked
    solvent enough, as far as swagmen go. We were dirty and haggard and ragged
    and tired-looking, and that was all the more reason why we might have our
    cheques all right.</p>
  <p>This Stiffner was a hard customer. He&rsquo;d been a spieler, fighting man,
    bush parson, temperance preacher, and a policeman, and a commercial traveller,
    and everything else that was damnable; he&rsquo;d been a journalist, and
    an editor; he&rsquo;d been a lawyer, too. He was an ugly brute to look at,
    and uglier to have a row with&mdash;about six-foot-six, wide in proportion,
    and stronger than Donald Dinnie.</p>
  <p>He was meaner than a gold-field Chinaman, and sharper than a sewer rat:
    he wouldn&rsquo;t give his own father a feed, nor lend him a sprat&mdash;unless
    some safe person backed the old man&rsquo;s I.O.U.</p>
  <p>We knew that we needn&rsquo;t expect any mercy from Stiffner; but something
    had to be done, so I said to Bill:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to be done, Bill! What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill was mostly a quiet young chap, from Sydney, except when he got drunk&mdash;which
    was seldom&mdash;and then he was a customer, from all round. He was cracked
    on the subject of spielers. He held that the population of the world was
    divided into two classes&mdash;one was spielers and the other was the mugs.
    He reckoned that he wasn&rsquo;t a mug. At first I thought he was a spieler,
    and afterwards I thought that he was a mug. He used to say that a man had
    to do it these times; that he was honest once and a fool, and was robbed
    and starved in consequences by his friends and relations; but now he intended
    to take all that he could get. He said that you either had to have or be
    had; that men were driven to be sharps, and there was no help for it.</p>
  <p>Bill said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to sharpen our teeth, that&rsquo;s all, and chew
    somebody&rsquo;s lug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>There was a lot of navvies at the pub, and I knew one or two by sight, so
    Bill says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know one or two of these mugs. Bite one of their ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I took aside a chap that I knowed and bit his ear for ten bob,
    and gave it to Bill to mind, for I thought it would be safer with him than
    with me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang on to that,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t lose it for
    your natural life&rsquo;s sake, or Stiffner&rsquo;ll stiffen us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We put up about nine bob&rsquo;s worth of drinks that night&mdash;me and
    Bill&mdash;and Stiffner didn&rsquo;t squeal: he was too sharp. He shouted
    once or twice.</p>
  <p>By-and-by I left Bill and turned in, and in the morning when I woke up there
    was Bill sitting alongside of me, and looking about as lively as the fighting
    kangaroo in London in fog time. He had a black eye and eighteen pence. He&rsquo;d
    been taking down some of the mugs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Stiffner
    can smash us both with one hand, and if we don&rsquo;t pay up he&rsquo;ll
    pound our swags and cripple us. He&rsquo;s just the man to do it. He loves
    a fight even more than he hates being had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to be done, Jim,&rdquo; says Bill, in
    a tired, disinterested tone that made me mad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s than&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke be damned,&rdquo; I snarled, losing my temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know dashed well that our swags are in the bar, and we can&rsquo;t
    smoke without them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toss you to see who&rsquo;s
    to face the landlord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blessed!&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
    you further first. You have got a front. You mugged that stuff away, and
    you&rsquo;ll have to get us out of the mess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It made him wild to be called a mug, and we swore and growled at each other
    for a while; but we daren&rsquo;t speak loud enough to have a fight, so at
    last I agreed to toss up for it, and I lost.</p>
  <p>Bill started to give me some of his points, but I shut him up quick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your turn, and made a mess of it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For
    God&rsquo;s sake give me a show. Now, I&rsquo;ll go into the bar and ask
    for the swags, and carry them out on to the veranda, and then go back to
    settle up. You keep him talking all the time. You dump the two swags together,
    and smoke like sheol. That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I went into the bar, got the swags from the missus, carried them out on
    to the veranda, and then went back.</p>
  <p>Stiffner came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; says Stiffner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a nice day, I think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. I suppose you are going on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have to make a move to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I hooked carelessly on to the counter with one elbow, and looked dreamy-like
    out across the clearing, and presently I gave a sort of sigh and said:  &ldquo;Ah,
    well! I think I&rsquo;ll have a beer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are! Where&rsquo;s your mate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s round at the back. He&rsquo;ll be round directly;
    but he ain&rsquo;t drinking this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stiffner laughed that nasty empty laugh of his. He thought Bill was whipping
    the cat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, boss?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thankee!... Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The country was pretty open round there&mdash;the nearest timber was better
    than a mile away, and I wanted to give Bill a good start across the flat
    before the go-as-you-can commenced; so I talked for a while, and while we
    were talking I thought I might as well go the whole hog&mdash;I might as
    well die for a pound as a penny, if I had to die; and if I hadn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d
    have the pound to the good, anyway, so to speak. Anyhow, the risk would be
    about the same, or less, for I might have the spirit to run harder the more
    I had to run for&mdash;the more spirits I had to run for, in fact, as it
    turned out&mdash;so I says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take one of them there flasks of whisky to last
    us on the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right y&rsquo;are,&rdquo; says Stiffner. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll ye
    have&mdash;a small one or a big one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, a big one, I think&mdash;if I can get it into my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a tight squeeze,&rdquo; he said, and he laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Bet you two drinks I&rsquo;ll
    get it in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The top inside coat-pocket, and no tearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a big bottle, and all my pockets were small; but I got it into the
    pocket he&rsquo;d betted against. It was a tight squeeze, but I got it in.</p>
  <p>Then we both laughed, but his laugh was nastier than usual, because it was
    meant to be pleasant, and he&rsquo;d lost two drinks; and my laugh wasn&rsquo;t
    easy&mdash;I was anxious as to which of us would laugh next.</p>
  <p>Just then I noticed something, and an idea struck me&mdash;about the most
    up-to-date idea that ever struck me in my life. I noticed that Stiffner was
    limping on his right foot this morning, so I said to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with your foot?&rdquo; putting my hand in my pocket. &ldquo;Oh,
    it&rsquo;s a crimson nail in my boot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I
    got the blanky thing out this morning; but I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There just happened to be an old bag of shoemaker&rsquo;s tools in the bar,
    belonging to an old cobbler who was lying dead drunk on the veranda. So I
    said, taking my hand out of my pocket again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lend us the boot, and I&rsquo;ll fix it in a minute. That&rsquo;s
    my old trade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re a shoemaker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    never have thought it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughs one of his useless laughs that wasn&rsquo;t wanted, and slips
    off the boot&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t laced it up&mdash;and hands it across
    the bar to me. It was an ugly brute&mdash;a great thick, iron-bound, boiler-plated
    navvy&rsquo;s boot. It made me feel sore when I looked at it.</p>
  <p>I got the bag and pretended to fix the nail; but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple of nails gone from the sole,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    put  &rsquo;em in if I can find any hobnails, and it&rsquo;ll save the sole,&rdquo; and
    I rooted in the bag and found a good long nail, and shoved it right through
    the sole on the sly. He&rsquo;d been a bit of a sprinter in his time, and
    I thought it might be better for me in the near future if the spikes of his
    running-shoes were inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, you&rsquo;ll find that better, I fancy,&rdquo; I said, standing
    the boot on the bar counter, but keeping my hand on it in an absent-minded
    kind of way. Presently I yawned and stretched myself, and said in a careless
    way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! How&rsquo;s the slate?&rdquo; He scratched the back of
    his head and pretended to think.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll call it thirty bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps he thought I&rsquo;d slap down two quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and what will you do supposing we don&rsquo;t
    pay you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked blank for a moment. Then he fired up and gasped and choked once
    or twice; and then he cooled down suddenly and laughed his nastiest laugh&mdash;he
    was one of those men who always laugh when they&rsquo;re wild&mdash;and said
    in a nasty, quiet tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You thundering, jumped-up crawlers! If you don&rsquo;t (something)
    well part up I&rsquo;ll take your swags and (something) well kick your gory
    pants so you won&rsquo;t be able to sit down for a month&mdash;or stand up
    either!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the sooner you begin the better,&rdquo; I said; and I chucked
    the boot into a corner and bolted.</p>
  <p>He jumped the bar counter, got his boot, and came after me. He paused to
    slip the boot on&mdash;but he only made one step, and then gave a howl and
    slung the boot off and rushed back. When I looked round again he&rsquo;d
    got a slipper on, and was coming&mdash;and gaining on me, too. I shifted
    scenery pretty quick the next five minutes. But I was soon pumped. My heart
    began to beat against the ceiling of my head, and my lungs all choked up
    in my throat. When I guessed he was getting within kicking distance I glanced
    round so&rsquo;s to dodge the kick. He let out; but I shied just in time.
    He missed fire, and the slipper went about twenty feet up in the air and
    fell in a waterhole.</p>
  <p>He was done then, for the ground was stubbly and stony. I seen Bill on ahead
    pegging out for the horizon, and I took after him and reached for the timber
    for all I was worth, for I&rsquo;d seen Stiffner&rsquo;s missus coming with
    a shovel&mdash;to bury the remains, I suppose; and those two were a good
    match&mdash;Stiffner and his missus, I mean.</p>
  <p>Bill looked round once, and melted into the bush pretty soon after that.
    When I caught up he was about done; but I grabbed my swag and we pushed on,
    for I told Bill that I&rsquo;d seen Stiffner making for the stables when
    I&rsquo;d last looked round; and Bill thought that we&rsquo;d better get
    lost in the bush as soon as ever we could, and stay lost, too, for Stiffner
    was a man that couldn&rsquo;t stand being had.</p>
  <p>The first thing that Bill said when we got safe into camp was: &ldquo;I
    told you that we&rsquo;d pull through all right. You need never be frightened
    when you&rsquo;re travelling with me. Just take my advice and leave things
    to me, and we&rsquo;ll hang out all right. Now&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I shut him up. He made me mad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;! What the sheol did <i>you</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I got away with the swags, didn&rsquo;t
    I? Where&rsquo;d they be now if it wasn&rsquo;t for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I sat on him pretty hard for his pretensions, and paid him out for
    all the patronage he&rsquo;d worked off on me, and called him a mug straight,
    and walked round him, so to speak, and blowed, and told him never to pretend
    to me again that he was a battler.</p>
  <p>Then, when I thought I&rsquo;d licked him into form, I cooled down and soaped
    him up a bit; but I never thought that he had three climaxes and a crisis
    in store for me.</p>
  <p>He took it all pretty cool; he let me have my fling, and gave me time to
    get breath; then he leaned languidly over on his right side, shoved his left
    hand down into his left trouserpocket, and brought up a boot-lace, a box
    of matches, and nine-and-six.</p>
  <p>As soon as I got the focus of it I gasped:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where the deuce did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had it all along,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I seen at the pub
    that you had the show to chew a lug, so I thought we&rsquo;d save it&mdash;nine-and-sixpences
    ain&rsquo;t picked up every day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he leaned over on his left, went down into the other pocket, and came
    up with a piece of tobacco and half-a-sovereign.</p>
  <p>My eyes bulged out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where the blazes did you get that from?&rdquo; I yelled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was the half-quid you give me last night.
    Half-quids ain&rsquo;t to be thrown away these times; and, besides, I had
    a down on Stiffner, and meant to pay him out; I reckoned that if we wasn&rsquo;t
    sharp enough to take him down we hadn&rsquo;t any business to be supposed
    to be alive. Anyway, I guessed we&rsquo;d do it; and so we did&mdash;and
    got a bottle of whisky into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he leaned back, tired-like, against the log, and dredged his upper
    left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and brought up a sovereign wrapped in a pound
    note. Then he waited for me to speak; but I couldn&rsquo;t. I got my mouth
    open, but couldn&rsquo;t get it shut again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got that out of the mugs last night, but I thought that we&rsquo;d
    want it, and might as well keep it. Quids ain&rsquo;t so easily picked up,
    nowadays; and, besides, we need stuff more&rsquo;n Stiffner does, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did he know you had the stuff?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s the fun of it. That&rsquo;s what made him so
    excited. He was in the parlour all the time I was playing. But we might as
    well have a drink!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We did. I wanted it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill turned in by-and-by, and looked like a sleeping innocent in the moonlight.
    I sat up late, and smoked, and thought hard, and watched Bill, and turned
    in, and thought till near daylight, and then went to sleep, and had a nightmare
    about it. I dreamed I chased Stiffner forty miles to buy his pub, and that
    Bill turned out to be his nephew.</p>
  <p>Bill divvied up all right, and gave me half a crown over, but I didn&rsquo;t
    travel with him long after that. He was a decent young fellow as far as chaps
    go, and a good mate as far as mates go; but he was too far ahead for a peaceful,
    easy-going chap like me. It would have worn me out in a year to keep up to
    him.</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;The name of this should have been: &lsquo;Bill and Stiffner (thirdly,
    Jim)&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheManWhoForgot"></a>The Man Who Forgot</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno,&rdquo; said Tom Marshall&mdash;known as &ldquo;The
    Oracle&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd o&rsquo; sich cases before: they
    ain&rsquo;t commin, but&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heerd o&rsquo; sich cases before,&rdquo; and
    he screwed up the left side of his face whilst he reflectively scraped his
    capacious right ear with the large blade of a pocket-knife.</p>
  <p>They were sitting at the western end of the rouseabouts&rsquo; hut, enjoying
    the breeze that came up when the sun went down, and smoking and yarning.
    The &ldquo;case&rdquo;  in question was a wretchedly forlorn-looking specimen
    of the swag-carrying clan whom a boundary-rider had found wandering about
    the adjacent plain, and had brought into the station. He was a small, scraggy
    man, painfully fair, with a big, baby-like head, vacant watery eyes, long
    thin hairy hands, that felt like pieces of damp seaweed, and an apologetic
    cringe-and-look-up-at-you manner. He professed to have forgotten who he was
    and all about himself.</p>
  <p>The Oracle was deeply interested in this case, as indeed he was in anything
    else that &ldquo;looked curious.&rdquo; He was a big, simple-minded shearer,
    with more heart than brains, more experience than sense, and more curiosity
    than either. It was a wonder that he had not profited, even indirectly, by
    the last characteristic. His heart was filled with a kind of reverential
    pity for anyone who was fortunate or unfortunate enough to possess an &ldquo;affliction;&rdquo; and
    amongst his mates had been counted a deaf man, a blind man, a poet, and a
    man who &ldquo;had rats.&rdquo; Tom had dropped across them individually,
    when they were down in the world, and had befriended them, and studied them
    with great interest&mdash;especially the poet; and they thought kindly of
    him, and were grateful&mdash;except the individual with the rats, who reckoned
    Tom had an axe to grind&mdash;that he, in fact, wanted to cut his (Rat&rsquo;s)
    liver out as a bait for Darling cod&mdash;and so renounced the mateship.</p>
  <p>It was natural, then, for The Oracle to take the present case under his
    wing. He used his influence with the boss to get the Mystery on &ldquo;picking
    up,&rdquo;  and studied him in spare time, and did his best to assist the
    poor hushed memory, which nothing the men could say or do seemed able to
    push further back than the day on which the stranger &ldquo;kind o&rsquo; woke
    up&rdquo; on the plain, and found a swag beside him. The swag had been prospected
    and fossicked for a clue, but yielded none. The chaps were sceptical at first,
    and inclined to make fun of the Mystery; but Tom interfered, and intimated
    that if they were skunks enough to chyack or try on any of their &ldquo;funny
    business&rdquo; with a &ldquo;pore afflicted chap,&rdquo; he (Tom) would
    be obliged to &ldquo;perform.&rdquo; Most of the men there had witnessed
    Tom&rsquo;s performance, and no one seemed ambitious to take a leading part
    in it. They preferred to be in the audience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; reflected The Oracle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a curious case,
    and I dare say some of them big doctors, like Morell Mackenzie, would be
    glad to give a thousand or two to get holt on a case like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; cried Mitchell, the goat of the shed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    go halves!&mdash;or stay, let&rsquo;s form a syndicate and work the Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some of the rouseabouts laughed, but the joke fell as flat with Tom as any
    other joke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; said the Mystery himself, in the whine
    that was natural to him, and with a timid side look up at Tom&mdash;&ldquo;the
    worst of it is I might be a lord or duke, and don&rsquo;t know anything about
    it. I might be a rich man, with a lot of houses and money. I might be a lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps guffawed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;yer laughing at?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    see anything unreasonable about it; he might be a lord as far as looks go.
    I&rsquo;ve seen two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; reflected Tom, ignoring Mitchell, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    something in that; but then again, you see, you might be Jack the Ripper.
    Better let it slide, mate; let the dead past bury its dead. Start fresh with
    a clean sheet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t even know my name, or whether I&rsquo;m married
    or not,&rdquo; whined the outcast. &ldquo;I might have a good wife and little
    ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better keep on forgetting, mate,&rdquo; Mitchell said, &ldquo;and
    as for a name, that&rsquo;s nothing. I don&rsquo;t know mine, and I&rsquo;ve
    had eight. There&rsquo;s plenty good names knocking round. I knew a man named
    Jim Smith that died. Take his name, it just suits you, and he ain&rsquo;t
    likely to call round for it; if he does, you can say you was born with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So they called him Smith, and soon began to regard him as a harmless lunatic
    and to take no notice of his eccentricities. Great interest was taken in
    the case for a time, and even Mitchell put in his oar and tried all sorts
    of ways to assist the Mystery in his weak, helpless, and almost pitiful endeavours
    to recollect who he was. A similar case happened to appear in the papers
    at this time, and the thing caught on to such an extent that The Oracle was
    moved to impart some advice from his store of wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think too much over it if I was you,&rdquo; said
    he to Mitchell,  &ldquo;hundreds of sensible men went mad over that there
    Tichborne case who didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it, but just through
    thinking on it; and you&rsquo;re ratty enough already, Jack. Let it alone
    and trust me to find out who&rsquo;s Smith just as soon as ever we cut out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Smith ate, worked, and slept, and borrowed tobacco and forgot
    to return it&mdash;which was made a note of. He talked freely about his case
    when asked, but if he addressed anyone, it was with the air of the timid
    but good young man, who is fully aware of the extent and power of this world&rsquo;s
    wickedness, and stands somewhat in awe of it, but yet would beg you to favour
    a humble worker in the vineyard by kindly accepting a tract, and passing
    it on to friends after perusal.</p>
  <p>One Saturday morning, about a fortnight before cut out, The Oracle came
    late to his stand, and apparently with something on his mind. Smith hadn&rsquo;t
    turned up, and the next rouseabout was doing his work, to the mutual dissatisfaction
    of all parties immediately concerned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of Smith?&rdquo; asked Mitchell of The Oracle. &ldquo;Seems
    to have forgot to get up this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom looked disheartened and disappointed. <i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgot again</i>,&rdquo;  said
    he, slowly and impressively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgot what? We know he&rsquo;s blessed well forgot to come to graft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgot again,&rdquo; repeated Tom. &ldquo;He woke up this
    morning and wanted to know who he was and where he was.&rdquo; Comments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better give him best, Oracle,&rdquo; said Mitchell presently. &ldquo;If
    he can&rsquo;t find out who he is and where he is, the boss&rsquo;ll soon
    find it out for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;when I take a thing in hand I see it
    through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was also characteristic of the boss-over-the-board, though in another
    direction. He went down to the hut and inquired for Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t you at work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who am I, sir? Where am I?&rdquo; whined Smith. &ldquo;Can you please
    tell me who I am and where I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss drew a long breath and stared blankly at the Mystery; then he erupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; he howled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who the
    gory sheol you are, except that you&rsquo;re a gory lunatic, and what&rsquo;s
    more, I don&rsquo;t care a damn. But I&rsquo;ll soon show you where you are!
    You can call up at the store and get your cheque, and soon as you blessed
    well like; and then take a walk, and don&rsquo;t forget to take your lovely
    swag with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The matter was discussed at the dinner-table. The Oracle swore that it was
    a cruel, mean way to treat a &ldquo;pore afflicted chap,&rdquo; and cursed
    the boss. Tom&rsquo;s admirers cursed in sympathy, and trouble seemed threatening,
    when the voice of Mitchell was heard to rise in slow, deliberate tones over
    the clatter of cutlery and tin plates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;I wonder whether Smith forgot
    his cheque?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was ascertained that Smith hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>There was some eating and thinking done. Soon Mitchell&rsquo;s voice was
    heard again, directed at The Oracle.</p>
  <p>It said &ldquo;Do you keep any vallabels about your bunk, Oracle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom looked hard at Mitchell. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;: only I think it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea for
    you to look at your bunk and see whether Smith forgot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps grew awfully interested. They fixed their eyes on Tom, and he
    looked with feeling from one face to another; then he pushed his plate back,
    and slowly extracted his long legs from between the stool and the table.
    He climbed to his bunk, and carefully reviewed the ingredients of his swag.
    Smith hadn&rsquo;t forgot.</p>
  <p>When The Oracle&rsquo;s face came round again there was in it a strange
    expression which a close study would have revealed to be more of anger than
    of sorrow, but that was not all. It was an expression such as a man might
    wear who is undergoing a terrible operation, without chloroform, but is determined
    not to let a whimper escape him. Tom didn&rsquo;t swear, and by that token
    they guessed how mad he was. &rsquo;Twas a rough shed, with a free and lurid
    vocabulary, but had they all sworn in chorus, with One-eyed Bogan as lead,
    it would not have done justice to Tom&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;and they realized
    this.</p>
  <p>The Oracle took down his bridle from its peg, and started for the door amid
    a respectful and sympathetic silence, which was only partly broken once by
    the voice of Mitchell, which asked in an awed whisper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going ter ketch yer horse, Tom?&rdquo; The Oracle nodded, and passed
    on; he spake no word&mdash;he was too full for words.</p>
  <p>Five minutes passed, and then the voice of Mitchell was heard again, uninterrupted
    by the clatter of tinware. It said in impressive tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would not be a bad idea for some of you chaps that camp in the
    bunks along there, to have a look at your things. Scotty&rsquo;s bunk is
    next to Tom&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Scotty shot out of his place as if a snake had hold of his leg, starting
    a plank in the table and upsetting three soup plates. He reached for his
    bunk like a drowning man clutching at a plank, and tore out the bedding.
    Again, Smith hadn&rsquo;t forgot.</p>
  <p>Then followed a general overhaul, and it was found in most cases that Smith
    had remembered. The pent-up reservoir of blasphemy burst forth.</p>
  <p>The Oracle came up with Smith that night at the nearest shanty, and found
    that he had forgotten again, and in several instances, and was forgetting
    some more under the influence of rum and of the flattering interest taken
    in his case by a drunken Bachelor of Arts who happened to be at the pub.
    Tom came in quietly from the rear, and crooked his finger at the shanty-keeper.
    They went apart from the rest, and talked together a while very earnestly.
    Then they secretly examined Smith&rsquo;s swag, the core of which was composed
    of Tom&rsquo;s and his mate&rsquo;s valuables.</p>
  <p>Then The Oracle stirred up Smith&rsquo;s recollections and departed.</p>
  <p>Smith was about again in a couple of weeks. He was damaged somewhat physically,
    but his memory was no longer impaired.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HisCountryAfterAll"></a>His Country&mdash;After All</b></h2>
  <p>The Blenheim coach was descending into the valley of the Avetere River&mdash;pronounced
    Aveterry&mdash;from the saddle of Taylor&rsquo;s Pass. Across the river to
    the right, the grey slopes and flats stretched away to the distant sea from
    a range of tussock hills. There was no native bush there; but there were
    several groves of imported timber standing wide apart&mdash;sentinel-like&mdash;seeming
    lonely and striking in their isolation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grand country, New Zealand, eh?&rdquo; said a stout man with a brown
    face, grey beard, and grey eyes, who sat between the driver and another passenger
    on the box.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call this grand country!&rdquo; exclaimed the other
    passenger, who claimed to be, and looked like, a commercial traveller, and
    might have been a professional spieler&mdash;quite possibly both. &ldquo;Why,
    it&rsquo;s about the poorest country in New Zealand! You ought to see some
    of the country in the North Island&mdash;Wairarapa and Napier districts,
    round about Pahiatua. I call this damn poor country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon you wouldn&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;d ever been in Australia&mdash;back
    in New South Wales. The people here don&rsquo;t seem to know what a grand
    country they&rsquo;ve got. You say this is the worst, eh? Well, this would
    make an Australian cockatoo&rsquo;s mouth water&mdash;the worst of New Zealand
    would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always thought Australia was all good country,&rdquo; mused the
    driver&mdash;a flax-stick. &ldquo;I always thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good country!&rdquo; exclaimed the man with the grey beard, in a
    tone of disgust. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only a mongrel desert, except some
    bits round the coast. The worst dried-up and God-forsaken country I was ever
    in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a silence, thoughtful on the driver&rsquo;s part, and aggressive
    on that of the stranger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always thought,&rdquo; said the driver, reflectively, after the
    pause&mdash;&ldquo;I always thought Australia was a good country,&rdquo; and
    he placed his foot on the brake.</p>
  <p>They let him think. The coach descended the natural terraces above the river
    bank, and pulled up at the pub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a native of Australia?&rdquo; said the bagman to
    the grey-beard, as the coach went on again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I am. Anyway, I was born there. That&rsquo;s the
    main thing I&rsquo;ve got against the darned country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long did you stay there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till I got away,&rdquo; said the stranger. Then, after a think, he
    added,  &ldquo;I went away first when I was thirty-five&mdash;went to the
    islands. I swore I&rsquo;d never go back to Australia again; but I did. I
    thought I had a kind of affection for old Sydney. I knocked about the blasted
    country for five or six years, and then I cleared out to &rsquo;Frisco. I
    swore I&rsquo;d never go back again, and I never will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;ll take a run over and have a look at old Sydney
    and those places, before you go back to America, after getting so near?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the blazes do I want to have a look at the blamed country for?&rdquo;  snapped
    the stranger, who had refreshed considerably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing
    to thank Australia for&mdash;except getting out of it. It&rsquo;s the best
    country to get out of that I was ever in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I only thought you might have had some friends over there,&rdquo;  interposed
    the traveller in an injured tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friends! That&rsquo;s another reason. I wouldn&rsquo;t go back there
    for all the friends and relations since Adam. I had more than quite enough
    of it while I was there. The worst and hardest years of my life were spent
    in Australia. I might have starved there, and did do it half my time. I worked
    harder and got less in my own country in five years than I ever did in any
    other in fifteen&rdquo;&mdash;he was getting mixed&mdash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
    been in a few since then. No, Australia is the worst country that ever the
    Lord had the sense to forget. I mean to stick to the country that stuck to
    me, when I was starved out of my own dear native land&mdash;and that country
    is the United States of America. What&rsquo;s Australia? A big, thirsty,
    hungry wilderness, with one or two cities for the convenience of foreign
    speculators, and a few collections of humpies, called towns&mdash;also for
    the convenience of foreign speculators; and populated mostly by mongrel sheep,
    and partly by fools, who live like European slaves in the towns, and like
    dingoes in the bush&mdash;who drivel about &lsquo;democracy,&rsquo; and yet
    haven&rsquo;t any more spunk than to graft for a few Cockney dudes that razzle-dazzle
    most of the time in Paris. Why, the Australians haven&rsquo;t even got the
    grit to claim enough of their own money to throw a few dams across their
    watercourses, and so make some of the interior fit to live in. America&rsquo;s
    bad enough, but it was never so small as that.... Bah! The curse of Australia
    is sheep, and the Australian war cry is Baa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the first man I ever heard talk as you&rsquo;ve
    been doing about his own country,&rdquo; said the bagman, getting tired and
    impatient of being sat on all the time. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lives there a man with
    a soul so dead, who never said&mdash;to&mdash;to himself&rsquo;... I forget
    the darned thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to remember it. The man whose soul was dead cleared his throat
    for action, and the driver&mdash;for whom the bagman had shouted twice as
    against the stranger&rsquo;s once&mdash;took the opportunity to observe that
    he always thought a man ought to stick up for his own country.</p>
  <p>The stranger ignored him and opened fire on the bagman. He proceeded to
    prove that that was all rot&mdash;that patriotism was the greatest curse
    on earth; that it had been the cause of all war; that it was the false, ignorant
    sentiment which moved men to slave, starve, and fight for the comfort of
    their sluggish masters; that it was the enemy of universal brotherhood, the
    mother of hatred, murder, and slavery, and that the world would never be
    any better until the deadly poison, called the sentiment of patriotism, had
    been &ldquo;educated&rdquo; out of the stomachs of the people.  &ldquo;Patriotism!&rdquo; he
    exclaimed scornfully. &ldquo;My country! The darned fools; the country never
    belonged to them, but to the speculators, the absentees, land-boomers, swindlers,
    gangs of thieves&mdash;the men the patriotic fools starve and fight for&mdash;their
    masters. Ba-a!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The opposition collapsed.</p>
  <p>The coach had climbed the terraces on the south side of the river, and was
    bowling along on a level stretch of road across the elevated flat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What trees are those?&rdquo; asked the stranger, breaking the aggressive
    silence which followed his unpatriotic argument, and pointing to a grove
    ahead by the roadside. &ldquo;They look as if they&rsquo;ve been planted
    there. There ain&rsquo;t been a forest here surely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re some trees the Government imported,&rdquo; said
    the bagman, whose knowledge on the subject was limited. &ldquo;Our own bush
    won&rsquo;t grow in this soil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it looks as if anything else would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the stranger sniffed once by accident, and then several times with
    interest.</p>
  <p>It was a warm morning after rain. He fixed his eyes on those trees.</p>
  <p>They didn&rsquo;t look like Australian gums; they tapered to the tops, the
    branches were pretty regular, and the boughs hung in shipshape fashion. There
    was not the Australian heat to twist the branches and turn the leaves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, still staring and sniffing hard. &ldquo;Why,
    dang me if they ain&rsquo;t (sniff) Australian gums!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the driver, flicking his horses, &ldquo;they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blanky (sniff) blanky old Australian gums!&rdquo; exclaimed the ex-Australian,
    with strange enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not old,&rdquo; said the driver; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
    only young trees. But they say they don&rsquo;t grow like that in Australia&mdash;&rsquo;count
    of the difference in the climate. I always thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the other did not appear to hear him; he kept staring hard at the trees
    they were passing. They had been planted in rows and cross-rows, and were
    coming on grandly.</p>
  <p>There was a rabbit trapper&rsquo;s camp amongst those trees; he had made
    a fire to boil his billy with gum-leaves and twigs, and it was the scent
    of that fire which interested the exile&rsquo;s nose, and brought a wave
    of memories with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly to the rabbit trapper,
    and to the astonishment of his fellow passengers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate!&rdquo; The answer came back like an echo&mdash;it
    seemed to him&mdash;from the past.</p>
  <p>Presently he caught sight of a few trees which had evidently been planted
    before the others&mdash;as an experiment, perhaps&mdash;and, somehow, one
    of them had grown after its own erratic native fashion&mdash;gnarled and
    twisted and ragged, and could not be mistaken for anything else but an Australian
    gum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A thunderin&rsquo; old blue-gum!&rdquo; ejaculated the traveller,
    regarding the tree with great interest.</p>
  <p>He screwed his neck to get a last glimpse, and then sat silently smoking
    and gazing straight ahead, as if the past lay before him&mdash;and it <i>was</i> before
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; he said, in explanation of a long meditative silence
    on his part; &ldquo;ah, well&mdash;them saplings&mdash;the smell of them
    gum-leaves set me thinking.&rdquo;  And he thought some more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said a tourist in the coach, presently,
    in a condescending tone, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see much in Australia. The
    bally colonies are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that be damned!&rdquo; snarled the Australian-born&mdash;they
    had finished the second flask of whisky. &ldquo;What do you Britishers know
    about Australia? She&rsquo;s as good as England, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;ll go straight back to the States as soon
    as you&rsquo;ve done your business in Christchurch,&rdquo; said the bagman,
    when near their journey&rsquo;s end they had become confidential.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno. I reckon I&rsquo;ll just take a run over to Australia
    first. There&rsquo;s an old mate of mine in business in Sydney, and I&rsquo;d
    like to have a yarn with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheUnionBuriesItsDead"></a>The Union Buries
      Its Dead</b></h2>
  <p>While out boating one Sunday afternoon on a billabong across the river,
    we saw a young man on horseback driving some horses along the bank. He said
    it was a fine day, and asked if the water was deep there. The joker of our
    party said it was deep enough to drown him, and he laughed and rode farther
    up. We didn&rsquo;t take-much notice of him.</p>
  <p>Next day a funeral gathered at a corner pub and asked each other in to have
    a drink while waiting for the hearse. They passed away some of the time dancing
    jigs to a piano in the bar parlour. They passed away the rest of the time
    skylarking and fighting.</p>
  <p>The defunct was a young Union labourer, about twenty-five, who had been
    drowned the previous day while trying to swim some horses across a billabong
    of the Darling.</p>
  <p>He was almost a stranger in town, and the fact of his having been a Union
    man accounted for the funeral. The police found some Union papers in his
    swag, and called at the General Labourers&rsquo; Union Office for information
    about him. That&rsquo;s how we knew. The secretary had very little information
    to give. The departed was a &ldquo;Roman,&rdquo; and the majority of the
    town were otherwise&mdash;but Unionism is stronger than creed. Liquor, however,
    is stronger than Unionism; and, when the hearse presently arrived, more than
    two-thirds of the funeral were unable to follow.</p>
  <p>The procession numbered fifteen, fourteen souls following the broken shell
    of a soul. Perhaps not one of the fourteen possessed a soul any more than
    the corpse did&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
  <p>Four or five of the funeral, who were boarders at the pub, borrowed a trap
    which the landlord used to carry passengers to and from the railway station.
    They were strangers to us who were on foot, and we to them. We were all strangers
    to the corpse.</p>
  <p>A horseman, who looked like a drover just returned from a big trip, dropped
    into our dusty wake and followed us a few hundred yards, dragging his packhorse
    behind him, but a friend made wild and demonstrative signals from a hotel
    veranda&mdash;hooking at the air in front with his right hand and jobbing
    his left thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the bar&mdash;so the
    drover hauled off and didn&rsquo;t catch up to us any more. He was a stranger
    to the entire show.</p>
  <p>We walked in twos. There were three twos. It was very hot and dusty; the
    heat rushed in fierce dazzling rays across every iron roof and light-coloured
    wall that was turned to the sun. One or two pubs closed respectfully until
    we got past. They closed their bar doors and the patrons went in and out
    through some side or back entrance for a few minutes. Bushmen seldom grumble
    at an inconvenience of this sort, when it is caused by a funeral. They have
    too much respect for the dead.</p>
  <p>On the way to the cemetery we passed three shearers sitting on the shady
    side of a fence. One was drunk&mdash;very drunk. The other two covered their
    right ears with their hats, out of respect for the departed&mdash;whoever
    he might have been&mdash;and one of them kicked the drunk and muttered something
    to him.</p>
  <p>He straightened himself up, stared, and reached helplessly for his hat,
    which he shoved half off and then on again. Then he made a great effort to
    pull himself together&mdash;and succeeded. He stood up, braced his back against
    the fence, knocked off his hat, and remorsefully placed his foot on it&mdash;to
    keep it off his head till the funeral passed.</p>
  <p>A tall, sentimental drover, who walked by my side, cynically quoted Byronic
    verses suitable to the occasion&mdash;to death&mdash;and asked with pathetic
    humour whether we thought the dead man&rsquo;s ticket would be recognized &ldquo;over
    yonder.&rdquo; It was a G.L.U. ticket, and the general opinion was that it
    would be recognized.</p>
  <p>Presently my friend said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember when we were in the boat yesterday, we saw a man driving
    some horses along the bank?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nodded at the hearse and said &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take any particular notice of him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He
    said something, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; said it was a fine day. You&rsquo;d have taken more notice if
    you&rsquo;d known that he was doomed to die in the hour, and that those were
    the last words he would say to any man in this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said a full voice from the rear. &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;d
    known that, ye&rsquo;d have prolonged the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We plodded on across the railway line and along the hot, dusty road which
    ran to the cemetery, some of us talking about the accident, and lying about
    the narrow escapes we had had ourselves. Presently someone said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked up and saw a priest standing in the shade of the tree by the cemetery
    gate.</p>
  <p>The hearse was drawn up and the tail-boards were opened. The funeral extinguished
    its right ear with its hat as four men lifted the coffin out and laid it
    over the grave. The priest&mdash;a pale, quiet young fellow&mdash;stood under
    the shade of a sapling which grew at the head of the grave. He took off his
    hat, dropped it carelessly on the ground, and proceeded to business. I noticed
    that one or two heathens winced slightly when the holy water was sprinkled
    on the coffin. The drops quickly evaporated, and the little round black spots
    they left were soon dusted over; but the spots showed, by contrast, the cheapness
    and shabbiness of the cloth with which the coffin was covered. It seemed
    black before; now it looked a dusky grey.</p>
  <p>Just here man&rsquo;s ignorance and vanity made a farce of the funeral.
    A big, bull-necked publican, with heavy, blotchy features, and a supremely
    ignorant expression, picked up the priest&rsquo;s straw hat and held it about
    two inches over the head of his reverence during the whole of the service.
    The father, be it remembered, was standing in the shade. A few shoved their
    hats on and off uneasily, struggling between their disgust for the living
    and their respect for the dead. The hat had a conical crown and a brim sloping
    down all round like a sunshade, and the publican held it with his great red
    claw spread over the crown. To do the priest justice, perhaps he didn&rsquo;t
    notice the incident. A stage priest or parson in the same position might
    have said, &ldquo;Put the hat down, my friend; is not the memory of our departed
    brother worth more than my complexion?&rdquo; A wattle-bark layman might
    have expressed himself in stronger language, none the less to the point.
    But my priest seemed unconscious of what was going on. Besides, the publican
    was a great and important pillar of the church. He couldn&rsquo;t, as an
    ignorant and conceited ass, lose such a good opportunity of asserting his
    faithfulness and importance to his church.</p>
  <p>The grave looked very narrow under the coffin, and I drew a breath of relief
    when the box slid easily down. I saw a coffin get stuck once, at Rookwood,
    and it had to be yanked out with difficulty, and laid on the sods at the
    feet of the heart-broken relations, who howled dismally while the grave-diggers
    widened the hole. But they don&rsquo;t cut contracts so fine in the West.
    Our grave-digger was not altogether bowelless, and, out of respect for that
    human quality described as  &ldquo;feelin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he scraped up some
    light and dusty soil and threw it down to deaden the fall of the clay lumps
    on the coffin. He also tried to steer the first few shovelfuls gently down
    against the end of the grave with the back of the shovel turned outwards,
    but the hard dry Darling River clods rebounded and knocked all the same.
    It didn&rsquo;t matter much&mdash;nothing does. The fall of lumps of clay
    on a stranger&rsquo;s coffin doesn&rsquo;t sound any different from the fall
    of the same things on an ordinary wooden box&mdash;at least I didn&rsquo;t
    notice anything awesome or unusual in the sound; but, perhaps, one of us&mdash;the
    most sensitive&mdash;might have been impressed by being reminded of a burial
    of long ago, when the thump of every sod jolted his heart.</p>
  <p>I have left out the wattle&mdash;because it wasn&rsquo;t there. I have also
    neglected to mention the heart-broken old mate, with his grizzled head bowed
    and great pearly drops streaming down his rugged cheeks. He was absent&mdash;he
    was probably &ldquo;Out Back.&rdquo;  For similar reasons I have omitted
    reference to the suspicious moisture in the eyes of a bearded bush ruffian
    named Bill. Bill failed to turn up, and the only moisture was that which
    was induced by the heat. I have left out the &ldquo;sad Australian sunset&rdquo;  because
    the sun was not going down at the time. The burial took place exactly at
    midday.</p>
  <p>The dead bushman&rsquo;s name was Jim, apparently; but they found no portraits,
    nor locks of hair, nor any love letters, nor anything of that kind in his
    swag&mdash;not even a reference to his mother; only some papers relating
    to Union matters. Most of us didn&rsquo;t know the name till we saw it on
    the coffin; we knew him as &ldquo;that poor chap that got drowned yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So his name&rsquo;s James Tyson,&rdquo; said my drover acquaintance,
    looking at the plate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! Didn&rsquo;t you know that before?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but I knew he was a Union man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It turned out, afterwards, that J.T. wasn&rsquo;t his real name&mdash;only &ldquo;the
    name he went by.&rdquo; Anyhow he was buried by it, and most of the &ldquo;Great
    Australian Dailies&rdquo; have mentioned in their brevity columns that a
    young man named James John Tyson was drowned in a billabong of the Darling
    last Sunday.</p>
  <p>We did hear, later on, what his real name was; but if we ever chance to
    read it in the &ldquo;Missing Friends Column,&rdquo; we shall not be able
    to give any information to heart-broken mother or sister or wife, nor to
    anyone who could let him hear something to his advantage&mdash;for we have
    already forgotten the name.</p>

      Doesn&rsquo;t Believe In The Sack</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;If ever I do get a job again,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    stick to it while there&rsquo;s a hand&rsquo;s turn of work to do, and put
    a few pounds together. I won&rsquo;t be the fool I always was. If I&rsquo;d
    had sense a couple of years ago, I wouldn&rsquo;t be tramping through this
    damned sand and mulga now. I&rsquo;ll get a job on a station, or at some
    toff&rsquo;s house, knocking about the stables and garden, and I&rsquo;ll
    make up my mind to settle down to graft for four or five years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But supposing you git the sack?&rdquo; said his mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it. Only for taking the sack I wouldn&rsquo;t
    be hard up to-day. The boss might come round and say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t want you after this week, Mitchell. I haven&rsquo;t
    got any more work for you to do. Come up and see me at the office presently.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll go up and get my money; but I&rsquo;ll be pottering
    round as usual on Monday, and come up to the kitchen for my breakfast. Some
    time in the day the boss&rsquo;ll be knocking round and see me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Mitchell,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;I thought you
    was gone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I was going,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say. &lsquo;Who
    told you that&mdash;or what made you think so?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought I told you on Saturday that I wouldn&rsquo;t want
    you any more,&rsquo;  he&rsquo;ll say, a bit short. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t
    got enough work to keep a man going; I told you that; I thought you understood. <i>Didn&rsquo;t
    I give you the sack on Saturday</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use;&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;that sort
    of thing&rsquo;s played out. I&rsquo;ve been had too often that way; I&rsquo;ve
    been sacked once too often. Taking the sack&rsquo;s been the cause of all
    my trouble; I don&rsquo;t believe in it. If I&rsquo;d never taken the sack
    I&rsquo;d have been a rich man to-day; it might be all very well for horses,
    but it doesn&rsquo;t suit me; it doesn&rsquo;t hurt you, but it hurts me.
    I made up my mind that when I got a place to suit me, I&rsquo;d stick in
    it. I&rsquo;m comfortable here and satisfied, and you&rsquo;ve had no cause
    to find fault with me. It&rsquo;s no use you trying to sack me, because I
    won&rsquo;t take it. I&rsquo;ve been there before, and you might as well
    try to catch an old bird with chaff.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t pay you, and you&rsquo;d better be off,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll
    say, trying not to grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind the money,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;the bit
    of tucker won&rsquo;t cost you anything, and I&rsquo;ll find something to
    do round the house till you have some more work. I won&rsquo;t ask you for
    anything, and, surely to God I&rsquo;ll find enough to do to pay for my grub!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll potter round and take things easy and call up at the
    kitchen as usual at meal times, and by and by the boss&rsquo;ll think to
    himself: &lsquo;Well, if I&rsquo;ve got to feed this chap I might as well
    get some work out of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;ll find me, something regular to do&mdash;a bit of fencing,
    or carpentering, or painting, or something, and then I&rsquo;ll begin to
    call up for my stuff again, as usual.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Golden Gully still, but golden in name only, unless indeed the yellow
    mullock heaps or the bloom of the wattle-trees on the hillside gave it a
    claim to the title. But the gold was gone from the gully, and the diggers
    were gone, too, after the manner of Timon&rsquo;s friends when his wealth
    deserted him. Golden Gully was a dreary place, dreary even for an abandoned
    goldfield. The poor, tortured earth, with its wounds all bare, seemed to
    make a mute appeal to the surrounding bush to come up and hide it, and, as
    if in answer to its appeal, the shrub and saplings were beginning to close
    in from the foot of the range. The wilderness was reclaiming its own again.</p>
  <p>The two dark, sullen hills that stood on each side were clothed from tip
    to hollow with dark scrub and scraggy box-trees; but above the highest row
    of shafts on one side ran a line of wattle-trees in full bloom.</p>
  <p>The top of the western hill was shaped somewhat like a saddle, and standing
    high above the eucalypti on the point corresponding with the pommel were
    three tall pines. These lonely trees, seen for many miles around, had caught
    the yellow rays of many a setting sun long before the white man wandered
    over the ranges.</p>
  <p>The predominant note of the scene was a painful sense of listening, that
    never seemed to lose its tension&mdash;a listening as though for the sounds
    of digger life, sounds that had gone and left a void that was accentuated
    by the signs of a former presence. The main army of diggers had long ago
    vanished to new rushes, leaving only its stragglers and deserters behind.
    These were men who were too poor to drag families about, men who were old
    and feeble, and men who had lost their faith in fortune. They had dropped
    unnoticed out of the ranks; and remained to scratch out a living among the
    abandoned claims.</p>
  <p>Golden Gully had its little community of fossickers who lived in a clearing
    called Spencer&rsquo;s Flat on one side and Pounding Flat on the other, but
    they lent no life to the scene; they only haunted it. A stranger might have
    thought the field entirely deserted until he came on a coat and a billy at
    the foot of saplings amongst the holes, and heard, in the shallow ground
    underneath, the thud of a pick, which told of some fossicker below rooting
    out what little wash remained.</p>
  <p>One afternoon towards Christmas, a windlass was erected over an old shaft
    of considerable depth at the foot of the gully. A greenhide bucket attached
    to a rope on the windlass was lying next morning near the mouth of the shaft,
    and beside it, on a clear-swept patch, was a little mound of cool wet wash-dirt.</p>
  <p>A clump of saplings near at hand threw a shade over part of the mullock
    heap, and in this shade, seated on an old coat, was a small boy of eleven
    or twelve years, writing on a slate.</p>
  <p>He had fair hair, blue eyes, and a thin old-fashioned face&mdash;a face
    that would scarcely alter as he grew to manhood. His costume consisted of
    a pair of moleskin trousers, a cotton shirt, and one suspender. He held the
    slate rigidly with a corner of its frame pressed close against his ribs,
    whilst his head hung to one side, so close to the slate that his straggling
    hair almost touched it. He was regarding his work fixedly out of the corners
    of his eyes, whilst he painfully copied down the head line, spelling it in
    a different way each time. In this laborious task he appeared to be greatly
    assisted by a tongue that lolled out of the corner of his mouth and made
    an occasional revolution round it, leaving a circle of temporarily clean
    face. His small clay-covered toes also entered into the spirit of the thing,
    and helped him not a little by their energetic wriggling. He paused occasionally
    to draw the back of his small brown arm across his mouth.</p>
  <p>Little Isley Mason, or, as he was called, &ldquo;His Father&rsquo;s Mate,&rdquo; had
    always been a favourite with the diggers and fossickers from the days when
    he used to slip out first thing in the morning and take a run across the
    frosty flat in his shirt. Long Bob Sawkins would often tell how Isley came
    home one morning from his run in the long, wet grass as naked as he was born,
    with the information that he had lost his shirt.</p>
  <p>Later on, when most of the diggers had gone, and Isley&rsquo;s mother was
    dead, he was to be seen about the place with bare, sunbrowned arms and legs,
    a pick and shovel, and a gold dish about two-thirds of his height in diameter,
    with which he used to go &ldquo;a-speckin&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;fossickin&rsquo;&rdquo; amongst
    the old mullock heaps. Long Bob was Isley&rsquo;s special crony, and he would
    often go out of his way to lay the boy outer bits o&rsquo; wash and likely
    spots, lamely excusing his long yarns with the child by the explanation that
    it was &ldquo;amusin&rsquo; to draw Isley out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley had been sitting writing for some time when a deep voice called out
    from below:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send down the bucket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley put down his slate, and going to the shaft dropped the bucket down
    as far as the slack rope reached; then, placing one hand on the bole of the
    windlass and holding the other against it underneath, he let it slip round
    between his palms until the bucket reached bottom. A sound of shovelling
    was heard for a few moments, and presently the voice cried, &ldquo;Wind away,
    sonny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet ain&rsquo;t half enough,&rdquo; said the boy, peering down. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    be frightened to pile it in, father. I kin wind up a lot more&rsquo;n thet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A little more scraping, and the boy braced his feet well upon the little
    mound of clay which he had raised under the handle of the windlass to make
    up for his deficiency in stature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley wound slowly but sturdily, and soon the bucket of &ldquo;wash&rdquo; appeared
    above the surface; then he took it in short lifts and deposited it with the
    rest of the wash-dirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo; called his father again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you done that writing lesson yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very near.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then send down the slate next time for some sums.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy resumed his seat, fixed the corner of the slate well into his ribs,
    humped his back, and commenced another wavering line.</p>
  <p>Tom Mason was known on the place as a silent, hard worker. He was a man
    of about sixty, tall, and dark bearded. There was nothing uncommon about
    his face, except, perhaps, that it hardened, as the face of a man might harden
    who had suffered a long succession of griefs and disappointments. He lived
    in a little hut under a peppermint tree at the far edge of Pounding Flat.
    His wife had died there about six years before, and new rushes broke out
    and he was well able to go, he never left Golden Gully.</p>
  <p>Mason was kneeling in front of the &ldquo;face&rdquo; digging away by the
    light of a tallow candle stuck in the side. The floor of the drive was very
    wet, and his trousers were heavy and cold with clay and water; but the old
    digger was used to this sort of thing. His pick was not bringing out much
    to-day, however, for he seemed abstracted and would occasionally pause in
    his work, while his thoughts wandered far away from the narrow streak of
    wash-dirt in the &ldquo;face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was digging out pictures from a past life. They were not pleasant ones,
    for his face was stony and white in the dim glow of the candle.</p>
  <p>Thud, thud, thud&mdash;the blows became slower and more irregular as the
    fossicker&rsquo;s mind wandered off into the past. The sides of the drive
    seemed to vanish slowly away, and the &ldquo;face&rdquo; retreated far out
    beyond a horizon that was hazy in the glow of the southern ocean. He was
    standing on the deck of a ship and by his side stood a brother. They were
    sailing southward to the Land of Promise that was shining there in all its
    golden glory! The sails pressed forward in the bracing wind, and the clipper
    ship raced along with its burden of the wildest dreamers ever borne in a
    vessel&rsquo;s hull! Up over long blue ocean ridges, down into long blue
    ocean gullies; on to lands so new, and yet so old, where above the sunny
    glow of the southern skies blazed the shining names of Ballarat! and Bendigo!
    The deck seemed to lurch, and the fossicker fell forward against the face
    of the drive. The shock recalled him, and he lifted his pick once more.</p>
  <p>But the blows slacken again as another vision rises before him. It is Ballarat
    now. He is working in a shallow claim at Eureka, his brother by his side.
    The brother looks pale and ill, for he has been up all night dancing and
    drinking. Out behind them is the line of blue hills; in front is the famous
    Bakery Hill, and down to the left Golden Point. Two mounted troopers are
    riding up over Specimen Hill. What do they want?</p>
  <p>They take the brother away, handcuffed. Manslaughter last night. Cause&mdash;drink
    and jealousy.</p>
  <p>The vision is gone again. Thud, thud, goes the pick; it counts the years
    that follow&mdash;one, two, three, four, up to twenty, and then it stops
    for the next scene&mdash;a selection on the banks of a bright river in New
    South Wales. The little homestead is surrounded by vines and fruit-trees.
    Many swarms of bees work under the shade of the trees, and a crop of wheat
    is nearly ripe on the hillside.</p>
  <p>A man and a boy are engaged in clearing a paddock just below the homestead.
    They are father and son; the son, a boy of about seventeen, is the image
    of his father.</p>
  <p>Horses&rsquo; feet again! Here comes Nemesis in mounted troopers&rsquo; uniform.</p>
  <p>The mail was stuck up last night about five miles away, and a refractory
    passenger shot. The son had been out &rsquo;possum shooting&rsquo; all night
    with some friends.</p>
  <p>The troopers take the son away handcuffed: &ldquo;Robbery under arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The father was taking out a stump when the troopers came. His foot is still
    resting on the spade, which is half driven home. He watches the troopers
    take the boy up to the house, and then, driving the spade to its full depth,
    he turns up another sod. The troopers reach the door of the homestead; but
    still he digs steadily, and does not seem to hear his wife&rsquo;s cry of
    despair. The troopers search the boy&rsquo;s room and bring out some clothing
    in two bundles; but still the father digs. They have saddled up one of the
    farm horses and made the boy mount. The father digs. They ride off along
    the ridge with the boy between them. The father never lifts his eyes; the
    hole widens round the stump; he digs away till the brave little wife comes
    and takes him gently by the arm. He half rouses himself and follows her to
    the house like an obedient dog.</p>
  <p>Trial and disgrace follow, and then other misfortunes, pleuro among the
    cattle, drought, and poverty.</p>
  <p>Thud, thud, thud again! But it is not the sound of the fossicker&rsquo;s
    pick&mdash;it is the fall of sods on his wife&rsquo;s coffin.</p>
  <p>It is a little bush cemetery, and he stands stonily watching them fill up
    her grave. She died of a broken heart and shame. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
    disgrace! I can&rsquo;t bear disgrace!&rdquo; she had moaned all these six
    weary years&mdash;for the poor are often proud.</p>
  <p>But he lives on, for it takes a lot to break a man&rsquo;s heart. He holds
    up his head and toils on for the sake of a child that is left, and that child
    is&mdash;Isley.</p>
  <p>And now the fossicker seems to see a vision of the future. He seems to be
    standing somewhere, an old, old man, with a younger one at his side; the
    younger one has Isley&rsquo;s face. Horses&rsquo; feet again! Ah, God! Nemesis
    once more in troopers&rsquo;  uniform!</p>
  <p>The fossicker falls on his knees in the mud and clay at the bottom of the
    drive, and prays Heaven to take his last child ere Nemesis comes for him.</p>
  <p>Long Bob Sawkins had been known on the diggings as &ldquo;Bob the Devil.&rdquo;  His
    profile at least from one side, certainly did recall that of the sarcastic
    Mephistopheles; but the other side, like his true character, was by no means
    a devil&rsquo;s. His physiognomy had been much damaged, and one eye removed
    by the premature explosion of a blast in some old Ballarat mine. The blind
    eye was covered with a green patch, which gave a sardonic appearance to the
    remaining features.</p>
  <p>He was a stupid, heavy, good-natured Englishman. He stuttered a little,
    and had a peculiar habit of wedging the monosyllable &ldquo;why&rdquo; into
    his conversation at times when it served no other purpose than to fill up
    the pauses caused by his stuttering; but this by no means assisted him in
    his speech, for he often stuttered over the &ldquo;why&rdquo; itself.</p>
  <p>The sun was getting low down, and its yellow rays reached far up among the
    saplings of Golden Gully when Bob appeared coming down by the path that ran
    under the western hill. He was dressed in the usual costume-cotton shirt,
    moleskin trousers, faded hat and waistcoat, and blucher boots. He carried
    a pick over his shoulder, the handle of which was run through the heft of
    a short shovel that hung down behind, and he had a big dish under his arm.
    He paused opposite the shaft with the windlass, and hailed the boy in his
    usual form of salutation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look, see here Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Bob?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I seed a young&mdash;why&mdash;magpie up in the scrub, and yer oughter
    be able to catch it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t leave the shaft; father&rsquo;s b&rsquo;low.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did yer father know there was any&mdash;why&mdash;wash in the
    old shaft?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seed old Corney in town Saturday, &rsquo;n he said thur was enough
    to make it worth while bailin&rsquo; out. Bin bailin&rsquo; all the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob came over, and letting his tools down with a clatter he hitched up the
    knees of his moleskins and sat down on one heel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are yer&mdash;why&mdash;doin&rsquo; on the slate, Isley?&rdquo; said
    he, taking out an old clay pipe and lighting it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sums,&rdquo; said Isley.</p>
  <p>Bob puffed away at his pipe a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use!&rdquo; he said, sitting down on the clay
    and drawing his knees up. &ldquo;Edication&rsquo;s a failyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen at &rsquo;im!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy. &ldquo;D&rsquo;yer
    mean ter say it ain&rsquo;t no use learnin&rsquo; readin&rsquo; and writin&rsquo; and
    sums?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy went to the windlass and let the bucket down. Bob offered to help
    him wind up, but Isley, proud of showing his strength to his friend, insisted
    on winding by himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be&mdash;why&mdash;a strong man some day, Isley,&rdquo; said
    Bob, landing the bucket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I could wind up a lot more&rsquo;n father puts in. Look how I
    greased the handles! It works like butter now,&rdquo; and the boy sent the
    handles spinning round with a jerk to illustrate his meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did they call yer Isley for?&rdquo; queried Bob, as they resumed
    their seats. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t yer real name, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my name&rsquo;s Harry. A digger useter say I was a isle in the
    ocean to father &rsquo;n mother, &rsquo;n then I was nicknamed Isle, &rsquo;n
    then Isley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hed a&mdash;why&mdash;brother once, didn&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but thet was afore I was borned. He died, at least mother used
    ter say she didn&rsquo;t know if he was dead; but father says he&rsquo;s
    dead as fur&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your father hed a brother, too. Did yer ever&mdash;why&mdash;hear
    of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard father talkin&rsquo; about it wonst to mother. I think
    father&rsquo;s brother got into some row in a bar where a man was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And was yer&mdash;why&mdash;father&mdash;why&mdash;fond of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard father say that he was wonst, but thet was all past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob smoked in silence for a while, and seemed to look at some dark clouds
    that were drifting along like a funeral out in the west. Presently he said
    half aloud something that sounded like &ldquo;All, all&mdash;why&mdash;past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Isley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s&mdash;why, why&mdash;nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered
    Bob, rousing himself. &ldquo;Is that a paper in yer father&rsquo;s coat-pocket,
    Isley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, taking it out.</p>
  <p>Bob took the paper and stared hard at it for a moment or so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about the new goldfields there,&rdquo; said
    Bob, putting his finger on a tailor&rsquo;s advertisement. &ldquo;I wish
    you&rsquo;d&mdash;why&mdash;read it to me, Isley; I can&rsquo;t see the small
    print they uses nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thet&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; said the boy, taking the paper, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    something about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Old on, Bob, father wants me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy ran to the shaft, rested his hands and forehead against the bole
    of the windlass, and leant over to hear what his father was saying.</p>
  <p>Without a moment&rsquo;s warning the treacherous bole slipped round; a small
    body bounded a couple of times against the sides of the shaft and fell at
    Mason&rsquo;s feet, where it lay motionless!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mason!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put him in the bucket and lash him to the rope with your belt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few moments, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob&rsquo;s trembling hands would scarcely grasp the handle, but he managed
    to wind somehow.</p>
  <p>Presently the form of the child appeared, motionless and covered with clay
    and water. Mason was climbing up by the steps in the side of the shaft.</p>
  <p>Bob tenderly unlashed the boy and laid him under the saplings on the grass;
    then he wiped some of the clay and blood away from the child&rsquo;s forehead,
    and dashed over him some muddy water.</p>
  <p>Presently Isley gave a gasp and opened his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are yer&mdash;why&mdash;hurt much, Isley?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ba-back&rsquo;s bruk, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so bad as that, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence awhile, and then&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! father! be quick, father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mason reached the surface and came and knelt by the other side of the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;why&mdash;run fur some brandy,&rdquo; said
    Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No use, Bob,&rdquo; said Isley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all bruk up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer feel better, sonny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;goin&rsquo; to&mdash;die, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Isley,&rdquo; groaned Bob.</p>
  <p>A short silence, and then the boy&rsquo;s body suddenly twisted with pain.
    But it was soon over. He lay still awhile, and then said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob made a vain attempt to speak. &ldquo;Isley!&rdquo; he said,&rdquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The child turned and stretched out his hands to the silent, stony-faced
    man on the other side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;father, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shuddering groan broke from Mason&rsquo;s lips, and then all was quiet.</p>
  <p>Bob had taken off his hat to wipe his, forehead, and his face, in spite
    of its disfigurement, was strangely like the face of the stone-like man opposite.</p>
  <p>For a moment they looked at one another across the body of the child, and
    then Bob said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never knowed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; said Mason gruffly; and, taking up the
    dead child, he walked towards the hut.</p>
  <p>It was a very sad little group that gathered outside Mason&rsquo;s hut next
    morning. Martin&rsquo;s wife had been there all the morning cleaning up and
    doing what she could. One of the women had torn up her husband&rsquo;s only
    white shirt for a shroud, and they had made the little body look clean and
    even beautiful in the wretched little hut.</p>
  <p>One after another the fossickers took off their hats and entered, stooping
    through the low door. Mason sat silently at the foot of the bunk with his
    head supported by his hand, and watched the men with a strange, abstracted
    air.</p>
  <p>Bob had ransacked the camp in search of some boards for a coffin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be the last I&rsquo;ll be able to&mdash;why&mdash;do for
    him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>At last he came to Mrs Martin in despair. That lady took him into the dining-room,
    and pointed to a large pine table, of which she was very proud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Knock that table to pieces,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Taking off the few things that were lying on it, Bob turned it over and
    began to knock the top off.</p>
  <p>When he had finished the coffin one of the fossicker&rsquo;s wives said
    it looked too bare, and she ripped up her black riding-skirt, and made Bob
    tack the cloth over the coffin.</p>
  <p>There was only one vehicle available in the place, and that was Martin&rsquo;s
    old dray; so about two o&rsquo;clock Pat Martin attached his old horse Dublin
    to the shafts with sundry bits of harness and plenty of old rope, and dragged
    Dublin, dray and all, across to Mason&rsquo;s hut.</p>
  <p>The little coffin was carried out, and two gin-cases were placed by its
    side in the dray to serve as seats for Mrs Martin and Mrs Grimshaw, who mounted
    in tearful silence.</p>
  <p>Pat Martin felt for his pipe, but remembered himself and mounted on the
    shaft. Mason fastened up the door of the hut with a padlock. A couple of
    blows on one of his sharp points roused Dublin from his reverie. With a lurch
    to the right and another to the left he started, and presently the little
    funeral disappeared down the road that led to the &ldquo;town&rdquo; and
    its cemetery.</p>
  <p>About six months afterwards Bob Sawkins went on a short journey, and returned
    with a tall, bearded young man. He and Bob arrived after dark, and went straight
    to Mason&rsquo;s hut. There was a light inside, but when Bob knocked there
    was no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go in; don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said to his companion.</p>
  <p>The stranger pushed open the creaking door, and stood bareheaded just inside
    the doorway.</p>
  <p>A billy was boiling unheeded on the fire. Mason sat at the table with his
    face buried in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer, but the flickering of the firelight made the stranger
    think he could detect an impatient shrug in Mason&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
  <p>For a moment the stranger paused irresolute, and then stepping up to the
    table he laid his hand on Mason&rsquo;s arm, and said gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! Do you want another mate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the sleeper did not&mdash;at least, not in this world.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDroversWife"></a>The Drover&rsquo;s Wife</b></h2>
  <p>The two-roomed house is built of round timber, slabs, and stringy-bark,
    and floored with split slabs. A big bark kitchen standing at one end is larger
    than the house itself, veranda included.</p>
  <p>Bush all round&mdash;bush with no horizon, for the country is flat. No ranges
    in the distance. The bush consists of stunted, rotten native apple-trees.
    No undergrowth. Nothing to relieve the eye save the darker green of a few
    she-oaks which are sighing above the narrow, almost waterless creek. Nineteen
    miles to the nearest sign of civilization&mdash;a shanty on the main road.</p>
  <p>The drover, an ex-squatter, is away with sheep. His wife and children are
    left here alone.</p>
  <p>Four ragged, dried-up-looking children are playing about the house. Suddenly
    one of them yells: &ldquo;Snake! Mother, here&rsquo;s a snake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The gaunt, sun-browned bushwoman dashes from the kitchen, snatches her baby
    from the ground, holds it on her left hip, and reaches for a stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! gone into the wood-heap!&rdquo; yells the eldest boy&mdash;a
    sharp-faced urchin of eleven. &ldquo;Stop there, mother! I&rsquo;ll have
    him. Stand back! I&rsquo;ll have the beggar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tommy, come here, or you&rsquo;ll be bit. Come here at once when
    I tell you, you little wretch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The youngster comes reluctantly, carrying a stick bigger than himself. Then
    he yells, triumphantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There it goes&mdash;under the house!&rdquo; and darts away with club
    uplifted. At the same time the big, black, yellow-eyed dog-of-all-breeds,
    who has shown the wildest interest in the proceedings, breaks his chain and
    rushes after that snake. He is a moment late, however, and his nose reaches
    the crack in the slabs just as the end of its tail disappears. Almost at
    the same moment the boy&rsquo;s club comes down and skins the aforesaid nose.
    Alligator takes small notice of this, and proceeds to undermine the building;
    but he is subdued after a struggle and chained up. They cannot afford to
    lose him.</p>
  <p>The drover&rsquo;s wife makes the children stand together near the dog-house
    while she watches for the snake. She gets two small dishes of milk and sets
    them down near the wall to tempt it to come out; but an hour goes by and
    it does not show itself.</p>
  <p>It is near sunset, and a thunderstorm is coming. The children must be brought
    inside. She will not take them into the house, for she knows the snake is
    there, and may at any moment come up through a crack in the rough slab floor;
    so she carries several armfuls of firewood into the kitchen, and then takes
    the children there. The kitchen has no floor&mdash;or, rather, an earthen
    one&mdash;called a &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo; in this part of the bush. There
    is a large, roughly-made table in the centre of the place. She brings the
    children in, and makes them get on this table. They are two boys and two
    girls&mdash;mere babies. She gives them some supper, and then, before it
    gets dark, she goes into the house, and snatches up some pillows and bedclothes&mdash;expecting
    to see or lay her hand on the snake any minute. She makes a bed on the kitchen
    table for the children, and sits down beside it to watch all night.</p>
  <p>She has an eye on the corner, and a green sapling club laid in readiness
    on the dresser by her side; also her sewing basket and a copy of the <i>Young
    Ladies&rsquo;  Journal</i>. She has brought the dog into the room.</p>
  <p>Tommy turns in, under protest, but says he&rsquo;ll lie awake all night
    and smash that blinded snake.</p>
  <p>His mother asks him how many times she has told him not to swear.</p>
  <p>He has his club with him under the bedclothes, and Jacky protests:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mummy! Tommy&rsquo;s skinnin&rsquo; me alive wif his club. Make him
    take it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tommy: &ldquo;Shet up, you little&mdash;! D&rsquo;yer want to be bit with
    the snake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jacky shuts up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If yer bit,&rdquo; says Tommy, after a pause, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
    swell up, an&rsquo; smell, an&rsquo; turn red an&rsquo; green an&rsquo; blue
    all over till yer bust. Won&rsquo;t he, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, don&rsquo;t frighten the child. Go to sleep,&rdquo; she
    says.</p>
  <p>The two younger children go to sleep, and now and then Jacky complains of
    being &ldquo;skeezed.&rdquo; More room is made for him. Presently Tommy says: &ldquo;Mother!
    listen to them (adjective) little &rsquo;possums. I&rsquo;d like to screw
    their blanky necks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Jacky protests drowsily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t hurt us, the little blanks!&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Mother: &ldquo;There, I told you you&rsquo;d teach Jacky to swear.&rdquo; But
    the remark makes her smile. Jacky goes to sleep. Presently Tommy asks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother! Do you think they&rsquo;ll ever extricate the (adjective)
    kangaroo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord! How am I to know, child? Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you wake me if the snake comes out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Near midnight. The children are all asleep and she sits there still, sewing
    and reading by turns. From time to time she glances round the floor and wall-plate,
    and, whenever she hears a noise, she reaches for the stick. The thunderstorm
    comes on, and the wind, rushing through the cracks in the slab wall, threatens
    to blow out her candle. She places it on a sheltered part of the dresser
    and fixes up a newspaper to protect it. At every flash of lightning, the
    cracks between the slabs gleam like polished silver. The thunder rolls, and
    the rain comes down in torrents.</p>
  <p>Alligator lies at full length on the floor, with his eyes turned towards
    the partition. She knows by this that the snake is there. There are large
    cracks in that wall opening under the floor of the dwelling-house.</p>
  <p>She is not a coward, but recent events have shaken her nerves. A little
    son of her brother-in-law was lately bitten by a snake, and died. Besides,
    she has not heard from her husband for six months, and is anxious about him.</p>
  <p>He was a drover, and started squatting here when they were married. The
    drought of 18&mdash; ruined him. He had to sacrifice the remnant of his flock
    and go droving again. He intends to move his family into the nearest town
    when he comes back, and, in the meantime, his brother, who keeps a shanty
    on the main road, comes over about once a month with provisions. The wife
    has still a couple of cows, one horse, and a few sheep. The brother-in-law
    kills one of the latter occasionally, gives her what she needs of it, and
    takes the rest in return for other provisions. She is used to being left
    alone. She once lived like this for eighteen months. As a girl she built
    the usual castles in the air; but all her girlish hopes and aspirations have
    long been dead. She finds all the excitement and recreation she needs in
    the <i>Young Ladies&rsquo; Journal</i>, and Heaven help her! takes a pleasure
    in the fashion-plates.</p>
  <p>Her husband is an Australian, and so is she. He is careless, but a good
    enough husband. If he had the means he would take her to the city and keep
    her there like a princess. They are used to being apart, or at least she
    is. &ldquo;No use fretting,&rdquo; she says. He may forget sometimes that
    he is married; but if he has a good cheque when he comes back he will give
    most of it to her. When he had money he took her to the city several times&mdash;hired
    a railway sleeping compartment, and put up at the best hotels. He also bought
    her a buggy, but they had to sacrifice that along with the rest.</p>
  <p>The last two children were born in the bush&mdash;one while her husband
    was bringing a drunken doctor, by force, to attend to her. She was alone
    on this occasion, and very weak. She had been ill with a fever. She prayed
    to God to send her assistance. God sent Black Mary&mdash;the &ldquo;whitest&rdquo; gin
    in all the land. Or, at least, God sent King Jimmy first, and he sent Black
    Mary. He put his black face round the door post, took in the situation at
    a glance, and said cheerfully: &ldquo;All right, missus&mdash;I bring my
    old woman, she down alonga creek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of the children died while she was here alone. She rode nineteen miles
    for assistance, carrying the dead child.</p>
  <p>It must be near one or two o&rsquo;clock. The fire is burning low. Alligator
    lies with his head resting on his paws, and watches the wall. He is not a
    very beautiful dog, and the light shows numerous old wounds where the hair
    will not grow. He is afraid of nothing on the face of the earth or under
    it. He will tackle a bullock as readily as he will tackle a flea. He hates
    all other dogs&mdash;except kangaroo-dogs&mdash;and has a marked dislike
    to friends or relations of the family. They seldom call, however. He sometimes
    makes friends with strangers. He hates snakes and has killed many, but he
    will be bitten some day and die; most snake-dogs end that way.</p>
  <p>Now and then the bushwoman lays down her work and watches, and listens,
    and thinks. She thinks of things in her own life, for there is little else
    to think about.</p>
  <p>The rain will make the grass grow, and this reminds her how she fought a
    bush-fire once while her husband was away. The grass was long, and very dry,
    and the fire threatened to burn her out. She put on an old pair of her husband&rsquo;s
    trousers and beat out the flames with a green bough, till great drops of
    sooty perspiration stood out on her forehead and ran in streaks down her
    blackened arms. The sight of his mother in trousers greatly amused Tommy,
    who worked like a little hero by her side, but the terrified baby howled
    lustily for his &ldquo;mummy.&rdquo; The fire would have mastered her but
    for four excited bushmen who arrived in the nick of time. It was a mixed-up
    affair all round; when she went to take up the baby he screamed and struggled
    convulsively, thinking it was a &ldquo;blackman;&rdquo; and Alligator, trusting
    more to the child&rsquo;s sense than his own instinct, charged furiously,
    and (being old and slightly deaf) did not in his excitement at first recognize
    his mistress&rsquo;s voice, but continued to hang on to the moleskins until
    choked off by Tommy with a saddle-strap. The dog&rsquo;s sorrow for his blunder,
    and his anxiety to let it be known that it was all a mistake, was as evident
    as his ragged tail and a twelve-inch grin could make it. It was a glorious
    time for the boys; a day to look back to, and talk about, and laugh over
    for many years.</p>
  <p>She thinks how she fought a flood during her husband&rsquo;s absence. She
    stood for hours in the drenching downpour, and dug an overflow gutter to
    save the dam across the creek. But she could not save it. There are things
    that a bushwoman can not do. Next morning the dam was broken, and her heart
    was nearly broken too, for she thought how her husband would feel when he
    came home and saw the result of years of labour swept away. She cried then.</p>
  <p>She also fought the pleuro-pneumonia&mdash;dosed and bled the few remaining
    cattle, and wept again when her two best cows died.</p>
  <p>Again, she fought a mad bullock that besieged the house for a day. She made
    bullets and fired at him through cracks in the slabs with an old shot-gun.
    He was dead in the morning. She skinned him and got seventeen-and-sixpence
    for the hide.</p>
  <p>She also fights the crows and eagles that have designs on her chickens.
    Her plan of campaign is very original. The children cry &ldquo;Crows, mother!&rdquo; and
    she rushes out and aims a broomstick at the birds as though it were a gun,
    and says  &ldquo;Bung!&rdquo; The crows leave in a hurry; they are cunning,
    but a woman&rsquo;s cunning is greater.</p>
  <p>Occasionally a bushman in the horrors, or a villainous-looking sundowner,
    comes and nearly scares the life out of her. She generally tells the suspicious-looking
    stranger that her husband and two sons are at work below the dam, or over
    at the yard, for he always cunningly inquires for the boss.</p>
  <p>Only last week a gallows-faced swagman&mdash;having satisfied himself that
    there were no men on the place&mdash;threw his swag down on the veranda,
    and demanded tucker. She gave him something to eat; then he expressed his
    intention of staying for the night. It was sundown then. She got a batten
    from the sofa, loosened the dog, and confronted the stranger, holding the
    batten in one hand and the dog&rsquo;s collar with the other. &ldquo;Now
    you go!&rdquo; she said. He looked at her and at the dog, said &ldquo;All
    right, mum,&rdquo; in a cringing tone, and left. She was a determined-looking
    woman, and Alligator&rsquo;s yellow eyes glared unpleasantly&mdash;besides,
    the dog&rsquo;s chawing-up apparatus greatly resembled that of the reptile
    he was named after.</p>
  <p>She has few pleasures to think of as she sits here alone by the fire, on
    guard against a snake. All days are much the same to her; but on Sunday afternoon
    she dresses herself, tidies the children, smartens up baby, and goes for
    a lonely walk along the bush-track, pushing an old perambulator in front
    of her. She does this every Sunday. She takes as much care to make herself
    and the children look smart as she would if she were going to do the block
    in the city. There is nothing to see, however, and not a soul to meet. You
    might walk for twenty miles along this track without being able to fix a
    point in your mind, unless you are a bushman. This is because of the everlasting,
    maddening sameness of the stunted trees&mdash;that monotony which makes a
    man long to break away and travel as far as trains can go, and sail as far
    as ship can sail&mdash;and farther.</p>
  <p>But this bushwoman is used to the loneliness of it. As a girl-wife she hated
    it, but now she would feel strange away from it.</p>
  <p>She is glad when her husband returns, but she does not gush or make a fuss
    about it. She gets him something good to eat, and tidies up the children.</p>
  <p>She seems contented with her lot. She loves her children, but has no time
    to show it. She seems harsh to them. Her surroundings are not favourable
    to the development of the &ldquo;womanly&rdquo; or sentimental side of nature.</p>
  <p>It must be near morning now; but the clock is in the dwellinghouse. Her
    candle is nearly done; she forgot that she was out of candles. Some more
    wood must be got to keep the fire up, and so she shuts the dog inside and
    hurries round to the woodheap. The rain has cleared off. She seizes a stick,
    pulls it out, and&mdash;crash! the whole pile collapses.</p>
  <p>Yesterday she bargained with a stray blackfellow to bring her some wood,
    and while he was at work she went in search of a missing cow. She was absent
    an hour or so, and the native black made good use of his time. On her return
    she was so astonished to see a good heap of wood by the chimney, that she
    gave him an extra fig of tobacco, and praised him for not being lazy. He
    thanked her, and left with head erect and chest well out. He was the last
    of his tribe and a King; but he had built that wood-heap hollow.</p>
  <p>She is hurt now, and tears spring to her eyes as she sits down again by
    the table. She takes up a handkerchief to wipe the tears away, but pokes
    her eyes with her bare fingers instead. The handkerchief is full of holes,
    and she finds that she has put her thumb through one, and her forefinger
    through another.</p>
  <p>This makes her laugh, to the surprise of the dog. She has a keen, very keen,
    sense of the ridiculous; and some time or other she will amuse bushmen with
    the story.</p>
  <p>She had been amused before like that. One day she sat down &ldquo;to have
    a good cry,&rdquo; as she said&mdash;and the old cat rubbed against her dress
    and &ldquo;cried too.&rdquo;  Then she had to laugh.</p>
  <p>It must be near daylight now. The room is very close and hot because of
    the fire. Alligator still watches the wall from time to time. Suddenly he
    becomes greatly interested; he draws himself a few inches nearer the partition,
    and a thrill runs through his body. The hair on the back of his neck begins
    to bristle, and the battle-light is in his yellow eyes. She knows what this
    means, and lays her hand on the stick. The lower end of one of the partition
    slabs has a large crack on both sides. An evil pair of small, bright bead-like
    eyes glisten at one of these holes. The snake&mdash;a black one&mdash;comes
    slowly out, about a foot, and moves its head up and down. The dog lies still,
    and the woman sits as one fascinated. The snake comes out a foot farther.
    She lifts her stick, and the reptile, as though suddenly aware of danger,
    sticks his head in through the crack on the other side of the slab, and hurries
    to get his tail round after him. Alligator springs, and his jaws come together
    with a snap. He misses, for his nose is large, and the snake&rsquo;s body
    close down in the angle formed by the slabs and the floor. He snaps again
    as the tail comes round. He has the snake now, and tugs it out eighteen inches.
    Thud, thud comes the woman&rsquo;s club on the ground. Alligator pulls again.
    Thud, thud. Alligator gives another pull and he has the snake out&mdash;a
    black brute, five feet long. The head rises to dart about, but the dog has
    the enemy close to the neck. He is a big, heavy dog, but quick as a terrier.
    He shakes the snake as though he felt the original curse in common with mankind.
    The eldest boy wakes up, seizes his stick, and tries to get out of bed, but
    his mother forces him back with a grip of iron. Thud, thud&mdash;the snake&rsquo;s
    back is broken in several places. Thud, thud&mdash;its head is crushed, and
    Alligator&rsquo;s nose skinned again.</p>
  <p>She lifts the mangled reptile on the point of her stick, carries it to the
    fire, and throws it in; then piles on the wood and watches the snake burn.
    The boy and dog watch too. She lays her hand on the dog&rsquo;s head, and
    all the fierce, angry light dies out of his yellow eyes. The younger children
    are quieted, and presently go to sleep. The dirty-legged boy stands for a
    moment in his shirt, watching the fire. Presently he looks up at her, sees
    the tears in her eyes, and, throwing his arms round her neck exclaims:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother, I won&rsquo;t never go drovin&rsquo;; blarst me if I do!&rdquo; And
    she hugs him to her worn-out breast and kisses him; and they sit thus together
    while the sickly daylight breaks over the bush.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man shaded his eyes and peered through the dazzling glow of that
    broiling Christmas Day. He stood just within the door of a slab-and-bark
    hut situated upon the bank of a barren creek; sheep-yards lay to the right,
    and a low line of bare, brown ridges formed a suitable background to the
    scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five Bob!&rdquo; shouted he again; and a dusty sheep-dog rose wearily
    from the shaded side of the hut and looked inquiringly at his master, who
    pointed towards some sheep which were straggling from the flock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fetch &rsquo;em back,&rdquo; he said confidently.</p>
  <p>The dog went off, and his master returned to the interior of the hut.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em early,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;the
    super won&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em early, and have the arternoon
    to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get dinner,&rdquo; he added, glancing at some pots on
    the fire. &ldquo;I cud do a bit of doughboy, an&rsquo; that theer boggabri&rsquo;ll
    eat like tater-marrer along of the salt meat.&rdquo; He moved one of the
    black buckets from the blaze. &ldquo;I likes to keep it jist on the sizzle,&rdquo; he
    said in explanation to himself; &ldquo;hard bilin&rsquo; makes it tough&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    keep it jist a-simmerin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here his soliloquy was interrupted by the return of the dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Five Bob,&rdquo; said the hatter, &ldquo;dinner&rsquo;ll
    be ready dreckly. Jist keep yer eye on the sheep till I calls yer; keep &rsquo;em
    well rounded up, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em afterwards and have
    a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This speech was accompanied by a gesture evidently intelligible, for the
    dog retired as though he understood English, and the cooking proceeded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a pick an&rsquo; shovel with me an&rsquo; root up
    that old blackfellow,&rdquo;  mused the shepherd, evidently following up
    a recent train of thought; &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;ll do now. I&rsquo;ll
    put in the spuds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The last sentence referred to the cooking, the first to a blackfellow&rsquo;s
    grave about which he was curious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sheep&rsquo;s a-campin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the soliloquizer,
    glancing through the door. &ldquo;So me an&rsquo; Five Bob&rsquo;ll be able
    to get our dinner in peace. I wish I had just enough fat to make the pan
    siss; I&rsquo;d treat myself to a leather-jacket; but it took three weeks&rsquo; skimmin&rsquo; to
    get enough for them theer doughboys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In due time the dinner was dished up; and the old man seated himself on
    a block, with the lid of a gin-case across his knees for a table. Five Bob
    squatted opposite with the liveliest interest and appreciation depicted on
    his intelligent countenance.</p>
  <p>Dinner proceeded very quietly, except when the carver paused to ask the
    dog how some tasty morsel went with him, and Five Bob&rsquo;s tail declared
    that it went very well indeed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, try this,&rdquo; cried the old man, tossing him
    a large piece of doughboy. A click of Five Bob&rsquo;s jaws and the dough
    was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clean into his liver!&rdquo; said the old man with a faint smile.
    He washed up the tinware in the water the duff had been boiled in, and then,
    with the assistance of the dog, yarded the sheep.</p>
  <p>This accomplished, he took a pick and shovel and an old sack, and started
    out over the ridge, followed, of course, by his four-legged mate. After tramping
    some three miles he reached a spur, running out from the main ridge. At the
    extreme end of this, under some gum-trees, was a little mound of earth, barely
    defined in the grass, and indented in the centre as all blackfellows&rsquo; graves
    were.</p>
  <p>He set to work to dig it up, and sure enough, in about half an hour he bottomed
    on payable dirt.</p>
  <p>When he had raked up all the bones, he amused himself by putting them together
    on the grass and by speculating as to whether they had belonged to black
    or white, male or female. Failing, however, to arrive at any satisfactory
    conclusion, he dusted them with great care, put them in the bag, and started
    for home.</p>
  <p>He took a short cut this time over the ridge and down a gully which was
    full of ring-barked trees and long white grass. He had nearly reached its
    mouth when a great greasy black goanna clambered up a sapling from under
    his feet and looked fightable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dang the jumpt-up thing!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;It &rsquo;gin
    me a start!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the foot of the sapling he espied an object which he at first thought
    was the blackened carcass of a sheep, but on closer examination discovered
    to be the body of a man; it lay with its forehead resting on its hands, dried
    to a mummy by the intense heat of the western summer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me luck&rsquo;s in for the day and no mistake!&rdquo; said the shepherd,
    scratching the back of his head, while he took stock of the remains. He picked
    up a stick and tapped the body on the shoulder; the flesh sounded like leather.
    He turned it over on its side; it fell flat on its back like a board, and
    the shrivelled eyes seemed to peer up at him from under the blackened wrists.</p>
  <p>He stepped back involuntarily, but, recovering himself, leant on his stick
    and took in all the ghastly details.</p>
  <p>There was nothing in the blackened features to tell aught of name or race,
    but the dress proclaimed the remains to be those of a European. The old man
    caught sight of a black bottle in the grass, close beside the corpse. This
    set him thinking. Presently he knelt down and examined the soles of the dead
    man&rsquo;s blucher boots, and then, rising with an air of conviction, exclaimed: &ldquo;Brummy!
    by gosh!&mdash;busted up at last!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tole yer so, Brummy,&rdquo; he said impressively, addressing the
    corpse.  &ldquo;I allers told yer as how it &rsquo;ud be&mdash;an&rsquo; here
    y&rsquo;are, you thundering jumpt-up cuss-o&rsquo;-God fool. Yer cud earn
    more&rsquo;n any man in the colony, but yer&rsquo;d lush it all away. I allers
    sed as how it &rsquo;ud end, an&rsquo; now yer kin see fur y&rsquo;self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spect yer was a-comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; me t&rsquo; get fixt up an&rsquo; set
    straight agin; then yer was a-goin&rsquo; to swear off, same as yer &rsquo;allers
    did; an&rsquo; here y&rsquo;are, an&rsquo;  now I expect I&rsquo;ll have
    t&rsquo; fix yer up for the last time an&rsquo; make yer decent, for  &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t
    do t&rsquo; leave yer alyin&rsquo; out here like a dead sheep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He picked up the corked bottle and examined it. To his great surprise it
    was nearly full of rum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this gits me,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man; &ldquo;me luck&rsquo;s
    in, this Christmas, an&rsquo; no mistake. He must &rsquo;a&rsquo; got the
    jams early in his spree, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be a-making for me with near
    a bottleful left. Howsomenever, here goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Looking round, his eyes lit up with satisfaction as he saw some bits of
    bark which had been left by a party of strippers who had been getting bark
    there for the stations. He picked up two pieces, one about four and the other
    six feet long, and each about two feet wide, and brought them over to the
    body. He laid the longest strip by the side of the corpse, which he proceeded
    to lift on to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Brummy,&rdquo; he said, in a softer tone than usual, &ldquo;ye
    ain&rsquo;t as bad as yer might be, considerin&rsquo; as it must be three
    good months since yer slipped yer wind. I spect it was the rum as preserved
    yer. It was the death of yer when yer was alive, an&rsquo; now yer dead,
    it preserves yer like&mdash;like a mummy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he placed the other strip on top, with the hollow side downwards&mdash;thus
    sandwiching the defunct between the two pieces&mdash;removed the saddle-strap,
    which he wore for a belt, and buckled it round one end, while he tried to
    think of something with which to tie up the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take any more strips off my shirt,&rdquo; he said,
    critically examining the skirts of the old blue overshirt he wore. &ldquo;I
    might get a strip or two more off, but it&rsquo;s short enough already. Let&rsquo;s
    see; how long have I been a-wearin&rsquo; of that shirt; oh, I remember,
    I bought it jist two days afore Five Bob was pupped. I can&rsquo;t afford
    a new shirt jist yet; howsomenever, seein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Brummy, I&rsquo;ll
    jist borrow a couple more strips and sew &rsquo;em on agen when I git home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He up-ended Brummy, and placing his shoulder against the middle of the lower
    sheet of bark, lifted the corpse to a horizontal position; then, taking the
    bag of bones in his hand, he started for home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-spendin&rsquo; sech a dull Christmas arter all,&rdquo; he
    reflected, as he plodded on; but he had not walked above a hundred yards
    when he saw a black goanna sidling into the grass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another of them theer dang things!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    two I&rsquo;ve seed this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently he remarked: &ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t smell none too sweet, Brummy.
    It must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been jist about the middle of shearin&rsquo; when
    yer pegged out. I wonder who got yer last cheque. Shoo! theer&rsquo;s another
    black goanner&mdash;theer must be a flock of  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rested Brummy on the ground while he had another pull at the bottle,
    and, before going on, packed the bag of bones on his shoulder under the body,
    and he soon stopped again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The thunderin&rsquo; jumpt-up bones is all skew-whift,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ole on, Brummy, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em&rdquo;&mdash;and
    he leaned the dead man against a tree while he settled the bones on his shoulder,
    and took another pull at the bottle.</p>
  <p>About a mile further on he heard a rustling in the grass to the right, and,
    looking round, saw another goanna gliding off sideways, with its long snaky
    neck turned towards him.</p>
  <p>This puzzled the shepherd considerably, the strangest part of it being that
    Five Bob wouldn&rsquo;t touch the reptile, but slunk off with his tail down
    when ordered to &ldquo;sick &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s sothin&rsquo; comic about them theer goanners,&rdquo; said
    the old man at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seed swarms of grasshoppers an&rsquo; big
    mobs of kangaroos, but dang me if ever I seed a flock of black goanners afore!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On reaching the hut the old man dumped the corpse against the wall, wrong
    end up, and stood scratching his head while he endeavoured to collect his
    muddled thoughts; but he had not placed Brummy at the correct angle, and,
    consequently, that individual fell forward and struck him a violent blow
    on the shoulder with the iron toes of his blucher boots.</p>
  <p>The shock sobered him. He sprang a good yard, instinctively hitching up
    his moleskins in preparation for flight; but a backward glance revealed to
    him the true cause of this supposed attack from the rear. Then he lifted
    the body, stood it on its feet against the chimney, and ruminated as to where
    he should lodge his mate for the night, not noticing that the shorter sheet
    of bark had slipped down on the boots and left the face exposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spect I&rsquo;ll have ter put yer into the chimney-trough for the
    night, Brummy,&rdquo; said he, turning round to confront the corpse. &ldquo;Yer
    can&rsquo;t expect me to take yer into the hut, though I did it when yer
    was in a worse state than&mdash;Lord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The shepherd was not prepared for the awful scrutiny that gleamed on him
    from those empty sockets; his nerves received a shock, and it was some time
    before he recovered himself sufficiently to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look a-here, Brummy,&rdquo; said he, shaking his finger severely
    at the delinquent, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pick a row with yer; I&rsquo;d
    do as much for yer an&rsquo;  more than any other man, an&rsquo; well yer
    knows it; but if yer starts playin&rsquo; any of yer jumpt-up pranktical
    jokes on me, and a-scarin&rsquo; of me after a-humpin&rsquo; of yer  &rsquo;ome,
    by the &rsquo;oly frost I&rsquo;ll kick yer to jim-rags, so I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This admonition delivered, he hoisted Brummy into the chimney-trough, and
    with a last glance towards the sheep-yards, he retired to his bunk to have,
    as he said, a snooze.</p>
  <p>He had more than a snooze, however, for when he woke, it was dark, and the
    bushman&rsquo;s instinct told him it must be nearly nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>He lit a slush-lamp and poured the remainder of the rum into a pannikin;
    but, just as he was about to lift the draught to his lips, he heard a peculiar
    rustling sound overhead, and put the pot down on the table with a slam that
    spilled some of the precious liquor.</p>
  <p>Five Bob whimpered, and the old shepherd, though used to the weird and dismal,
    as one living alone in the bush must necessarily be, felt the icy breath
    of fear at his heart.</p>
  <p>He reached hastily for his old shot-gun, and went out to investigate. He
    walked round the but several times and examined the roof on all sides, but
    saw nothing. Brummy appeared to be in the same position.</p>
  <p>At last, persuading himself that the noise was caused by possums or the
    wind, the old man went inside, boiled his billy, and, after composing his
    nerves somewhat with a light supper and a meditative smoke, retired for the
    night. He was aroused several times before midnight by the same mysterious
    sound overhead, but, though he rose and examined the roof on each occasion
    by the light of the rising moon, he discovered nothing.</p>
  <p>At last he determined to sit up and watch until daybreak, and for this purpose
    took up a position on a log a short distance from the hut, with his gun laid
    in readiness across his knee.</p>
  <p>After watching for about an hour, he saw a black object coming over the
    ridge-pole. He grabbed his gun and fired. The thing disappeared. He ran round
    to the other side of the hut, and there was a great black goanna in violent
    convulsions on the ground.</p>
  <p>Then the old man saw it all. &ldquo;The thunderin&rsquo; jumpt-up thing
    has been a-havin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The same
    cuss-o&rsquo;-God wretch has a-follered me &rsquo;ome, an&rsquo; has been
    a-havin&rsquo; its Christmas dinner off of Brummy, an&rsquo; a-hauntin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me
    into the bargain, the jumpt-up tinker!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As there was no one by whom he could send a message to the station, and
    the old man dared not leave the sheep and go himself, he determined to bury
    the body the next afternoon, reflecting that the authorities could disinter
    it for inquest if they pleased.</p>
  <p>So he brought the sheep home early and made arrangements for the burial
    by measuring the outer casing of Brummy and digging a hole according to those
    dimensions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;minds me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never rightly knowed
    Brummy&rsquo;s religion, blest if ever I did. Howsomenever, there&rsquo;s
    one thing sartin&mdash;none o&rsquo; them theer pianer-fingered parsons is
    a-goin&rsquo; ter take the trouble ter travel out inter this God-forgotten
    part to hold sarvice over him, seein&rsquo; as how his last cheque&rsquo;s
    blued. But, as I&rsquo;ve got the fun&rsquo;ral arrangements all in me own
    hands, I&rsquo;ll do jestice to it, and see that Brummy has a good comfortable
    buryin&rsquo;&mdash;and more&rsquo;s unpossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time yer turned in, Brum,&rdquo; he said, lifting the
    body down.</p>
  <p>He carried it to the grave and dropped it into one corner like a post. He
    arranged the bark so as to cover the face, and, by means of a piece of clothes-line,
    lowered the body to a horizontal position. Then he threw in an armful of
    gum-leaves, and then, very reluctantly, took the shovel and dropped in a
    few shovelfuls of earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; this is the last of Brummy,&rdquo; he said, leaning on
    his spade and looking away over the tops of the ragged gums on the distant
    range.</p>
  <p>This reflection seemed to engender a flood of memories, in which the old
    man became absorbed. He leaned heavily upon his spade and thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arter all,&rdquo; he murmured sadly, &ldquo;arter all&mdash;it were
    Brummy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brummy,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now; nothin&rsquo; matters
    now&mdash;nothin&rsquo;  didn&rsquo;t ever matter, nor&mdash;nor don&rsquo;t.
    You uster say as how it &rsquo;ud be all right termorrer&rdquo;  (pause); &ldquo;termorrer&rsquo;s
    come, Brummy&mdash;come fur you&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t come fur me yet, but&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He threw in some more earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t remember, Brummy, an&rsquo; mebbe yer don&rsquo;t
    want to remember&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to remember&mdash;but&mdash;well,
    but, yer see that&rsquo;s where yer got the pull on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shovelled in some more earth and paused again.</p>
  <p>The dog rose, with ears erect, and looked anxiously first at his master
    and then into the grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Theer oughter be somethin&rsquo; sed,&rdquo; muttered the old man; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
    right to put &rsquo;im under like a dog. Theer oughter be some sort o&rsquo; sarmin.&rdquo; He
    sighed heavily in the listening silence that followed this remark and proceeded
    with his work. He filled the grave to the brim this time, and fashioned the
    mound carefully with his spade. Once or twice he muttered the words, &ldquo;I
    am the rassaraction.&rdquo; As he laid the tools quietly aside, and stood
    at the head of the grave, he was evidently trying to remember the something
    that ought to be said. He removed his hat, placed it carefully on the grass,
    held his hands out from his sides and a little to the front, drew a long
    deep breath, and said with a solemnity that greatly disturbed Five Bob: &ldquo;Hashes
    ter hashes, dus ter dus, Brummy&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; in hopes
    of a great an&rsquo; gerlorious rassaraction!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat down on a log near by, rested his elbows on his knees and passed
    his hand wearily over his forehead&mdash;but only as one who was tired and
    felt the heat; and presently he rose, took up the tools, and walked back
    to the hut.</p>
  <p>And the sun sank again on the grand Australian bush&mdash;the nurse and
    tutor of eccentric minds, the home of the weird.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ComingAcross"></a>Coming Across</b><br>
      <font size="+1">A Study in the Steerage</font> </h2>
  <p>We were delayed for an hour or so inside Sydney Heads, taking passengers
    from the <i>Oroya,</i> which had just arrived from England and anchored off
    Watson&rsquo;s Bay. An Adelaide boat went alongside the ocean liner, while
    we dropped anchor at a respectable distance. This puzzled some of us until
    one of the passengers stopped an ancient mariner and inquired. The sailor
    jerked his thumb upwards, and left. The passengers stared aloft till some
    of them got the lockjaw in the back of their necks, and then another sailor
    suggested that we had yards to our masts, while the Adelaide boat had not.</p>
  <p>It seemed a pity that the new chums for New Zealand didn&rsquo;t have a
    chance to see Sydney after coming so far and getting so near. It struck them
    that way too. They saw Melbourne, which seemed another injustice to the old
    city. However, nothing matters much nowadays, and they might see Sydney in
    happier times.</p>
  <p>They looked like new chums, especially the &ldquo;furst clarsters,&rdquo; and
    there were two or three Scotsmen among them who looked like Scots, and talked
    like it too; also an Irishman. Great Britain and Ireland do not seem to be
    learning anything fresh about Australia. We had a yarn with one of these
    new arrivals, and got talking about the banks. It turned out that he was
    a radical. He spat over the side and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a something shame the way things is carried on! Now, look
    here, a banker can rob hundreds of wimmin and children an&rsquo; widders
    and orfuns, and nothin&rsquo;  is done to him; but if a poor man only embezzles
    a shilling <i>he gets transported to the colonies for life</i>.&rdquo; The
    italics are ours, but the words were his.</p>
  <p>We explained to this new chum that transportation was done away with long
    ago, as far as Australia was concerned, that no more convicts were sent out
    here&mdash;only men who ought to be; and he seemed surprised. He did not
    call us a liar, but he looked as if he thought that we were prevaricating.
    We were glad that he didn&rsquo;t say so, for he was a bigger man. New chums
    are generally more robust than Australians.</p>
  <p>When we got through the Heads someone pointed to the wrong part of the cliff
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shortly afterwards another man pointed to another wrong part of the cliffs
    and observed incidentally:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pretty soon a third man came along and pointed to a third wrong part of
    the cliff, and remarked casually:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We moved aft and met the fourth mate, who jerked his thumb over his shoulder
    at the cliffs in general, and muttered condescendingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not long before a woman turned round and asked &ldquo;Was that the
    place where the Dunbar was wrecked, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and she said &ldquo;Lor,&rdquo; and beckoned
    to a friend.</p>
  <p>We went for&rsquo;ard and met an old sailor, who glared at us, jerked his
    thumb at the coast and growled:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> went down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then we went below; but we felt a slight relief when he said &ldquo;went
    down&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It is doubtful whether a passenger boat ever cleared Sydney Heads since
    the wild night of that famous wreck without someone pointing to the wrong
    part of the cliffs, and remarking:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>Dunbar</i> fiend is inseparable from Australian coasting steamers.</p>
  <p>We travelled second-class in the interests of journalism. You get more points
    for copy in the steerage. It was a sacrifice; but we hope to profit by it
    some day.</p>
  <p>There were about fifty male passengers, including half a dozen New Zealand
    shearers, two of whom came on board drunk&mdash;their remarks for the first
    night mainly consisted of &ldquo;gory.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gory&rdquo; is part
    of the Australian language now&mdash;a big part.</p>
  <p>The others were chiefly tradesmen, labourers, clerks and bagmen, driven
    out of Australia by the hard times there, and glad, no doubt, to get away.
    There was a jeweller on board, of course, and his name was Moses or Cohen.
    If it wasn&rsquo;t it should have been&mdash;or Isaacs. His christian name
    was probably Benjamin. We called him Jacobs. He passed away most of his time
    on board in swopping watch lies with the other passengers and good-naturedly
    spoiling their Waterburys.</p>
  <p>One commercial traveller shipped with a flower in his buttonhole. His girl
    gave it to him on the wharf, and told him to keep it till it faded, and then
    press it. She was a barmaid. She thought he was &ldquo;going saloon,&rdquo; but
    he came forward as soon as the wharf was out of sight. He gave the flower
    to the stewardess, and told us about these things one moonlight night during
    the voyage.</p>
  <p>There was another&mdash;a well-known Sydney man&mdash;whose friends thought
    he was going saloon, and turned up in good force to see him off. He spent
    his last shilling &ldquo;shouting,&rdquo; and kept up his end of the pathetic
    little farce out of consideration for the feelings of certain proud female
    relatives, and not because he was &ldquo;proud&rdquo;&mdash;at least in that
    way. He stood on a conspicuous part of the saloon deck and waved his white
    handkerchief until Miller&rsquo;s Point came between. Then he came forward
    where he belonged. But he was proud&mdash;bitterly so. He had a flower too,
    but he did not give it to the stewardess. He had it pressed, we think (for
    we knew him), and perhaps he wears it now over the place where his heart
    used to be.</p>
  <p>When Australia was fading from view we shed a tear, which was all we had
    to shed; at least, we tried to shed a tear, and could not. It is best to
    be exact when you are writing from experience.</p>
  <p>Just as Australia was fading from view, someone looked through a glass,
    and said in a sad, tired kind of voice that he could just see the place where
    the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.</p>
  <p>Several passengers were leaning about and saying &ldquo;Europe! E-u-rope!&rdquo;  in
    agonized tones. None of them were going to Europe, and the new chums said
    nothing about it. This reminds us that some people say &ldquo;Asia! Asia!
    Ak-kak-Asia!&rdquo; when somebody spills the pepper. There was a pepper-box
    without a stopper on the table in our cabin. The fact soon attracted attention.</p>
  <p>A new chum came along and asked us whether the Maoris were very bad round
    Sydney. He&rsquo;d heard that they were. We told him that we had never had
    any trouble with them to speak of, and gave him another show.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of the wreck of the <i>Dunbar</i>?&rdquo; we asked.
    He said that he never &ldquo;heerd tell&rdquo; of it, but he had heerd of
    the wreck of the <i>Victoria</i>.</p>
  <p>We gave him best.</p>
  <p>The first evening passed off quietly, except for the vinously-excited shearers.
    They had sworn eternal friendship with a convivial dude from the saloon,
    and he made a fine specimen fool of himself for an hour or so. He never showed
    his nose for&rsquo;ard again.</p>
  <p>Now and then a passenger would solemnly seek the steward and have a beer.
    The steward drew it out of a small keg which lay on its side on a shelf with
    a wooden tap sticking out of the end of it&mdash;out of the end of the keg,
    we mean. The beer tasted like warm but weak vinegar, and cost sixpence per
    small glass. The bagman told the steward that he could not compliment him
    on the quality of his liquor, but the steward said nothing. He did not even
    seem interested&mdash;only bored. He had heard the same remark often before,
    no doubt. He was a fat, solemn steward&mdash;not formal, but very reticent&mdash;unresponsive.
    He looked like a man who had conducted a religious conservative paper once
    and failed, and had then gone into the wholesale produce line, and failed
    again, and finally got his present billet through the influence of his creditors
    and two clergymen. He might have been a sociable fellow, a man about town,
    even a gay young dog, and a radical writer before he was driven to accept
    the editorship of the aforesaid periodical. He probably came of a &ldquo;good
    English family.&rdquo; He was now, very likely, either a rigid Presbyterian
    or an extreme freethinker. He thought a lot, anyway, and looked as if he
    knew a lot too&mdash;too much for words, in fact.</p>
  <p>We took a turn on deck before turning in, and heard two men arguing about
    the way in which the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.</p>
  <p>The commercial travellers, the jeweller, and one or two new chums who were
    well provided with clothing undressed deliberately and retired ostentatiously
    in pyjamas, but there were others&mdash;men of better days&mdash;who turned
    in either very early or very late, when the cabin was quiet, and slipped
    hurriedly and furtively out of their clothes and between the blankets, as
    if they were ashamed of the poverty of their underwear. It is well that the
    Lord can see deep down into the hearts of men, for He has to judge them;
    it is well that the majority of mankind cannot, because, if they could, the
    world would be altogether too sorrowful to live in; and we do not think the
    angels can either, else they would not be happy&mdash;if they could and were
    they would not be angels any longer&mdash;they would be devils. Study it
    out on a slate.</p>
  <p>We turned in feeling comfortably dismal, and almost wishing that we had
    gone down with the <i>Dunbar</i>.</p>
  <p>The intoxicated shearers and the dude kept their concert up till a late
    hour that night&mdash;or, rather, a very early hour next morning; and at
    about midnight they were reinforced by the commercial traveller and Moses,
    the jeweller, who had been visiting acquaintances aft. This push was encouraged
    by voices from various bunks, and enthusiastically barracked for by a sandy-complexioned,
    red-headed comedian with twinkling grey eyes, who occupied the berth immediately
    above our own.</p>
  <p>They stood with their backs to the bunks, and their feet braced against
    the deck, or lurched round, and took friendly pulls from whisky flasks, and
    chyacked each other, and laughed, and blowed, and lied like&mdash;like Australian
    bushmen; and occasionally they broke out into snatches of song&mdash;and
    as often broke down. Few Englishmen know more than the first verse, or two
    lines, of even their most popular song, and, where elevated enough to think
    they can sing, they repeat the first verse over and over again, with the
    wrong words, and with a sort of &ldquo;Ta-ra-ra-rum-ti-tooral, ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-rum-ti,
    ta-ra-ra-rum-tum-ti-rum-rum-tum-ti-dee-e-e,&rdquo; by way of variation.</p>
  <p>Presently&mdash;suddenly, it seemed to our drowsy senses&mdash;two of the
    shearers and the bagman commenced arguing with drunken gravity and precision
    about politics, even while a third bushman was approaching the climax of
    an out-back yarn of many adjectives, of which he himself was the hero. The
    scraps of conversation that we caught were somewhat as follow. We leave out
    most of the adjectives.</p>
  <p>First Voice: &ldquo;Now, look here. The women will vote for men, not principles.
    That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m against women voting. Now, just mark my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Third Voice (trying to finish yarn): &ldquo;Hold on. Just wait till I tell
    yer. Well, this bloomin&rsquo; bloke, he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Second Voice (evidently in reply to first): &ldquo;Principles you mean,
    not men. You&rsquo;re getting a bit mixed, old man.&rdquo; (Smothered chuckle
    from comedian over our head.)</p>
  <p>Third Voice (seeming to drift round in search of sympathy): &ldquo;&lsquo;You
    will!&rsquo;  sez I. &lsquo;Yes, I will,&rsquo; he sez. &lsquo;Oh, you will,
    will yer?&rsquo; I sez; and with that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Second Voice (apparently wandering from both subjects) &ldquo;Blanker has
    always stuck up for the workin&rsquo; man, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll get in,
    you&rsquo;ll see. Why, he&rsquo;s a bloomin&rsquo;  workin&rsquo; man himself.
    Me and Blanker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Disgusted voice from a bunk: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s damn rot! We&rsquo;ve
    had enough of lumpers in parliament! Horny hands are all right enough, but
    we don&rsquo;t want any more blanky horny heads!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Third Voice (threateningly): &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; about &rsquo;orny
    heads? That pitch is meant for us, ain&rsquo;t it? Do you mean to say that
    I&rsquo;ve got a &rsquo;orny head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here two men commenced snarling at each other, and there was some talk of
    punching the causes of the dispute; but the bagman interfered, a fresh flask
    was passed round, and some more eternal friendship sworn to.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and the next time we were aware of anything the commercial
    and Moses had disappeared, the rest were lying or sitting in their bunks,
    and the third shearer was telling a yarn about an alleged fight he had at
    a shed up-country; and perhaps he was telling it for the benefit of the dissatisfied
    individual who made the injudicious remark concerning horny heads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I said to the boss-over-the-board, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a nice
    sort of a thing,&rsquo;  I sez. &lsquo;Who are you talkin&rsquo; to?&rsquo; he
    says. &lsquo;You, bless yer,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo;  he
    says, &lsquo;you get your cheque and clear! &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;you
    can take that!&rsquo;  and I hauled off and landed him a beauty under the
    butt of the listener. Then the boss came along with two blacklegs, but the
    boys made a ring, and I laid out the blanks in just five minutes. Then I
    sez to the boss, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of cove I am,&rsquo; I sez, &rsquo;an&rsquo; now,
    if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But just here there came a deep, growling voice&mdash;seemingly from out
    of the depths of the forehold&mdash;anyway, there came a voice, and it said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake give her a rest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The steward turned off the electricity, but there were two lanterns dimly
    burning in our part of the steerage. It was a narrow compartment running
    across the width of the boat, and had evidently been partitioned off from
    the top floor of the hold to meet the emigration from Australia to New Zealand.
    There were three tiers of bunks, two deep, on the far side, three rows of
    single bunks on the other, and two at each end of the cabin, the top ones
    just under the portholes.</p>
  <p>The shearers had turned in &ldquo;all standing;&rdquo; two of them were
    lying feet to feet in a couple of outside lower berths. One lay on his stomach
    with his face turned outwards, his arm thrown over the side of the bunk,
    and his knuckles resting on the deck, the other rested on the broad of his
    back with his arm also hanging over the side and his knuckles resting on
    the floor. And so they slept the sleep of the drunk.</p>
  <p>A fair, girl-faced young Swiss emigrant occupied one of the top berths,
    with his curly, flaxen head resting close alongside one of the lanterns that
    were dimly burning, and an Anglo-foreign dictionary in his hand. His mate,
    or brother, who resembled him in everything except that he had dark hair,
    lay asleep alongside; and in the next berth a long consumptive-looking new
    chum sat in his pyjamas, with his legs hanging over the edge, and his hands
    grasping the sideboard, to which, on his right hand, a sort of tin-can arrangement
    was hooked. He was staring intently at nothing, and seemed to be thinking
    very hard.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and woke suddenly to find our eyes wide open, and the
    young Swiss still studying, and the jackaroo still sitting in the same position,
    but with a kind of waiting expression on his face&mdash;a sort of expectant
    light in his eyes. Suddenly he lurched for the can, and after awhile he lay
    back looking like a corpse.</p>
  <p>We slept again, and finally awoke to daylight and the clatter of plates.
    All the bunks were vacated except two, which contained corpses, apparently.</p>
  <p>Wet decks, and a round, stiff, morning breeze, blowing strongly across the
    deck, abeam, and gustily through the open portholes. There was a dull grey
    sky, and the sea at first sight seemed to be of a dark blue or green, but
    on closer inspection it took a dirty slate colour, with splashes as of indigo
    in the hollows. There was one of those near, yet far-away horizons.</p>
  <p>About two-thirds of the men were on deck, but the women had not shown up
    yet&mdash;nor did they show up until towards the end of the trip.</p>
  <p>Some of the men were smoking in a sheltered corner, some walking up and
    down, two or three trying to play quoits, one looking at the poultry, one
    standing abaft the purser&rsquo;s cabin with hands in the pockets of his
    long ragged overcoat, watching the engines, and two more&mdash;carpenters&mdash;were
    discussing a big cedar log, about five feet in diameter, which was lashed
    on deck alongside the hatch.</p>
  <p>While we were waiting for the <i>Oroya</i> some of the ship&rsquo;s officers
    came and had a consultation over this log and called up part of the crew,
    who got some more ropes and a chain on to it. It struck us at the time that
    that log would make a sensation if it fetched loose in rough weather. But
    there wasn&rsquo;t any rough weather.</p>
  <p>The fore-cabin was kept clean; the assistant steward was good-humoured and
    obliging; his chief was civil enough to freeze the Never-Never country; but
    the bill of fare was monotonous.</p>
  <p>During the afternoon a first-salooner made himself obnoxious by swelling
    round for&rsquo;ard. He was a big bull-necked &ldquo;Britisher&rdquo; (that
    word covers it) with a bloated face, prominent gooseberry eyes, fore &rsquo;n&rsquo; aft
    cap, and long tan shoes. He seemed as if he&rsquo;d come to see a &ldquo;zoo,&rdquo; and
    was dissatisfied with it&mdash;had a fine contempt for it, in fact, because
    it did not come up to other zoological gardens that he had seen in London,
    and on the <i>aw</i>-continong and in the-<i>aw</i>-er-<i>aw</i>&mdash;the
    States, dontcherknow. The fellows reckoned that he ought to be &ldquo;took
    down a peg&rdquo;  (dontcherknow) and the sandy-complexioned comedian said
    he&rsquo;d do it. So he stepped softly up to the swell, tapped him lightly
    on the shoulder, and pointed aft&mdash;holding his arm out like a pump handle
    and his forefinger rigid.</p>
  <p>The Britisher&rsquo;s face was a study; it was blank at first and then it
    went all colours, and wore, in succession, every possible expression except
    a pleasant one. He seemed bursting with indignation, but he did not speak&mdash;could
    not, perhaps; and, as soon as he could detach his feet from the spot to which
    they had been nailed in the first place by astonishment, he stalked aft.
    He did not come to see the zoo any more.</p>
  <p>The fellows in the fore-cabin that evening were growling about the bad quality
    of the grub supplied.</p>
  <p>Then the shearer&rsquo;s volcano showed signs of activity. He shifted round,
    spat impatiently, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You chaps don&rsquo;t know what yer talkin&rsquo; about. You want
    something to grumble about. You should have been out with me last year on
    the Paroo in Noo South Wales. The meat we got there was so bad that it uster
    travel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! travel! take the track! go on the wallaby! The cockies over
    there used to hang the meat up on the branches of the trees, and just shake
    it whenever they wanted to feed the fowls. And the water was so bad that
    half a pound of tea in the billy wouldn&rsquo;t make no impression on the
    colour&mdash;nor the taste. The further west we went the worse our meat got,
    till at last we had to carry a dog-chain to chain it up at night. Then it
    got worse and broke the chain, and then we had to train the blessed dogs
    to shepherd it and bring it back. But we fell in with another chap with a
    bad old dog&mdash;a downright knowing, thieving, old hard-case of a dog;
    and this dog led our dogs astray&mdash;demoralized them&mdash;corrupted their
    morals&mdash;and so one morning they came home with the blooming meat inside
    them, instead of outside&mdash;and we had to go hungry for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better turn in, gentlemen. I&rsquo;m going to turn off
    the light,&rdquo;  said the steward.</p>
  <p>The yarn reminded the Sydney man of a dog he had, and he started some dog
    lies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This dog of mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knowed the way into the
    best public-houses. If I came to a strange town and wanted a good drink,
    I&rsquo;d only have to say, &lsquo;Jack, I&rsquo;m dry,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;d
    lead me all right. He always knew the side entrances and private doors after
    hours, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the yarn did not go very well&mdash;it fell flat in fact. Then the commercial
    traveller was taken bad with an anecdote. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;I had a black bag once that knew the way into public-houses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. A black bag. A long black bag like that one I&rsquo;ve got there
    in my bunk. I was staying at a boarding-house in Sydney, and one of us used
    to go out every night for a couple of bottles of beer, and we carried the
    bottles in the bag; and when we got opposite the pub the front end of the
    bag would begin to swing round towards the door. It was wonderful. It was
    just as if there was a lump of steel in the end of the bag and a magnet in
    the bar. We tried it with ever so many people, but it always acted the same.
    We couldn&rsquo;t use that bag for any other purpose, for if we carried it
    along the street it would make our wrists ache trying to go into pubs. It
    twisted my wrist one time, and it ain&rsquo;t got right since&mdash;I always
    feel the pain in dull weather. Well, one night we got yarning and didn&rsquo;t
    notice how the time was going, and forgot to go for the beer till it was
    nearly too late. We looked for the bag and couldn&rsquo;t find it&mdash;we
    generally kept it under a side-table, but it wasn&rsquo;t there, and before
    we were done looking, eleven o&rsquo;clock went. We sat down round the fire,
    feeling pretty thirsty, and were just thinking about turning in when we heard
    a thump on the table behind us. We looked round, and there was that bag with
    two full bottles of English ale in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I remembered that I&rsquo;d left a bob in the bottom of the
    bag, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The steward turned off the electric light.</p>
  <p>There were some hundreds of cases of oranges stacked on deck, and made fast
    with matting and cordage to the bulwarks. That night was very dark, and next
    morning there was a row. The captain said he&rsquo;d &ldquo;give any man
    three months that he caught at those oranges.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot, yer givin&rsquo; us?&rdquo; said a shearer. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
    know anything about yer bloomin&rsquo; oranges.... I seen one of the saloon
    passengers moochin&rsquo; round for&rsquo;ard last night. You&rsquo;d better
    search the saloon for your blarsted oranges, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t come round
    tacklin&rsquo; the wrong men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not necessary to search our quarters, for the &ldquo;offside&rdquo; steward
    was sweeping orange peel out of the steerage for three days thereafter.</p>
  <p>And that night, just as we were about to fall asleep, a round, good-humoured
    face loomed over the edge of the shelf above and a small, twinkling, grey
    eye winked at us. Then a hand came over, gave a jerk, and something fell
    on our nose. It was an orange. We sent a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; up through
    the boards and commenced hurriedly and furtively to stow away the orange.
    But the comedian had an axe to grind&mdash;most people have&mdash;wanted
    to drop his peel alongside our berth; and it made us uneasy because we did
    not want circumstantial evidence lying round us if the captain chanced to
    come down to inquire. The next man to us had a barney with the man above
    him about the same thing. Then the peel was scattered round pretty fairly,
    or thrown into an empty bunk, and no man dared growl lest he should come
    to be regarded as a blackleg&mdash;a would-be informer.</p>
  <p>The men opposite the door kept a look out; and two Australian jokers sat
    in the top end berth with their legs hanging over and swinging contentedly,
    and the porthole open ready for a swift and easy disposal of circumstantial
    evidence on the first alarm. They were eating a pineapple which they had
    sliced and extracted in sections from a crate up on deck. They looked so
    chummy, and so school-boyishly happy and contented, that they reminded us
    of the days long ago, when we were so high.</p>
  <p>The chaps had talk about those oranges on deck next day. The commercial
    traveller said we had a right to the oranges, because the company didn&rsquo;t
    give us enough to eat. He said that we were already suffering from insufficient
    proper nourishment, and he&rsquo;d tell the doctor so if the doctor came
    on board at Auckland. Anyway, it was no sin to rob a company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said our comedian, &ldquo;those oranges, perhaps,
    were sent over by a poor, struggling orange grower, with a wife and family
    to keep, and he&rsquo;ll have to bear the loss, and a few bob might make
    a lot of difference to him. It ain&rsquo;t right to rob a poor man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This made us feel doubtful and mean, and one or two got uncomfortable and
    shifted round uneasily. But presently the traveller came to the rescue. He
    said that no doubt the oranges belonged to a middleman, and the middleman
    was the curse of the country. We felt better.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the trip the women began to turn up. There were five
    grass widows, and every female of them had a baby. The Australian marries
    young and poor; and, when he can live no longer in his native land, he sells
    the furniture, buys a steerage ticket to New Zealand or Western Australia,
    and leaves his wife with her relatives or friends until he earns enough money
    to send for her. Four of our women were girl-wives, and mostly pretty. One
    little handful of a thing had a fine baby boy, nearly as big as herself,
    and she looked so fragile and pale, and pretty and lonely, and had such an
    appealing light in her big shadowed brown eyes, and such a pathetic droop
    at the corners of her sweet little mouth, that you longed to take her in
    your manly arms&mdash;baby and all&mdash;and comfort her.</p>
  <p>The last afternoon on high seas was spent in looking through glasses for
    the Pinnacles, off North Cape. And, as we neared the land, the commercial
    traveller remarked that he wouldn&rsquo;t mind if there was a wreck now&mdash;provided
    we all got saved.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have all our names in the papers,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;Gallant conduct of the passengers and crew. Heroic rescue by
    Mr So-and-so-climbing the cliffs with a girl under his arm, and all that
    sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps smiled a doleful smile, and turned away again to look at the Promised
    Land. They had had no anxiety to speak of for the last two or three days;
    but now they were again face to face with the cursed question, &ldquo;How
    to make a living.&rdquo; They were wondering whether or no they would get
    work in New Zealand, and feeling more doubtful about it than when they embarked.</p>
  <p>Pity we couldn&rsquo;t go to sea and sail away for ever, and never see land
    any more&mdash;or, at least, not till better and brighter days&mdash;if they
    ever come.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStoryOfMalachi"></a>The Story Of Malachi</b></h2>
  <p>Malachi was very tall, very thin, and very round-shouldered, and the sandiness
    of his hair also cried aloud for an adjective. All the boys considered Malachi
    the greatest ass on the station, and there was no doubt that he <i>was</i> an
    awful fool. He had never been out of his native bush in all his life, excepting
    once, when he paid a short visit to Sydney, and when he returned it was evident
    that his nerves had received a shaking. We failed to draw one word out of
    Malachi regarding his views on the city&mdash;to describe it was not in his
    power, for it had evidently been something far beyond his comprehension.
    Even after his visit had become a matter of history, if you were to ask him
    what he thought of Sydney the dazed expression would come back into his face,
    and he would scratch his head and say in a slow and deliberate manner, &ldquo;Well,
    there&rsquo;s no mistake, it&rsquo;s a caution.&rdquo;  And as such the city
    remained, so far as Malachi&rsquo;s opinion of it was concerned.</p>
  <p>Malachi was always shabbily dressed, in spite of his pound a week and board,
    and &ldquo;When Malachi gets a new suit of clothes&rdquo; was the expression
    invariably used by the boys to fix a date for some altogether improbable
    event. We were always having larks with Malachi, for we looked upon him as
    our legitimate butt. He seldom complained, and when he did his remonstrance
    hardly ever went beyond repeating the words, &ldquo;Now, none of your pranktical
    jokes!&rdquo; If this had not the desired effect, and we put up some too
    outrageous trick on him, he would content himself by muttering with sorrowful
    conviction, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no mistake, it&rsquo;s a caution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We were not content with common jokes, such as sewing up the legs of Malachi&rsquo;s
    trousers while he slept, fixing his bunk, or putting explosives in his pipe&mdash;we
    aspired to some of the higher branches of the practical joker&rsquo;s art.
    It was well known that Malachi had an undying hatred for words of four syllables
    and over, and the use of them was always sufficient to forfeit any good opinions
    he might have previously entertained concerning the user. &ldquo;I hate them
    high-flown words,&rdquo;  he would say&mdash;&ldquo;I got a book at home
    that I could get them out of if I wanted them; but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The
    book referred to was a very dilapidated dictionary. Malachi&rsquo;s hatred
    for high-flown words was only equalled by his aversion to the opposite sex;
    and, this being known, we used to write letters to him in a feminine hand,
    threatening divers breach of promise actions, and composed in the high-flown
    language above alluded to. We used to think this very funny, and by these
    means we made his life a burden to him. Malachi put the most implicit faith
    in everything we told him; he would take in the most improbable yarn provided
    we preserved a grave demeanour and used no high-flown expressions. He would
    indeed sometimes remark that our yarns were a caution, but that was all.</p>
  <p>We played upon him the most gigantic joke of all during the visit of a certain
    bricklayer, who came to do some work at the homestead. &ldquo;Bricky&rdquo; was
    a bit of a phrenologist, and knew enough of physiognomy and human nature
    to give a pretty fair delineation of character. He also went in for spirit-rapping,
    greatly to the disgust of the two ancient housekeepers, who declared that
    they&rsquo;d have &ldquo;no dalins wid him and his divil&rsquo;s worruk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bricklayer was from the first an object of awe to Malachi, who carefully
    avoided him; but one night we got the butt into a room where the artisan
    was entertaining the boys with a seance. After the table-rapping, during
    which Malachi sat with uncovered head and awe-struck expression, we proposed
    that he should have his bumps read, and before he could make his escape Malachi
    was seated in a chair in the middle of the room and the bricklayer was running
    his fingers over his head. I really believe that Malachi&rsquo;s hair bristled
    between the phrenologist&rsquo;s fingers. Whenever he made a hit his staunch
    admirer, &ldquo;Donegal,&rdquo; would exclaim &ldquo;Look at that now!&rdquo; while
    the girls tittered and said, &ldquo;Just fancy!&rdquo; and from time to time
    Malachi would be heard to mutter to himself, in a tone of the most intense
    conviction, that,  &ldquo;without the least mistake it was a caution.&rdquo; Several
    times at his work the next day Malachi was observed to rest on his spade,
    while he tilted his hat forward with one hand and felt the back of his head
    as though he had not been previously aware of its existence.</p>
  <p>We &ldquo;ran&rdquo; Malachi to believe that the bricklayer was mad on the
    subject of phrenology, and was suspected of having killed several persons
    in order to obtain their skulls for experimental purposes. We further said
    that he had been heard to say that Malachi&rsquo;s skull was a most extraordinary
    one, and so we advised him to be careful.</p>
  <p>Malachi occupied a hut some distance from the station, and one night, the
    last night of the bricklayer&rsquo;s stay, as Malachi sat smoking over the
    fire the door opened quietly and the phrenologist entered. He carried a bag
    with a pumpkin in the bottom of it, and, sitting down on a stool, he let
    the bag down with a bump on the floor between his feet. Malachi was badly
    scared, but he managed to stammer out&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello!&rdquo; said the phrenologist.</p>
  <p>There was an embarrassing silence, which was at last broken by &ldquo;Bricky&rdquo;  saying &ldquo;How
    are you gettin&rsquo; on, Malachi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, jist right,&rdquo; replied Malachi.</p>
  <p>Nothing was said for a while, until Malachi, after fidgeting a good deal
    on his stool, asked the bricklayer when he was leaving the station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going away in the morning, early,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    jist been over to Jimmy Nowlett&rsquo;s camp, and as I was passing I thought
    I&rsquo;d call and get your head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I come for your skull.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the phrenologist continued, while Malachi sat horror-stricken;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got Jimmy Nowlett&rsquo;s skull here,&rdquo; and he lifted the bag and lovingly
    felt the pumpkin&mdash;it must have weighed forty pounds. &ldquo;I spoilt
    one of his best bumps with the tomahawk. I had to hit him twice, but it&rsquo;s
    no use crying over spilt milk.&rdquo; Here he drew a heavy shingling-hammer
    out of the bag and wiped off with his sleeve something that looked like blood.
    Malachi had been edging round for the door, and now he made a rush for it.
    But the skull-fancier was there before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gor-sake you don&rsquo;t want to murder me!&rdquo; gasped Malachi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I can get your skull any other way,&rdquo; said Bricky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Malachi&mdash;and then, with a vague idea that
    it was best to humour a lunatic, he continued, in a tone meant to be off-hand
    and careless&mdash;&ldquo;Now, look here, if yer only waits till I die you
    can have my whole skelington and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now Malachi,&rdquo; said the phrenologist sternly, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye
    think I&rsquo;m a fool? I ain&rsquo;t going to stand any humbug. If yer acts
    sensible you&rsquo;ll be quiet, and it&rsquo;ll soon be over, but if yer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malachi did not wait to hear the rest. He made a spring for the back of
    the hut and through it, taking down a large new sheet of stringy-bark in
    his flight. Then he could be heard loudly ejaculating &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
    caution!&rdquo; as he went through the bush like a startled kangaroo, and
    he didn&rsquo;t stop till he reached the station.</p>
  <p>Jimmy Nowlett and I had been peeping through a crack in the same sheet of
    bark that Malachi dislodged; it fell on us and bruised us somewhat, but it
    wasn&rsquo;t enough to knock the fun out of the thing.</p>
  <p>When Jimmy Nowlett crawled out from under the bark he had to lie down on
    Malachi&rsquo;s bunk to laugh, and even for some time afterwards it was not
    unusual for Jimmy to wake up in the night and laugh till we wished him dead.</p>
  <p>I should like to finish here, but there remains something more to be said
    about Malachi.</p>
  <p>One of the best cows at the homestead had a calf, about which she made a
    great deal of fuss. She was ordinarily a quiet, docile creature, and, though
    somewhat fussy after calving no one ever dreamed that she would injure anyone.
    It happened one day that the squatter&rsquo;s daughter and her intended husband,
    a Sydney exquisite, were strolling in a paddock where the cow was. Whether
    the cow objected to the masher or his lady love&rsquo;s red parasol, or whether
    she suspected designs upon her progeny, is not certain; anyhow, she went
    for them. The young man saw the cow coming first, and he gallantly struck
    a bee-line for the fence, leaving the girl to manage for herself. She wouldn&rsquo;t
    have managed very well if Malachi hadn&rsquo;t been passing just then. He
    saw the girl&rsquo;s danger and ran to intercept the cow with no weapon but
    his hands.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t last long. There was a roar, a rush, and a cloud of dust,
    out of which the cow presently emerged, and went scampering back to the bush
    in which her calf was hidden.</p>
  <p>We carried Malachi home and laid him on a bed. He had a terrible wound in
    the groin, and the blood soaked through the bandages like water. We did all
    that was possible for him, the boys killed the squatter&rsquo;s best horse
    and spoilt two others riding for a doctor, but it was of no use. In the last
    half-hour of his life we all gathered round Malachi&rsquo;s bed; he was only
    twenty-two. Once he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder how mother&rsquo;ll manage now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo; someone asked gently; we had
    never dreamt that Malachi might have someone to love him and be proud of
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Bathurst,&rdquo; he answered wearily&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
    take on awful, I &rsquo;spect, she was awful fond of me&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
    been pulling together this last ten years&mdash;mother and me&mdash;we wanted
    to make it all right for my little brother Jim&mdash;poor Jim!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Jim?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s blind,&rdquo; said Malachi &ldquo;always was&mdash;we
    wanted to make it all right for him agin time he grows up&mdash;I&mdash;I
    managed to send home about&mdash;about forty pounds a year&mdash;we bought
    a bit of ground, and&mdash;and&mdash;I think&mdash;I&rsquo;m going now. Tell &rsquo;em,
    Harry&mdash;tell  &rsquo;em how it was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had to go outside then. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it any more. There was
    a lump in my throat and I&rsquo;d have given anything to wipe out my share
    in the practical jokes, but it was too late now.</p>
  <p>Malachi was dead when I went in again, and that night the hat went round
    with the squatter&rsquo;s cheque in the bottom of it and we made it &ldquo;all
    right&rdquo;  for Malachi&rsquo;s blind brother Jim.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SteelmansPupil"></a>Steelman&rsquo;s Pupil</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman was a hard case, but some said that Smith was harder. Steelman
    was big and good-looking, and good-natured in his way; he was a spieler,
    pure and simple, but did things in humorous style. Smith was small and weedy,
    of the sneak variety; he had a whining tone and a cringing manner. He seemed
    to be always so afraid you were going to hit him that he would make you want
    to hit him on that account alone.</p>
  <p>Steelman &ldquo;had&rdquo; you in a fashion that would make your friends
    laugh. Smith would &ldquo;have&rdquo; you in a way which made you feel mad
    at the bare recollection of having been taken in by so contemptible a little
    sneak.</p>
  <p>They battled round together in the North Island of Maoriland for a couple
    of years.</p>
  <p>One day Steelman said to Smith:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Smithy, you don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re born yet. I&rsquo;m
    going to take you in hand and teach you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he did. If Smith wouldn&rsquo;t do as Steelman told him, or wasn&rsquo;t
    successful in cadging, or mugged any game they had in hand, Steelman would
    threaten to stoush him; and, if the warning proved ineffectual after the
    second or third time, he would stoush him.</p>
  <p>One day, on the track, they came to a place where an old Scottish couple
    kept a general store and shanty. They camped alongside the road, and Smith
    was just starting up to the house to beg supplies when Steelman cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&mdash;hold on. Now where do you think you&rsquo;re going to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m going to try and chew the old party&rsquo;s lug, of
    course. We&rsquo;ll be out of tucker in a couple of days,&rdquo; said Smith.</p>
  <p>Steelman sat down on a stump in a hopeless, discouraged sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said, regarding Smith with mingled reproach
    and disgust.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. I might as well give it best. I can
    see that it&rsquo;s only waste of time trying to learn you anything. Will
    I ever be able to knock some gumption into your thick skull? After all the
    time and trouble and pains I&rsquo;ve took with your education, you hain&rsquo;t
    got any more sense than to go and mug a business like that! When will you
    learn sense? Hey? After all, I&mdash;Smith, you&rsquo;re a born mug!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He always called Smith a &ldquo;mug&rdquo; when he was particularly wild
    at him, for it hurt Smith more than anything else. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only
    two classes in the world, spielers and mugs&mdash;and you&rsquo;re a mug,
    Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have I done, anyway?&rdquo; asked Smith helplessly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman wearily rested his brow on his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will do, Smith,&rdquo; he said listlessly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    say another word, old man; it&rsquo;ll only make my head worse; don&rsquo;t
    talk. You might, at the very least, have a little consideration for my feelings&mdash;even
    if you haven&rsquo;t for your own interests.&rdquo;  He paused and regarded
    Smith sadly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you another show. I&rsquo;ll stage
    the business for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made Smith doff his coat and get into his worst pair of trousers&mdash;and
    they were bad enough; they were hopelessly &ldquo;gone&rdquo; beyond the
    extreme limit of bush decency. He made Smith put on a rag of a felt hat and
    a pair of &ldquo;&rsquo;lastic-sides&rdquo;  which had fallen off a tramp
    and lain baking and rotting by turns on a rubbish heap; they had to be tied
    on Smith with bits of rag and string. He drew dark shadows round Smith&rsquo;s
    eyes, and burning spots on his cheek-bones with some greasepaints he used
    when they travelled as &ldquo;The Great Steelman and Smith Combination Star
    Dramatic Co.&rdquo;  He damped Smith&rsquo;s hair to make it dark and lank,
    and his face more corpse-like by comparison&mdash;in short, he made him up
    to look like a man who had long passed the very last stage of consumption,
    and had been artificially kept alive in the interests of science.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; said Steelman to Smith. &ldquo;You
    left your whare the day before yesterday and started to walk to the hospital
    at Palmerston. An old mate picked you up dying on the road, brought you round,
    and carried you on his back most of the way here. You firmly believe that
    Providence had something to do with the sending of that old mate along at
    that time and place above all others. Your mate also was hard up; he was
    going to a job&mdash;the first show for work he&rsquo;d had in nine months&mdash;but
    he gave it up to see you through; he&rsquo;d give up his life rather than
    desert a mate in trouble. You only want a couple of shillings or a bit of
    tucker to help you on to Palmerston. You know you&rsquo;ve got to die, and
    you only want to live long enough to get word to your poor old mother, and
    die on a bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, they&rsquo;re Scotch up at that house. You understand the
    Scotch barrack pretty well by now&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t it ain&rsquo;t
    my fault. You were born in Aberdeen, but came out too young to remember much
    about the town. Your father&rsquo;s dead. You ran away to sea and came out
    in the <i>Bobbie Burns</i> to Sydney. Your poor old mother&rsquo;s in Aberdeen
    now&mdash;Bruce or Wallace Wynd will do. Your mother might be dead now&mdash;poor
    old soul!&mdash;any way, you&rsquo;ll never see her again. You wish you&rsquo;d
    never run away from home. You wish you&rsquo;d been a better son to your
    poor old mother; you wish you&rsquo;d written to her and answered her last
    letter. You only want to live long enough to write home and ask for forgiveness
    and a blessing before you die. If you had a drop of spirits of some sort
    to brace you up you might get along the road better. (Put this delicately.)
    Get the whine out of your voice and breathe with a wheeze&mdash;like this;
    get up the nearest approach to a deathrattle that you can. Move as if you
    were badly hurt in your wind&mdash;like this. (If you don&rsquo;t do it better&rsquo;n
    that, I&rsquo;ll stoush you.) Make your face a bit longer and keep your lips
    dry&mdash;don&rsquo;t lick them, you damned fool!&mdash;<i>breathe</i> on
    them; make &rsquo;em dry as chips. That&rsquo;s the only decent pair of breeks
    you&rsquo;ve got, and the only &ldquo;shoon.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re a Presbyterian&mdash;not
    a U.P., the Auld Kirk. Your mate would have come up to the house only&mdash;well,
    you&rsquo;ll have to use the stuffing in your head a bit; you can&rsquo;t
    expect me to do all the brain work. Remember it&rsquo;s consumption you&rsquo;ve
    got&mdash;galloping consumption; you know all the symptoms&mdash;pain on
    top of your right lung, bad cough, and night sweats. Something tells you
    that you won&rsquo;t see the new year&mdash;it&rsquo;s a week off Christmas
    now. And if you come back without anything, I&rsquo;ll blessed soon put you
    out of your misery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith came back with about four pounds of shortbread and as much various
    tucker as they could conveniently carry; a pretty good suit of cast-off tweeds;
    a new pair of &rsquo;lastic-sides from the store stock; two bottles of patent
    medicine and a black bottle half-full of home-made consumption-cure; also
    a letter to a hospital-committee man, and three shillings to help him on
    his way to Palmerston. He also got about half a mile of sympathy, religious
    consolation, and medical advice which he didn&rsquo;t remember.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i>,&rdquo; he said, triumphantly, &ldquo;am I a mug or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman kindly ignored the question. &ldquo;I <i>did</i> have a better
    opinion of the Scotch,&rdquo; he said, contemptuously.</p>
  <p>Steelman got on at an hotel as billiard-marker and decoy, and in six months
    he managed that pub. Smith, who&rsquo;d been away on his own account, turned
    up in the town one day clean broke, and in a deplorable state. He heard of
    Steelman&rsquo;s luck, and thought he was &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; so went
    to his old friend.</p>
  <p>Cold type&mdash;or any other kind of type&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t do justice
    to Steelman&rsquo;s disgust. To think that this was the reward of all the
    time and trouble he&rsquo;d spent on Smith&rsquo;s education! However, when
    he cooled down, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smith, you&rsquo;re a young man yet, and it&rsquo;s never too late
    to mend. There is still time for reformation. I can&rsquo;t help you now;
    it would only demoralize you altogether. To think, after the way I trained
    you, you can&rsquo;t battle round any better&rsquo;n this! I always thought
    you were an irreclaimable mug, but I expected better things of you towards
    the end. I thought I&rsquo;d make <i>something</i> of you. It&rsquo;s enough
    to dishearten any man and disgust him with the world. Why! you ought to be
    a rich man now with the chances and training you had! To think&mdash;but
    I won&rsquo;t talk of that; it has made me ill. I suppose I&rsquo;ll have
    to give you something, if it&rsquo;s only to get rid of the sight of you.
    Here&rsquo;s a quid, and I&rsquo;m a mug for giving it to you. It&rsquo;ll
    do you more harm than good; and it ain&rsquo;t a friendly thing nor the right
    thing for me&mdash;who always had your welfare at heart&mdash;to give it
    to you under the circumstances. Now, get away out of my sight, and don&rsquo;t
    come near me till you&rsquo;ve reformed. If you do, I&rsquo;ll have to stoush
    you out of regard for my own health and feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Steelman came down in the world again and picked up Smith on the road,
    and they battled round together for another year or so; and at last they
    were in Wellington&mdash;Steelman &ldquo;flush&rdquo; and stopping at an
    hotel, and Smith stumped, as usual, and staying with a friend. One night
    they were drinking together at the hotel, at the expense of some mugs whom
    Steelman was &ldquo;educating.&rdquo; It was raining hard. When Smith was
    going home, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Steely, old man. Listen to the rain! I&rsquo;ll get wringing
    wet going home. You might as well lend me your overcoat to-night. You won&rsquo;t
    want it, and I won&rsquo;t hurt it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, Steelman&rsquo;s heart being warmed by his successes, he lent the overcoat.</p>
  <p>Smith went and pawned it, got glorious on the proceeds, and took the pawn-ticket
    to Steelman next day.</p>
  <p>Smith had reformed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BoardAndResidence"></a>Board And Residence</b></h2>
  <p>One o&rsquo;clock on Saturday. The unemployed&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock
    on Saturday! Nothing more can be done this week, so you drag yourself wearily
    and despairingly  &ldquo;home,&rdquo; with the cheerful prospect of a penniless
    Saturday afternoon and evening and the long horrible Australian-city Sunday
    to drag through. One of the landlady&rsquo;s clutch&mdash;and she <i>is</i> an
    old hen&mdash;opens the door, exclaims:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Careless!&rdquo; and grins. You wait an anxious minute, to
    postpone the disappointment which you feel by instinct is coming, and then
    ask hopelessly whether there are any letters for you.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing for you, Mr Careless.&rdquo; Then in answer
    to the unspoken question, &ldquo;The postman&rsquo;s been, but there&rsquo;s
    nothing for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You hang up your hat in the stuffy little passage, and start upstairs, when, &ldquo;Oh,
    Mr Careless, mother wants to know if you&rsquo;ve had yer dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You haven&rsquo;t, but you say you have. You are empty enough inside, but
    the emptiness is filled up, as it were, with the wrong sort of hungry vacancy&mdash;gnawing
    anxiety. You haven&rsquo;t any stomach for the warm, tasteless mess which
    has been &ldquo;kep&rsquo;  &rsquo;ot&rdquo; for you in a cold stove. You
    feel just physically tired enough to go to your room, lie down on the bed,
    and snatch twenty minutes&rsquo; rest from that terrible unemployed restlessness
    which, you know, is sure to drag you to your feet to pace the room or tramp
    the pavement even before your bodily weariness has nearly left you. So you
    start up the narrow, stuffy little flight of steps called the &ldquo;stairs.&rdquo; Three
    small doors open from the landing&mdash;a square place of about four feet
    by four. The first door is yours; it is open, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Decided odour of bedroom dust and fluff, damped and kneaded with cold soap-suds.
    Rear view of a girl covered with a damp, draggled, dirt-coloured skirt, which
    gapes at the waistband from the &ldquo;body,&rdquo; disclosing a good glimpse
    of soiled stays (ribs burst), and yawns behind over a decidedly dirty white
    petticoat, the slit of which last, as she reaches forward and backs out convulsively,
    half opens and then comes together in an unsatisfactory, startling, tantalizing
    way, and allows a hint of a red flannel under-something. The frayed ends
    of the skirt lie across a hopelessly-burst pair of elastic-sides which rest
    on their inner edges&mdash;toes out&mdash;and jerk about in a seemingly undecided
    manner. She is damping and working up the natural layer on the floor with
    a piece of old flannel petticoat dipped occasionally in a bucket which stands
    by her side, containing about a quart of muddy water. She looks round and
    exclaims, &ldquo;Oh, did you want to come in, Mr Careless?&rdquo; Then she
    says she&rsquo;ll be done in a minute; furthermore she remarks that if you
    want to come in you won&rsquo;t be in her road. You don&rsquo;t&mdash;you
    go down to the dining-room&mdash;parlour&mdash;sitting-room&mdash;nursery&mdash;and
    stretch yourself on the sofa in the face of the painfully-evident disapproval
    of the landlady.</p>
  <p>You have been here, say, three months, and are only about two weeks behind.
    The landlady still says, &ldquo;Good morning, Mr Careless,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good
    evening, Mr Careless,&rdquo; but there is an unpleasant accent on the &ldquo;Mr,&rdquo; and
    a still more unpleasantly pronounced stress on the &ldquo;morning&rdquo; or &ldquo;evening.&rdquo; While
    your money lasted you paid up well and regularly&mdash;sometimes in advance&mdash;and
    dined out most of the time; but that doesn&rsquo;t count now.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes pass, and then the landlady&rsquo;s disapproval becomes manifest
    and aggressive. One of the little girls, a sharp-faced little larrikiness,
    who always wears a furtive grin of cunning&mdash;it seems as though it were
    born with her, and is perhaps more a misfortune than a fault&mdash;comes
    in and says please she wants to tidy up.</p>
  <p>So you get up and take your hat and go out again to look for a place to
    rest in&mdash;to try not to think.</p>
  <p>You <i>wish</i> you could get away up-country. You also wish you were dead.</p>
  <p>The landlady, Mrs Jones, is a widow, or grass-widow, Welsh, of course, and
    clannish; flat face, watery grey eyes, shallow, selfish, ignorant, and a
    hypocrite unconsciously&mdash;by instinct.</p>
  <p>But the worst of it is that Mrs Jones takes advantage of the situation to
    corner you in the passage when you want to get out, or when you come in tired,
    and talk. It amounts to about this: She has been fourteen years in this street,
    taking in boarders; everybody knows her; everybody knows Mrs Jones; her poor
    husband died six years ago (God rest his soul); she finds it hard to get
    a living these times; work, work, morning, noon, and night (talk, talk, talk,
    more likely). &ldquo;Do you know Mr Duff of the Labour Bureau?&rdquo; He
    has known her family for years; a very nice gentleman&mdash;a very nice gentleman
    indeed; he often stops at the gate to have a yarn with her on his way to
    the office (he must be hard up for a yarn). She doesn&rsquo;t know hardly
    nobody in this street; she never gossips; it takes her all her time to get
    a living; she can&rsquo;t be bothered with neighbours; it&rsquo;s always
    best to keep to yourself and keep neighbours at a distance. Would you believe
    it, Mr Careless, she has been two years in this house and hasn&rsquo;t said
    above a dozen words to the woman next door; she&rsquo;d just know her by
    sight if she saw her; as for the other woman she wouldn&rsquo;t know her
    from a crow. Mr Blank and Mrs Blank could tell you the same.... She always
    had gentlemen staying with her; she never had no cause to complain of one
    of them except once; they always treated her fair and honest. Here follows
    story about the exception; he, I gathered, was a journalist, and she could
    never depend on him. He seemed, from her statements, to have been decidedly
    erratic in his movements, mode of life and choice of climes. He evidently
    caused her a great deal of trouble and anxiety, and I felt a kind of sneaking
    sympathy for his memory. One young fellow stayed with her five years; he
    was, etc. She couldn&rsquo;t be hard on any young fellow that gets out of
    work; of course if he can&rsquo;t get it he can&rsquo;t pay; she can&rsquo;t
    get blood out of a stone; she couldn&rsquo;t turn him out in the street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got sons of my own, Mr Careless, I&rsquo;ve got sons of my own.&rdquo;...
    She is sure she always does her best to make her boarders comfortable, and
    if they want anything they&rsquo;ve only got to ask for it. The kettle is
    always on the stove if you want a cup of tea, and if you come home late at
    night and want a bit of supper you&rsquo;ve only got to go to the safe (which
    of us would dare?). She never locks it, she never did.... And then she begins
    about her wonderful kids, and it goes on hour after hour. Lord! it&rsquo;s
    enough to drive a man mad.</p>
  <p>We were recommended to this place on the day of our arrival by a young dealer
    in the furniture line, whose name was Moses&mdash;and he looked like it,
    but we didn&rsquo;t think of that at the time. He had Mrs Jones&rsquo;s card
    in his window, and he left the shop in charge of his missus and came round
    with us at once. He assured us that we couldn&rsquo;t do better than stay
    with her. He said she was a most respectable lady, and all her boarders were
    decent young fellows&mdash;gentlemen; she kept everything scrupulously clean,
    and kept the best table in town, and she&rsquo;d do for us (washing included)
    for eighteen shillings per week; she generally took the first week in advance.
    We asked him to have a beer&mdash;for the want of somebody else to ask&mdash;and
    after that he said that Mrs Jones was a kind, motherly body, and understood
    young fellows; and that we&rsquo;d be even more comfortable than in our own
    home; that we&rsquo;d be allowed to do as we liked&mdash;she wasn&rsquo;t
    particular; she wouldn&rsquo;t mind it a bit if we came home late once in
    a way&mdash;she was used to that, in fact; she liked to see young fellows
    enjoying themselves. We afterwards found out that he got so much on every
    boarder he captured. We also found out&mdash;after paying in advance&mdash;that
    her gentlemen generally sent out their white things to be done; she only
    did the coloured things, so we had to pay a couple of bob extra a week to
    have our &ldquo;biled&rdquo; rags and collars sent out and done; and after
    the first week they bore sad evidence of having been done on the premises
    by one of the frowsy daughters. But we paid all the same. And, good Lord!
    if she keeps the best table in town, we are curious to see the worst. When
    you go down to breakfast you find on the table in front of your chair a cold
    plate, with a black something&mdash;God knows what it looks like&mdash;in
    the centre of it. It eats like something scraped off the inside of a hide
    and burnt; and with this you have a cup of warm grey slush called a &ldquo;cup
    of tea.&rdquo; Dinner: A slice of alleged roast beef or boiled mutton, of
    no particular colour or taste; three new spuds, of which the largest is about
    the size of an ordinary hen&rsquo;s egg, the smallest that of a bantam&rsquo;s,
    and the middle one in between, and which eat soggy and have no taste to speak
    of, save that they are a trifle bitter; a dab of unhealthy-looking green
    something, which might be either cabbage leaves or turnip-tops, and a glass
    of water. The whole mess is lukewarm, including the water&mdash;it would
    all be better cold. Tea: A thin slice of the aforesaid alleged roast or mutton,
    and the pick of about six thin slices of stale bread&mdash;evidently cut
    the day before yesterday. This is the way Mrs Jones  &ldquo;does&rdquo; for
    us for eighteen shillings a week. The bread gave out at tea-time this evening,
    and a mild financial boarder tapped his plate with his knife, and sent the
    bread plate out to be replenished. It came back with <i>one</i> slice on
    it.</p>
  <p>The mild financial boarder, with desperate courage, is telling the landlady
    that he&rsquo;ll have to shift next week&mdash;it is too far to go to work,
    he cannot always get down in time; he is very sorry he has to go, he says;
    he is very comfortable here, but it can&rsquo;t be helped; anyway, as soon
    as he can get work nearer, he&rsquo;ll come back at once; also (oh, what
    cowards men are when women are concerned), he says he wishes she could shift
    and take a house down at the other end of the town. She says (at least here
    are some fragments of her gabble which we caught and shorthanded):  &ldquo;Well,
    I&rsquo;m very sorry to lose you, Mr Sampson, very sorry indeed; but of course
    if you must go, you must. Of course you can&rsquo;t be expected to walk that
    distance every morning, and you mustn&rsquo;t be getting to work late, and
    losing your place... Of course we could get breakfast an hour earlier if...
    well, as I said before, I&rsquo;m sorry to lose you and, indeed... You won&rsquo;t
    forget to come and see us... glad to see you at any time... Well, any way,
    if you ever want to come back, you know, your bed will be always ready for
    you, and you&rsquo;ll be treated just the same, and made just as comfortable&mdash;you
    won&rsquo;t forget that&rdquo; (he says he won&rsquo;t); &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t
    forget to come to dinner sometimes&rdquo; (he says he won&rsquo;t); &ldquo;and,
    of course... You know I always try... Don&rsquo;t forget to drop in sometimes...
    Well, anyway, if you ever do happen to hear of a decent young fellow who
    wants a good, clean, comfortable home, you&rsquo;ll be sure to send him to
    me, will you?&rdquo; (He says he will.) &ldquo;Well, of course, Mr Sampson,
    etc., etc., etc., and-so-on, and-so-on, and-so-on, and-so-on,...&rdquo; It&rsquo;s
    enough to give a man rats.</p>
  <p>He escapes, and we regard his departure very much as a gang of hopeless
    convicts might regard the unexpected liberation of one of their number.</p>
  <p>This is the sort of life that gives a man a God-Almighty longing to break
    away and take to the bush.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoDogsAndAFence"></a>Two Dogs And A Fence</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing makes a dog madder,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;than to
    have another dog come outside his fence and sniff and bark at him through
    the cracks when he can&rsquo;t get out. The other dog might be an entire
    stranger; he might be an old chum, and he mightn&rsquo;t bark&mdash;only
    sniff&mdash;but it makes no difference to the inside dog. The inside dog
    generally starts it, and the outside dog only loses his temper and gets wild
    because the inside dog has lost his and got mad and made such a stinking
    fuss about nothing at all; and then the outside dog barks back and makes
    matters a thousand times worse, and the inside dog foams at the mouth and
    dashes the foam about, and goes at it like a million steel traps.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000701h-images/page270.jpg" width="504" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell why the inside dog gets so wild about it in the
    first place, except, perhaps, because he thinks the outside dog has taken
    him at a disadvantage and is &lsquo;poking it at him;&rsquo; anyway, he gets
    madder the longer it lasts, and at last he gets savage enough to snap off
    his own tail and tear it to bits, because he can&rsquo;t get out and chew
    up that other dog; and, if he did get out, he&rsquo;d kill the other dog,
    or try to, even if it was his own brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes the outside dog only smiles and trots off; sometimes he
    barks back good-humouredly; sometimes he only just gives a couple of disinterested
    barks as if he isn&rsquo;t particular, but is expected, because of his dignity
    and doghood, to say something under the circumstances; and sometimes, if
    the outside dog is a little dog, he&rsquo;ll get away from that fence in
    a hurry on the first surprise, or, if he&rsquo;s a cheeky little dog, he&rsquo;ll
    first make sure that the inside dog can&rsquo;t get out, and then he&rsquo;ll
    have some fun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amusing to see a big dog, of the Newfoundland kind, sniffing
    along outside a fence with a broad, good-natured grin on his face all the
    time the inside dog is whooping away at the rate of thirty whoops a second,
    and choking himself, and covering himself with foam, and dashing the spray
    through the cracks, and jolting and jerking every joint in his body up to
    the last joint in his tail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes the inside dog is a little dog, and the smaller he is the
    more row he makes&mdash;but then he knows he&rsquo;s safe. And, sometimes,
    as I said before, the outside dog is a short-tempered dog who hates a row,
    and never wants to have a disagreement with anybody&mdash;like a good many
    peaceful men, who hate rows, and are always nice and civil and pleasant,
    in a nasty, unpleasant, surly, sneering sort of civil way that makes you
    want to knock their heads off; men who never start a row, but keep it going,
    and make it a thousand times worse when it&rsquo;s once started, just because
    they didn&rsquo;t start it&mdash;and keep on saying so, and that the other
    party did. The short-tempered outside dog gets wild at the other dog for
    losing his temper, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you making such a fuss about? What&rsquo;s the matter
    with you, anyway? Hey?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the inside dog says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who do you think you&rsquo;re talking to? You&mdash;! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; etc.,
    etc., etc.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the outside dog says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re worse than a flaming old slut!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they go at it, and you can hear them miles off, like a Chinese
    war&mdash;like a hundred great guns firing eighty blank cartridges a minute,
    till the outside dog is just as wild to get inside and eat the inside dog
    as the inside dog is to get out and disembowel him. Yet if those same two
    dogs were to meet casually outside they might get chummy at once, and be
    the best of friends, and swear everlasting mateship, and take each other
    home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MacquariesMate"></a>Macquarie&rsquo;s Mate</b></h2>
  <p>The chaps in the bar of Stiffner&rsquo;s shanty were talking about Macquarie,
    an absent shearer&mdash;who seemed, from their conversation, to be better
    known than liked by them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen Macquarie for ever so long,&rdquo; remarked Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks,
    after a pause. &ldquo;Wonder where he could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jail, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps&mdash;or hell,&rdquo; growled Barcoo. &ldquo;He
    ain&rsquo;t much loss, any road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath, yer right, Barcoo!&rdquo; interposed &ldquo;Sally&rdquo; Thompson. &ldquo;But,
    now I come to think of it, Old Awful Example there was a mate of his one
    time. Bless&rsquo;d if the old soaker ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; to life again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shaky, rag-and-dirt-covered framework of a big man rose uncertainly from
    a corner of the room, and, staggering forward, brushed the staring thatch
    back from his forehead with one hand, reached blindly for the edge of the
    bar with the other, and drooped heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Awful Example,&rdquo; demanded the shanty-keeper. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    up with you now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The drunkard lifted his head and glared wildly round with bloodshot eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you talk about him! <i>Drop it</i>,
    I say! Drop it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the matter with you now, anyway?&rdquo; growled
    the barman.  &ldquo;Got &rsquo;em again? Hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you talk about Macquarie! He&rsquo;s
    a mate of mine! Here! Gimme a drink!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what if he is a mate of yours?&rdquo; sneered Barcoo. &ldquo;It
    don&rsquo;t reflec&rsquo;  much credit on you&mdash;nor him neither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The logic contained in the last three words was unanswerable, and Awful
    Example was still fairly reasonable, even when rum oozed out of him at every
    pore. He gripped the edge of the bar with both hands, let his ruined head
    fall forward until it was on a level with his temporarily rigid arms, and
    stared blindly at the dirty floor; then he straightened himself up, still
    keeping his hold on the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of you chaps,&rdquo; he said huskily; &ldquo;one of you chaps,
    in this bar to-day, called Macquarie a scoundrel, and a loafer, and a blackguard,
    and&mdash;and a sneak and a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what if we did?&rdquo; said Barcoo, defiantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    all that, and a cheat into the bargain. And now, what are you going to do
    about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man swung sideways to the bar, rested his elbow on it, and his head
    on his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a sneak and he wasn&rsquo;t a liar,&rdquo; he
    said, in a quiet, tired tone; &ldquo;and Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a cheat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, old man, you needn&rsquo;t get your rag out about it,&rdquo; said
    Sally Thompson, soothingly. &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps we was a bit too hard
    on him; and it isn&rsquo;t altogether right, chaps, considerin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    not here. But, then, you know, Awful, he might have acted straight to you
    that was his mate. The meanest blank&mdash;if he is a man at all&mdash;will
    do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, to blazes with the old sot!&rdquo; shouted Barcoo. &ldquo;I gave
    my opinion about Macquarie, and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll stand to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a point for the defence,&rdquo; the
    old man went on, without heeding the interruptions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
    a point or two for the defence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; said Stiffner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the first place&mdash;in the first place, Macquarie never talked
    about no man behind his back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an uneasy movement, and a painful silence. Barcoo reached for
    his drink and drank slowly; he needed time to think&mdash;Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks
    studied his boots&mdash;Sally Thompson looked out at the weather&mdash;the
    shanty-keeper wiped the top of the bar very hard&mdash;and the rest shifted
    round and &ldquo;s&rsquo;posed they&rsquo;d try a game er cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barcoo set his glass down very softly, pocketed his hands deeply and defiantly,
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what of that? Macquarie was as strong as a bull, and the greatest
    bully on the river into the bargain. He could call a man a liar to his face&mdash;and
    smash his face afterwards. And he did it often, too, and with smaller men
    than himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a breath of relief in the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you want to make out that I&rsquo;m talking about a man behind
    his back?&rdquo;  continued Barcoo, threateningly, to Awful Example. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
    best take care, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a coward,&rdquo; remonstrated the drunkard,
    softly, but in an injured tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you, anyway?&rdquo; yelled the publican. &ldquo;What
    yer growling at? D&rsquo;ye want a row? Get out if yer can&rsquo;t be agreeable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boozer swung his back to the bar, hooked himself on by his elbows, and
    looked vacantly out of the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;another point for the defence,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    always best&mdash;it&rsquo;s always best to keep the last point to&mdash;the
    last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord! Well, out with it! <i>Out with it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Macquarie&rsquo;s dead</i>! That&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everyone moved uneasily: Sally Thompson turned the other side to the bar,
    crossed one leg behind the other, and looked down over his hip at the sole
    and heel of his elastic-side&mdash;the barman rinsed the glasses vigorously&mdash;Longbones
    shuffled and dealt on the top of a cask, and some of the others gathered
    round him and got interested&mdash;Barcoo thought he heard his horse breaking
    away, and went out to see to it, followed by Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks and a couple
    more, who thought that it might be one of their horses.</p>
  <p>Someone&mdash;a tall, gaunt, determined-looking bushman, with square features
    and haggard grey eyes&mdash;had ridden in unnoticed through the scrub to
    the back of the shanty and dismounted by the window.</p>
  <p>When Barcoo and the others re-entered the bar it soon became evident that
    Sally Thompson had been thinking, for presently he came to the general rescue
    as follows:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a blessed lot of tommy-rot about dead people in this
    world&mdash;a lot of damned old-woman nonsense. There&rsquo;s more sympathy
    wasted over dead and rotten skunks than there is justice done to straight,
    honest-livin&rsquo; chaps. I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve in this gory sentiment
    about the dead at the expense of the living. I b&rsquo;lieve in justice for
    the livin&rsquo;&mdash;and the dead too, for that matter&mdash;but justice
    for the livin&rsquo;. Macquarie was a bad egg, and it don&rsquo;t alter the
    case if he was dead a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was another breath of relief in the bar, and presently somebody said: &ldquo;Yer
    right, Sally!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good for you, Sally, old man!&rdquo; cried Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, taking
    it up.  &ldquo;An&rsquo;, besides, I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve Macquarie
    is dead at all. He&rsquo;s always dyin&rsquo;, or being reported dead, and
    then turnin&rsquo; up again. Where did you hear about it, Awful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Example ruefully rubbed a corner of his roof with the palm of his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot in what you say, Sally Thompson,&rdquo; he
    admitted slowly, totally ignoring Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks. &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve had enough of the old fool,&rdquo; yelled Barcoo. &ldquo;Macquarie
    was a spieler, and any man that ud be his mate ain&rsquo;t much better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, take a drink and dry up, yer ole hass!&rdquo; said the man
    behind the bar, pushing a bottle and glass towards the drunkard. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
    want a row?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man took the bottle and glass in his shaking bands and painfully
    poured out a drink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot in what Sally Thompson says,&rdquo; he went on,
    obstinately,  &ldquo;but&mdash;but,&rdquo; he added in a strained tone, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    another point that I near forgot, and none of you seemed to think of it&mdash;not
    even Sally Thompson nor&mdash;nor Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stiffner turned his back, and Barcoo spat viciously and impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drivelled the drunkard, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another
    point for&mdash;for the defence&mdash;of my mate, Macquarie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, out with it! Spit it out, for God&rsquo;s sake, or you&rsquo;ll
    bust!&rdquo; roared Stiffner. &ldquo;What the blazes is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>His mate&rsquo;s alive!</i>&rdquo; yelled the old man. &ldquo;Macquarie&rsquo;s
    mate&rsquo;s alive! That&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000701h-images/page322.jpg" width="486" height="750"></p>
  <p>He reeled back from the bar, dashed his glass and hat to the boards, gave
    his pants, a hitch by the waistband that almost lifted him off his feet,
    and tore at his shirt-sleeves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make a ring, boys,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;His mate&rsquo;s alive!
    Put up your hands, Barcoo! By God, his mate&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Someone had turned his horse loose at the rear and had been standing by
    the back door for the last five minutes. Now he slipped quietly in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep the old fool off, or he&rsquo;ll get hurt,&rdquo; snarled Barcoo.</p>
  <p>Stiffner jumped the counter. There were loud, hurried words of remonstrance,
    then some stump-splitting oaths and a scuffle, consequent upon an attempt
    to chuck the old man out. Then a crash. Stiffner and Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks
    were down, two others were holding Barcoo back, and someone had pinned Awful
    Example by the shoulders from behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; he yelled, too blind with passion to notice the
    movements of surprise among the men before him. &ldquo;Let me go! I&rsquo;ll
    smash&mdash;any man&mdash;that&mdash;that says a word again&rsquo; a mate
    of mine behind his back. Barcoo, I&rsquo;ll have your blood! Let me go! I&rsquo;ll,
    I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll&mdash; Who&rsquo;s holdin&rsquo; me? You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Macquarie, old mate!&rdquo; said a quiet voice.</p>
  <p>Barcoo thought he heard his horse again, and went out in a hurry. Perhaps
    he thought that the horse would get impatient and break loose if he left
    it any longer, for he jumped into the saddle and rode off.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShantyKeepersWife"></a>The Shanty-Keeper&rsquo;s
      Wife</b></h2>
  <p>There were about a dozen of us jammed into the coach, on the box seat and
    hanging on to the roof and tailboard as best we could. We were shearers,
    bagmen, agents, a squatter, a cockatoo, the usual joker&mdash;and one or
    two professional spielers, perhaps. We were tired and stiff and nearly frozen&mdash;too
    cold to talk and too irritable to risk the inevitable argument which an interchange
    of ideas would have led up to. We had been looking forward for hours, it
    seemed, to the pub where we were to change horses. For the last hour or two
    all that our united efforts had been able to get out of the driver was a
    grunt to the effect that it was &ldquo;&rsquo;bout a couple o&rsquo; miles.&rdquo; Then
    he said, or grunted, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t fur now,&rdquo; a couple
    of times, and refused to commit himself any further; he seemed grumpy about
    having committed himself that far.</p>
  <p>He was one of those men who take everything in dead earnest; who regard
    any expression of ideas outside their own sphere of life as trivial, or,
    indeed, if addressed directly to them, as offensive; who, in fact, are darkly
    suspicious of anything in the shape of a joke or laugh on the part of an
    outsider in their own particular dust-hole. He seemed to be always thinking,
    and thinking a lot; when his hands were not both engaged, he would tilt his
    hat forward and scratch the base of his skull with his little finger, and
    let his jaw hang. But his intellectual powers were mostly concentrated on
    a doubtful swingle-tree, a misfitting collar, or that there bay or piebald
    (on the off or near side) with the sore shoulder.</p>
  <p>Casual letters or papers, to be delivered on the road, were matters which
    troubled him vaguely, but constantly&mdash;like the abstract ideas of his
    passengers.</p>
  <p>The joker of our party was a humourist of the dry order, and had been slyly
    taking rises out of the driver for the last two or three stages. But the
    driver only brooded. He wasn&rsquo;t the one to tell you straight if you
    offended him, or if he fancied you offended him, and thus gain your respect,
    or prevent a misunderstanding which would result in life-long enmity. He
    might meet you in after years when you had forgotten all about your trespass&mdash;if
    indeed you had ever been conscious of it&mdash;and &ldquo;stoush&rdquo; you
    unexpectedly on the ear.</p>
  <p>Also you might regard him as your friend, on occasion, and yet he would
    stand by and hear a perfect stranger tell you the most outrageous lies, to
    your hurt, and know that the stranger was telling lies, and never put you
    up to it. It would never enter his head to do so. It wouldn&rsquo;t be any
    affair of his&mdash;only an abstract question.</p>
  <p>It grew darker and colder. The rain came as if the frozen south were spitting
    at your face and neck and hands, and our feet grew as big as camel&rsquo;s,
    and went dead, and we might as well have stamped the footboards with wooden
    legs for all the feeling we got into ours. But they were more comfortable
    that way, for the toes didn&rsquo;t curl up and pain so much, nor did our
    corns stick out so hard against the leather, and shoot.</p>
  <p>We looked out eagerly for some clearing, or fence, or light&mdash;some sign
    of the shanty where we were to change horses&mdash;but there was nothing
    save blackness all round. The long, straight, cleared road was no longer
    relieved by the ghostly patch of light, far ahead, where the bordering tree-walls
    came together in perspective and framed the ether. We were down in the bed
    of the bush.</p>
  <p>We pictured a haven of rest with a suspended lamp burning in the frosty
    air outside and a big log fire in a cosy parlour off the bar, and a long
    table set for supper. But this is a land of contradictions; wayside shanties
    turn up unexpectedly and in the most unreasonable places, and are, as likely
    as not, prepared for a banquet when you are not hungry and can&rsquo;t wait,
    and as cold and dark as a bushman&rsquo;s grave when you are and can.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the driver said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re there now.&rdquo; He said this
    as if he had driven us to the scaffold to be hanged, and was fiercely glad
    that he&rsquo;d got us there safely at last. We looked but saw nothing; then
    a light appeared ahead and seemed to come towards us; and presently we saw
    that it was a lantern held up by a man in a slouch hat, with a dark bushy
    beard, and a three-bushel bag around his shoulders. He held up his other
    hand, and said something to the driver in a tone that might have been used
    by the leader of a search party who had just found the body. The driver stopped
    and then went on slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; we asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The publican&rsquo;s wife is sick,&rdquo; somebody said, &ldquo;and
    he wants us to come quietly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The usual little slab and bark shanty was suggested in the gloom, with a
    big bark stable looming in the background. We climbed down like so many cripples.
    As soon as we began to feel our legs and be sure we had the right ones and
    the proper allowance of feet, we helped, as quietly as possible, to take
    the horses out and round to the stable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is she very bad?&rdquo; we asked the publican, showing as much concern
    as we could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in a subdued voice of a rough man who had spent
    several anxious, sleepless nights by the sick bed of a dear one. &ldquo;But,
    God willing, I think we&rsquo;ll pull her through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus encouraged we said, sympathetically: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry
    to trouble you, but I suppose we could manage to get a drink and a bit to
    eat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to eat in the
    house, and I&rsquo;ve only got rum and milk. You can have that if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of the pilgrims broke out here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well of all the pubs,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush-sh-sh!&rdquo; said the publican.</p>
  <p>The pilgrim scowled and retired to the rear. You can&rsquo;t express your
    feelings freely when there&rsquo;s a woman dying close handy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, who says rum and milk?&rdquo; asked the joker, in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; said the publican, and disappeared into the little
    front passage.</p>
  <p>Presently a light showed through a window, with a scratched and fly-bitten
    B and A on two panes, and a mutilated R on the third, which was broken. A
    door opened, and we sneaked into the bar. It was like having drinks after
    hours where the police are strict and independent.</p>
  <p>When we came out the driver was scratching his head and looking at the harness
    on the verandah floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fellows &rsquo;ll have ter put in the time for an hour or so.
    The horses is out back somewheres,&rdquo; and he indicated the interior of
    Australia with a side jerk of his head, &ldquo;and the boy ain&rsquo;t back
    with &rsquo;em yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But dash it all,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;me and my mate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the publican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long are the horses likely to be?&rdquo; we asked the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Might be three or four hours. It&rsquo;s
    all accordin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;me and my mate wanter
    catch the train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush-sh-sh!&rdquo; from the publican in a fierce whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, boss,&rdquo; said the joker, &ldquo;can you let us have beds,
    then? I don&rsquo;t want to freeze here all night, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I can do that, but some of
    you will have to sleep double and some of you&rsquo;ll have to take it out
    of the sofas, and one or two &rsquo;ll have to make a shakedown on the floor.
    There&rsquo;s plenty of bags in the stable, and you&rsquo;ve got rugs and
    coats with you. Fix it up amongst yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here!&rdquo; interrupted the Pilgrim, desperately, &ldquo;we
    can&rsquo;t afford to wait! We&rsquo;re only &lsquo;battlers&rsquo;, me and
    my mate, pickin&rsquo; up crumbs by the wayside. We&rsquo;ve got to catch
    the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the publican, savagely. &ldquo;You fool, didn&rsquo;t
    I tell you my missus was bad? I won&rsquo;t have any noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; protested the Pilgrim, &ldquo;we must catch
    the train at Dead Camel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch my boot presently,&rdquo; said the publican, with
    a savage oath, &ldquo;and go further than Dead Camel. I won&rsquo;t have
    my missus disturbed for you or any other man! Just you shut up or get out,
    and take your blooming mate with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We lost patience with the Pilgrim and sternly took him aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, for God&rsquo;s sake, hold your jaw,&rdquo; we said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
    you got any consideration at all? Can&rsquo;t you see the man&rsquo;s wife
    is ill&mdash;dying perhaps&mdash;and he nearly worried off his head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Pilgrim and his mate were scraggy little bipeds of the city push variety,
    so they were suppressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; yawned the joker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to roost
    on a stump all night. I&rsquo;m going to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be eighteenpence each,&rdquo; hinted the landlord. &ldquo;You
    can settle now if you like to save time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We took the hint, and had another drink. I don&rsquo;t know how we  &ldquo;fixed
    it up amongst ourselves,&rdquo; but we got settled down somehow. There was
    a lot of mysterious whispering and scuffling round by the light of a couple
    of dirty greasy bits of candle. Fortunately we dared not speak loud enough
    to have a row, though most of us were by this time in the humour to pick
    a quarrel with a long-lost brother.</p>
  <p>The Joker got the best bed, as good-humoured, good-natured chaps generally
    do, without seeming to try for it. The growler of the party got the floor
    and chaff bags, as selfish men mostly do&mdash;without seeming to try for
    it either. I took it out of one of the &ldquo;sofas&rdquo;, or rather that
    sofa took it out of me. It was short and narrow and down by the head, with
    a leaning to one corner on the outside, and had more nails and bits of gin-case
    than original sofa in it.</p>
  <p>I had been asleep for three seconds, it seemed, when somebody shook me by
    the shoulder and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take yer seats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When I got out, the driver was on the box, and the others were getting rum
    and milk inside themselves (and in bottles) before taking their seats.</p>
  <p>It was colder and darker than before, and the South Pole seemed nearer,
    and pretty soon, but for the rum, we should have been in a worse fix than
    before.</p>
  <p>There was a spell of grumbling. Presently someone said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe them horses was lost at all. I was round behind
    the stable before I went to bed, and seen horses there; and if they wasn&rsquo;t
    them same horses there, I&rsquo;ll eat &rsquo;em raw!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would yer?&rdquo; said the driver, in a disinterested tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the passenger. Then, with a sudden ferocity, &ldquo;and
    you too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The driver said nothing. It was an abstract question which didn&rsquo;t
    interest him.</p>
  <p>We saw that we were on delicate ground, and changed the subject for a while.
    Then someone else said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where his missus was? I didn&rsquo;t see any signs of her
    about, or any other woman about the place, and we was pretty well all over
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must have kept her in the stable,&rdquo; suggested the Joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she wasn&rsquo;t, for Scotty and that chap on the roof was there
    after bags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She might have been in the loft,&rdquo; reflected the Joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no loft,&rdquo; put in a voice from the top of the coach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Mister&mdash;Mister man,&rdquo; said the Joker suddenly to
    the driver,  &ldquo;Was his missus sick at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; replied the driver. &ldquo;She might have been. He
    said so, anyway. I ain&rsquo;t got no call to call a man a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said the cannibalistic individual to the driver,
    in the tone of a man who has made up his mind for a row, &ldquo;has that
    shanty-keeper got a wife at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe he has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is she living with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t&mdash;if yer wanter know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno. How am I to know? She left him three or four years ago.
    She was in Sydney last time I heard of her. It ain&rsquo;t no affair of mine,
    anyways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is there any woman about the place at all, driver?&rdquo; inquired
    a professional wanderer reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not that I knows on. There useter be a old black gin come
    pottering round sometimes, but I ain&rsquo;t seen her lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And excuse me, driver, but is there anyone round there at all?&rdquo;  enquired
    the professional wanderer, with the air of a conscientious writer, collecting
    material for an Australian novel from life, with an eye to detail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the driver&mdash;and recollecting that he was expected
    to be civil and obliging to his employers&rsquo; patrons, he added in surly
    apology, &ldquo;Only the boss and the stableman, that I knows of.&rdquo; Then
    repenting of the apology, he asserted his manhood again, and asked, in a
    tone calculated to risk a breach of the peace, &ldquo;Any more questions,
    gentlemen&mdash;while the shop&rsquo;s open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a long pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; asked the Pilgrim appealingly, &ldquo;was them horses
    lost at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the driver. &ldquo;He said they was. He&rsquo;s
    got the looking after them. It was nothing to do with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twelve drinks at sixpence a drink&rdquo;&mdash;said the Joker, as
    if calculating to himself&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s six bob, and, say on
    an average, four shouts&mdash;that&rsquo;s one pound four. Twelve beds at
    eighteenpence a bed&mdash;that&rsquo;s eighteen shillings; and say ten bob
    in various drinks and the stuff we brought with us, that&rsquo;s two pound
    twelve. That publican didn&rsquo;t do so bad out of us in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We wondered how much the driver got out of it, but thought it best not to
    ask him.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We didn&rsquo;t say much for the rest of the journey. There was the usual
    man who thought as much and knew all about it from the first, but he wasn&rsquo;t
    appreciated. We suppressed him. One or two wanted to go back and &ldquo;stoush&rdquo; that
    landlord, and the driver stopped the coach cheerfully at their request; but
    they said they&rsquo;d come across him again and allowed themselves to be
    persuaded out of it. It made us feel bad to think how we had allowed ourselves
    to be delayed, and robbed, and had sneaked round on tiptoe, and how we had
    sat on the inoffensive Pilgrim and his mate, and all on account of a sick
    wife who didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
  <p>The coach arrived at Dead Camel in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and
    distrust, and we spread ourselves over the train and departed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHeroofRedclay"></a>The Hero of Redclay</b></h2>
  <p>The &ldquo;boss-over-the-board&rdquo; was leaning with his back to the wall
    between two shoots, reading a reference handed to him by a green-hand applying
    for work as picker-up or woolroller&mdash;a shed rouseabout. It was terribly
    hot. I was slipping past to the rolling-tables, carrying three fleeces to
    save a journey; we were only supposed to carry two. The boss stopped me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got three fleeces there, young man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that I had just slipped a light ragged fleece into
    the belly-wool and &ldquo;bits&rdquo; basket, I felt deeply injured, and
    righteously and fiercely indignant at being pulled up. It was a fearfully
    hot day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I catch you carrying three fleeces again,&rdquo; said the boss
    quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the sack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it now if you like,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>He nodded. &ldquo;You can go on picking-up in this man&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he
    said to the jackeroo, whose reference showed him to be a non-union man&mdash;a  &ldquo;free-labourer&rdquo;,
    as the pastoralists had it, or, in plain shed terms, &ldquo;a blanky scab&rdquo;.
    He was now in the comfortable position of a non-unionist in a union shed
    who had jumped into a sacked man&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p>Somehow the lurid sympathy of the men irritated me worse than the boss-over-the-board
    had done. It must have been on account of the heat, as Mitchell says. I was
    sick of the shed and the life. It was within a couple of days of cut-out,
    so I told Mitchell&mdash;who was shearing&mdash;that I&rsquo;d camp up the
    Billabong and wait for him; got my cheque, rolled up my swag, got three days&rsquo;  tucker
    from the cook, said so-long to him, and tramped while the men were in the
    shed.</p>
  <p>I camped at the head of the Billabong where the track branched, one branch
    running to Bourke, up the river, and the other out towards the Paroo&mdash;and
    hell.</p>
  <p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the third morning Mitchell came along with his cheque
    and his swag, and a new sheep-pup, and his quiet grin; and I wasn&rsquo;t
    too pleased to see that he had a shearer called &ldquo;the Lachlan&rdquo; with
    him.</p>
  <p>The Lachlan wasn&rsquo;t popular at the shed. He was a brooding, unsociable
    sort of man, and it didn&rsquo;t make any difference to the chaps whether
    he had a union ticket or not. It was pretty well known in the shed&mdash;there
    were three or four chaps from the district he was reared in&mdash;that he&rsquo;d
    done five years hard for burglary. What surprised me was that Jack Mitchell
    seemed thick with him; often, when the Lachlan was sitting brooding and smoking
    by himself outside the hut after sunset, Mitchell would perch on his heels
    alongside him and yarn. But no one else took notice of anything Mitchell
    did out of the common.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better camp with us till the cool of the evening,&rdquo; said Mitchell
    to the Lachlan, as they slipped their swags. &ldquo;Plenty time for you to
    start after sundown, if you&rsquo;re going to travel to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So the Lachlan was going to travel all night and on a different track. I
    felt more comfortable, and put the billy on. I did not care so much what
    he&rsquo;d been or had done, but I was green and soft yet, and his presence
    embarrassed me.</p>
  <p>They talked shearing, sheds, tracks, and a little unionism&mdash;the Lachlan
    speaking in a quiet voice and with a lot of sound, common sense, it seemed
    to me. He was tall and gaunt, and might have been thirty, or even well on
    in the forties. His eyes were dark brown and deep set, and had something
    of the dead-earnest sad expression you saw in the eyes of union leaders and
    secretaries&mdash;the straight men of the strikes of &rsquo;90 and &rsquo;91.
    I fancied once or twice I saw in his eyes the sudden furtive look of the &ldquo;bad
    egg&rdquo; when a mounted trooper is spotted near the shed; but perhaps this
    was prejudice. And with it all there was about the Lachlan something of the
    man who has lost all he had and the chances of all he was ever likely to
    have, and is past feeling, or caring, or flaring up&mdash;past getting mad
    about anything&mdash;something, all the same, that warned men not to make
    free with him.</p>
  <p>He and Mitchell fished along the Billabong all the afternoon; I fished a
    little, and lay about the camp and read. I had an instinct that the Lachlan
    saw I didn&rsquo;t cotton on to his camping with us, though he wasn&rsquo;t
    the sort of man to show what he saw or felt. After tea, and a smoke at sunset,
    he shouldered his swag, nodded to me as if I was an accidental but respectful
    stranger at a funeral that belonged to him, and took the outside track. Mitchell
    walked along the track with him for a mile or so, while I poked round and
    got some boughs down for a bed, and fed and studied the collie pup that Jack
    had bought from the shearers&rsquo; cook.</p>
  <p>I saw them stop and shake hands out on the dusty clearing, and they seemed
    to take a long time about it; then Mitchell started back, and the other began
    to dwindle down to a black peg and then to a dot on the sandy plain, that
    had just a hint of dusk and dreamy far-away gloaming on it between the change
    from glaring day to hard, bare, broad moonlight.</p>
  <p>I thought Mitchell was sulky, or had got the blues, when he came back; he
    lay on his elbow smoking, with his face turned from the camp towards the
    plain. After a bit I got wild&mdash;if Mitchell was going to go on like that
    he might as well have taken his swag and gone with the Lachlan. I don&rsquo;t
    know exactly what was the matter with me that day, and at last I made up
    my mind to bring the thing to a head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem mighty thick with the Lachlan,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with that?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;It
    ain&rsquo;t the first felon I&rsquo;ve been on speaking terms with. I borrowed
    half-a-caser off a murderer once, when I was in a hole and had no one else
    to go to; and the murderer hadn&rsquo;t served his time, neither. I&rsquo;ve
    got nothing against the Lachlan, except that he&rsquo;s a white man and bears
    a faint family resemblance to a certain branch of my tribe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I rolled out my swag on the boughs, got my pipe, tobacco, and matches handy
    in the crown of a spare hat, and lay down.</p>
  <p>Mitchell got up, re-lit his pipe at the fire, and mooned round for a while,
    with his hands behind him, kicking sticks out of the road, looking out over
    the plain, down along the Billabong, and up through the mulga branches at
    the stars; then he comforted the pup a bit, shoved the fire together with
    his toe, stood the tea-billy on the coals, and came and squatted on the sand
    by my head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe! I&rsquo;ll tell you a yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; fire away! Has it got anything to do with the Lachlan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the Lachlan now; but it&rsquo;s
    about a chap he knew. Don&rsquo;t you ever breathe a word of this to the
    Lachlan or anyone, or he&rsquo;ll get on to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve been a good many things in my time. I did a deal
    of house-painting at one time; I was a pretty smart brush hand, and made
    money at it. Well, I had a run of work at a place called Redclay, on the
    Lachlan side. You know the sort of town&mdash;two pubs, a general store,
    a post office, a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, a police station, a branch bank,
    and a dozen private weatherboard boxes on piles, with galvanized-iron tops,
    besides the humpies. There was a paper there, too, called the &lsquo;Redclay
    Advertiser&rsquo; (with which was incorporated the &lsquo;Geebung Chronicle&rsquo;),
    and a Roman Catholic church, a Church of England, and a Wesleyan chapel.
    Now you see more of private life in the house-painting line than in any other&mdash;bar
    plumbing and gasfitting; but I&rsquo;ll tell you about my house-painting
    experiences some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a young chap named Jack Drew editing the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  then.
    He belonged to the district, but had been sent to Sydney to a grammar school
    when he was a boy. He was between twenty-five and thirty; had knocked round
    a good deal, and gone the pace in Sydney. He got on as a boy reporter on
    one of the big dailies; he had brains and could write rings round a good
    many, but he got in with a crowd that called themselves &lsquo;Bohemians&rsquo;,
    and the drink got a hold on him. The paper stuck to him as long as it could
    (for the sake of his brains), but they had to sack him at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He went out back, as most of them do, to try and work out their salvation,
    and knocked round amongst the sheds. He &lsquo;picked up&rsquo; in one shed
    where I was shearing, and we carried swags together for a couple of months.
    Then he went back to the Lachlan side, and prospected amongst the old fields
    round there with his elder brother Tom, who was all there was left of his
    family. Tom, by the way, broke his heart digging Jack out of a cave in a
    drive they were working, and died a few minutes after the rescue. (See &ldquo;When
    the Sun Went Down&rdquo;, in &ldquo;While the Billy Boils&rdquo;) But that&rsquo;s
    another yarn. Jack Drew had a bad spree after that; then he went to Sydney
    again, got on his old paper, went to the dogs, and a Parliamentary push that
    owned some city fly-blisters and country papers sent him up to edit the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  at
    two quid a week. He drank again, and no wonder&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know
    what it is to run a &lsquo;Geebung Advocate&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mudgee Budgee
    Chronicle&rsquo;, and live there. He was about the same build as the Lachlan,
    but stouter, and had something the same kind of eyes; but he was ordinarily
    as careless and devil-may-care as the Lachlan is grumpy and quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a doctor there, called Dr. Lebinski. They said he was a
    Polish exile. He was fifty or sixty, a tall man, with the set of an old soldier
    when he stood straight; but he mostly walked with his hands behind him, studying
    the ground. Jack Drew caught that trick off him towards the end. They were
    chums in a gloomy way, and kept to themselves&mdash;they were the only two
    men with brains in that town. They drank and fought the drink together. The
    Doctor was too gloomy and impatient over little things to be popular. Jack
    Drew talked too straight in the paper, and in spite of his proprietors&mdash;about
    pub spieling and such things&mdash;and was too sarcastic in his progress
    committee, town council, and toady reception reports. The Doctor had a hawk&rsquo;s
    nose, pointed grizzled beard and moustache, and steely-grey eyes with a haunted
    look in them sometimes (especially when he glanced at you sideways), as if
    he loathed his fellow men, and couldn&rsquo;t always hide it; or as if you
    were the spirit of morphia or opium, or a dead girl he&rsquo;d wronged in
    his youth&mdash;or whatever his devil was, beside drink. He was clever, and
    drink had brought him down to Redclay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bank manager was a heavy snob named Browne. He complained of
    being a bit dull of hearing in one ear&mdash;after you&rsquo;d yelled at
    him three or four times; sometimes I&rsquo;ve thought he was as deaf as a
    book-keeper in both. He had a wife and youngsters, but they were away on
    a visit while I was working in Redclay. His niece&mdash;or, rather, his wife&rsquo;s
    niece&mdash;a girl named Ruth Wilson, did the housekeeping. She was an orphan,
    adopted by her aunt, and was general slavey and scape-goat to the family&mdash;especially
    to the brats, as is often the case. She was rather pretty, and lady-like,
    and kept to herself. The women and girls called her Miss Wilson, and didn&rsquo;t
    like her. Most of the single men&mdash;and some of the married ones, perhaps&mdash;were
    gone on her, but hadn&rsquo;t the brains or the pluck to bear up and try
    their luck. I was gone worse than any, I think, but had too much experience
    or common sense. She was very good to me&mdash;used to hand me out cups of
    tea and plates of sandwiches, or bread and butter, or cake, mornings and
    afternoons the whole time I was painting the bank. The Doctor had known her
    people and was very kind to her. She was about the only woman&mdash;for she
    was more woman than girl&mdash;that he&rsquo;d brighten up and talk for.
    Neither he nor Jack Drew were particularly friendly with Browne or his push.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The banker, the storekeeper, one of the publicans, the butcher (a
    popular man with his hands in his pockets, his hat on the back of his head,
    and nothing in it), the postmaster, and his toady, the lightning squirter,
    were the scrub-aristocracy. The rest were crawlers, mostly pub spielers and
    bush larrikins, and the women were hags and larrikinesses. The town lived
    on cheque-men from the surrounding bush. It was a nice little place, taking
    it all round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember a ball at the local town hall, where the scrub aristocrats
    took one end of the room to dance in and the ordinary scum the other. It
    was a saving in music. Some day an Australian writer will come along who&rsquo;ll
    remind the critics and readers of Dickens, Carlyle, and Thackeray mixed,
    and he&rsquo;ll do justice to these little customs of ours in the little
    settled-district towns of Democratic Australia. This sort of thing came to
    a head one New Year&rsquo;s Night at Redclay, when there was a &lsquo;public&rsquo; ball
    and peace on earth and good will towards all men&mdash;mostly on account
    of a railway to Redclay being surveyed. We were all there. They&rsquo;d got
    the Doc. out of his shell to act as M.C.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the aristocrats was the daughter of the local storekeeper;
    she belonged to the lawn-tennis clique, and they <i>were</i> select. For
    some reason or other&mdash;because she looked upon Miss Wilson as a slavey,
    or on account of a fancied slight, or the heat working on ignorance, or on
    account of something that comes over girls and women that no son of sin can
    account for&mdash;this Miss Tea-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-sugar tossed her head and
    refused Miss Wilson&rsquo;s hand in the first set and so broke the ladies&rsquo; chain
    and the dance. Then there was a to-do. The Doctor held up his hand to stop
    the music, and said, very quietly, that he must call upon Miss So-and-so
    to apologise to Miss Wilson&mdash;or resign the chair. After a lot of fuss
    the girl did apologise in a snappy way that was another insult. Jack Drew
    gave Miss Wilson his arm and marched her off without a word&mdash;I saw she
    was almost crying. Some one said, &lsquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go on with the dance.&rsquo; The
    Doctor flashed round on them, but they were too paltry for him, so he turned
    on his heel and went out without a word. But I was beneath them again in
    social standing, so there was nothing to prevent me from making a few well-chosen
    remarks on things in general&mdash;which I did; and broke up that ball, and
    broke some heads afterwards, and got myself a good deal of hatred and respect,
    and two sweethearts; and lost all the jobs I was likely to get, except at
    the bank, the Doctor&rsquo;s, and the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day it was raining&mdash;general rain for a week. Rain, rain,
    rain, over ridge and scrub and galvanised iron and into the dismal creeks.
    I&rsquo;d done all my inside work, except a bit under the Doctor&rsquo;s
    verandah, where he&rsquo;d been having some patching and altering done round
    the glass doors of his surgery, where he consulted his patients. I didn&rsquo;t
    want to lose time. It was a Monday and no day for the Royal, and there was
    no dust, so it was a good day for varnishing. I took a pot and brush and
    went along to give the Doctor&rsquo;s doors a coat of varnish. The Doctor
    and Drew were inside with a fire, drinking whisky and smoking, but I didn&rsquo;t
    know that when I started work. The rain roared on the iron roof like the
    sea. All of a sudden it held up for a minute, and I heard their voices. The
    doctor had been shouting on account of the rain, and forgot to lower his
    voice. &lsquo;Look here, Jack Drew,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there are only
    two things for you to do if you have any regard for that girl; one is to
    stop this&rsquo; (the liquor I suppose he meant) &lsquo;and pull yourself
    together; and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do that&mdash;I know men.
    The other is to throw up the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s doing
    you no good&mdash;and clear out.&rsquo; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; says
    Drew. &lsquo;Then shoot yourself,&rsquo; said the Doctor. &lsquo;(There&rsquo;s
    another flask in the cupboard). You know what this hole is like.... She&rsquo;s
    a good true girl&mdash;a girl as God made her. I knew her father and mother,
    and I tell you, Jack, I&rsquo;d sooner see her dead than....&rsquo; The roof
    roared again. I felt a bit delicate about the business and didn&rsquo;t like
    to disturb them, so I knocked off for the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a week before that I was down in the bed of the Redclay Creek
    fishing for &lsquo;tailers&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d been getting on all right with
    the housemaid at the &lsquo;Royal&rsquo;&mdash;she used to have plates of
    pudding and hot pie for me on the big gridiron arrangement over the kitchen
    range; and after the third tuck-out I thought it was good enough to do a
    bit of a bear-up in that direction. She mentioned one day, yarning, that
    she liked a stroll by the creek sometimes in the cool of the evening. I thought
    she&rsquo;d be off that day, so I said I&rsquo;d go for a fish after I&rsquo;d
    knocked off. I thought I might get a bite. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t catch Lizzie&mdash;tell
    you about that some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was Sunday. I&rsquo;d been fishing for Lizzie about an hour when
    I saw a skirt on the bank out of the tail of my eye&mdash;and thought I&rsquo;d
    got a bite, sure. But I was had. It was Miss Wilson strolling along the bank
    in the sunset, all by her pretty self. She was a slight girl, not very tall,
    with reddish frizzled hair, grey eyes, and small, pretty features. She spoke
    as if she had more brains than the average, and had been better educated.
    Jack Drew was the only young man in Redclay she could talk to, or who could
    talk to a girl like her; and that was the whole trouble in a nutshell. The
    newspaper office was next to the bank, and I&rsquo;d seen her hand cups of
    tea and cocoa over the fence to his office window more than once, and sometimes
    they yarned for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Good morning, Mr. Mitchell.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Good morning, Miss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some girls I can&rsquo;t talk to like I&rsquo;d talk
    to other girls. She asked me if I&rsquo;d caught any fish, and I said, &lsquo;No,
    Miss.&rsquo; She asked me if it wasn&rsquo;t me down there fishing with Mr.
    Drew the other evening, and I said, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;it was me.&rsquo; Then
    presently she asked me straight if he was fishing down the creek that afternoon?
    I guessed they&rsquo;d been down fishing for each other before. I said, &lsquo;No,
    I thought he was out of town.&rsquo; I knew he was pretty bad at the Royal.
    I asked her if she&rsquo;d like to have a try with my line, but she said
    No, thanks, she must be going; and she went off up the creek. I reckoned
    Jack Drew had got a bite and landed her. I felt a bit sorry for her, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next Saturday evening after the rainy Monday at the Doctor&rsquo;s,
    I went down to fish for tailers&mdash;and Lizzie. I went down under the banks
    to where there was a big she-oak stump half in the water, going quietly,
    with an idea of not frightening the fish. I was just unwinding the line from
    my rod, when I noticed the end of another rod sticking out from the other
    side of the stump; and while I watched it was dropped into the water. Then
    I heard a murmur, and craned my neck round the back of the stump to see who
    it was. I saw the back view of Jack Drew and Miss Wilson; he had his arm
    round her waist, and her head was on his shoulder. She said, &lsquo;I <i>will</i> trust
    you, Jack&mdash;I know you&rsquo;ll give up the drink for my sake. And I&rsquo;ll
    help you, and we&rsquo;ll be so happy!&rsquo; or words in that direction.
    A thunderstorm was coming on. The sky had darkened up with a great blue-black
    storm-cloud rushing over, and they hadn&rsquo;t noticed it. I didn&rsquo;t
    mind, and the fish bit best in a storm. But just as she said &lsquo;happy&rsquo; came
    a blinding flash and a crash that shook the ridges, and the first drops came
    peltering down. They jumped up and climbed the bank, while I perched on the
    she-oak roots over the water to be out of sight as they passed. Half way
    to the town I saw them standing in the shelter of an old stone chimney that
    stood alone. He had his overcoat round her and was sheltering her from the
    wind....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke-oh, Joe. The tea&rsquo;s stewing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell got up, stretched himself, and brought the billy and pint-pots
    to the head of my camp. The moon had grown misty. The plain horizon had closed
    in. A couple of boughs, hanging from the gnarled and blasted timber over
    the billabong, were the perfect shapes of two men hanging side by side. Mitchell
    scratched the back of his neck and looked down at the pup curled like a glob
    of mud on the sand in the moonlight, and an idea struck him. He got a big
    old felt hat he had, lifted his pup, nose to tail, fitted it in the hat,
    shook it down, holding the hat by the brim, and stood the hat near the head
    of his doss, out of the moonlight. &ldquo;He might get moonstruck,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want that pup to be a genius.&rdquo; The
    pup seemed perfectly satisfied with this new arrangement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a smoke,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he added,
    with a sly grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to make up the yarn as I go along,
    and it&rsquo;s hard work. It seems to begin to remind me of yarns your grandmother
    or aunt tells of things that happened when she was a girl&mdash;but those
    yarns are true. You won&rsquo;t have to listen long now; I&rsquo;m well on
    into the second volume.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the storm I hurried home to the tent&mdash;I was batching with
    a carpenter. I changed my clothes, made a fire in the fire-bucket with shavings
    and ends of soft wood, boiled the billy, and had a cup of coffee. It was
    Saturday night. My mate was at the Royal; it was cold and dismal in the tent,
    and there was nothing to read, so I reckoned I might as well go up to the
    Royal, too, and put in the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had to pass the Bank on the way. It was the usual weatherboard
    box with a galvanised iron top&mdash;four rooms and a passage, and a detached
    kitchen and wash-house at the back; the front room to the right (behind the
    office) was the family bedroom, and the one opposite it was the living room.
    The &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  office was next door. Jack Drew camped in a
    skillion room behind his printing office, and had his meals at the Royal.
    I noticed the storm had taken a sheet of iron off the skillion, and supposed
    he&rsquo;d sleep at the Royal that night. Next to the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo; office
    was the police station (still called the Police Camp) and the Courthouse.
    Next was the Imperial Hotel, where the scrub aristocrats went. There was
    a vacant allotment on the other side of the Bank, and I took a short cut
    across this to the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d forgotten to pull down the blind of the dining-room
    window, and I happened to glance through and saw she had Jack Drew in there
    and was giving him a cup of tea. He had a bad cold, I remember, and I suppose
    his health had got precious to her, poor girl. As I glanced she stepped to
    the window and pulled down the blind, which put me out of face a bit&mdash;though,
    of course, she hadn&rsquo;t seen me. I was rather surprised at her having
    Jack in there, till I heard that the banker, the postmaster, the constable,
    and some others were making a night of it at the Imperial, as they&rsquo;d
    been doing pretty often lately&mdash;and went on doing till there was a blow-up
    about it, and the constable got transferred Out Back. I used to drink my
    share then. We smoked and played cards and yarned and filled &rsquo;em up
    again at the Royal till after one in the morning. Then I started home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d finished giving the Bank a couple of coats of stone-colour
    that week, and was cutting in in dark colour round the spouting, doors, and
    window-frames that Saturday. My head was pretty clear going home, and as
    I passed the place it struck me that I&rsquo;d left out the only varnish
    brush I had. I&rsquo;d been using it to give the sashes a coat of varnish
    colour, and remembered that I&rsquo;d left it on one of the window-sills&mdash;the
    sill of her bedroom window, as it happened. I knew I&rsquo;d sleep in next
    day, Sunday, and guessed it would be hot, and I didn&rsquo;t want the varnish
    tool to get spoiled; so I reckoned I&rsquo;d slip in through the side gate,
    get it, and take it home to camp and put it in oil. The window sash was jammed,
    I remember, and I hadn&rsquo;t been able to get it up more than a couple
    of inches to paint the runs of the sash. The grass grew up close under the
    window, and I slipped in quietly. I noticed the sash was still up a couple
    of inches. Just as I grabbed the brush I heard low voices inside&mdash;Ruth
    Wilson&rsquo;s and Jack Drew&rsquo;s&mdash;in her room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The surprise sent about a pint of beer up into my throat in a lump.
    I tip-toed away out of there. Just as I got clear of the gate I saw the banker
    being helped home by a couple of cronies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went home to the camp and turned in, but I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.
    I lay think&mdash;think&mdash;thinking, till I thought all the drink out
    of my head. I&rsquo;d brought a bottle of ale home to last over Sunday, and
    I drank that. It only made matters worse. I didn&rsquo;t know how I felt&mdash;I&mdash;well,
    I felt as if I was as good a man as Jack Drew&mdash;I&mdash;you see I&rsquo;ve&mdash;you
    might think it soft&mdash;but I loved that girl, not as I&rsquo;ve been gone
    on other girls, but in the old-fashioned, soft, honest, hopeless, far-away
    sort of way; and now, to tell the straight truth, I thought I might have
    had her. You lose a thing through being too straight or sentimental, or not
    having enough cheek; and another man comes along with more brass in his blood
    and less sentimental rot and takes it up&mdash;and the world respects him;
    and you feel in your heart that you&rsquo;re a weaker man than he is. Why,
    part of the time I must have felt like a man does when a better man runs
    away with his wife. But I&rsquo;d drunk a lot, and was upset and lonely-feeling
    that night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but Redclay had a tremendous sensation next day! Jack Drew, of
    all the men in the world, had been caught in the act of robbing the bank.
    According to Browne&rsquo;s account in court and in the newspapers, he returned
    home that night at about twelve o&rsquo;clock (which I knew was a lie, for
    I saw him being helped home nearer two) and immediately retired to rest (on
    top of the quilt, boots and all, I suppose). Some time before daybreak he
    was roused by a fancied noise (I suppose it was his head swelling); he rose,
    turned up a night lamp (he hadn&rsquo;t lit it, I&rsquo;ll swear), and went
    through the dining-room passage and office to investigate (for whisky and
    water). He saw that the doors and windows were secure, returned to bed, and
    fell asleep again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is something in a deaf person&rsquo;s being roused easily.
    I know the case of a deaf chap who&rsquo;d start up at a step or movement
    in the house when no one else could hear or feel it; keen sense of vibration,
    I reckon. Well, just at daybreak (to shorten the yarn) the banker woke suddenly,
    he said, and heard a crack like a shot in the house. There was a loose flooring-board
    in the passage that went off like a pistol-shot sometimes when you trod on
    it; and I guess Jack Drew trod on it, sneaking out, and he weighed nearly
    twelve stone. If the truth were known, he probably heard Browne poking round,
    tried the window, found the sash jammed, and was slipping through the passage
    to the back door. Browne got his revolver, opened his door suddenly, and
    caught Drew standing between the girl&rsquo;s door (which was shut) and the
    office door, with his coat on his arm and his boots in his hands. Browne
    covered him with his revolver, swore he&rsquo;d shoot if he moved, and yelled
    for help. Drew stood a moment like a man stunned; then he rushed Browne,
    and in the struggle the revolver went off, and Drew got hit in the arm. Two
    of the mounted troopers&mdash;who&rsquo;d been up looking to the horses for
    an early start somewhere&mdash;rushed in then, and took Drew. He had nothing
    to say. What could he say? He couldn&rsquo;t say he was a blackguard who&rsquo;d
    taken advantage of a poor unprotected girl because she loved him. They found
    the back door unlocked, by the way, which was put down to the burglar; of
    course Browne couldn&rsquo;t explain that he came home too muddled to lock
    doors after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the girl? She shrieked and fell when the row started, and they
    found her like a log on the floor of her room after it was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They found in Jack&rsquo;s overcoat pocket a parcel containing a
    cold chisel, small screw-wrench, file, and one or two other things that he&rsquo;d
    bought that evening to tinker up the old printing press. I knew that, because
    I&rsquo;d lent him a hand a few nights before, and he told me he&rsquo;d
    have to get the tools. They found some scratches round the key-hole and knob
    of the office door that I&rsquo;d made myself, scraping old splashes of paint
    off the brass and hand-plate so as to make a clean finish. Oh, it taught
    me the value of circumstantial evidence! If I was judge I wouldn&rsquo;t
    give a man till the &lsquo;risin&rsquo; av the coort&rsquo; on it, any more
    than I would on the bare word of the noblest woman breathing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the preliminary examination Jack Drew said he was guilty. But
    it seemed that, according to law, he couldn&rsquo;t be guilty until after
    he was committed. So he was committed for trial at the next Quarter Sessions.
    The excitement and gabble were worse than the Dean case, or Federation, and
    sickened me, for they were all on the wrong track. You lose a lot of life
    through being behind the scenes. But they cooled down presently to wait for
    the trial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They thought it best to take the girl away from the place where she&rsquo;d
    got the shock; so the Doctor took her to his house, where he had an old housekeeper
    who was as deaf as a post&mdash;a first class recommendation for a housekeeper
    anywhere. He got a nurse from Sydney to attend on Ruth Wilson, and no one
    except he and the nurse were allowed to go near her. She lay like dead, they
    said, except when she had to be held down raving; brain fever, they said,
    brought on by the shock of the attempted burglary and pistol shot. Dr. Lebinski
    had another doctor up from Sydney at his own expense, but nothing could save
    her&mdash;and perhaps it was as well. She might have finished her life in
    a lunatic asylum. They were going to send her to Sydney, to a brain hospital;
    but she died a week before the Sessions. She was right-headed for an hour,
    they said, and asking all the time for Jack. The Doctor told her he was all
    right and was coming&mdash;and, waiting and listening for him, she died.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The case was black enough against Drew now. I knew he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have the pluck to tell the truth now, even if he was that sort of a man.
    I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so I spoke to the Doctor straight. I caught
    him coming out of the Royal, and walked along the road with him a bit. I
    suppose he thought I was going to show cause why his doors ought to have
    another coat of varnish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hallo, Mitchell!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s painting?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Doctor!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what am I going to do about
    this business?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What business?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jack Drew&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He looked at me sideways&mdash;the swift haunted look. Then he walked
    on without a word, for half a dozen yards, hands behind, and studying the
    dust. Then he asked, quite quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know the truth?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a dozen yards this time; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see him in the morning, and see you afterwards,&rsquo; and
    he shook hands and went on home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next day he came to me where I was doing a job on a step ladder.
    He leaned his elbow against the steps for a moment, and rubbed his hand over
    his forehead, as if it ached and he was tired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him, Mitchell,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You were mates with him, once, Out Back?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know Drew&rsquo;s hand-writing?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should think so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He laid a leaf from a pocketbook on top of the steps. I read the
    message written in pencil:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To Jack Mitchell.&mdash;We were mates on the track. If you
    know anything of my affair, don&rsquo;t give it away.&mdash;J. D.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tore the leaf and dropped the bits into the paint-pot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Doctor,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but
    is there no way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;None.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He turned away, wearily. He&rsquo;d knocked about so much over the
    world that he was past bothering about explaining things or being surprised
    at anything. But he seemed to get a new idea about me; he came back to the
    steps again, and watched my brush for a while, as if he was thinking, in
    a broody sort of way, of throwing up his practice and going in for house-painting.
    Then he said, slowly and deliberately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If she&mdash;the girl&mdash;had lived, we might have tried
    to fix it up quietly. That&rsquo;s what I was hoping for. I don&rsquo;t see
    how we can help him now, even if he&rsquo;d let us. He would never have spoken,
    anyway. We must let it go on, and after the trial I&rsquo;ll go to Sydney
    and see what I can do at headquarters. It&rsquo;s too late now. You understand,
    Mitchell?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve thought it out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he went away towards the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what could Jack Drew or we do? Study it out whatever way you
    like. There was only one possible chance to help him, and that was to go
    to the judge; and the judge that happened to be on that circuit was a man
    who&mdash;even if he did listen to the story and believe it&mdash;would have
    felt inclined to give Jack all the more for what he was charged with. Browne
    was out of the question. The day before the trial I went for a long walk
    in the bush, but couldn&rsquo;t hit on anything that the Doctor might have
    missed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was in the court&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t keep away. The Doctor was
    there too. There wasn&rsquo;t so much of a change in Jack as I expected,
    only he had the gaol white in his face already. He stood fingering the rail,
    as if it was the edge of a table on a platform and he was a tired and bored
    and sleepy chairman waiting to propose a vote of thanks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The only well-known man in Australia who reminds me of Mitchell is Bland
    Holt, the comedian. Mitchell was about as good hearted as Bland Holt, too,
    under it all; but he was bigger and roughened by the bush. But he seemed
    to be taking a heavy part to-night, for, towards the end of his yarn, he
    got up and walked up and down the length of my bed, dropping the sentences
    as he turned towards me. He&rsquo;d folded his arms high and tight, and his
    face in the moonlight was&mdash;well, it was very different from his careless
    tone of voice. He was like&mdash;like an actor acting tragedy and talking
    comedy. Mitchell went on, speaking quickly&mdash;his voice seeming to harden:</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The charge was read out&mdash;I forget how it went&mdash;it sounded
    like a long hymn being given out. Jack pleaded guilty. Then he straightened
    up for the first time and looked round the court, with a calm, disinterested
    look&mdash;as if we were all strangers and he was noting the size of the
    meeting. And&mdash;it&rsquo;s a funny world, ain&rsquo;t it?&mdash;everyone
    of us shifted or dropped his eyes, just as if we were the felons and Jack
    the judge. Everyone except the Doctor; he looked at Jack and Jack looked
    at him. Then the Doctor smiled&mdash;I can&rsquo;t describe it&mdash;and
    Drew smiled back. It struck me afterwards that I should have been in that
    smile. Then the Doctor did what looked like a strange thing&mdash;stood like
    a soldier with his hands to Attention. I&rsquo;d noticed that, whenever he&rsquo;d
    made up his mind to do a thing, he dropped his hands to his sides: it was
    a sign that he couldn&rsquo;t be moved. Now he slowly lifted his hand to
    his forehead, palm out, saluted the prisoner, turned on his heel, and marched
    from the court-room. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s boozin&rsquo;  again,&rsquo; someone
    whispered. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s got a touch of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My oath, he&rsquo;s ratty!&rsquo; said someone else. One of the traps
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arder in the car-rt!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The judge gave it to Drew red-hot on account of the burglary being
    the cause of the girl&rsquo;s death and the sorrow in a respectable family;
    then he gave him five years&rsquo; hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It gave me a lot of confidence in myself to see the law of the land
    barking up the wrong tree, while only I and the Doctor and the prisoner knew
    it. But I&rsquo;ve found out since then that the law is often the only one
    that knows it&rsquo;s barking up the wrong tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Mitchell prepared to turn in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about Drew,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he did his time, or most of it. The Doctor went to headquarters,
    but either a drunken doctor from a geebung town wasn&rsquo;t of much account,
    or they weren&rsquo;t taking any romance just then at headquarters. So the
    Doctor came back, drank heavily, and one frosty morning they found him on
    his back on the bank of the creek, with his face like note-paper where the
    blood hadn&rsquo;t dried on it, and an old pistol in his hand&mdash;that
    he&rsquo;d used, they said, to shoot Cossacks from horseback when he was
    a young dude fighting in the bush in Poland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lay silent a good while; then he yawned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s a lonely track the Lachlan&rsquo;s tramping
    to-night; but I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s got his ghosts with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d been puzzling for the last half-hour to think where I&rsquo;d
    met or heard of Jack Drew; now it flashed on me that I&rsquo;d been told
    that Jack Drew was the Lachlan&rsquo;s real name.</p>
  <p>I lay awake thinking a long time, and wished Mitchell had kept his yarn
    for daytime. I felt&mdash;well, I felt as if the Lachlan&rsquo;s story should
    have been played in the biggest theatre in the world, by the greatest actors,
    with music for the intervals and situations&mdash;deep, strong music, such
    as thrills and lifts a man from his boot soles. And when I got to sleep I
    hadn&rsquo;t slept a moment, it seemed to me, when I started wide awake to
    see those infernal hanging boughs with a sort of nightmare idea that the
    Lachlan hadn&rsquo;t gone, or had come back, and he and Mitchell had hanged
    themselves sociably&mdash;Mitchell for sympathy and the sake of mateship.</p>
  <p>But Mitchell was sleeping peacefully, in spite of a path of moonlight across
    his face&mdash;and so was the pup.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDarlingRiver"></a>The Darling River</b></h2>
  <p>The Darling&mdash;which is either a muddy gutter or a second Mississippi&mdash;is
    about six times as long as the distance, in a straight line, from its head
    to its mouth. The state of the river is vaguely but generally understood
    to depend on some distant and foreign phenomena to which bushmen refer in
    an off-hand tone of voice as &ldquo;the Queenslan&rsquo; rains&rdquo;, which
    seem to be held responsible, in a general way, for most of the out-back trouble.</p>
  <p>It takes less than a year to go up stream by boat to Walgett or Bourke in
    a dry season; but after the first three months the passengers generally go
    ashore and walk. They get sick of being stuck in the same sort of place,
    in the same old way; they grow weary of seeing the same old &ldquo;whaler&rdquo;  drop
    his swag on the bank opposite whenever the boat ties up for wood; they get
    tired of lending him tobacco, and listening to his ideas, which are limited
    in number and narrow in conception.</p>
  <p>It shortens the journey to get out and walk; but then you will have to wait
    so long for your luggage&mdash;unless you hump it with you.</p>
  <p>We heard of a man who determined to stick to a Darling boat and travel the
    whole length of the river. He was a newspaper man. He started on his voyage
    of discovery one Easter in flood-time, and a month later the captain got
    bushed between the Darling and South Australian border. The waters went away
    before he could find the river again, and left his boat in a scrub. They
    had a cargo of rations, and the crew stuck to the craft while the tucker
    lasted; when it gave out they rolled up their swags and went to look for
    a station, but didn&rsquo;t find one. The captain would study his watch and
    the sun, rig up dials and make out courses, and follow them without success.
    They ran short of water, and didn&rsquo;t smell any for weeks; they suffered
    terrible privations, and lost three of their number, <i>not</i> including
    the newspaper liar. There are even dark hints considering the drawing of
    lots in connection with something too terrible to mention. They crossed a
    thirty-mile plain at last, and sighted a black gin. She led them to a boundary
    rider&rsquo;s hut, where they were taken in and provided with rations and
    rum.</p>
  <p>Later on a syndicate was formed to explore the country and recover the boat;
    but they found her thirty miles from the river and about eighteen from the
    nearest waterhole deep enough to float her, so they left her there. She&rsquo;s
    there still, or else the man that told us about it is the greatest liar Out
    Back.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Imagine the hull of a North Shore ferry boat, blunted a little at the ends
    and cut off about a foot below the water-line, and parallel to it, then you
    will have something shaped somewhat like the hull of a Darling mud-rooter.
    But the river boat is much stronger. The boat we were on was built and repaired
    above deck after the different ideas of many bush carpenters, of whom the
    last seemed by his work to have regarded the original plan with a contempt
    only equalled by his disgust at the work of the last carpenter but one. The
    wheel was boxed in, mostly with round sapling-sticks fastened to the frame
    with bunches of nails and spikes of all shapes and sizes, most of them bent.
    The general result was decidedly picturesque in its irregularity, but dangerous
    to the mental welfare of any passenger who was foolish enough to try to comprehend
    the design; for it seemed as though every carpenter had taken the opportunity
    to work in a little abstract idea of his own.</p>
  <p>The way they &ldquo;dock&rdquo; a Darling River boat is beautiful for its
    simplicity. They choose a place where there are two stout trees about the
    boat&rsquo;s length apart, and standing on a line parallel to the river.
    They fix pulley-blocks to the trees, lay sliding planks down into the water,
    fasten a rope to one end of the steamer, and take the other end through the
    block attached to the tree and thence back aboard a second steamer; then
    they carry a rope similarly from the other end through the block on the second
    tree, and aboard a third boat. At a given signal one boat leaves for Wentworth,
    and the other starts for the Queensland border. The consequence is that craft
    number one climbs the bank amid the cheers of the local loafers, who congregate
    and watch the proceedings with great interest and approval. The crew pitch
    tents, and set to work on the hull, which looks like a big, rough shallow
    box.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We once travelled on the Darling for a hundred miles or so on a boat called
    the &lsquo;Mud Turtle&rsquo;&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s what <i>we</i> called
    her. She might reasonably have haunted the Mississippi fifty years ago. She
    didn&rsquo;t seem particular where she went, or whether she started again
    or stopped for good after getting stuck. Her machinery sounded like a chapter
    of accidents and was always out of order, but she got along all the same,
    provided the steersman kept her off the bank.</p>
  <p>Her skipper was a young man, who looked more like a drover than a sailor,
    and the crew bore a greater resemblance to the unemployed than to any other
    body we know of, except that they looked a little more independent. They
    seemed clannish, too, with an unemployed or free-labour sort of isolation.
    We have an idea that they regarded our personal appearance with contempt.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Above Louth we picked up a &ldquo;whaler&rdquo;, who came aboard for the
    sake of society and tobacco. Not that he hoped to shorten his journey; he
    had no destination. He told us many reckless and unprincipled lies, and gave
    us a few ornamental facts. One of them took our fancy, and impressed us&mdash;with
    its beautiful simplicity, I suppose. He said: &ldquo;Some miles above where
    the Darlin&rsquo;  and the Warrygo runs inter each other, there&rsquo;s a
    billygong runnin&rsquo; right across between the two rivers and makin&rsquo; a
    sort of tryhangular hyland; &rsquo;n&rsquo; I can tel&rsquo;yer a funny thing
    about it.&rdquo; Here he paused to light his pipe. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he
    continued, impressively, jerking the match overboard, &ldquo;when the Darlin&rsquo;s
    up, and the Warrygo&rsquo;s <i>low</i>, the billygong runs from the Darlin&rsquo; into
    the <i>Warrygo</i>; <i>and</i>, when the Warrygo&rsquo;s up &rsquo;n&rsquo; the
    Darlin&rsquo;s down, the waters runs <i>from</i> the Warrygo &rsquo;n&rsquo; inter
    the Darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What could be more simple?</p>
  <p>The steamer was engaged to go up a billabong for a load of shearers from
    a shed which was cutting out; and first it was necessary to tie up in the
    river and discharge the greater portion of the cargo in order that the boat
    might safely negotiate the shallow waters. A local fisherman, who volunteered
    to act as pilot, was taken aboard, and after he was outside about a pint
    of whisky he seemed to have the greatest confidence in his ability to take
    us to hell, or anywhere else&mdash;at least, he said so. A man was sent ashore
    with blankets and tucker to mind the wool, and we crossed the river, butted
    into the anabranch, and started out back. Only the Lord and the pilot know
    how we got there. We travelled over the bush, through its branches sometimes,
    and sometimes through grass and mud, and every now and then we struck something
    that felt and sounded like a collision. The boat slid down one hill, and  &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; a
    stump at the bottom with a force that made every mother&rsquo;s son bite
    his tongue or break a tooth.</p>
  <p>The shearers came aboard next morning, with their swags and two cartloads
    of boiled mutton, bread, &ldquo;brownie&rdquo;, and tea and sugar. They numbered
    about fifty, including the rouseabouts. This load of sin sank the steamer
    deeper into the mud; but the passengers crowded over to port, by request
    of the captain, and the crew poked the bank away with long poles. When we
    began to move the shearers gave a howl like the yell of a legion of lost
    souls escaping from down below. They gave three cheers for the rouseabouts&rsquo; cook,
    who stayed behind; then they cursed the station with a mighty curse. They
    cleared a space on deck, had a jig, and afterwards a fight between the shearers&rsquo; cook
    and his assistant. They gave a mighty bush whoop for the Darling when the
    boat swung into that grand old gutter, and in the evening they had a general
    all-round time. We got back, and the crew had to reload the wool without
    assistance, for it bore the accursed brand of a &ldquo;freedom-of-contract&rdquo; shed.</p>
  <p>We slept, or tried to sleep, that night on the ridge of two wool bales laid
    with the narrow sides up, having first been obliged to get ashore and fight
    six rounds with a shearer for the privilege of roosting there. The live cinders
    from the firebox went up the chimney all night, and fell in showers on deck.
    Every now and again a spark would burn through the &ldquo;Wagga rug&rdquo; of
    a sleeping shearer, and he&rsquo;d wake suddenly and get up and curse. It
    was no use shifting round, for the wind was all ways, and the boat steered
    north, south, east, and west to humour the river. Occasionally a low branch
    would root three or four passengers off their wool bales, and they&rsquo;d
    get up and curse in chorus. The boat started two snags; and towards daylight
    struck a stump. The accent was on the stump. A wool bale went overboard,
    and took a swag and a dog with it; then the owner of the swag and dog and
    the crew of the boat had a swearing match between them. The swagman won.</p>
  <p>About daylight we stretched our cramped limbs, extricated one leg from between
    the wool bales, and found that the steamer was just crayfishing away from
    a mud island, where she had tied up for more wool. Some of the chaps had
    been ashore and boiled four or five buckets of tea and coffee. Shortly after
    the boat had settled down to work again an incident came along. A rouseabout
    rose late, and, while the others were at breakfast, got an idea into his
    head that a good &ldquo;sloosh&rdquo; would freshen him up; so he mooched
    round until he found a big wooden bucket with a rope to it. He carried the
    bucket aft of the wheel. The boat was butting up stream for all she was worth,
    and the stream was running the other way, of course, and about a hundred
    times as fast as a train. The jackeroo gave the line a turn round his wrist;
    before anyone could see him in time to suppress him, he lifted the bucket,
    swung it to and fro, and dropped it cleverly into the water.</p>
  <p>This delayed us for nearly an hour. A couple of men jumped into the row
    boat immediately and cast her adrift. They picked up the jackeroo about a
    mile down the river, clinging to a snag, and when we hauled him aboard he
    looked like something the cat had dragged in, only bigger. We revived him
    with rum and got him on his feet; and then, when the captain and crew had
    done cursing him, he rubbed his head, went forward, and had a look at the
    paddle; then he rubbed his head again, thought, and remarked to his mates:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it lucky I didn&rsquo;t dip that bucket <i>for&rsquo;ard</i> the
    wheel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This remark struck us forcibly. We agreed that it was lucky&mdash;for him;
    but the captain remarked that it was damned unlucky for the world, which,
    he explained, was over-populated with fools already.</p>
  <p>Getting on towards afternoon we found a barge loaded with wool and tied
    up to a tree in the wilderness. There was no sign of a man to be seen, nor
    any sign, except the barge, that a human being had ever been there. The captain
    took the craft in tow, towed it about ten miles up the stream, and left it
    in a less likely place than where it was before.</p>
  <p>Floating bottles began to be more frequent, and we knew by that same token
    that we were nearing &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Luck!&rdquo;&mdash;Bourke, we mean.
    And this reminds us.</p>
  <p>When the Brewarrina people observe a more than ordinary number of bottles
    floating down the river, they guess that Walgett is on the spree; when the
    Louth chaps see an unbroken procession of dead marines for three or four
    days they know that Bourke&rsquo;s drunk. The poor, God-abandoned &ldquo;whaler&rdquo; sits
    in his hungry camp at sunset and watches the empty symbols of Hope go by,
    and feels more God-forgotten than ever&mdash;and thirstier, if possible&mdash;and
    gets a great, wide, thirsty, quaking, empty longing to be up where those
    bottles come from. If the townspeople knew how much misery they caused by
    their thoughtlessness they would drown their dead marines, or bury them,
    but on no account allow them to go drifting down the river, and stirring
    up hells in the bosoms of less fortunate fellow-creatures.</p>
  <p>There came a man from Adelaide to Bourke once, and he collected all the
    empty bottles in town, stacked them by the river, and waited for a boat.
    What he wanted them for the legend sayeth not, but the people reckoned he
    had a &ldquo;private still&rdquo;, or something of that sort, somewhere down
    the river, and were satisfied. What he came from Adelaide for, or whether
    he really did come from there, we do not know. All the Darling bunyips are
    supposed to come from Adelaide. Anyway, the man collected all the empty bottles
    he could lay his hands on, and piled them on the bank, where they made a
    good show. He waited for a boat to take his cargo, and, while waiting, he
    got drunk. That excited no comment. He stayed drunk for three weeks, but
    the townspeople saw nothing unusual in that. In order to become an object
    of interest in their eyes, and in that line, he would have had to stay drunk
    for a year and fight three times a day&mdash;oftener, if possible&mdash;and
    lie in the road in the broiling heat between whiles, and be walked on by
    camels and Afghans and free-labourers, and be locked up every time he got
    sober enough to smash a policeman, and try to hang himself naked, and be
    finally squashed by a loaded wool team.</p>
  <p>But while he drank the Darling rose, for reasons best known to itself, and
    floated those bottles off. They strung out and started for the Antarctic
    Ocean, with a big old wicker-worked demijohn in the lead.</p>
  <p>For the first week the down-river men took no notice; but after the bottles
    had been drifting past with scarcely a break for a fortnight or so, they
    began to get interested. Several whalers watched the procession until they
    got the jimjams by force of imagination, and when their bodies began to float
    down with the bottles, the down-river people got anxious.</p>
  <p>At last the Mayor of Wilcannia wired Bourke to know whether Dibbs or Parkes
    was dead, or democracy triumphant, or if not, wherefore the jubilation? Many
    telegrams of a like nature were received during that week, and the true explanation
    was sent in reply to each. But it wasn&rsquo;t believed, and to this day
    Bourke has the name of being the most drunken town on the river.</p>
  <p>After dinner a humorous old hard case mysteriously took us aside and said
    he had a good yarn which we might be able to work up. We asked him how, but
    he winked a mighty cunning wink and said that he knew all about us. Then
    he asked us to listen. He said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was an old feller down the Murrumbidgee named Kelly. He was
    a bit gone here. One day Kelly was out lookin&rsquo; for some sheep, when
    he got lost. It was gettin&rsquo; dark. Bymeby there came an old crow in
    a tree overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kel-ley, you&rsquo;re lo-o-st! Kel-ley, you&rsquo;re lo-o-st!&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know I am,&rsquo; sez Kelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fol-ler me, fol-ler me,&rsquo; sez the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right y&rsquo;are,&rsquo; sez Kelly, with a jerk of his arm. &lsquo;Go
    ahead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So the crow went on, and Kelly follered, an&rsquo; bymeby he found
    he was on the right track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometime after Kelly was washin&rsquo; sheep (this was when we useter
    wash the sheep instead of the wool). Kelly was standin&rsquo; on the platform
    with a crutch in his hand landin&rsquo; the sheep, when there came a old
    crow in the tree overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kelly, I&rsquo;m hun-gry! Kel-ley, I&rsquo;m hun-ger-ry!&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alright,&rsquo; sez Kelly; &lsquo;be up at the hut about dinner
    time &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll sling you out something.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Drown&mdash;a&mdash;sheep! Drown&mdash;a&mdash;sheep, Kel-ley,&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blanked if I do,&rsquo; sez Kelly. &lsquo;If I drown a sheep
    I&rsquo;ll have to pay for it, be-God!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t find yer when yer lost agin,&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if yer will,&rsquo; says Kelly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    take blanky good care I won&rsquo;t get lost again, to be found by a gory
    ole crow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>There are a good many fishermen on the Darling. They camp along the banks
    in all sorts of tents, and move about in little box boats that will only
    float one man. The fisherman is never heavy. He is mostly a withered little
    old madman, with black claws, dirty rags (which he never changes), unkempt
    hair and beard, and a &ldquo;ratty&rdquo; expression. We cannot say that
    we ever saw him catch a fish, or even get a bite, and we certainly never
    saw him offer any for sale.</p>
  <p>He gets a dozen or so lines out into the stream, with the shore end fastened
    to pegs or roots on the bank, and passed over sticks about four feet high,
    stuck in the mud; on the top of these sticks he hangs bullock bells, or substitutes&mdash;jam
    tins with stones fastened inside to bits of string. Then he sits down and
    waits. If the cod pulls the line the bell rings.</p>
  <p>The fisherman is a great authority on the river and fish, but has usually
    forgotten everything else, including his name. He chops firewood for the
    boats sometimes, but it isn&rsquo;t his profession&mdash;he&rsquo;s a fisherman.
    He is only sane on points concerning the river, though he has all the fisherman&rsquo;s
    eccentricities. Of course he is a liar.</p>
  <p>When he gets his camp fixed on one bank it strikes him he ought to be over
    on the other, or at a place up round the bend, so he shifts. Then he reckons
    he was a fool for not stopping where he was before. He never dies. He never
    gets older, or drier, or more withered looking, or dirtier, or loonier&mdash;because
    he can&rsquo;t. We cannot imagine him as ever having been a boy, or even
    a youth. We cannot even try to imagine him as a baby. He is an animated mummy,
    who used to fish on the Nile three thousand years ago, and catch nothing.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We forgot to mention that there are wonderfully few wrecks on the Darling.
    The river boats seldom go down&mdash;their hulls are not built that way&mdash;and
    if one did go down it wouldn&rsquo;t sink far. But, once down, a boat is
    scarcely ever raised again; because, you see, the mud silts up round it and
    over it, and glues it, as it were, to the bottom of the river. Then the forty-foot
    alligators&mdash;which come down with the &ldquo;Queenslan&rsquo; rains&rdquo;,
    we suppose&mdash;root in the mud and fill their bellies with sodden flour
    and drowned deck-hands.</p>
  <p>They tried once to blow up a wreck with dynamite because it (the wreck)
    obstructed navigation; but they blew the bottom out of the river instead,
    and all the water went through. The Government have been boring for it ever
    since. I saw some of the bores myself&mdash;there is one at Coonamble.</p>
  <p>There is a yarn along the Darling about a cute Yankee who was invited up
    to Bourke to report on a proposed scheme for locking the river. He arrived
    towards the end of a long and severe drought, and was met at the railway
    station by a deputation of representative bushmen, who invited him, in the
    first place, to accompany them to the principal pub&mdash;which he did. He
    had been observed to study the scenery a good deal while coming up in the
    train, but kept his conclusions to himself. On the way to the pub he had
    a look at the town, and it was noticed that he tilted his hat forward very
    often, and scratched the back of his head a good deal, and pondered a lot;
    but he refrained from expressing an opinion&mdash;even when invited to do
    so. He guessed that his opinions wouldn&rsquo;t do much good, anyway, and
    he calculated that they would keep till he got back &ldquo;over our way&rdquo;&mdash;by
    which it was reckoned he meant the States.</p>
  <p>When they asked him what he&rsquo;d have, he said to Watty the publican:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon you can build me your national drink. I guess I&rsquo;ll
    try it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A long colonial was drawn for him, and he tried it. He seemed rather startled
    at first, then he looked curiously at the half-empty glass, set it down very
    softly on the bar, and leaned against the same and fell into a reverie; from
    which he roused himself after a while, with a sorrowful jerk of his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Show me this river of yourn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They led him to the Darling, and he had a look at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this your river?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied, apprehensively.</p>
  <p>He tilted his hat forward till the brim nearly touched his nose, scratched
    the back of his long neck, shut one eye, and looked at the river with the
    other. Then, after spitting half a pint of tobacco juice into the stream,
    he turned sadly on his heel and led the way back to the pub. He invited the
    boys to &ldquo;pisen themselves&rdquo;; after they were served he ordered
    out the longest tumbler on the premises, poured a drop into it from nearly
    every bottle on the shelf, added a lump of ice, and drank slowly and steadily.</p>
  <p>Then he took pity on the impatient and anxious population, opened his mouth,
    and spake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, fellows,&rdquo; he drawled, jerking his arm in the direction
    of the river, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll dew. I&rsquo;ll
    bottle that damned river of yourn in twenty-four hours!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later on he mellowed a bit, under the influence of several drinks which
    were carefully and conscientiously &ldquo;built&rdquo; from plans and specifications
    supplied by himself, and then, among other things, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that there river rises as high as you say it dew&mdash;and if
    this was the States&mdash;why, we&rsquo;d have had the Great Eastern up here
    twenty years ago&rdquo;&mdash;or words to that effect.</p>
  <p>Then he added, reflectively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I come over here I calculated that I was going to make things
    hum, but now I guess I&rsquo;ll have to change my prospectus. There&rsquo;s
    a lot of loose energy laying round over our way, but I guess that if I wanted
    to make things move in your country I&rsquo;d have to bring over the entire
    American nation&mdash;also his wife and dawg. You&rsquo;ve got the makings
    of a glorious nation over here, but you don&rsquo;t get up early enough!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>The only national work performed by the blacks is on the Darling. They threw
    a dam of rocks across the river&mdash;near Brewarrina, we think&mdash;to
    make a fish trap. It&rsquo;s there yet. But God only knows where they got
    the stones from, or how they carried them, for there isn&rsquo;t a pebble
    within forty miles.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADaughterofMaoriland"></a>A Daughter of Maoriland</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">A Sketch of Poor-Class Maoris</p>
  <p>The new native-school teacher, who was &ldquo;green&rdquo;, &ldquo;soft&rdquo;,
    and poetical, and had a literary ambition, called her &ldquo;August&rdquo;,
    and fondly hoped to build a romance on her character. She was down in the
    school registers as Sarah Moses, Maori, 16 years and three months. She looked
    twenty; but this was nothing, insomuch as the mother of the youngest child
    in the school&mdash;a dear little half-caste lady of two or three summers&mdash;had
    not herself the vaguest idea of the child&rsquo;s age, nor anybody else&rsquo;s,
    nor of ages in the abstract. The church register was lost some six years
    before, when &ldquo;Granny&rdquo;, who was a hundred, if a day, was supposed
    to be about twenty-five. The teacher had to guess the ages of all the new
    pupils.</p>
  <p>August was apparently the oldest in the school&mdash;a big, ungainly, awkward
    girl, with a heavy negro type of Maori countenance, and about as much animation,
    mentally or physically, as a cow. She was given to brooding; in fact, she
    brooded all the time. She brooded all day over her school work, but did it
    fairly well. How the previous teachers had taught her all she knew was a
    mystery to the new one. There had been a tragedy in August&rsquo;s family
    when she was a child, and the affair seemed to have cast a gloom over the
    lives of the entire family, for the lowering brooding cloud was on all their
    faces. August would take to the bush when things went wrong at home, and
    climb a tree and brood till she was found and coaxed home. Things, according
    to pa gossip, had gone wrong with her from the date of the tragedy, when
    she, a bright little girl, was taken&mdash;a homeless orphan&mdash;to live
    with a sister, and, afterwards, with an aunt-by-marriage. They treated her, &rsquo;twas
    said, with a brutality which must have been greatly exaggerated by pa-gossip,
    seeing that unkindness of this description is, according to all the best
    authorities, altogether foreign to Maori nature.</p>
  <p>Pa-gossip&mdash;which is less reliable than the ordinary washerwoman kind,
    because of a deeper and more vicious ignorance&mdash;had it that one time
    when August was punished by a teacher (or beaten by her sister or aunt-by-marriage)
    she &ldquo;took to the bush&rdquo; for three days, at the expiration of which
    time she was found on the ground in an exhausted condition. She was evidently
    a true Maori or savage, and this was one of the reasons why the teacher with
    the literary ambition took an interest in her. She had a print of a portrait
    of a man in soldier&rsquo;s uniform, taken from a copy of the <i>Illustrated
    London News</i>, pasted over the fireplace in the whare where she lived,
    and neatly bordered by vandyked strips of silvered tea-paper. She had pasted
    it in the place of honour, or as near as she could get to it. The place of
    honour was sacred to framed representations of the Nativity and Catholic
    subjects, half-modelled, half-pictured. The print was a portrait of the last
    Czar of Russia, of all the men in the world; and August was reported to have
    said that she loved that man. His father had been murdered, so had her mother.
    This was one of the reasons why the teacher with the literary ambition thought
    he could get a romance out of her.</p>
  <p>After the first week she hung round the new schoolmistress, dog-like&mdash;with &ldquo;dog-like
    affection&rdquo;, thought the teacher. She came down often during the holidays,
    and hung about the verandah and back door for an hour or so; then, by-and-bye,
    she&rsquo;d be gone. Her brooding seemed less aggressive on such occasions.
    The teacher reckoned that she had something on her mind, and wanted to open
    her heart to &ldquo;the wife&rdquo;, but was too ignorant or too shy, poor
    girl; and he reckoned, from his theory of Maori character, that it might
    take her weeks, or months, to come to the point. One day, after a great deal
    of encouragement, she explained that she felt &ldquo;so awfully lonely, Mrs.
    Lorrens.&rdquo;  All the other girls were away, and she wished it was school-time.</p>
  <p>She was happy and cheerful again, in her brooding way, in the playground.
    There was something sadly ludicrous about her great, ungainly figure slopping
    round above the children at play. The schoolmistress took her into the parlour,
    gave her tea and cake, and was kind to her; and she took it all with broody
    cheerfulness.</p>
  <p>One Sunday morning she came down to the cottage and sat on the edge of the
    verandah, looking as wretchedly miserable as a girl could. She was in rags&mdash;at
    least, she had a rag of a dress on&mdash;and was barefooted and bareheaded.
    She said that her aunt had turned her out, and she was going to walk down
    the coast to Whale Bay to her grandmother&mdash;a long day&rsquo;s ride.
    The teacher was troubled, because he was undecided what to do. He had to
    be careful to avoid any unpleasantness arising out of Maori cliquism. As
    the teacher he couldn&rsquo;t let her go in the state she was in; from the
    depths of his greenness he trusted her, from the depths of his softness he
    pitied her; his poetic nature was fiercely indignant on account of the poor
    girl&rsquo;s wrongs, and the wife spoke for her. Then he thought of his unwritten
    romance, and regarded August in the light of copy, and that settled it. While
    he talked the matter over with his wife, August &ldquo;hid in the dark of
    her hair,&rdquo; awaiting her doom. The teacher put his hat on, walked up
    to the pa, and saw her aunt. She denied that she had turned August out, but
    the teacher believed the girl. He explained his position, in words simplified
    for Maori comprehension, and the aunt and relations said they understood,
    and that he was &ldquo;perfectly right, Mr. Lorrens.&rdquo;  They were very
    respectful. The teacher said that if August would not return home, he was
    willing to let her stay at the cottage until such time as her uncle, who
    was absent, returned, and he (the teacher) could talk the matter over with
    him. The relations thought that that was the very best thing that could be
    done, and thanked him. The aunt, two sisters, and as many of the others,
    including the children, as were within sight or hail at the time&mdash;most
    of them could not by any possible means have had the slightest connection
    with the business in hand&mdash;accompanied the teacher to the cottage. August
    took to the flax directly she caught sight of her relations, and was with
    difficulty induced to return. There was a lot of talk in Maori, during which
    the girl and her aunt shuffled and swung round at the back of each other,
    and each talked over her shoulder, and laughed foolishly and awkwardly once
    or twice; but in the end the girl was sullenly determined not to return home,
    so it was decided that she should stay. The schoolmistress made tea.</p>
  <p>August brightened from the first day. She was a different girl altogether. &ldquo;I
    never saw such a change in a girl,&rdquo; said the young schoolmistress,
    and one or two others. &ldquo;I always thought she was a good girl if taken
    the right way; all she wanted was a change and kind treatment.&rdquo; But
    the stolid old Maori chairman of the school committee only shrugged his shoulders
    and said (when the schoolmistress, woman-like, pressed him for an opinion
    to agree with her own), &ldquo;You can look at it two ways, Mrs. Lorrens.&rdquo; Which,
    by the way, was about the only expression of opinion that the teacher was
    ever able to get out of him on any subject.</p>
  <p>August worked and behaved well. She was wonderfully quick in picking up
    English ways and housework. True, she was awkward and not over cleanly in
    some things, but her mistress had patience with her. Who wouldn&rsquo;t have?
    She &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t do enough&rdquo; for her benefactress; she hung
    on her words and sat at her footstool of evenings in a way that gladdened
    the teacher&rsquo;s sentimental nature; she couldn&rsquo;t bear to see him
    help his wife with a hat-pin or button&mdash;August must do it. She insisted
    on doing her mistress&rsquo; hair every night. In short, she tried in every
    way to show her gratitude. The teacher and his wife smiled brightly at each
    other behind her back, and thought how cheerful the house was since she came,
    and wondered what they&rsquo;d do without her. It was a settled thing that
    they should take her back to the city with them, and have a faithful and
    grateful retainer all their lives and a sort of Aunt Chloe for their children,
    when they had any. The teacher got yards of copy out of her for his &ldquo;Maori
    Sketches and Characters&rdquo;, worked joyously at his romance, and felt
    great already, and was happy. She had a bed made up temporarily (until the
    teacher could get a spring mattress for her from town) on the floor in the
    dining-room, and when she&rsquo;d made her bed she&rsquo;d squat on it in
    front of the fire and sing Maori songs in a soft voice. She&rsquo;d sing
    the teacher and his wife, in the next room, to sleep. Then she&rsquo;d get
    up and have a feed, but they never heard her.</p>
  <p>Her manners at the table (for she was treated &ldquo;like one of themselves&rdquo; in
    the broadest sense of the term) were surprisingly good, considering that
    the adults of her people were decidedly cow-like in white society, and scoffed
    sea-eggs, shell-fish, and mutton-birds at home with a gallop which was not
    edifying. Her appetite, it was true, was painful at times to the poetic side
    of the teacher&rsquo;s nature; but he supposed that she&rsquo;d been half-starved
    at home, poor girl, and would get over it. Anyway, the copy he&rsquo;d get
    out of her would repay him for this and other expenses a hundredfold. Moreover,
    begging and borrowing had ceased with her advent, and the teacher set this
    down to her influence.</p>
  <p>The first jar came when she was sent on horseback to the town for groceries,
    and didn&rsquo;t get back till late the next day. She explained that some
    of her relations got hold of her and made her stay, and wanted her to go
    into public-houses with them, but she wouldn&rsquo;t. She said that <i>she</i> wanted
    to come home. But why didn&rsquo;t she? The teacher let it pass, and hoped
    she&rsquo;d gain strength of character by-and-bye. He had waited up late
    the night before with her supper on the hob; and he and his wife had been
    anxious for fear something had happened to the poor girl who was under their
    care. He had walked to the treacherous river-ford several times during the
    evening, and waited there for her. So perhaps he was tired, and that was
    why he didn&rsquo;t write next night.</p>
  <p>The sugar-bag, the onion-basket, the potato-bag and the tea-chest began
    to &ldquo;go down&rdquo; alarmingly, and an occasional pound of candles,
    a pigeon, a mutton-bird (plucked and ready for Sunday&rsquo;s cooking), and
    other little trifles went, also. August couldn&rsquo;t understand it, and
    the teacher believed her, for falsehood and deceit are foreign to the simple
    natures of the modern Maoris. There were no cats; but no score of ordinary
    cats could have given colour to the cat theory, had it been raised in this
    case. The breath of August advertised onions more than once, but no human
    stomach could have accounted for the quantity. She surely could not have
    eaten the other things raw&mdash;and she had no opportunities for private
    cooking, as far as the teacher and his wife could see. The other Maoris were
    out of the question; they were all strictly honest.</p>
  <p>Thefts and annoyances of the above description were credited to the &ldquo;swaggies&rdquo; who
    infested the roads, and had a very bad name down that way; so the teacher
    loaded his gun, and told August to rouse him at once, if she heard a sound
    in the night. She said she would; but a heavy-weight &ldquo;swaggie&rdquo;  could
    have come in and sat on her and had a smoke without waking her.</p>
  <p>She couldn&rsquo;t be trusted to go a message. She&rsquo;d take from three
    to six hours, and come back with an excuse that sounded genuine from its
    very simplicity. Another sister of hers lay ill in an isolated hut, alone
    and uncared for, except by the teacher&rsquo;s wife, and occasionally by
    a poor pa outcast who had negro blood in her veins, and a love for a white
    loafer. God help her! All of which sounds strange, considering that Maoris
    are very kind to each other. The schoolmistress sent August one night to
    stay with the sick Maori woman and help her as she could, and gave her strict
    instructions to come to the cottage first thing in the morning, and tell
    her how the sick woman was. August turned up at lunch-time next day. The
    teacher gave her her first lecture, and said plainly that he wasn&rsquo;t
    to be taken for a fool; then he stepped aside to get cool, and, when he returned,
    the girl was sobbing as if her heart would break, and the wife comforting
    her. She had been up all night, poor girl, and was thoroughly worn out. Somehow
    the teacher didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable about it. He went down to the
    whare. August had not touched a dishcloth or broom. She had slept, as she
    always did, like a pig, all night, while her sister lay and tossed in agony;
    in the morning she ate everything there was to eat in the house (which, it
    seemed, was the Maori way of showing sympathy in sickness and trouble), after
    which she brooded by the fire till the children, running out of school, announced
    the teacher&rsquo;s lunch hour.</p>
  <p>August braced up again for a little while. The master thought of the trouble
    they had with Ayacanora in &ldquo;Westward Ho&rdquo;, and was comforted,
    and tackled his romance again. Then the schoolmistress fell sick and things
    went wrong. The groceries went down faster than ever, and the house got very
    dirty, and began to have a native smell about it. August grew fat, and lazy,
    and dirty, and less reliable on washing-days, or when there was anything
    special to do in the house. &ldquo;The savage blood is strong,&rdquo; thought
    the teacher, &ldquo;and she is beginning to long for her own people and free
    unconventional life.&rdquo; One morning&mdash;on a washing-day, too, as it
    happened&mdash;she called out, before the teacher and his wife were up, that
    the Maoris who supplied them with milk were away, and she had promised to
    go up and milk the cow and bring the milk down. The teacher gave her permission.
    One of the scholars usually brought the milk early. Lunch time came and no
    August, no milk&mdash;strangest of all, only half the school children. The
    teacher put on his hat, and went up to the pa once more. He found August
    squatted in the midst of a circle of relations. She was entertaining them
    with one of a series of idealistic sketches of the teacher&rsquo;s domestic
    life, in which she showed a very vivid imagination, and exhibited an unaccountable
    savage sort of pessimism. Her intervals of absence had been occupied in this
    way from the first. The astounding slanders she had circulated concerning
    the teacher&rsquo;s private life came back, bit by bit, to his ears for a
    year afterwards, and her character sketches of previous teachers, and her
    own relations&mdash;for she spared nobody&mdash;would have earned a white
    woman a long and well-merited term of imprisonment for criminal libel. She
    had cunningly, by straightforward and unscrupulous lying, prejudiced the
    principal mother and boss woman of the pa against the teacher and his wife;
    as a natural result of which the old lady, who, like the rest, was very ignorant
    and ungrateful,  &ldquo;turned nasty&rdquo; and kept the children from school.
    The teacher lost his temper, so the children were rounded up and hurried
    down to school immediately; with them came August and her aunt, with alleged
    explanations and excuses, and a shell-fish. The aunt and sisters said they&rsquo;d
    have nothing to do with August. They didn&rsquo;t want her and wouldn&rsquo;t
    have her. The teacher said that, under those circumstances, she&rsquo;d better
    go and drown herself; so she went home with them.</p>
  <p>The whole business had been a plot by her nearest relations. They got rid
    of the trouble and expense of keeping her, and the bother of borrowing in
    person, whenever in need of trifles in the grocery line. Borrowing recommenced
    with her dismissal; but the teacher put a full stop to it, as far as he was
    concerned. Then August, egged on by her aunt, sent a blackguardly letter
    to the teacher&rsquo;s wife; the sick sister, by the way, who had been nursed
    and supplied with food by her all along, was in it, and said she was glad
    August sent the letter, and it served the schoolmistress right. The teacher
    went up to the pa once more; an hour later, August in person, accompanied,
    as usual, by a relation or two, delivered at the cottage an abject apology
    in writing, the composition of which would have discouraged the most enthusiastic
    advocate of higher education for the lower classes.</p>
  <p>Then various petty annoyances were tried. The teacher is firmly convinced
    that certain animal-like sounds round the house at night were due to August&rsquo;s
    trying to find out whether his wife was as likely to be haunted as the Maoris
    were. He didn&rsquo;t dream of such a thing at the time, for he did not believe
    that one of them had the pluck to venture out after dark. But savage superstition
    must give way to savage hate. The girl&rsquo;s last &ldquo;try-on&rdquo; was
    to come down to the school fence, and ostentatiously sharpen a table-knife
    on the wires, while she scowled murderously in the direction of the schoolmistress,
    who was hanging out her washing. August looked, in her dark, bushy, Maori
    hair, a thoroughly wild savage. Her father had murdered her mother under
    particularly brutal circumstances, and the daughter took after her father.</p>
  <p>The teacher called her and said: &ldquo;Now, look here, my lady, the best
    thing you can do is to drop that nonsense at once&rdquo; (she had dropped
    the knife in the ferns behind her), &ldquo;for we&rsquo;re the wrong sort
    of people to try it on with. Now you get out of this and tell your aunt&mdash;she&rsquo;s
    sneaking there in the flax&mdash;what I tell you, and that she&rsquo;d better
    clear out of this quick, or I&rsquo;ll have a policeman out and take the
    whole gang into town in an hour. Now be off, and shut that gate behind you,
    carefully, and fasten it.&rdquo; She did, and went.</p>
  <p>The worst of it was that the August romance copy was useless. Her lies were
    even less reliable and picturesque than the common Jones Alley hag lie. Then
    the teacher thought of the soft fool he&rsquo;d been, and that made him wild.
    He looked like a fool, and was one to a great extent, but it wasn&rsquo;t
    good policy to take him for one.</p>
  <p>Strange to say, he and others had reason to believe that August respected
    him, and liked him rather than otherwise; but she hated his wife, who had
    been kind to her, as only a savage can hate. The younger pupils told the
    teacher, cheerfully and confidently, that August said she&rsquo;d cut Mrs.
    Lorrens&rsquo;  throat the first chance she got. Next week the aunt sent
    down to ask if the teacher could sell her a bar of soap, and sent the same
    old shilling; he was tired of seeing it stuck out in front of him, so he
    took it, put it in his pocket, and sent the soap. This must have discouraged
    them, for the borrowing industry petered out. He saw the aunt later on, and
    she told him, cheerfully, that August was going to live with a half-caste
    in a certain house in town.</p>
  <p>Poor August! For she was only a tool after all. Her &ldquo;romance&rdquo; was
    briefly as follows:&mdash;She went, per off-hand Maori arrangement, as &lsquo;housekeeper&rsquo;  in
    the hut of a labourer at a neighbouring saw-mill. She stayed three months,
    for a wonder; at the expiration of which time she put on her hat and explained
    that she was tired of stopping there, and was going home. He said, &lsquo;All
    right, Sarah, wait a while and I&rsquo;ll take you home.&rsquo; At the door
    of her aunt&rsquo;s house he said, &lsquo;Well, good-bye, Sarah,&rsquo; and
    she said, in her brooding way, &lsquo;Good-bye, Jim.&rsquo; And that was
    all.</p>
  <p>As the last apparent result of August&rsquo;s mischief-making, her brother
    or someone one evening rode up to the cottage, drunk and inclined to bluster.
    He was accompanied by a friend, also drunk, who came to see the fun, and
    was ready to use his influence on the winning side. The teacher went inside,
    brought out his gun, and slipped two cartridges in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
    enough of this,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Now then, be off, you insolent blackguards,
    or I&rsquo;ll shoot you like rabbits. Go!&rdquo; and he snapped his jaw and
    the breech of his gun together. As they rode off, the old local hawk happened
    to soar close over a dead lamb in the fern at the corner of the garden, and
    the teacher, who had been &ldquo;laying&rdquo;  for him a long time, let
    fly both barrels at him, without thinking. When he turned, there was only
    a cloud of dust down the track.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>The teacher taught that school for three years thereafter, without a hitch.
    But he went no more on Universal Brotherhood lines. And, for years after
    he had gone, his name was spoken of with great respect by the Maoris.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStoryoftheOracle"></a>The Story of the Oracle</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;We young fellows,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Sympathy Joe&rdquo; to Mitchell,
    after tea, in their first camp west the river&mdash;&ldquo;and you and I <i>are</i> young
    fellows, comparatively&mdash;think we know the world. There are plenty of
    young chaps knocking round in this country who reckon they&rsquo;ve been
    through it all before they&rsquo;re thirty. I&rsquo;ve met cynics and men-o&rsquo;-the-world,
    aged twenty-one or thereabouts, who&rsquo;ve never been further than a trip
    to Sydney. They talk about &lsquo;this world&rsquo; as if they&rsquo;d knocked
    around in half-a-dozen other worlds before they came across here&mdash;and
    they are just as off-hand about it as older Australians are when they talk
    about this colony as compared with the others. They say: &lsquo;My oath!&mdash;same
    here.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been there.&rsquo; &lsquo;My oath!&mdash;you&rsquo;re
    right.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take it from me!&rsquo; and all that sort of thing.
    They understand women, and have a contempt for &rsquo;em; and chaps that
    don&rsquo;t talk as they talk, or do as they do, or see as they see, are
    either soft or ratty. A good many reckon that &lsquo;life ain&rsquo;t blanky
    well worth livin&rsquo;&rsquo;; sometimes they feel so blanky somehow that
    they wouldn&rsquo;t give a blank whether they chucked it or not; but that
    sort never chuck it. It&rsquo;s mostly the quiet men that do that, and if
    they&rsquo;ve got any complaints to make against the world they make &rsquo;em
    at the head station. Why, I&rsquo;ve known healthy, single, young fellows
    under twenty-five who drank to drown their troubles&mdash;some because they
    reckoned the world didn&rsquo;t understand nor appreciate &rsquo;em&mdash;as
    if it <i>could</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the world don&rsquo;t understand or appreciate you,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell solemnly, as he reached for a burning stick to light his pipe&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Make</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To drown <i>their</i> troubles!&rdquo; continued Joe, in a tone of
    impatient contempt. &ldquo;The Oracle must be well on towards the sixties;
    he can take his glass with any man, but you never saw him drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Oracle to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear his history?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, though I don&rsquo;t think he has any idea that I do. Now, we
    were talking about the Oracle a little while ago. We know he&rsquo;s an old
    ass; a good many outsiders consider that he&rsquo;s a bit soft or ratty,
    and, as we&rsquo;re likely to be mates together for some time on that fencing
    contract, if we get it, you might as well know what sort of a man he is and
    was, so&rsquo;s you won&rsquo;t get uneasy about him if he gets deaf for
    a while when you&rsquo;re talking, or does funny things with his pipe or
    pint-pot, or walks up and down by himself for an hour or so after tea, or
    sits on a log with his head in his hands, or leans on the fence in the gloaming
    and keeps looking in a blank sort of way, straight ahead, across the clearing.
    For he&rsquo;s gazing at something a thousand miles across country, south-east,
    and about twenty years back into the past, and no doubt he sees himself (as
    a young man), and a Gippsland girl, spooning under the stars along between
    the hop-gardens and the Mitchell River. And, if you get holt of a fiddle
    or a concertina, don&rsquo;t rasp or swank too much on old tunes, when he&rsquo;s
    round, for the Oracle can&rsquo;t stand it. Play something lively. He&rsquo;ll
    be down there at that surveyor&rsquo;s camp yarning till all hours, so we&rsquo;ll
    have plenty of time for the story&mdash;but don&rsquo;t you ever give him
    a hint that you know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My people knew him well; I got most of the story from them&mdash;mostly
    from Uncle Bob, who knew him better than any. The rest leaked out through
    the women&mdash;you know how things leak out amongst women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell dropped his head and scratched the back of it. <i>He</i> knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was on the Cudgegong River. My Uncle Bob was mates with him on
    one of those &lsquo;rushes&rsquo; along there&mdash;the &lsquo;Pipeclay&rsquo;,
    I think it was, or the &lsquo;Log Paddock&rsquo;. The Oracle was a young
    man then, of course, and so was Uncle Bob (he was a match for most men).
    You see the Oracle now, and you can imagine what he was when he was a young
    man. Over six feet, and as straight as a sapling, Uncle Bob said, clean-limbed,
    and as fresh as they made men in those days; carried his hands behind him,
    as he does now, when he hasn&rsquo;t got the swag&mdash;but his shoulders
    were back in those days. Of course he wasn&rsquo;t the Oracle then; he was
    young Tom Marshall&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Everybody liked him&mdash;especially
    women and children. He was a bit happy-go-lucky and careless, but he didn&rsquo;t
    know anything about &lsquo;this world&rsquo;, and didn&rsquo;t bother about
    it; he hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;been there&rsquo;. &lsquo;And his heart was as
    good as gold,&rsquo; my aunt used to say. He didn&rsquo;t understand women
    as we young fellows do nowadays, and therefore he hadn&rsquo;t any contempt
    for &rsquo;em. Perhaps he understood, and understands, them better than any
    of us, without knowing it. Anyway, you know, he&rsquo;s always gentle and
    kind where a woman or child is concerned, and doesn&rsquo;t like to hear
    us talk about women as we do sometimes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a girl on the goldfields&mdash;a fine lump of a blonde,
    and pretty gay. She came from Sydney, I think, with her people, who kept
    shanties on the fields. She had a splendid voice, and used to sing &lsquo;Madeline&rsquo;.
    There might have been one or two bad women before that, in the Oracle&rsquo;s
    world, but no cold-blooded, designing ones. He calls the bad ones &lsquo;unfortunate&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was Tom&rsquo;s looks, or his freshness, or his innocence,
    or softness&mdash;or all together&mdash;that attracted her. Anyway, he got
    mixed up with her before the goldfield petered out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt it took a long while for the facts to work into Tom&rsquo;s
    head that a girl might sing like she did and yet be thoroughly unprincipled.
    The Oracle was always slow at coming to a decision, but when he does it&rsquo;s
    generally the right one. Anyway, you can take that for granted, for you won&rsquo;t
    move him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he found out that she wasn&rsquo;t all
    that she pretented to be to him, or whether they quarrelled, or whether she
    chucked him over for a lucky digger. Tom never had any luck on the goldfields.
    Anyway, he left and went over to the Victorian side, where his people were,
    and went up Gippsland way. It was there for the first time in his life that
    he got what you would call &lsquo;properly gone on a girl&rsquo;; he got
    hard hit&mdash;he met his fate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her name was Bertha Bredt, I remember. Aunt Bob saw her afterwards.
    Aunt Bob used to say that she was &lsquo;a girl as God made her&rsquo;&mdash;a
    good, true, womanly girl&mdash;one of those sort of girls that only love
    once. Tom got on with her father, who was packing horses through the ranges
    to the new goldfields&mdash;it was rough country and there were no roads;
    they had to pack everything there in those days, and there was money in it.
    The girl&rsquo;s father took to Tom&mdash;as almost everybody else did&mdash;and,
    as far as the girl was concerned, I think it was a case of love at first
    sight. They only knew each other for about six months, and were only &lsquo;courting&rsquo; (as
    they called it then) for three or four months altogether, but she was that
    sort of girl that can love a man for six weeks and lose him for ever, and
    yet go on loving him to the end of her life&mdash;and die with his name on
    her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, things were brightening up every way for Tom, and he and his
    sweetheart were beginning to talk about their own little home in future,
    when there came a letter from the &lsquo;Madeline&rsquo; girl in New South
    Wales.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was in terrible trouble. Her baby was to be born in a month.
    Her people had kicked her out, and she was in danger of starving. She begged
    and prayed of him to come back and marry her, if only for his child&rsquo;s
    sake. He could go then, and be free; she would never trouble him any more&mdash;only
    come and marry her for the child&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle doesn&rsquo;t know where he lost that letter, but I do.
    It was burnt afterwards by a woman, who was more than a mother to him in
    his trouble&mdash;Aunt Bob. She thought he might carry it round with the
    rest of his papers, in his swag, for years, and come across it unexpectedly
    when he was camped by himself in the bush and feeling dull. It wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done him any good then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He must have fought the hardest fight in his life when he got that
    letter. No doubt he walked to and fro, to and fro, all night, with his hands
    behind him, and his eyes on the ground, as he does now sometimes. Walking
    up and down helps you to fight a thing out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt he thought of things pretty well as he thinks now: the poor
    girl&rsquo;s shame on every tongue, and belled round the district by every
    hag in the township; and she looked upon by women as being as bad as any
    man who ever went to Bathurst in the old days, handcuffed between two troopers.
    There is sympathy, a pipe and tobacco, a cheering word, and, maybe, a whisky
    now and then, for the criminal on his journey; but there is no mercy, at
    least as far as women are concerned, for the poor foolish girl, who has to
    sneak out the back way and round by back streets and lanes after dark, with
    a cloak on to hide her figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom sent what money he thought he could spare, and next day he went
    to the girl he loved and who loved him, and told her the truth, and showed
    her the letter. She was only a girl&mdash;but the sort of girl you <i>could</i> go
    to in a crisis like that. He had made up his mind to do the right thing,
    and she loved him all the more for it. And so they parted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When Tom reached &lsquo;Pipeclay&rsquo;, the girl&rsquo;s relations,
    that she was stopping with, had a parson readied up, and they were married
    the same day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what happened after that?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing happened for three or four months; then the child was born.
    It wasn&rsquo;t his!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell stood up with an oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girl was thoroughly bad. She&rsquo;d been carrying on with God
    knows how many men, both before and after she trapped Tom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you know how the Oracle argues over things, and I suppose he
    was as big an old fool then as he is now. He thinks that, as most men would
    deceive women if they could, when one man gets caught, he&rsquo;s got no
    call to squeal about it; he&rsquo;s bound, because of the sins of men in
    general against women, to make the best of it. What is one man&rsquo;s wrong
    counted against the wrongs of hundreds of unfortunate girls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an uncommon way of arguing&mdash;like most of the Oracle&rsquo;s
    ideas&mdash;but it seems to look all right at first sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he thought she&rsquo;d go straight; perhaps she convinced
    him that he was the cause of her first fall; anyway he stuck to her for more
    than a year, and intended to take her away from that place as soon as he&rsquo;d
    scraped enough money together. It might have gone on up till now, if the
    father of the child&mdash;a big black Irishman named Redmond&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
    come sneaking back at the end of a year. He&mdash;well, he came hanging round
    Mrs. Marshall while Tom was away at work&mdash;and she encouraged him. And
    Tom was forced to see it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom wanted to fight out his own battle without interference, but
    the chaps wouldn&rsquo;t let him&mdash;they reckoned that he&rsquo;d stand
    very little show against Redmond, who was a very rough customer and a fighting
    man. My uncle Bob, who was there still, fixed it up this way: The Oracle
    was to fight Redmond, and if the Oracle got licked Uncle Bob was to take
    Redmond on. If Redmond whipped Uncle Bob, that was to settle it; but if Uncle
    Bob thrashed Redmond, then he was also to fight Redmond&rsquo;s mate, another
    big, rough Paddy named Duigan. Then the affair would be finished&mdash;no
    matter which way the last bout went. You see, Uncle Bob was reckoned more
    of a match for Redmond than the Oracle was, so the thing looked fair enough&mdash;at
    first sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Redmond had his mate, Duigan, and one or two others of the rough
    gang that used to terrorise the fields round there in the roaring days of
    Gulgong. The Oracle had Uncle Bob, of course, and long Dave Regan, the drover&mdash;a
    good-hearted, sawny kind of chap that&rsquo;d break the devil&rsquo;s own
    buck-jumper, or smash him, or get smashed himself&mdash;and little Jimmy
    Nowlett, the bullocky, and one or two of the old, better-class diggers that
    were left on the field.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clear space among the saplings in Specimen Gully,
    where they used to pitch circuses; and here, in the cool of a summer evening,
    the two men stood face to face. Redmond was a rough, roaring, foul-mouthed
    man; he stripped to his shirt, and roared like a bull, and swore, and sneered,
    and wanted to take the whole of Tom&rsquo;s crowd while he was at it, and
    make one clean job of &rsquo;em. Couldn&rsquo;t waste time fighting them
    all one after the other, because he wanted to get away to the new rush at
    Cattle Creek next day. The fool had been drinking shanty-whisky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom stood up in his clean, white moles and white flannel shirt&mdash;one
    of those sort with no sleeves, that give the arms play. He had a sort of
    set expression and a look in his eyes that Uncle Bob&mdash;nor none of them&mdash;had
    ever seen there before. &lsquo;Give us plenty of&mdash;room!&rsquo; roared
    Redmond; &lsquo;one of us is going to hell, now! This is going to be a fight
    to a&mdash;finish, and a&mdash;short one!&rsquo;  And it was!&rdquo; Joe
    paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;go on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle never got a mark! He was top-dog right from the start.
    Perhaps it was his strength that Redmond had underrated, or his want of science
    that puzzled him, or the awful silence of the man that frightened him (it
    made even Uncle Bob uneasy). Or, perhaps, it was Providence (it was a glorious
    chance for Providence), but, anyway, as I say, the Oracle never got a mark,
    except on his knuckles. After a few rounds Redmond funked and wanted to give
    in, but the chaps wouldn&rsquo;t let him&mdash;not even his own mates&mdash;except
    Duigan. They made him take it as long as he could stand on his feet. He even
    shammed to be knocked out, and roared out something about having broken his&mdash;ankle&mdash;but
    it was no use. And the Oracle! The chaps that knew thought that he&rsquo;d
    refuse to fight, and never hit a man that had given in. But he did. He just
    stood there with that quiet look in his eyes and waited, and, when he did
    hit, there wasn&rsquo;t any necessity for Redmond to <i>pretend</i> to be
    knocked down. You&rsquo;ll see a glint of that old light in the Oracle&rsquo;s
    eyes even now, once in a while; and when you do it&rsquo;s a sign that you
    or someone are going too far, and had better pull up, for it&rsquo;s a red
    light on the line, old as he is.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Jimmy Nowlett was a nuggety little fellow, hard as cast iron,
    good-hearted, but very excitable; and when the bashed Redmond was being carted
    off (poor Uncle Bob was always pretty high-strung, and was sitting on a log
    sobbing like a great child from the reaction), Duigan made some sneering
    remark that only Jimmy Nowlett caught, and in an instant he was up and at
    Duigan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Duigan was demoralised by his mate&rsquo;s defeat, or by
    the suddenness of the attack; but, at all events, he got a hiding, too. Uncle
    Bob used to say that it was the funniest thing he ever saw in his life. Jimmy
    kept yelling: &lsquo;Let me get at him! By the Lord, let me get at him!&rsquo; And
    nobody was attempting to stop him, he <i>was</i> getting at him all the time&mdash;and
    properly, too; and, when he&rsquo;d knocked Duigan down, he&rsquo;d dance
    round him and call on him to get up; and every time he jumped or bounced,
    he&rsquo;d squeak like an india-rubber ball, Uncle Bob said, and he would
    nearly burst his boiler trying to lug the big man on to his feet so&rsquo;s
    he could knock him down again. It took two of Jimmy&rsquo;s mates all their
    time to lam him down into a comparatively reasonable state of mind after
    the fight was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle left for Sydney next day, and Uncle Bob went with him.
    He stayed at Uncle Bob&rsquo;s place for some time. He got very quiet, they
    said, and gentle; he used to play with the children, and they got mighty
    fond of him. The old folks thought his heart was broken, but it went through
    a deeper sorrow still after that and it ain&rsquo;t broken yet. It takes
    a lot to break the heart of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his wife,&rdquo; asked Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;what became of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever saw her again. She dropped down pretty
    low after he left her&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard she&rsquo;s living somewhere
    quietly. The Oracle&rsquo;s been sending someone money ever since I knew
    him, and I know it&rsquo;s a woman. I suppose it&rsquo;s she. He isn&rsquo;t
    the sort of a man to see a woman starve&mdash;especially a woman he had ever
    had anything to do with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the Gippsland girl?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst part of it all, I think. The Oracle went up
    North somewhere. In the course of a year or two his affair got over Gippsland
    way through a mate of his who lived over there, and at last the story got
    to the ears of this girl, Bertha Bredt. She must have written a dozen letters
    to him, Aunt Bob said. She knew what was in &rsquo;em, but, of course, she&rsquo;d
    never tell us. The Oracle only wrote one in reply. Then, what must the girl
    do but clear out from home and make her way over to Sydney&mdash;to Aunt
    Bob&rsquo;s place, looking for Tom. She never got any further. She took ill&mdash;brain-fever,
    or broken heart, or something of that sort. All the time she was down her
    cry was&mdash;&lsquo;I want to see him! I want to find Tom! I only want to
    see Tom!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When they saw she was dying, Aunt Bob wired to the Oracle to come&mdash;and
    he came. When the girl saw it was Tom sitting by the bed, she just gave one
    long look in his face, put her arms round his neck, and laid her head on
    his shoulder&mdash;and died.... Here comes the Oracle now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lifted the tea-billy on to the coals.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryofDaveRegan"></a>The Mystery of Dave
      Regan</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;then there was Dave Regan,&rdquo; said the traveller. &ldquo;Dave
    used to die oftener than any other bushman I knew. He was always being reported
    dead and turnin&rsquo; up again. He seemed to like it &mdash; except once,
    when his brother drew his money and drank it all to drown his grief at what
    he called Dave&rsquo;s  &lsquo;untimely end&rsquo;. Well, Dave went up to
    Queensland once with cattle, and was away three years and reported dead,
    as usual. He was drowned in the Bogan this time while tryin&rsquo; to swim
    his horse acrost a flood &mdash; and his sweetheart hurried up and got spliced
    to a worse man before Dave got back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one day I was out in the bush lookin&rsquo; for timber, when
    the biggest storm ever knowed in that place come on. There was hail in it,
    too, as big as bullets, and if I hadn&rsquo;t got behind a stump and crouched
    down in time I&rsquo;d have been riddled like a &mdash; like a bushranger.
    As it was, I got soakin&rsquo; wet. The storm was over in a few minutes,
    the water run off down the gullies, and the sun come out and the scrub steamed &mdash; and
    stunk like a new pair of moleskin trousers. I went on along the track, and
    presently I seen a long, lanky chap get on to a long, lanky horse and ride
    out of a bush yard at the edge of a clearin&rsquo;. I knowed it was Dave
    d&rsquo;reckly I set eyes on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave used to ride a tall, holler-backed thoroughbred with a body
    and limbs like a kangaroo dog, and it would circle around you and sidle away
    as if it was frightened you was goin&rsquo; to jab a knife into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello! Dave!&rsquo; said I, as he came spurrin&rsquo; up. &lsquo;How
    are yer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are yer gettin&rsquo; on?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, before we could say any more, that horse shied away and broke
    off through the scrub to the right. I waited, because I knowed Dave would
    come back again if I waited long enough; and in about ten minutes he came
    sidlin&rsquo; in from the scrub to the left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; says he, spurrin&rsquo; up
    sideways; &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s the old people?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t been home yet,&rsquo; says he, holdin&rsquo; out
    his hand; but, afore I could grip it, the cussed horse sidled off to the
    south end of the clearin&rsquo; and broke away again through the scrub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard Dave swearin&rsquo; about the country for twenty minutes
    or so, and then he came spurrin&rsquo; and cursin&rsquo; in from the other
    end of the clearin&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you been all this time?&rsquo; I said, as the horse
    came curvin&rsquo; up like a boomerang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gulf country,&rsquo; said Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was a storm, Dave,&rsquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My oath!&rsquo; says Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get caught in it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Got to shelter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you&rsquo;re as dry&rsquo;s a bone, Dave!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave grinned. &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; he
    yelled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said that to the horse as it boomeranged off again and broke away
    through the scrub. I waited; but he didn&rsquo;t come back, and I reckoned
    he&rsquo;d got so far away before he could pull up that he didn&rsquo;t think
    it worth while comin&rsquo; back; so I went on. By-and-bye I got thinkin&rsquo;.
    Dave was as dry as a bone, and I knowed that he hadn&rsquo;t had time to
    get to shelter, for there wasn&rsquo;t a shed within twelve miles. He wasn&rsquo;t
    only dry, but his coat was creased and dusty too &mdash; same as if he&rsquo;d
    been sleepin&rsquo; in a holler log; and when I come to think of it, his
    face seemed thinner and whiter than it used ter, and so did his hands and
    wrists, which always stuck a long way out of his coat-sleeves; and there
    was blood on his face &mdash; but I thought he&rsquo;d got scratched with
    a twig. (Dave used to wear a coat three or four sizes too small for him,
    with sleeves that didn&rsquo;t come much below his elbows and a tail that
    scarcely reached his waist behind.) And his hair seemed dark and lank, instead
    of bein&rsquo; sandy and stickin&rsquo; out like an old fibre brush, as it
    used ter. And then I thought his voice sounded different, too. And, when
    I enquired next day, there was no one heard of Dave, and the chaps reckoned
    I must have been drunk, or seen his ghost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem all right at all &mdash; it worried me a lot.
    I couldn&rsquo;t make out how Dave kept dry; and the horse and saddle and
    saddle-cloth was wet. I told the chaps how he talked to me and what he said,
    and how he swore at the horse; but they only said it was Dave&rsquo;s ghost
    and nobody else&rsquo;s. I told &rsquo;em about him bein&rsquo; dry as a
    bone after gettin&rsquo; caught in that storm; but they only laughed and
    said it was a dry place where Dave went to. I talked and argued about it
    until the chaps began to tap their foreheads and wink &mdash; then I left
    off talking. But I didn&rsquo;t leave off thinkin&rsquo; &mdash; I always
    hated a mystery. Even Dave&rsquo;s father told me that Dave couldn&rsquo;t
    be alive or else his ghost wouldn&rsquo;t be round &mdash; he said he knew
    Dave better than that. One or two fellers did turn up afterwards that had
    seen Dave about the time that I did &mdash; and then the chaps said they
    was sure that Dave was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But one fine day, as a lot of us chaps was playin&rsquo; pitch and
    toss at the shanty, one of the fellers yelled out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Gee! Here comes Dave Regan!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I looked up and saw Dave himself, sidlin&rsquo; out of a cloud
    of dust on a long lanky horse. He rode into the stockyard, got down, hung
    his horse up to a post, put up the rails, and then come slopin&rsquo; towards
    us with a half-acre grin on his face. Dave had long, thin bow-legs, and when
    he was on the ground he moved as if he was on roller skates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;El-lo, Dave!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are yer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;How the blazes are
    you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I, shakin&rsquo; hands. &lsquo;How
    are yer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m all right!&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;How are yer
    poppin&rsquo; up!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, when we&rsquo;d got all that settled, and the other chaps had
    asked how he was, he said: &lsquo;Ah, well! Let&rsquo;s have a drink.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And all the other chaps crawfished up and flung themselves round
    the corner and sidled into the bar after Dave. We had a lot of talk, and
    he told us that he&rsquo;d been down before, but had gone away without seein&rsquo; any
    of us, except me, because he&rsquo;d suddenly heard of a mob of cattle at
    a station two hundred miles away; and after a while I took him aside and
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Dave! Do you remember the day I met you after the
    storm?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He scratched his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you get under shelter that day?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why &mdash; no.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then how the blazes didn&rsquo;t yer get wet?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave grinned; then he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, when I seen the storm coming I took off me clothes and
    stuck &rsquo;em in a holler log till the rain was over.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he says, after the other coves had done laughin&rsquo;,
    but before I&rsquo;d done thinking; &lsquo;I kept my clothes dry and got
    a good refreshin&rsquo;  shower-bath into the bargain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he scratched the back of his neck with his little finger, and
    dropped his jaw, and thought a bit; then he rubbed the top of his head and
    his shoulder, reflective-like, and then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t reckon for them there blanky hailstones.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="NoPlaceforaWoman"></a>No Place for a Woman</b></h2>
  <p>He had a selection on a long box-scrub siding of the ridges, about half
    a mile back and up from the coach road. There were no neighbours that I ever
    heard of, and the nearest &ldquo;town&rdquo; was thirty miles away. He grew
    wheat among the stumps of his clearing, sold the crop standing to a Cockie
    who lived ten miles away, and had some surplus sons; or, some seasons, he
    reaped it by hand, had it thrashed by travelling &ldquo;steamer&rdquo; (portable
    steam engine and machine), and carried the grain, a few bags at a time, into
    the mill on his rickety dray.</p>
  <p>He had lived alone for upwards of 15 years, and was known to those who knew
    him as &ldquo;Ratty Howlett&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Trav&rsquo;lers and strangers failed to see anything uncommonly ratty about
    him. It was known, or, at least, it was believed, without question, that
    while at work he kept his horse saddled and bridled, and hung up to the fence,
    or grazing about, with the saddle on&mdash;or, anyway, close handy for a
    moment&rsquo;s notice&mdash;and whenever he caught sight, over the scrub
    and through the quarter-mile break in it, of a traveller on the road, he
    would jump on his horse and make after him. If it was a horseman he usually
    pulled him up inside of a mile. Stories were told of unsuccessful chases,
    misunderstandings, and complications arising out of Howlett&rsquo;s mania
    for running down and bailing up travellers. Sometimes he caught one every
    day for a week, sometimes not one for weeks&mdash;it was a lonely track.</p>
  <p>The explanation was simple, sufficient, and perfectly natural&mdash;from
    a bushman&rsquo;s point of view. Ratty only wanted to have a yarn. He and
    the traveller would camp in the shade for half an hour or so and yarn and
    smoke. The old man would find out where the traveller came from, and how
    long he&rsquo;d been there, and where he was making for, and how long he
    reckoned he&rsquo;d be away; and ask if there had been any rain along the
    traveller&rsquo;s back track, and how the country looked after the drought;
    and he&rsquo;d get the traveller&rsquo;s ideas on abstract questions&mdash; if
    he had any. If it was a footman (swagman), and he was short of tobacco, old
    Howlett always had half a stick ready for him. Sometimes, but very rarely,
    he&rsquo;d invite the swagman back to the hut for a pint of tea, or a bit
    of meat, flour, tea, or sugar, to carry him along the track.</p>
  <p>And, after the yarn by the road, they said, the old man would ride back,
    refreshed, to his lonely selection, and work on into the night as long as
    he could see his solitary old plough horse, or the scoop of his long-handled
    shovel.</p>
  <p>And so it was that I came to make his acquaintance&mdash;or, rather, that
    he made mine. I was cantering easily along the track &mdash;I was making
    for the north-west with a pack horse&mdash;when about a mile beyond the track
    to the selection I heard, &ldquo;Hi, Mister!&rdquo; and saw a dust cloud
    following me. I had heard of &ldquo;Old Ratty Howlett&rdquo; casually, and
    so was prepared for him.</p>
  <p>A tall gaunt man on a little horse. He was clean-shaven, except for a frill
    beard round under his chin, and his long wavy, dark hair was turning grey;
    a square, strong-faced man, and reminded me of one full-faced portrait of
    Gladstone more than any other face I had seen. He had large reddish-brown
    eyes, deep set under heavy eyebrows, and with something of the blackfellow
    in them&mdash;the sort of eyes that will peer at something on the horizon
    that no one else can see. He had a way of talking to the horizon, too&mdash;more
    than to his companion; and he had a deep vertical wrinkle in his forehead
    that no smile could lessen.</p>
  <p>I got down and got out my pipe, and we sat on a log and yarned awhile on
    bush subjects; and then, after a pause, he shifted uneasily, it seemed to
    me, and asked rather abruptly, and in an altered tone, if I was married.
    A queer question to ask a traveller; more especially in my case, as I was
    little more than a boy then.</p>
  <p>He talked on again of old things and places where we had both been, and
    asked after men he knew, or had known&mdash;drovers and others&mdash;and
    whether they were living yet. Most of his inquiries went back before my time;
    but some of the drovers, one or two overlanders with whom he had been mates
    in his time, had grown old into mine, and I knew them. I notice now, though
    I didn&rsquo;t then&mdash;and if I had it would not have seemed strange from
    a bush point of view&mdash;that he didn&rsquo;t ask for news, nor seem interested
    in it.</p>
  <p>Then after another uneasy pause, during which he scratched crosses in the
    dust with a stick, he asked me, in the same queer tone and without looking
    at me or looking up, if I happened to know anything about doctoring&mdash;if
    I&rsquo;d ever studied it.</p>
  <p>I asked him if anyone was sick at his place. He hesitated, and said  &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then
    I wanted to know why he had asked me that question, and he was so long about
    answering that I began to think he was hard of hearing, when, at last, he
    muttered something about my face reminding him of a young fellow he knew
    of who&rsquo;d gone to Sydney to &ldquo;study for a doctor&rdquo;. That might
    have been, and looked natural enough; but why didn&rsquo;t he ask me straight
    out if I was the chap he &ldquo;knowed of&rdquo;? Travellers do not like
    beating about the bush in conversation.</p>
  <p>He sat in silence for a good while, with his arms folded, and looking absently
    away over the dead level of the great scrubs that spread from the foot of
    the ridge we were on to where a blue peak or two of a distant range showed
    above the bush on the horizon.</p>
  <p>I stood up and put my pipe away and stretched. Then he seemed to wake up. &ldquo;Better
    come back to the hut and have a bit of dinner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
    missus will about have it ready, and I&rsquo;ll spare you a handful of hay
    for the horses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hay decided it. It was a dry season. I was surprised to hear of a wife,
    for I thought he was a hatter&mdash;I had always heard so; but perhaps I
    had been mistaken, and he had married lately; or had got a housekeeper. The
    farm was an irregularly-shaped clearing in the scrub, with a good many stumps
    in it, with a broken-down two-rail fence along the frontage, and logs and &ldquo;dog-leg&rdquo; the
    rest. It was about as lonely-looking a place as I had seen, and I had seen
    some out-of-the-way, God-forgotten holes where men lived alone. The hut was
    in the top corner, a two-roomed slab hut, with a shingle roof, which must
    have been uncommon round there in the days when that hut was built. I was
    used to bush carpentering, and saw that the place had been put up by a man
    who had plenty of life and hope in front of him, and for someone else beside
    himself. But there were two unfinished skilling rooms built on to the back
    of the hut; the posts, sleepers, and wall-plates had been well put up and
    fitted, and the slab walls were up, but the roof had never been put on. There
    was nothing but burrs and nettles inside those walls, and an old wooden bullock
    plough and a couple of yokes were dry-rotting across the back doorway. The
    remains of a straw-stack, some hay under a bark humpy, a small iron plough,
    and an old stiff coffin-headed grey draught horse, were all that I saw about
    the place.</p>
  <p>But there was a bit of a surprise for me inside, in the shape of a clean
    white tablecloth on the rough slab table which stood on stakes driven into
    the ground. The cloth was coarse, but it was a tablecloth &mdash;not a spare
    sheet put on in honour of unexpected visitors&mdash;and perfectly clean.
    The tin plates, pannikins, and jam tins that served as sugar bowls and salt
    cellars were polished brightly. The walls and fireplace were whitewashed,
    the clay floor swept, and clean sheets of newspaper laid on the slab mantleshelf
    under the row of biscuit tins that held the groceries. I thought that his
    wife, or housekeeper, or whatever she was, was a clean and tidy woman about
    a house. I saw no woman; but on the sofa &mdash;a light, wooden, batten one,
    with runged arms at the ends&mdash;lay a woman&rsquo;s dress on a lot of
    sheets of old stained and faded newspapers. He looked at it in a puzzled
    way, knitting his forehead, then took it up absently and folded it. I saw
    then that it was a riding skirt and jacket. He bundled them into the newspapers
    and took them into the bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wife was going on a visit down the creek this afternoon,&rdquo; he
    said rapidly and without looking at me, but stooping as if to have another
    look through the door at those distant peaks. &ldquo;I suppose she got tired
    o&rsquo; waitin&rsquo;, and went and took the daughter with her. But, never
    mind, the grub is ready.&rdquo; There was a camp-oven with a leg of mutton
    and potatoes sizzling in it on the hearth, and billies hanging over the fire.
    I noticed the billies had been scraped, and the lids polished.</p>
  <p>There seemed to be something queer about the whole business, but then he
    and his wife might have had a &ldquo;breeze&rdquo; during the morning. I
    thought so during the meal, when the subject of women came up, and he said
    one never knew how to take a woman, etc.; but there was nothing in what he
    said that need necessarily have referred to his wife or to any woman in particular.
    For the rest he talked of old bush things, droving, digging, and old bushranging&mdash;but
    never about live things and living men, unless any of the old mates he talked
    about happened to be alive by accident. He was very restless in the house,
    and never took his hat off.</p>
  <p>There was a dress and a woman&rsquo;s old hat hanging on the wall near the
    door, but they looked as if they might have been hanging there for a lifetime.
    There seemed something queer about the whole place&mdash;something wanting;
    but then all out-of-the-way bush homes are haunted by that something wanting,
    or, more likely, by the spirits of the things that should have been there,
    but never had been.</p>
  <p>As I rode down the track to the road I looked back and saw old Howlett hard
    at work in a hole round a big stump with his long-handled shovel.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d noticed that he moved and walked with a slight list to port, and
    put his hand once or twice to the small of his back, and I set it down to
    lumbago, or something of that sort.</p>
  <p>Up in the Never Never I heard from a drover who had known Howlett that his
    wife had died in the first year, and so this mysterious woman, if she was
    his wife, was, of course, his second wife. The drover seemed surprised and
    rather amused at the thought of old Howlett going in for matrimony again.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I rode back that way five years later, from the Never Never. It was early
    in the morning&mdash;I had ridden since midnight. I didn&rsquo;t think the
    old man would be up and about; and, besides, I wanted to get on home, and
    have a look at the old folk, and the mates I&rsquo;d left behind&mdash;and
    the girl. But I hadn&rsquo;t got far past the point where Howlett&rsquo;s
    track joined the road, when I happened to look back, and saw him on horseback,
    stumbling down the track. I waited till he came up.</p>
  <p>He was riding the old grey draught horse this time, and it looked very much
    broken down. I thought it would have come down every step, and fallen like
    an old rotten humpy in a gust of wind. And the old man was not much better
    off. I saw at once that he was a very sick man. His face was drawn, and he
    bent forward as if he was hurt. He got down stiffly and awkwardly, like a
    hurt man, and as soon as his feet touched the ground he grabbed my arm, or
    he would have gone down like a man who steps off a train in motion. He hung
    towards the bank of the road, feeling blindly, as it were, for the ground,
    with his free hand, as I eased him down. I got my blanket and calico from
    the pack saddle to make him comfortable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help me with my back agen the tree,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must
    sit up&mdash; it&rsquo;s no use lyin&rsquo; me down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat with his hand gripping his side, and breathed painfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I run up to the hut and get the wife?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He spoke painfully. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Then, as if the
    words were jerked out of him by a spasm: &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I took it that she had left him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been bad? How long has this been coming on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took no notice of the question. I thought it was a touch of rheumatic
    fever, or something of that sort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone into my back and
    sides now&mdash;the pain&rsquo;s worse in me back,&rdquo; he said presently.</p>
  <p>I had once been mates with a man who died suddenly of heart disease, while
    at work. He was washing a dish of dirt in the creek near a claim we were
    working; he let the dish slip into the water, fell back, crying, &ldquo;O,
    my back!&rdquo; and was gone. And now I felt by instinct that it was poor
    old Howlett&rsquo;s heart that was wrong. A man&rsquo;s heart is in his back
    as well as in his arms and hands.</p>
  <p>The old man had turned pale with the pallor of a man who turns faint in
    a heat wave, and his arms fell loosely, and his hands rocked helplessly with
    the knuckles in the dust. I felt myself turning white, too, and the sick,
    cold, empty feeling in my stomach, for I knew the signs. Bushmen stand in
    awe of sickness and death.</p>
  <p>But after I&rsquo;d fixed him comfortably and given him a drink from the
    water bag the greyness left his face, and he pulled himself together a bit;
    he drew up his arms and folded them across his chest. He let his head rest
    back against the tree&mdash;his slouch hat had fallen off revealing a broad,
    white brow, much higher than I expected. He seemed to gaze on the azure fin
    of the range, showing above the dark blue-green bush on the horizon.</p>
  <p>Then he commenced to speak&mdash;taking no notice of me when I asked him
    if he felt better now&mdash;to talk in that strange, absent, far-away tone
    that awes one. He told his story mechanically, monotonously&mdash;in set
    words, as I believe now, as he had often told it before; if not to others,
    then to the loneliness of the bush. And he used the names of people and places
    that I had never heard of&mdash;just as if I knew them as well as he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to bring her up the first year. It was no place
    for a woman. I wanted her to stay with her people and wait till I&rsquo;d
    got the place a little more ship-shape. The Phippses took a selection down
    the creek. I wanted her to wait and come up with them so&rsquo;s she&rsquo;d
    have some company&mdash; a woman to talk to. They came afterwards, but they
    didn&rsquo;t stop. It was no place for a woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mary would come. She wouldn&rsquo;t stop with her people down
    country. She wanted to be with me, and look after me, and work and help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He repeated himself a great deal&mdash;said the same thing over and over
    again sometimes. He was only mad on one track. He&rsquo;d tail off and sit
    silent for a while; then he&rsquo;d become aware of me in a hurried, half-scared
    way, and apologise for putting me to all that trouble, and thank me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    be all right d&rsquo;reckly. Best take the horses up to the hut and have
    some breakfast; you&rsquo;ll find it by the fire. I&rsquo;ll foller you,
    d&rsquo;reckly. The wife&rsquo;ll be waitin&rsquo; an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
    would drop off, and be going again presently on the old track:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her mother was coming up to stay awhile at the end of the year, but
    the old man hurt his leg. Then her married sister was coming, but one of
    the youngsters got sick and there was trouble at home. I saw the doctor in
    the town&mdash;thirty miles from here&mdash;and fixed it up with him. He
    was a boozer&mdash;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him afterwards. I fixed up with
    a woman in the town to come and stay. I thought Mary was wrong in her time.
    She must have been a month or six weeks out. But I listened to her. . . .
    Don&rsquo;t argue with a woman. Don&rsquo;t listen to a woman. Do the right
    thing. We should have had a mother woman to talk to us. But it was no place
    for a woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rocked his head, as if from some old agony of mind, against the tree-trunk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was took bad suddenly one night, but it passed off. False alarm.
    I was going to ride somewhere, but she said to wait till daylight. Someone
    was sure to pass. She was a brave and sensible girl, but she had a terror
    of being left alone. It was no place for a woman!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a black shepherd three or four miles away. I rode over
    while Mary was asleep, and started the black boy into town. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a
    shot him afterwards if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a caught him. The old black gin was
    dead the week before, or Mary would a&rsquo; bin alright. She was tied up
    in a bunch with strips of blanket and greenhide, and put in a hole. So there
    wasn&rsquo;t even a gin near the place. It was no place for a woman!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was watchin&rsquo; the road at daylight, and I was watchin&rsquo; the
    road at dusk. I went down in the hollow and stooped down to get the gap agen
    the sky, so&rsquo;s I could see if anyone was comin&rsquo; over. . . . I&rsquo;d
    get on the horse and gallop along towards the town for five miles, but something
    would drag me back, and then I&rsquo;d race for fear she&rsquo;d die before
    I got to the hut. I expected the doctor every five minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It come on about daylight next morning. I ran back&rsquo;ards and
    for&rsquo;ards between the hut and the road like a madman. And no one come.
    I was running amongst the logs and stumps, and fallin&rsquo; over them, when
    I saw a cloud of dust agen sunrise. It was her mother an&rsquo; sister in
    the spring-cart, an&rsquo; just catchin&rsquo; up to them was the doctor
    in his buggy with the woman I&rsquo;d arranged with in town. The mother and
    sister was staying at the town for the night, when they heard of the black
    boy. It took him a day to ride there. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a
    caught him ever after. The doctor&rsquo;d been on the drunk. If I&rsquo;d
    had the gun and known she was gone I&rsquo;d have shot him in the buggy.
    They said she was dead. And the child was dead, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They blamed me, but I didn&rsquo;t want her to come; it was no place
    for a woman. I never saw them again after the funeral. I didn&rsquo;t want
    to see them any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He moved his head wearily against the tree, and presently drifted on again
    in a softer tone&mdash;his eyes and voice were growing more absent and dreamy
    and far away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a month after&mdash;or a year, I lost count of the time long
    ago&mdash;she came back to me. At first she&rsquo;d come in the night, then
    sometimes when I was at work&mdash;and she had the baby&mdash;it was a girl&mdash;in
    her arms. And by-and-bye she came to stay altogether. . . . I didn&rsquo;t
    blame her for going away that time&mdash;it was no place for a woman. . .
    . She was a good wife to me. She was a jolly girl when I married her. The
    little girl grew up like her. I was going to send her down country to be
    educated&mdash;it was no place for a girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a month, or a year, ago, Mary left me, and took the daughter,
    and never came back till last night&mdash;this morning, I think it was. I
    thought at first it was the girl with her hair done up, and her mother&rsquo;s
    skirt on, to surprise her old dad. But it was Mary, my wife&mdash;as she
    was when I married her. She said she couldn&rsquo;t stay, but she&rsquo;d
    wait for me on the road; on&mdash;the road. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His arms fell, and his face went white. I got the water-bag. &ldquo;Another
    turn like that and you&rsquo;ll be gone,&rdquo; I thought, as he came to
    again. Then I suddenly thought of a shanty that had been started, when I
    came that way last, ten or twelve miles along the road, towards the town.
    There was nothing for it but to leave him and ride on for help, and a cart
    of some kind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wait here till I come back,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
    for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He roused himself a little. &ldquo;Best come up to the hut and get some
    grub. The wife&rsquo;ll be waiting. . . .&rdquo; He was off the track again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you wait while I take the horse down to the creek?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the water-bag handy.
    Don&rsquo;t move till I come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t move&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the road,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I took the packhorse, which was the freshest and best, threw the pack-saddle
    and bags into a bush, left the other horse to take care of itself, and started
    for the shanty, leaving the old man with his back to the tree, his arms folded,
    and his eyes on the horizon.</p>
  <p>One of the chaps at the shanty rode on for the doctor at once, while the
    other came back with me in a spring-cart. He told me that old Howlett&rsquo;s
    wife had died in child-birth the first year on the selection&mdash;&ldquo;she
    was a fine girl he&rsquo;d heered!&rdquo; He told me the story as the old
    man had told it, and in pretty well the same words, even to giving it as
    his opinion that it was no place for a woman. &ldquo;And he &lsquo;hatted&rsquo; and
    brooded over it till he went ratty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew the rest. He not only thought that his wife, or the ghost of his
    wife, had been with him all those years, but that the child had lived and
    grown up, and that the wife did the housework; which, of course, he must
    have done himself.</p>
  <p>When we reached him his knotted hands had fallen for the last time, and
    they were at rest. I only took one quick look at his face, but could have
    sworn that he was gazing at the blue fin of the range on the horizon of the
    bush.</p>
  <p>Up at the hut the table was set as on the first day I saw it, and breakfast
    in the camp-oven by the fire.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MeetingOldMates"></a>Meeting Old Mates</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>I<br>
    Tom Smith</b></h3>
  <p>You are getting well on in the thirties, and haven&rsquo;t left off being
    a fool yet. You have been away in another colony or country for a year or
    so, and have now come back again. Most of your chums have gone away or got
    married, or, worse still, signed the pledge&mdash; settled down and got steady;
    and you feel lonely and desolate and left-behind enough for anything. While
    drifting aimlessly round town with an eye out for some chance acquaintance
    to have a knock round with, you run against an old chum whom you never dreamt
    of meeting, or whom you thought to be in some other part of the country&mdash; or
    perhaps you knock up against someone who knows the old chum in question,
    and he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Tom Smith&rsquo;s in Sydney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom Smith! Why, I thought he was in Queensland! I haven&rsquo;t seen
    him for more than three years. Where&rsquo;s the old joker hanging out at
    all? Why, except you, there&rsquo;s no one in Australia I&rsquo;d sooner
    see than Tom Smith. Here I&rsquo;ve been mooning round like an unemployed
    for three weeks, looking for someone to have a knock round with, and Tom
    in Sydney all the time. I wish I&rsquo;d known before. Where&rsquo;ll I run
    against him&mdash; where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s living at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s his home? I was never there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll give you his address. . . . There, I think that&rsquo;s
    it. I&rsquo;m not sure about the number, but you&rsquo;ll soon find out in
    that street&mdash; most of &rsquo;em&rsquo;ll know Tom Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks! I rather think they will. I&rsquo;m glad I met you. I&rsquo;ll
    hunt Tom up to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So you put a few shillings in your pocket, tell your landlady that you&rsquo;re
    going to visit an old aunt of yours or a sick friend, and mayn&rsquo;t be
    home that night; and then you start out to hunt up Tom Smith and have at
    least one more good night, if you die for it.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>This is the first time you have seen Tom at home; you knew of his home and
    people in the old days, but only in a vague, indefinite sort of way. Tom
    has changed! He is stouter and older-looking; he seems solemn and settled
    down. You intended to give him a surprise and have a good old jolly laugh
    with him, but somehow things get suddenly damped at the beginning. He grins
    and grips your hand right enough, but there seems something wanting. You
    can&rsquo;t help staring at him, and he seems to look at you in a strange,
    disappointing way; it doesn&rsquo;t strike you that you also have changed,
    and perhaps more in his eyes than he in yours. He introduces you to his mother
    and sisters and brothers, and the rest of the family; or to his wife, as
    the case may be; and you have to suppress your feelings and be polite and
    talk common-place. You hate to be polite and talk common-place. You aren&rsquo;t
    built that way&mdash; and Tom wasn&rsquo;t either, in the old days. The wife
    (or the mother and sisters) receives you kindly, for Tom&rsquo;s sake, and
    makes much of you; but they don&rsquo;t know you yet. You want to get Tom
    outside, and have a yarn and a drink and a laugh with him&mdash;you are bursting
    to tell him all about yourself, and get him to tell you all about himself,
    and ask him if he remembers things; and you wonder if he is bursting the
    same way, and hope he is. The old lady and sisters (or the wife) bore you
    pretty soon, and you wonder if they bore Tom; you almost fancy, from his
    looks, that they do. You wonder whether Tom is coming out to-night, whether
    he wants to get out, and if he wants to and wants to get out by himself,
    whether he&rsquo;ll be able to manage it; but you daren&rsquo;t broach the
    subject, it wouldn&rsquo;t be polite. You&rsquo;ve got to be polite. Then
    you get worried by the thought that Tom is bursting to get out with you and
    only wants an excuse; is waiting, in fact, and hoping for you to ask him
    in an off-hand sort of way to come out for a stroll. But you&rsquo;re not
    quite sure; and besides, if you were, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the courage.
    By-and-bye you get tired of it all, thirsty, and want to get out in the open
    air. You get tired of saying,  &ldquo;Do you really, Mrs. Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do
    you think so, Miss Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You were quite right, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Well,
    I think so too, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; or, to the brother,  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    just what I thought, Mr. Smith.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;talk
    pretty&rdquo; to them, and listen to their wishy-washy nonsense; you want
    to get out and have a roaring spree with Tom, as you had in the old days;
    you want to make another night of it with your old mate, Tom Smith; and pretty
    soon you get the blues badly, and feel nearly smothered in there, and you&rsquo;ve
    got to get out and have a beer anyway&mdash;Tom or no Tom; and you begin
    to feel wild with Tom himself; and at last you make a bold dash for it and
    chance Tom. You get up, look at your hat, and say: &ldquo;Ah, well, I must
    be going, Tom; I&rsquo;ve got to meet someone down the street at seven o&rsquo;clock.
    Where&rsquo;ll I meet you in town next week?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Tom says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dash it; you ain&rsquo;t going yet. Stay to tea, Joe, stay to
    tea. It&rsquo;ll be on the table in a minute. Sit down&mdash;sit down, man!
    Here, gimme your hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Tom&rsquo;s sister, or wife, or mother comes in with an apron on and
    her hands all over flour, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not going yet, Mr. Brown? Tea&rsquo;ll be ready
    in a minute. Do stay for tea.&rdquo; And if you make excuses, she cross-examines
    you about the time you&rsquo;ve got to keep that appointment down the street,
    and tells you that their clock is twenty minutes fast, and that you have
    got plenty of time, and so you have to give in. But you are mightily encouraged
    by a winksome expression which you see, or fancy you see, on your side of
    Tom&rsquo;s face; also by the fact of his having accidentally knocked his
    foot against your shins. So you stay.</p>
  <p>One of the females tells you to &ldquo;Sit there, Mr. Brown,&rdquo; and
    you take your place at the table, and the polite business goes on. You&rsquo;ve
    got to hold your knife and fork properly, and mind your p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s,
    and when she says, &ldquo;Do you take milk and sugar, Mr. Brown?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve
    got to say, &ldquo;Yes, please, Miss Smith&mdash;thanks&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    plenty.&rdquo; And when they press you, as they will, to have more, you&rsquo;ve
    got to keep on saying, &ldquo;No, thanks, Mrs. Smith; no, thanks, Miss Smith;
    I really couldn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ve done very well, thank you; I had a very
    late dinner, and so on&rdquo;&mdash;bother such tommy-rot. And you don&rsquo;t
    seem to have any appetite, anyway. And you think of the days out on the track
    when you and Tom sat on your swags under a mulga at mid-day, and ate mutton
    and johnny-cake with clasp-knives, and drank by turns out of the old, battered,
    leaky billy.</p>
  <p>And after tea you have to sit still while the precious minutes are wasted,
    and listen and sympathize, while all the time you are on the fidget to get
    out with Tom, and go down to a private bar where you know some girls.</p>
  <p>And perhaps by-and-bye the old lady gets confidential, and seizes an opportunity
    to tell you what a good steady young fellow Tom is now that he never touches
    drink, and belongs to a temperance society (or the Y.M.C.A.), and never stays
    out of nights.</p>
  <p>Consequently you feel worse than ever, and lonelier, and sorrier that you
    wasted your time coming. You are encouraged again by a glimpse of Tom putting
    on a clean collar and fixing himself up a bit; but when you are ready to
    go, and ask him if he&rsquo;s coming a bit down the street with you, he says
    he thinks he will in such a disinterested, don&rsquo;t-mind-if-I-do sort
    of tone, that he makes you mad.</p>
  <p>At last, after promising to &ldquo;drop in again, Mr. Brown, whenever you&rsquo;re
    passing,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget to call,&rdquo; and thanking
    them for their assurance that they&rsquo;ll &ldquo;be always glad to see
    you,&rdquo; and telling them that you&rsquo;ve spent a very pleasant evening
    and enjoyed yourself, and are awfully sorry you couldn&rsquo;t stay&mdash;you
    get away with Tom.</p>
  <p>You don&rsquo;t say much to each other till you get round the corner and
    down the street a bit, and then for a while your conversation is mostly common-place,
    such as, &ldquo;Well, how have you been getting on all this time, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
    all right. How have you been getting on?&rdquo; and so on.</p>
  <p>But presently, and perhaps just as you have made up your mind to chance
    the alleged temperance business and ask Tom in to have a drink, he throws
    a glance up and down the street, nudges your shoulder, says &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; and
    disappears sideways into a pub.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Joe?&rdquo; &ldquo;The
    same for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s luck, old man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
    luck.&rdquo; You take a drink, and look over your glass at Tom. Then the
    old smile spreads over his face, and it makes you glad&mdash;you could swear
    to Tom&rsquo;s grin in a hundred years. Then something tickles him&mdash;your
    expression, perhaps, or a recollection of the past&mdash;and he sets down
    his glass on the bar and laughs. Then you laugh. Oh, there&rsquo;s no smile
    like the smile that old mates favour each other with over the tops of their
    glasses when they meet again after years. It is eloquent, because of the
    memories that give it birth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another. Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;? Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Oh,
    it all comes back again like a flash. Tom hasn&rsquo;t changed a bit; just
    the same good-hearted, jolly idiot he always was. Old times back again! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    just like old times,&rdquo; says Tom, after three or four more drinks.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>And so you make a night of it and get uproariously jolly. You get as  &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; as
    Bobby Burns did in the part of Tam O&rsquo;Shanter, and have a better &ldquo;time&rdquo;  than
    any of the times you had in the old days. And you see Tom as nearly home
    in the morning as you dare, and he reckons he&rsquo;ll get it hot from his
    people&mdash;which no doubt he will&mdash; and he explains that they are
    very particular up at home &mdash;church people, you know&mdash;and, of course,
    especially if he&rsquo;s married, it&rsquo;s understood between you that
    you&rsquo;d better not call for him up at home after this&mdash;at least,
    not till things have cooled down a bit. It&rsquo;s always the way. The friend
    of the husband always gets the blame in cases like this. But Tom fixes up
    a yarn to tell them, and you aren&rsquo;t to &ldquo;say anything different&rdquo; in
    case you run against any of them. And he fixes up an appointment with you
    for next Saturday night, and he&rsquo;ll get there if he gets divorced for
    it. But he <i>might</i> have to take the wife out shopping, or one of the
    girls somewhere; and if you see her with him you&rsquo;ve got to lay low,
    and be careful, and wait &mdash;at another hour and place, perhaps, all of
    which is arranged&mdash;  for if she sees you she&rsquo;ll smell a rat at
    once, and he won&rsquo;t be able to get off at all.</p>
  <p>And so, as far as you and Tom are concerned, the &ldquo;old times&rdquo; have
    come back once more.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But, of course (and we almost forgot it), you might chance to fall in love
    with one of Tom&rsquo;s sisters, in which case there would be another and
    a totally different story to tell.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II<br>
    Jack Ellis</b></h3>
  <p>Things are going well with you. You have escaped from &ldquo;the track&rdquo;,
    so to speak, and are in a snug, comfortable little billet in the city. Well,
    while doing the block you run against an old mate of other days&mdash;<i>very</i> other
    days&mdash;call him Jack Ellis. Things have gone hard with Jack. He knows
    you at once, but makes no advance towards a greeting; he acts as though he
    thinks you might cut him&mdash;which, of course, if you are a true mate,
    you have not the slightest intention of doing. His coat is yellow and frayed,
    his hat is battered and green, his trousers &ldquo;gone&rdquo;  in various
    places, his linen very cloudy, and his boots burst and innocent of polish.
    You try not to notice these things &mdash;or rather, not to seem to notice
    them&mdash;but you cannot help doing so, and you are afraid he&rsquo;ll notice
    that you see these things, and put a wrong construction on it. How men will
    misunderstand each other! You greet him with more than the necessary enthusiasm.
    In your anxiety to set him at his ease and make him believe that nothing&mdash;not
    even money&mdash;can make a difference in your friendship, you over-act the
    business; and presently you are afraid that he&rsquo;ll notice that too,
    and put a wrong construction on it. You wish that your collar was not so
    clean, nor your clothes so new. Had you known you would meet him, you would
    have put on some old clothes for the occasion.</p>
  <p>You are both embarrassed, but it is <i>you</i> who feel ashamed&mdash; you
    are almost afraid to look at him lest he&rsquo;ll think you are looking at
    his shabbiness. You ask him in to have a drink, but he doesn&rsquo;t respond
    so heartily as you wish, as he did in the old days; he doesn&rsquo;t like
    drinking with anybody when he isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, as he calls
    it&mdash; when he can&rsquo;t shout.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t matter in the old days who held the money so long as there
    was plenty of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in the camp. You think of the days when
    Jack stuck to you through thick and thin. You would like to give him money
    now, but he is so proud; he always was; he makes you mad with his beastly
    pride. There wasn&rsquo;t any pride of that sort on the track or in the camp
    in those days; but times have changed&mdash;your lives have drifted too widely
    apart&mdash; you have taken different tracks since then; and Jack, without
    intending to, makes you feel that it is so.</p>
  <p>You have a drink, but it isn&rsquo;t a success; it falls flat, as far as
    Jack is concerned; he won&rsquo;t have another; he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel
    on&rdquo;, and presently he escapes under plea of an engagement, and promises
    to see you again.</p>
  <p>And you wish that the time was come when no one could have more or less
    to spend than another.</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;I met an old mate of that description once, and so successfully
    persuaded him out of his beastly pride that he borrowed two pounds off me
    till Monday. I never got it back since, and I want it badly at the present
    time. In future I&rsquo;ll leave old mates with their pride unimpaired.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ARoughShed"></a>&ldquo;A Rough Shed&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>A hot, breathless, blinding sunrise&mdash;the sun having appeared suddenly
    above the ragged edge of the barren scrub like a great disc of molten steel.
    No hint of a morning breeze before it, no sign on earth or sky to show that
    it is morning&mdash;save the position of the sun.</p>
  <p>A clearing in the scrub&mdash;bare as though the surface of the earth were
    ploughed and harrowed, and dusty as the road. Two oblong huts &mdash;one
    for the shearers and one for the rouseabouts&mdash; in about the centre of
    the clearing (as if even the mongrel scrub had shrunk away from them) built
    end-to-end, of weatherboards, and roofed with galvanised iron. Little ventilation;
    no verandah; no attempt to create, artificially, a breath of air through
    the buildings. Unpainted, sordid&mdash;hideous. Outside, heaps of ashes still
    hot and smoking. Close at hand, &ldquo;butcher&rsquo;s shop&rdquo;&mdash;a
    bush and bag breakwind in the dust, under a couple of sheets of iron, with
    offal, grease and clotted blood blackening the surface of the ground about
    it. Greasy, stinking sheepskins hanging everywhere with blood-blotched sides
    out. Grease inches deep in great black patches about the fireplace ends of
    the huts, where wash-up and &ldquo;boiling&rdquo; water is thrown.</p>
  <p>Inside, a rough table on supports driven into the black, greasy ground floor,
    and formed of flooring boards, running on uneven lines the length of the
    hut from within about 6ft. of the fire-place. Lengths of single six-inch
    boards or slabs on each side, supported by the projecting ends of short pieces
    of timber nailed across the legs of the table to serve as seats.</p>
  <p>On each side of the hut runs a rough framework, like the partitions in a
    stable; each compartment battened off to about the size of a manger, and
    containing four bunks, one above the other, on each side&mdash; their ends,
    of course, to the table. Scarcely breathing space anywhere between. Fireplace,
    the full width of the hut in one end, where all the cooking and baking for
    forty or fifty men is done, and where flour, sugar, etc., are kept in open
    bags. Fire, like a very furnace. Buckets of tea and coffee on roasting beds
    of coals and ashes on the hearth. Pile of &ldquo;brownie&rdquo;  on the bare
    black boards at the end of the table. Unspeakable aroma of forty or fifty
    men who have little inclination and less opportunity to wash their skins,
    and who soak some of the grease out of their clothes &mdash;in buckets of
    hot water&mdash;on Saturday afternoons or Sundays. And clinging to all, and
    over all, the smell of the dried, stale yolk of wool &mdash;the stink of
    rams!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a rouseabout of the rouseabouts. I have fallen so far that it
    is beneath me to try to climb to the proud position of &lsquo;ringer&rsquo; of
    the shed. I had that ambition once, when I was the softest of green hands;
    but then I thought I could work out my salvation and go home. I&rsquo;ve
    got used to hell since then. I only get twenty-five shillings a week (less
    station store charges) and tucker here. I have been seven years west of the
    Darling and never shore a sheep. Why don&rsquo;t I learn to shear, and so
    make money? What should I do with more money? Get out of this and go home?
    I would never go home unless I had enough money to keep me for the rest of
    my life, and I&rsquo;ll never make that Out Back. Otherwise, what should
    I do at home? And how should I account for the seven years, if I were to
    go home? Could I describe shed life to them and explain how I lived. They
    think shearing only takes a few days of the year&mdash;at the beginning of
    summer. They&rsquo;d want to know how I lived the rest of the year. Could
    I explain that I &lsquo;jabbed trotters&rsquo; and was a &lsquo;tea-and-sugar
    burglar&rsquo; between sheds. They&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d been a tramp and
    a beggar all the time. Could I explain <i>anything</i> so that they&rsquo;d
    understand? I&rsquo;d have to be lying all the time and would soon be tripped
    up and found out. For, whatever else I have been I was never much of a liar.
    No, I&rsquo;ll never go home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I become momentarily conscious about daylight. The flies on the track
    got me into that habit, I think; they start at day-break&mdash; when the
    mosquitoes give over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cook rings a bullock bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cook is fire-proof. He is as a fiend from the nethermost sheol
    and needs to be. No man sees him sleep, for he makes bread &mdash;or worse,
    brownie&mdash;at night, and he rings a bullock bell loudly at half-past five
    in the morning to rouse us from our animal torpors. Others, the sheep-ho&rsquo;s
    or the engine-drivers at the shed or wool-wash, call him, if he does sleep.
    They manage it in shifts, somehow, and sleep somewhere, sometime. We haven&rsquo;t
    time to know. The cook rings the bullock bell and yells the time. It was
    the same time five minutes ago&mdash;or a year ago. No time to decide which.
    I dash water over my head and face and slap handfuls on my eyelids &mdash;gummed
    over aching eyes&mdash;still blighted by the yolk o&rsquo; wool&mdash; grey,
    greasy-feeling water from a cut-down kerosene tin which I sneaked from the
    cook and hid under my bunk and had the foresight to refill from the cask
    last night, under cover of warm, still, suffocating darkness. Or was it the
    night before last? Anyhow, it will be sneaked from me to-day, and from the
    crawler who will collar it to-morrow, and &lsquo;touched&rsquo;  and &lsquo;lifted&rsquo; and &lsquo;collared&rsquo; and
    recovered by the cook, and sneaked back again, and cause foul language, and
    fights, maybe, till we &lsquo;cut-out&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; we didn&rsquo;t have sweet dreams of home and mother, gentle
    poet&mdash; nor yet of babbling brooks and sweethearts, and love&rsquo;s
    young dream. We are too dirty and dog-tired when we tumble down, and have
    too little time to sleep it off. We don&rsquo;t want to dream those dreams
    out here&mdash; they&rsquo;d only be nightmares for us, and we&rsquo;d wake
    to remember. We <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> remember here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the edge of the timber a great galvanised-iron shed, nearly all
    roof, coming down to within 6ft. 6in. of the &lsquo;board&rsquo; over the &lsquo;shoots&rsquo;.
    Cloud of red dust in the dead timber behind, going up&mdash;noon-day dust.
    Fence covered with skins; carcases being burned; blue smoke going straight
    up as in noonday. Great glossy (greasy-glossy) black crows &lsquo;flopping&rsquo; around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first syren has gone. We hurry in single files from opposite
    ends of rouseabouts&rsquo; and shearers&rsquo; huts (as the paths happen
    to run to the shed) gulping hot tea or coffee from a pint-pot in one hand
    and biting at a junk of brownie in the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shed of forty hands. Shearers rush the pens and yank out sheep and
    throw them like demons; grip them with their knees, take up machines, jerk
    the strings; and with a rattling whirring roar the great machine-shed starts
    for the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go it, you &mdash;&mdash; tigers!&rsquo; yells a tar-boy. &lsquo;Wool
    away!&rsquo; &lsquo;Tar!&rsquo; &lsquo;Sheep Ho!&rsquo; We rush through with
    a whirring roar till breakfast time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We seize our tin plate from the pile, knife and fork from the candle-box,
    and crowd round the camp-oven to jab out lean chops, dry as chips, boiled
    in fat. Chops or curry-and-rice. There is some growling and cursing. We slip
    into our places without removing our hats. There&rsquo;s no time to hunt
    for mislaid hats when the whistle goes. Row of hat brims, level, drawn over
    eyes, or thrust back&mdash;according to characters or temperaments. Thrust
    back denotes a lucky absence of brains, I fancy. Row of forks going up, or
    jabbing, or poised, loaded, waiting for last mouthful to be bolted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We pick up, sweep, tar, sew wounds, catch sheep that break from the
    pens, jump down and pick up those that can&rsquo;t rise at the bottom of
    the shoots, &lsquo;bring-my-combs-from-the-grinder-will-yer,&rsquo;  laugh
    at dirty jokes, and swear&mdash;and, in short, are the &lsquo;will-yer&rsquo; slaves,
    body and soul, of seven, six, five, or four shearers, according to the distance
    from the rolling tables.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The shearer on the board at the shed is a demon. He gets so much
    a hundred; we, 25s. a week. He is not supposed, by the rules of the shed,
    the Union, and humanity, to take a sheep out of the pen <i>after</i> the
    bell goes (smoke-ho, meals, or knock-off), but his watch is hanging on the
    post, and he times himself to get so many sheep out of the pen <i>before</i> the
    bell goes, and <i>one more</i>&mdash;the  &lsquo;bell-sheep&rsquo;&mdash;as
    it is ringing. We have to take the last fleece to the table and leave our
    board clean. We go through the day of eight hours in runs of about an hour
    and 20 minutes between smoke-ho&rsquo;s&mdash;from 6 to 6. If the shearers
    shore 200 instead of 100, they&rsquo;d get 2 Pounds a day instead of 1 Pound,
    and we&rsquo;d have twice as much work to do for our 25s. per week. But the
    shearers are racing each other for tallies. And it&rsquo;s no use kicking.
    There is no God here and no Unionism (though we all have tickets). But what
    am I growling about? I&rsquo;ve worked from 6 to 6 with no smoke-ho&rsquo;s
    for half the wages, and food we wouldn&rsquo;t give the sheep-ho dog. It&rsquo;s
    the bush growl, born of heat, flies, and dust. I&rsquo;d growl now if I had
    a thousand a year. We <i>must</i> growl, swear, and some of us drink to d.t.&rsquo;s,
    or go mad sober.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pants and shirts stiff with grease as though a couple of pounds of
    soft black putty were spread on with a painter&rsquo;s knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, gentle bard!&mdash;we don&rsquo;t sing at our work. Over the
    whirr and roar and hum all day long, and with iteration that is childish
    and irritating to the intelligent greenhand, float unthinkable adjectives
    and adverbs, addressed to jumbucks, jackaroos, and mates indiscriminately.
    And worse words for the boss over the board&mdash;behind his back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came of a Good Christian Family&mdash;perhaps that&rsquo;s why
    I went to the Devil. When I came out here I&rsquo;d shrink from the man who
    used foul language. In a short time I used it with the worst. I couldn&rsquo;t
    help it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it. If I went back to a woman&rsquo;s country
    again I wouldn&rsquo;t swear. I&rsquo;d forget this as I would a nightmare.
    That&rsquo;s the way of it. There&rsquo;s something of the larrikin about
    us. We don&rsquo;t exist individually. Off the board, away from the shed
    (and each other) we are quiet&mdash;even gentle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A great-horned ram, in poor condition, but shorn of a heavy fleece,
    picks himself up at the foot of the &lsquo;shoot&rsquo;, and hesitates, as
    if ashamed to go down to the other end where the ewes are. The most ridiculous
    object under Heaven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tar-boy of fifteen, of the bush, with a mouth so vile that a street-boy,
    same age (up with a shearing uncle), kicks him behind&mdash;having proved
    his superiority with his fists before the shed started. Of which unspeakable
    little fiend the roughest shearer of a rough shed was heard to say, in effect,
    that if he thought there was the slightest possibility of his becoming the
    father of such a boy he&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;take drastic measures to prevent
    the possibility of his becoming a proud parent at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twice a day the cooks and their familiars carry buckets of oatmeal-water
    and tea to the shed, two each on a yoke. We cry, &lsquo;Where are you coming
    to, my pretty maids?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In ten minutes the surfaces of the buckets are black with flies.
    We have given over trying to keep them clear. We stir the living cream aside
    with the bottoms of the pints, and guzzle gallons, and sweat it out again.
    Occasionally a shearer pauses and throws the perspiration from his forehead
    in a rain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shearers live in such a greedy rush of excitement that often a strong
    man will, at a prick of the shears, fall in a death-like faint on the board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We hate the Boss-of-the-Board as the shearers&rsquo; &lsquo;slushy&rsquo; hates
    the shearers&rsquo; cook. I don&rsquo;t know why. He&rsquo;s a very fair
    boss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He refused to put on a traveller yesterday, and the traveller knocked
    him down. He walked into the shed this morning with his hat back and thumbs
    in waistcoat&mdash;a tribute to man&rsquo;s weakness. He threatened to dismiss
    the traveller&rsquo;s mate, a bigger man, for rough shearing&mdash;a tribute
    to man&rsquo;s strength. The shearer said nothing. We hate the boss because
    he <i>is</i> boss, but we respect him because he is a strong man. He is as
    hard up as any of us, I hear, and has a sick wife and a large, small family
    in Melbourne. God judge us all!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a gambling-school here, headed by the shearers&rsquo; cook.
    After tea they head-&rsquo;em, and advance cheques are passed from hand to
    hand, and thrown in the dust until they are black. When it&rsquo;s too dark
    to see with nose to the ground, they go inside and gamble with cards. Sometimes
    they start on Saturday afternoon, heading &rsquo;em till dark, play cards
    all night, start again heading &rsquo;em Sunday afternoon, play cards all
    Sunday night, and sleep themselves sane on Monday, or go to work ghastly&mdash;like
    dead men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cry of &lsquo;Fight&rsquo;; we all rush out. But there isn&rsquo;t
    much fighting. Afraid of murdering each other. I&rsquo;m beginning to think
    that most bush crime is due to irritation born of dust, heat, and flies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The smothering atmosphere shudders when the sun goes down. We call
    it the sunset breeze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saturday night or Sunday we&rsquo;re invited into the shearers&rsquo; hut.
    There are songs that are not hymns and recitations and speeches that are
    not prayers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last Sunday night: Slush lamps at long intervals on table. Men playing
    cards, sewing on patches&mdash;(nearly all smoking)&mdash; some writing,
    and the rest reading Deadwood Dick. At one end of the table a Christian Endeavourer
    endeavouring; at the other a cockney Jew, from the hawker&rsquo;s boat, trying
    to sell rotten clothes. In response to complaints, direct and not chosen
    generally for Sunday, the shearers&rsquo;  rep. requests both apostles to
    shut up or leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be expected to take the Christian and leave the
    Jew, any more than he could take the Jew and leave the Christian. We are
    just amongst ourselves in our hell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A lost soul laughs (mine) and dreadful night smothers us.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="PayableGold"></a>Payable Gold</b></h2>
  <p>Among the crowds who left the Victorian side for New South Wales about the
    time Gulgong broke out was an old Ballarat digger named Peter McKenzie. He
    had married and retired from the mining some years previously and had made
    a home for himself and family at the village of St. Kilda, near Melbourne;
    but, as was often the case with old diggers, the gold fever never left him,
    and when the fields of New South Wales began to blaze he mortgaged his little
    property in order to raise funds for another campaign, leaving sufficient
    behind him to keep his wife and family in comfort for a year or so.</p>
  <p>As he often remarked, his position was now very different from what it had
    been in the old days when he first arrived from Scotland, in the height of
    the excitement following on the great discovery. He was a young man then
    with only himself to look out for, but now that he was getting old and had
    a family to provide for he had staked too much on this venture to lose. His
    position did certainly look like a forlorn hope, but he never seemed to think
    so.</p>
  <p>Peter must have been very lonely and low-spirited at times. A young or unmarried
    man can form new ties, and even make new sweethearts if necessary, but Peter&rsquo;s
    heart was with his wife and little ones at home, and they were mortgaged,
    as it were, to Dame Fortune. Peter had to lift this mortgage off.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless he was always cheerful, even at the worst of times, and his
    straight grey beard and scrubby brown hair encircled a smile which appeared
    to be a fixture. He had to make an effort in order to look grave, such as
    some men do when they want to force a smile.</p>
  <p>It was rumoured that Peter had made a vow never to return home until he
    could take sufficient wealth to make his all-important family comfortable,
    or, at least, to raise the mortgage from the property, for the sacrifice
    of which to his mad gold fever he never forgave himself. But this was one
    of the few things which Peter kept to himself.</p>
  <p>The fact that he had a wife and children at St. Kilda was well known to
    all the diggers. They had to know it, and if they did not know the age, complexion,
    history and peculiarities of every child and of the &ldquo;old woman&rdquo; it
    was not Peter&rsquo;s fault.</p>
  <p>He would cross over to our place and talk to the mother for hours about
    his wife and children. And nothing pleased him better than to discover peculiarities
    in us children wherein we resembled his own. It pleased us also for mercenary
    reasons.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same with my old woman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    just the same with my youngsters,&rdquo;  Peter would exclaim boisterously,
    for he looked upon any little similarity between the two families as a remarkable
    coincidence. He liked us all, and was always very kind to us, often standing
    between our backs and the rod that spoils the child&mdash;that is, I mean,
    if it isn&rsquo;t used. I was very short-tempered, but this failing was more
    than condoned by the fact that Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;eldest&rdquo; was given
    that way also. Mother&rsquo;s second son was very good-natured; so was Peter&rsquo;s
    third. Her &ldquo;third&rdquo; had a great aversion for any duty that threatened
    to increase his muscles; so had Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;second&rdquo;. Our baby
    was very fat and heavy and was given to sucking her own thumb vigorously,
    and, according to the latest bulletins from home, it was just the same with
    Peter&rsquo;s  &ldquo;last&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>I think we knew more about Peter&rsquo;s family than we did about our own.
    Although we had never seen them, we were as familiar with their features
    as the photographer&rsquo;s art could make us, and always knew their domestic
    history up to the date of the last mail.</p>
  <p>We became interested in the McKenzie family. Instead of getting bored by
    them as some people were, we were always as much pleased when Peter got a
    letter from home as he was himself, and if a mail were missed, which seldom
    happened&mdash;we almost shared his disappointment and anxiety. Should one
    of the youngsters be ill, we would be quite uneasy, on Peter&rsquo;s account,
    until the arrival of a later bulletin removed his anxiety, and ours.</p>
  <p>It must have been the glorious power of a big true heart that gained for
    Peter the goodwill and sympathy of all who knew him.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s smile had a peculiar fascination for us children. We would
    stand by his pointing forge when he&rsquo;d be sharpening picks in the early
    morning, and watch his face for five minutes at a time, wondering sometimes
    whether he was always <i>smiling inside</i>, or whether the smile went on
    externally irrespective of any variation in Peter&rsquo;s condition of mind.</p>
  <p>I think it was the latter case, for often when he had received bad news
    from home we have heard his voice quaver with anxiety, while the old smile
    played on his round, brown features just the same.</p>
  <p>Little Nelse (one of those queer old-man children who seem to come into
    the world by mistake, and who seldom stay long) used to say that Peter &ldquo;cried
    inside&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Once, on Gulgong, when he attended the funeral of an old Ballarat mate,
    a stranger who had been watching his face curiously remarked that McKenzie
    seemed as pleased as though the dead digger had bequeathed him a fortune.
    But the stranger had soon reason to alter his opinion, for when another old
    mate began in a tremulous voice to repeat the words &ldquo;Ashes to ashes,
    an&rsquo; dust to dust,&rdquo; two big tears suddenly burst from Peter&rsquo;s
    eyes, and hurried down to get entrapped in his beard.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s goldmining ventures were not successful. He sank three duffers
    in succession on Gulgong, and the fourth shaft, after paying expenses, left
    a little over a hundred to each party, and Peter had to send the bulk of
    his share home. He lived in a tent (or in a hut when he could get one) after
    the manner of diggers, and he &ldquo;did for himself&rdquo;, even to washing
    his own clothes. He never drank nor &ldquo;played&rdquo;, and he took little
    enjoyment of any kind, yet there was not a digger on the field who would
    dream of calling old Peter McKenzie &ldquo;a mean man&rdquo;. He lived, as
    we know from our own observations, in a most frugal manner. He always tried
    to hide this, and took care to have plenty of good things for us when he
    invited us to his hut; but children&rsquo;s eyes are sharp. Some said that
    Peter half-starved himself, but I don&rsquo;t think his family ever knew,
    unless he told them so afterwards.</p>
  <p>Ah, well! the years go over. Peter was now three years from home, and he
    and Fortune were enemies still. Letters came by the mail, full of little
    home troubles and prayers for Peter&rsquo;s return, and letters went back
    by the mail, always hopeful, always cheerful. Peter never gave up. When everything
    else failed he would work by the day (a sad thing for a digger), and he was
    even known to do a job of fencing until such time as he could get a few pounds
    and a small party together to sink another shaft.</p>
  <p>Talk about the heroic struggles of early explorers in a hostile country;
    but for dogged determination and courage in the face of poverty, illness,
    and distance, commend me to the old-time digger&mdash;the truest soldier
    Hope ever had!</p>
  <p>In the fourth year of his struggle Peter met with a terrible disappointment.
    His party put down a shaft called the Forlorn Hope near Happy Valley, and
    after a few weeks&rsquo; fruitless driving his mates jibbed on it. Peter
    had his own opinion about the ground&mdash;an old digger&rsquo;s opinion,
    and he used every argument in his power to induce his mates to put a few
    days&rsquo; more work in the claim. In vain he pointed out that the quality
    of the wash and the dip of the bottom exactly resembled that of the &ldquo;Brown
    Snake&rdquo;, a rich Victorian claim. In vain he argued that in the case
    of the abovementioned claim, not a colour could be got until the payable
    gold was actually reached. Home Rule and The Canadian and that cluster of
    fields were going ahead, and his party were eager to shift. They remained
    obstinate, and at last, half-convinced against his opinion, Peter left with
    them to sink the &ldquo;Iawatha&rdquo;, in Log Paddock, which turned out
    a rank duffer&mdash; not even paying its own expenses.</p>
  <p>A party of Italians entered the old claim and, after driving it a few feet
    further, made their fortune.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>We all noticed the change in Peter McKenzie when he came to &ldquo;Log Paddock&rdquo;,
    whither we had shifted before him. The old smile still flickered, but he
    had learned to &ldquo;look&rdquo; grave for an hour at a time without much
    effort. He was never quite the same after the affair of Forlorn Hope, and
    I often think how he must have &ldquo;cried&rdquo;  sometimes &ldquo;inside&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>However, he still read us letters from home, and came and smoked in the
    evening by our kitchen-fire. He showed us some new portraits of his family
    which he had received by a late mail, but something gave me the impression
    that the portraits made him uneasy. He had them in his possession for nearly
    a week before showing them to us, and to the best of our knowledge he never
    showed them to anybody else. Perhaps they reminded him of the flight of time&mdash;perhaps
    he would have preferred his children to remain just as he left them until
    he returned.</p>
  <p>But stay! there was one portrait that seemed to give Peter infinite pleasure.
    It was the picture of a chubby infant of about three years or more. It was
    a fine-looking child taken in a sitting position on a cushion, and arrayed
    in a very short shirt. On its fat, soft, white face, which was only a few
    inches above the ten very podgy toes, was a smile something like Peter&rsquo;s.
    Peter was never tired of looking at and showing the picture of his child&mdash;the
    child he had never seen. Perhaps he cherished a wild dream of making his
    fortune and returning home before <i>that</i> child grew up.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>McKenzie and party were sinking a shaft at the upper end of Log Paddock,
    generally called &ldquo;The other end&rdquo;. We were at the lower end.</p>
  <p>One day Peter came down from &ldquo;the other end&rdquo; and told us that
    his party expected to &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; during the following week, and
    if they got no encouragement from the wash they intended to go prospecting
    at the &ldquo;Happy Thought&rdquo;, near Specimen Flat.</p>
  <p>The shaft in Log Paddock was christened &ldquo;Nil Desperandum&rdquo;. Towards
    the end of the week we heard that the wash in the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; was showing
    good colours.</p>
  <p>Later came the news that &ldquo;McKenzie and party&rdquo; had bottomed on
    payable gold, and the red flag floated over the shaft. Long before the first
    load of dirt reached the puddling machine on the creek, the news was all
    round the diggings. The &ldquo;Nil Desperandum&rdquo; was a &ldquo;Golden
    Hole&rdquo;!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>We will not forget the day when Peter went home. He hurried down in the
    morning to have an hour or so with us before Cobb and Co. went by. He told
    us all about his little cottage by the bay at St. Kilda. He had never spoken
    of it before, probably because of the mortgage. He told us how it faced the
    bay&mdash;how many rooms it had, how much flower garden, and how on a clear
    day he could see from the window all the ships that came up to the Yarra,
    and how with a good telescope he could even distinguish the faces of the
    passengers on the big ocean liners.</p>
  <p>And then, when the mother&rsquo;s back was turned, he hustled us children
    round the corner, and surreptitiously slipped a sovereign into each of our
    dirty hands, making great pantomimic show for silence, for the mother was
    very independent.</p>
  <p>And when we saw the last of Peter&rsquo;s face setting like a good-humoured
    sun on the top of Cobb and Co.&rsquo;s, a great feeling of discontent and
    loneliness came over all our hearts. Little Nelse, who had been Peter&rsquo;s
    favourite, went round behind the pig-stye, where none might disturb him,
    and sat down on the projecting end of a trough to &ldquo;have a cry&rdquo;,
    in his usual methodical manner. But old &ldquo;Alligator Desolation&rdquo;,
    the dog, had suspicions of what was up, and, hearing the sobs, went round
    to offer whatever consolation appertained to a damp and dirty nose and a
    pair of ludicrously doleful yellow eyes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnOversightofSteelmans"></a>An Oversight of
      Steelman&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman and Smith&mdash;professional wanderers&mdash;were making back for
    Wellington, down through the wide and rather dreary-looking Hutt Valley.
    They were broke. They carried their few remaining belongings in two skimpy,
    amateurish-looking swags. Steelman had fourpence left. They were very tired
    and very thirsty&mdash;at least Steelman was, and he answered for both. It
    was Smith&rsquo;s policy to feel and think just exactly as Steelman did.
    Said Steelman:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The landlord of the next pub. is not a bad sort. I won&rsquo;t go
    in&mdash; he might remember me. You&rsquo;d best go in. You&rsquo;ve been
    tramping round in the Wairarapa district for the last six months, looking
    for work. You&rsquo;re going back to Wellington now, to try and get on the
    new corporation works just being started there&mdash;the sewage works. You
    think you&rsquo;ve got a show. You&rsquo;ve got some mates in Wellington,
    and they&rsquo;re looking out for a chance for you. You did get a job last
    week on a sawmill at Silverstream, and the boss sacked you after three days
    and wouldn&rsquo;t pay you a penny. That&rsquo;s just his way. I know him&mdash; at
    least a mate of mine does. I&rsquo;ve heard of him often enough. His name&rsquo;s
    Cowman. Don&rsquo;t forget the name, whatever you do. The landlord here hates
    him like poison; he&rsquo;ll sympathize with you. Tell him you&rsquo;ve got
    a mate with you; he&rsquo;s gone ahead&mdash;took a short cut across the
    paddocks. Tell him you&rsquo;ve got only fourpence left, and see if he&rsquo;ll
    give you a drop in a bottle. Says you: &lsquo;Well, boss, the fact is we&rsquo;ve
    only got fourpence, but you might let us have a drop in a bottle&rsquo;;
    and very likely he&rsquo;ll stand you a couple of pints in a gin-bottle.
    You can fling the coppers on the counter, but the chances are he won&rsquo;t
    take them. He&rsquo;s not a bad sort. Beer&rsquo;s fourpence a pint out here,
    same&rsquo;s in Wellington. See that gin-bottle lying there by the stump;
    get it and we&rsquo;ll take it down to the river with us and rinse it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They reached the river bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take my swag&mdash;it looks more decent,&rdquo; said
    Steelman. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do: we&rsquo;ll
    undo both swags and make them into one&mdash;one decent swag, and I&rsquo;ll
    cut round through the lanes and wait for you on the road ahead of the pub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rolled up the swag with much care and deliberation and considerable judgment.
    He fastened Smith&rsquo;s belt round one end of it, and the handkerchiefs
    round the other, and made a towel serve as a shoulder-strap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish we had a canvas bag to put it in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or
    a cover of some sort. But never mind. The landlord&rsquo;s an old Australian
    bushman, now I come to think of it; the swag looks Australian enough, and
    it might appeal to his feelings, you know&mdash;bring up old recollections.
    But you&rsquo;d best not say you come from Australia, because he&rsquo;s
    been there, and he&rsquo;d soon trip you up. He might have been where you&rsquo;ve
    been, you know, so don&rsquo;t try to do too much. You always do mug-up the
    business when you try to do more than I tell you. You might tell him your
    mate came from Australia&mdash;but no, he might want you to bring me in.
    Better stick to Maoriland. I don&rsquo;t believe in too much ornamentation.
    Plain lies are the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the landlord&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that. You don&rsquo;t want to know that. You are not supposed
    to know him at all. It might look suspicious if you called him by his name,
    and lead to awkward questions; then you&rsquo;d be sure to put your foot
    into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could say I read it over the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh. Travellers don&rsquo;t read the names over the doors, when
    they go into pubs. You&rsquo;re an entire stranger to him. Call him &lsquo;Boss&rsquo;.
    Say &lsquo;Good-day, Boss,&rsquo;  when you go in, and swing down your swag
    as if you&rsquo;re used to it. Ease it down like this. Then straighten yourself
    up, stick your hat back, and wipe your forehead, and try to look as hearty
    and independent and cheerful as you possibly can. Curse the Government, and
    say the country&rsquo;s done. It don&rsquo;t matter what Government it is,
    for he&rsquo;s always against it. I never knew a real Australian that wasn&rsquo;t.
    Say that you&rsquo;re thinking about trying to get over to Australia, and
    then listen to him talking about it&mdash; and try to look interested, too!
    Get that damned stone-deaf expression off your face! . . . He&rsquo;ll run
    Australia down most likely (I never knew an Other-sider that had settled
    down over here who didn&rsquo;t). But don&rsquo;t you make any mistake and
    agree with him, because, although successful Australians over here like to
    run their own country down, there&rsquo;s very few of them that care to hear
    anybody else do it. . . . Don&rsquo;t come away as soon as you get your beer.
    Stay and listen to him for a while, as if you&rsquo;re interested in his
    yarning, and give him time to put you on to a job, or offer you one. Give
    him a chance to ask how you and your mate are off for tobacco or tucker.
    Like as not he&rsquo;ll sling you half a crown when you come away&mdash;that
    is, if you work it all right. Now try to think of something to say to him,
    and make yourself a bit interesting&mdash;if you possibly can. Tell him about
    the fight we saw back at the pub. the other day. He might know some of the
    chaps. This is a sleepy hole, and there ain&rsquo;t much news knocking round.
    . . . I wish I could go in myself, but he&rsquo;s sure to remember <i>me</i>.
    I&rsquo;m afraid he got left the last time I stayed there (so did one or
    two others); and, besides, I came away without saying good-bye to him, and
    he might feel a bit sore about it. That&rsquo;s the worst of travelling on
    the old road. Come on now, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet I&rsquo;ll get a quart,&rdquo; said Smith, brightening up, &ldquo;and
    some tucker for it to wash down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stoush
    you. Never mind the bottle; fling it away. It doesn&rsquo;t look well for
    a traveller to go into a pub. with an empty bottle in his hand. A real swagman
    never does. It looks much better to come out with a couple of full ones.
    That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do. Now, come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman turned off into a lane, cut across the paddocks to the road again,
    and waited for Smith. He hadn&rsquo;t long to wait.</p>
  <p>Smith went on towards the public-house, rehearsing his part as he walked&mdash;  repeating
    his &ldquo;lines&rdquo; to himself, so as to be sure of remembering all that
    Steelman had told him to say to the landlord, and adding, with what he considered
    appropriate gestures, some fancy touches of his own, which he determined
    to throw in in spite of Steelman&rsquo;s advice and warning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    tell him (this)&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him (that). Well, look here, boss,
    I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re pretty right and I quite agree with you as far
    as that&rsquo;s concerned, but,&rdquo; &amp;c. And so, murmuring and mumbling
    to himself, Smith reached the hotel. The day was late, and the bar was small,
    and low, and dark. Smith walked in with all the assurance he could muster,
    eased down his swag in a corner in what he no doubt considered the true professional
    style, and, swinging round to the bar, said in a loud voice which he intended
    to be cheerful, independent, and hearty:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;boss&rdquo;. It was about the hardest-faced
    old woman that Smith had ever seen. The pub. had changed hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; stammered poor Smith.</p>
  <p>It was a knock-down blow for Smith. He couldn&rsquo;t come to time. He and
    Steelman had had a landlord in their minds all the time, and laid their plans
    accordingly; the possibility of having a she &mdash;and one like this&mdash;to
    deal with never entered into their calculations. Smith had no time to reorganise,
    even if he had had the brains to do so, without the assistance of his mate&rsquo;s
    knowledge of human nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>Painful pause. She sized him up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, missus&mdash;I&mdash;the fact is&mdash;will you give me a bottle
    of beer for fourpence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;&mdash;. The fact is, we&rsquo;ve only got fourpence
    left, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate outside, and you might let us have
    a quart or so, in a bottle, for that. I mean&mdash;anyway, you might let
    us have a pint. I&rsquo;m very sorry to bother you, missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she couldn&rsquo;t do it. No. Certainly not. Decidedly not! All her
    drinks were sixpence. She had her license to pay, and the rent, and a family
    to keep. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay out there&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t worth her
    while. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay the cost of carting the liquor out, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, missus,&rdquo; poor Smith blurted out at last, in sheer desperation,  &ldquo;give
    me what you can in a bottle for this. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate
    outside.&rdquo; And he put the four coppers on the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got a bottle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I give you one, will you bring it back? You can&rsquo;t expect
    me to give you a bottle as well as a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mum; I&rsquo;ll bring it back directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reached out a bottle from under the bar, and very deliberately measured
    out a little over a pint and poured it into the bottle, which she handed
    to Smith without a cork.</p>
  <p>Smith went his way without rejoicing. It struck him forcibly that he should
    have saved the money until they reached Petone, or the city, where Steelman
    would be sure to get a decent drink. But how was he to know? He had chanced
    it, and lost; Steelman might have done the same. What troubled Smith most
    was the thought of what Steelman would say; he already heard him, in imagination,
    saying: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mug, Smith&mdash; Smith, you <i>are</i> a mug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Steelman didn&rsquo;t say much. He was prepared for the worst by seeing
    Smith come along so soon. He listened to his story with an air of gentle
    sadness, even as a stern father might listen to the voluntary confession
    of a wayward child; then he held the bottle up to the fading light of departing
    day, looked through it (the bottle), and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t worth while dividing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith&rsquo;s heart shot right down through a hole in the sole of his left
    boot into the hard road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, handing him the bottle, &ldquo;drink
    it, old man; you want it. It wasn&rsquo;t altogether your fault; it was an
    oversight of mine. I didn&rsquo;t bargain for a woman of that kind, and,
    of course, <i>you</i> couldn&rsquo;t be expected to think of it. Drink it!
    Drink it down, Smith. I&rsquo;ll manage to work the oracle before this night
    is out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith was forced to believe his ears, and, recovering from his surprise,
    drank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promised to take back the bottle,&rdquo; he said, with the ghost
    of a smile.</p>
  <p>Steelman took the bottle by the neck and broke it on the fence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Smith; I&rsquo;ll carry the swag for a while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they tramped on in the gathering starlight.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HowSteelmantoldhisStory"></a>How Steelman told
      his Story</b></h2>
  <p>It was Steelman&rsquo;s humour, in some of his moods, to take Smith into
    his confidence, as some old bushmen do their dogs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nearly as good as an intelligent sheep-dog to talk to,
    Smith&mdash;  when a man gets tired of thinking to himself and wants a relief.
    You&rsquo;re a bit of a mug and a good deal of an idiot, and the chances
    are that you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m driving at half the time&mdash; that&rsquo;s
    the main reason why I don&rsquo;t mind talking to you. You ought to consider
    yourself honoured; it ain&rsquo;t every man I take into my confidence, even
    that far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith rubbed his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner talk to you&mdash;or a stump&mdash;any day than
    to one of those silent, suspicious, self-contained, worldly-wise chaps that
    listen to everything you say&mdash;sense and rubbish alike&mdash;as if you
    were trying to get them to take shares in a mine. I drop the man who listens
    to me all the time and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get bored. He isn&rsquo;t safe.
    He isn&rsquo;t to be trusted. He mostly wants to grind his axe against yours,
    and there&rsquo;s too little profit for me where there are two axes to grind,
    and no stone&mdash;though I&rsquo;d manage it once, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are several ways. Either you join forces, for instance, and
    find a grindstone&mdash;or make one of the other man&rsquo;s axe. But the
    last way is too slow, and, as I said, takes too much brain-work&mdash; besides,
    it doesn&rsquo;t pay. It might satisfy your vanity or pride, but I&rsquo;ve
    got none. I had once, when I was younger, but it&mdash;well, it nearly killed
    me, so I dropped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can mostly trust the man who wants to talk more than you do;
    he&rsquo;ll make a safe mate&mdash;or a good grindstone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith scratched the nape of his neck and sat blinking at the fire, with
    the puzzled expression of a woman pondering over a life-question or the trimming
    of a hat. Steelman took his chin in his hand and watched Smith thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I say, Steely,&rdquo; exclaimed Smith, suddenly, sitting
    up and scratching his head and blinking harder than ever&mdash;&ldquo;wha&mdash;what
    am I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I the axe or the grindstone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! your brain seems in extra good working order to-night, Smith.
    Well, you turn the grindstone and I grind.&rdquo; Smith settled. &ldquo;If
    you could grind better than I, I&rsquo;d turn the stone and let <i>you</i> grind,
    I&rsquo;d never go against the interests of the firm&mdash;that&rsquo;s fair
    enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; admitted Smith; &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do I. Now, Smith, we&rsquo;ve got along all right together for
    years, off and on, but you never know what might happen. I might stop breathing,
    for instance&mdash;and so might you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith began to look alarmed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poetical justice might overtake one or both of us&mdash;such things
    have happened before, though not often. Or, say, misfortune or death might
    mistake us for honest, hard-working mugs with big families to keep, and cut
    us off in the bloom of all our wisdom. You might get into trouble, and, in
    that case, I&rsquo;d be bound to leave you there, on principle; or I might
    get into trouble, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have the brains to get me out&mdash; though
    I know you&rsquo;d be mug enough to try. I might make a rise and cut you,
    or you might be misled into showing some spirit, and clear out after I&rsquo;d
    stoushed you for it. You might get tired of me calling you a mug, and bossing
    you and making a tool or convenience of you, you know. You might go in for
    honest graft (you were always a bit weak-minded) and then I&rsquo;d have
    to wash my hands of you (unless you agreed to keep me) for an irreclaimable
    mug. Or it might suit me to become a respected and worthy fellow townsman,
    and then, if you came within ten miles of me or hinted that you ever knew
    me, I&rsquo;d have you up for vagrancy, or soliciting alms, or attempting
    to levy blackmail. I&rsquo;d have to fix you&mdash;so I give you fair warning.
    Or we might get into some desperate fix (and it needn&rsquo;t be very desperate,
    either) when I&rsquo;d be obliged to sacrifice you for my own personal safety,
    comfort, and convenience. Hundreds of things might happen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as I said, we&rsquo;ve been at large together for some years,
    and I&rsquo;ve found you sober, trustworthy, and honest; so, in case we do
    part &mdash;as we will sooner or later&mdash;and you survive, I&rsquo;ll
    give you some advice from my own experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the first place: If you ever happen to get born again &mdash;and
    it wouldn&rsquo;t do you much harm&mdash;get born with the strength of a
    bullock and the hide of one as well, and a swelled head, and no brains&mdash; at
    least no more brains than you&rsquo;ve got now. I was born with a skin like
    tissue-paper, and brains; also a heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get born without relatives, if you can: if you can&rsquo;t help it,
    clear out on your own just as soon after you&rsquo;re born as you possibly
    can. I hung on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you have relations, and feel inclined to help them any time when
    you&rsquo;re flush (and there&rsquo;s no telling what a weak-minded man like
    you might take it into his head to do)&mdash;don&rsquo;t do it. They&rsquo;ll
    get a down on you if you do. It only causes family troubles and bitterness.
    There&rsquo;s no dislike like that of a dependant. You&rsquo;ll get neither
    gratitude nor civility in the end, and be lucky if you escape with a character.
    (You&rsquo;ve got <i>no</i> character, Smith; I&rsquo;m only just supposing
    you have.) There&rsquo;s no hatred too bitter for, and nothing too bad to
    be said of, the mug who turns. The worst yarns about a man are generally
    started by his own tribe, and the world believes them at once on that very
    account. Well, the first thing to do in life is to escape from your friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you ever go to work&mdash;and miracles have happened before&mdash; no
    matter what your wages are, or how you are treated, you can take it for granted
    that you&rsquo;re sweated; act on that to the best of your ability, or you&rsquo;ll
    never rise in the world. If you go to see a show on the nod you&rsquo;ll
    be found a comfortable seat in a good place; but if you pay the chances are
    the ticket clerk will tell you a lie, and you&rsquo;ll have to hustle for
    standing room. The man that doesn&rsquo;t ante gets the best of this world;
    anything he&rsquo;ll stand is good enough for the man that pays. If you try
    to be too sharp you&rsquo;ll get into gaol sooner or later; if you try to
    be too honest the chances are that the bailiff will get into your house&mdash;if
    you have one&mdash;and make a holy show of you before the neighbours. The
    honest softy is more often mistaken for a swindler, and accused of being
    one, than the out-and-out scamp; and the man that tells the truth too much
    is set down as an irreclaimable liar. But most of the time crow low and roost
    high, for it&rsquo;s a funny world, and you never know what might happen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if you get married (and there&rsquo;s no accounting for a woman&rsquo;s
    taste) be as bad as you like, and then moderately good, and your wife will
    love you. If you&rsquo;re bad all the time she can&rsquo;t stand it for ever,
    and if you&rsquo;re good all the time she&rsquo;ll naturally treat you with
    contempt. Never explain what you&rsquo;re going to do, and don&rsquo;t explain
    afterwards, if you can help it. If you find yourself between two stools,
    strike hard for your own self, Smith&mdash;strike hard, and you&rsquo;ll
    be respected more than if you fought for all the world. Generosity isn&rsquo;t
    understood nowadays, and what the people don&rsquo;t understand is either &lsquo;mad&rsquo; or &lsquo;cronk&rsquo;.
    Failure has no case, and you can&rsquo;t build one for it. . . . I started
    out in life very young&mdash;and very soft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to tell me your story, Steely,&rdquo; remarked
    Smith.</p>
  <p>Steelman smiled sadly.</p>
