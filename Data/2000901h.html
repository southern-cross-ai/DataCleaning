<p class="first">FOR five and fifty years old Mrs. Bevan had
lived at Milton Grange, just outside the little village of High
Roding, in Essex. She had come there when, as a young girl just
out of her teens, she had married Mark Bevan, only a few years
older, and every nook and cranny of the old house was hallowed to
her in rapturous memories of those first wedded days. The Grange
had belonged to the Bevan family for many generations, and stood
in extensive high-walled grounds, containing beautiful old-world
gardens, lawns whose velvet softness it was a delight to tread,
and a large lake, whose reeds and rushes were a sanctuary for
wild birds.</p>

<p>She had been a very lovely bride, and her husband a very
handsome groom. All the joys which life can hold seemed to
stretch before the young couple, for they had good health, ample
means and were devoted to each other.</p>

<p>It was in the days before the world had come to her dreadful
travail with Progress and New Orders. There were no telephones,
no electric lights, no motor cars, and no Dictators. Flying was a
madman's dream, and the bomber in the skies had never entered
into men's minds, even as a nightmare. The country-side of
England was all peace and rest. The squire was still the benign
godfather in the countless little villages scattered throughout
the length and breadth of the land, and the old ivy-covered
church still gave its benediction to the births, deaths, and
marriages of those whose destiny it was to live beneath its
shadow.</p>

<p>Margaret Bevan and her husband had been supremely happy,
experiencing only one great sorrow. No babies had come to Milton
Grange, and the laughter of little children had not echoed in its
many spacious rooms. For many years it had been a great grief to
them, but gradually time had softened their disappointment, and
they had become content with each others' love and respect.</p>

<p>When Margaret was 60 her husband died, and then commenced long
years of lonely widowhood for her. She was not a woman who had
ever made many friends, and she had no relatives of her own.
Also, the only one of her husband was his nephew, a young doctor,
recently qualified and practising in London. She was very fond of
the latter, and told him frankly that one day he would come into
all she possessed. "But I don't want you to look forward to my
death," she smiled, "and so I am going to make you an allowance,
straightaway, of £1,000 a year. That will make you quite
independent of your profession, and you will be able to go in for
research, as you've always wanted to." Dr. Bevan was most
grateful, and he and his young wife were frequent guests at the
Grange.</p>

<p>"But why do you go on living here, Aunt Margaret?" he pleaded.
"What good to you is this large and lonely house, with all these
servants? You would be much happier if you came to town and had a
cosy little flat, with only two maids to look after."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bevan had smilingly shaken her head. "For nearly two
hundred years, Robert, there's always been a Bevan here, and I
shan't leave it until I die. Everything reminds me of my dear
husband, and I am sure it would have been his wish that I should
remain on. Don't forget, I have my tenants in the village to look
after. They depend so much upon me."</p>

<p>So she continued on at the Grange, keeping three maids, a
butler and a gardener, living as closely as possible the same
life she had lived when her husband had been alive. Every night
she dined in state, eating very little, but waited upon in solemn
silence by the butler and the parlormaid. The only day she went
out was upon Sunday, and then in the morning, at a quarter to
eleven precisely, she was driven by the gardener, attired in the
grey Bevan livery, in an old-fashioned landau to the village
church. There, in the Bevan family pew, she sat a dignified and
sad old lady, with her eyes fixed for the greater part of the
service upon a brass plate upon the wall, commemorating the
passing of one, Mark Bevan, justice of the peace for the County
of Essex, in the sixty-second year of his life.</p>

<p>The years rolled on and then, when she was nearly seventy-five, she developed heart trouble, and Dr. Bevan insisted she
must always have some-one by her in case she was taken with a
sudden attack. He wanted her to have a properly-qualified nurse,
but always of a most determined disposition, she engaged one only
semi-trained, whom the vicar of the village recommended and who
happened to be a relation of one of her tenants.</p>

<p>Nurse Bateman&mdash;she called herself "Nurse" because she had
had a few months' experience in a cottage hospital&mdash;gave her
age as thirty. Undoubtedly, she had been quite good-looking once,
but now her prettiness was a decidedly faded character. She was
shrewd and intelligent, with sense enough not to attempt to
dominate the old lady. She gave herself no airs and got on well
with the servants, particularly so with the butler.</p>

<p>So things went on uneventfully for some six months, and then
the shadow of a dreadful terror fell upon Milton Grange, for it
came to be believed a deadly poisonous snake had somehow found
its way into the house, one of those which had escaped when, a
few weeks previously, a fire had taken place in a travelling
circus and menagerie, visiting Great Dunmow, a small town only a
few miles distant.</p>

<p>It was Martha, the cook, who suspected its presence, first.
One night, when the last to be going to bed, she was in the
kitchen by herself except for Sloper, the big black cat, who was
asleep upon a chair. She had lit her candle to go upstairs and
just turned out the hanging lamp. Mrs. Bevan still clung to the
old ways and there was neither gas nor electricity in the
house.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she heard a hiss, a long fierce hiss which
lasted, she thought, for quite three seconds. She could not tell
with any certainty from where the sound came, but she believed it
was from the direction of the long kitchen dresser. Very
astonished, but not frightened, for somehow for the moment she
did not associate the sound with any living creature, she lifted
the candlestick high above her head to spread the light
round.</p>

<p>Seeing nothing upon the floor or anywhere about, and the hiss
not being repeated, she would have thought she had been mistaken
in the nature of the sound if her eyes had not suddenly happened
to fall upon the cat. The big black Tom, no longer in restful
slumber, was now upon his feet, his back arched, his fur ruffled
and with all appearance of being badly frightened. He was holding
his head stiffly and his eyes were strained and staring.</p>

<p>The next morning, when telling the others what had happened,
she admitted that then she did begin to feel a little bit afraid
and not quite so certain she had been imagining everything.
However, the hiss did not come again, the cat sank down once more
upon the chair and, very puzzled, she took herself off to bed.
But it was a long time before she got off to sleep.</p>

<p>At breakfast she told the two girls and Mr. Snap, the butler,
all about having heard the hiss, and they thought it a good joke,
Mr. Snap asking jocularly if she'd been at the old lady's port.
Later, Nurse Bateman thought it very amusing, too.</p>

<p>Cook did not mind their joking, but the laugh was upon her
side when that same night Jane, the housemaid, came running into
the kitchen with a very white face and called out chokingly that
something had just hissed at her in the passage.</p>

<p>All the others were in the kitchen at the time, waiting for
the nurse to come into supper and, accordingly, headed by Mr.
Snap with his electric torch and the cook with the poker, they
all ran out together and made a thorough search of the passage
and adjoining rooms. Nurse Bateman, appearing at that moment,
joined with them in the search.</p>

<p>But they found nothing and, returning to the kitchen, sat down
to their meal. The girls were certainly feeling rather scared,
but Mr. Snap would still not believe any hiss had really been
heard. Very tactlessly, he made things worse for them by
recalling to their recollections the recent fire at the
travelling menagerie.</p>

<p>"Don't forget they've never been at all certain," he went on,
"how many of the snakes were burnt up or got away, it will always
be a mystery." His eyes twinkled. "So it's quite possible one of
the deadly tiger ones escaped and has travelled all this distance
and made his home here. I've heard that in India snakes prefer
old houses."</p>

<p>Cook and the girls shuddered, but the nurse spoke very sharply
to him. "You shouldn't have said that, Mr. Snap. You've no
business to have put the idea into their heads. It's very silly
of you."</p>

<p>The butler took the reproof meekly and, indeed, looked rather
crestfallen. He was stout, amorous and fifty, and known to be
very sweet on the nurse. It was supposed he had saved money, and
everyone was curious as to whether he would induce her to marry
him.</p>

<p>"It was only a joke, Nurse," he said apologetically, "and, of
course I didn't mean anything."</p>

<p>"But if the mistress came to hear of it," went on Nurse
sternly, "with her weak heart it would be very dangerous. It
might frighten her into leaving the house."</p>

<p>"Then you don't understand Mrs. Bevan," scoffed Cook
instantly. "Nothing on earth would induce her to leave here.
She'd think it her duty to die rather than to go away. Why, she's
not slept one single night away from the house since poor Master
died!"</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate," nodded the nurse, "none of us must
mention anything about it to her. I won't have it."</p>

<p>"But I don't suppose we shall hear the hissing again," grinned
the butler. "In my opinion we've heard the last of it."</p>

<p>It was destined, however, that Mr. Snap should speedily learn
of what little worth his opinion was, for that very night he
heard the hiss himself and was quite as frightened as the girls
had been. He had just come out of his pantry, he said, and there
came a loud and long hiss from the direction of the kitchen
dresser. He didn't mind admitting that he'd instantly grabbed up
the poker and rushed for the door as quickly as he could. Then he
had stood waiting for quite five minutes but, seeing nothing and
hearing no more hisses, he had at length ventured back into the
room to put out the lamp before going off to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning he apologised most contritely to both the
cook and Jane for having misbelieved them. He was convinced now
that it was some living creature which had frightened them. "But
we'll find out what it is," he added fiercely. "We'll move out
that old dresser at once and see if there are any snake-holes
behind."</p>

<p>The dresser, of solid oak, was huge and heavy. It had not been
disturbed for many years, never in the cook's time, and she had
been at the Grange since she was twenty and she now admitted to
being forty-two. With some effort it was moved away from the wall
and, sure enough, a big hole in the wainscoting was at once
seen.</p>

<p>"Large enough for a dozen snakes to jump through at a time,"
announced the perspiring Mr. Snap. "Well, we'll nail a piece of
board over it and see what that does." He smiled a sickly smile.
"Then snake, owl, or whistling rat, whatever he is, he'll have to
do his hissing where it's less likely to be heard. You see," he
went on in explanation, "snakes are nocturnal like rabbits, which
means they mostly come out to feed at nights. So, if we nail him
up now, we've probably caught him when he's at home, and there
he'll have to stay until he starves to death."</p>

<p>Accordingly the hole was nailed over and the dresser put back.
Unhappily, however it did not bring the result anticipated, for
the hissing continued, and soon everyone in the house had heard
it, except Mrs. Bevan. Cook heard it again, in the scullery this
time; Elsie, the housemaid, heard it twice in the hall; Mr. Snap
heard it three times in his pantry; Jane heard it when she was
coming down the stairs, and Nurse Bateman, the last to be
converted, heard it most distinctly in the library. They all came
to hear it, too, not only when by themselves but also when in
company with the others. The horror of it began to get on their
nerves. Cook moved her bed into the girls' room, Mr. Snap nightly
blocked up the crack under his bedroom door with thick wads of
newspapers, and Nurse Bateman banked up strong disinfectants,
sprinkled generously about.</p>

<p>Still no one had ever seen anything. There had only been that
fierce, dreadful hissing, now, seemingly, coming from all
directions. To the credit of them all they determined Mrs. Bevan
should learn nothing. Neither did they discuss the matter with
anyone outside the house, except the gardener.</p>

<p>So things went on for just a week from the day when cook had
first heard the hissing, and then a happening took place which
made it impossible to keep things any longer from Mrs. Bevan.</p>

<p>One morning, Sloper, the big Tom cat, was found dead in the
kitchen, stretched out stiff and arched, and there was no doubt
he had died from snake bite. Thomson, the gardener, was sure of
it. Years ago he had made a voyage to Australia upon a sailing-boat, and during a short stay in the Commonwealth had once seen
the body of a dog who had been bitten by a snake, and it had
looked just as the body of the cat looked now. Besides, there
were those two small bite marks upon the leg, plain for everyone
to see.</p>

<p>They held a conclave in the kitchen and very reluctantly
decided Mrs. Bevan must be told at once. Sloper had been her pet,
always partaking of his midday meal with her. He never missed a
day, always being upon the spot the exact minute when her lunch
was served. So, if he did not arrive now at the usual hour, she
would start to worry dreadfully, wondering what could have become
of him and if he had been caught in some trap. It was considered
the suspense would be far worse for the old lady than learning
what had actually happened.</p>

<p>The business of telling the dreadful story was entrusted to
the cook, Mr. Snap and the nurse being present to corroborate all
she said. Mrs. Bevan received the news bravely, although, at
first, with absolute incredulity.</p>

<p>"But it's impossible!" she exclaimed. "No snake would have
come all that way from Great Dunmow. It can't be a snake at
all."</p>

<p>"But it must be, Mum," said Mr. Snap firmly, but respectfully.
"There are two fang marks upon one of poor Sloper's legs and that
is how poisonous snakes bite." He spoke very sadly. "Should I
bring him to you to let you see them."</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the old lady shudderingly, "I don't want to
see anything." She shed a few tears over the passing of her
favorite, and then sat down to write a letter to Dr. Bevan,
telling him everything that had happened. She sent Snap
straightaway into the village to post it, knowing that if it
caught the eleven o'clock post her nephew would receive it that
same afternoon. She expected he would come down that night.</p>

<p>But there was no appearance of the doctor, as so confidently
hoped for, and then, when being assisted by Nurse Bateman to get
ready for bed, the old lady received such a truly terrible shock
that no one could have been really surprised if it had proved
fatal.</p>

<p>Both she and the nurse heard the hissing of the snake, loud,
fierce and reverberating. Also, the latter actually saw the
reptile, this time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bevan's knees gave way under her and she fell back into
an arm chair which was, providently, just behind her. She was
paralysed and inarticulate in her fright.</p>

<p>The snake hissed three times, but it was not the hissing which
so affected the old lady. It was the blood curdling screams which
Nurse Bateman emitted, one after the other. They rang out like
sirens, so Cook declared afterwards. Cook had been right away at
the other end of the house at the time and, hearing the cries and
thinking more of her loved mistress than of any danger to
herself, she raced upstairs with no thought in her mind that any
second she might be treading upon a deadly reptile.</p>

<p>She found both her mistress and the nurse in dead faints, but
gave her attention only to the former, lifting her upon the bed
and forcing brandy between her lips. Mrs. Bevan soon revived and
whispered shakingly what had taken place. The nurse, too, had by
then recovered, feeling very ashamed that she had screamed so
loudly. She said, however, that she had seen, most distinctly, a
long black snake slither across the floor and pass through the
mercifully partly-opened door.</p>

<p>"Never you mind, mistress," said Cook bravely. "I promise you
you shan't go through it again. I'll bring my mattress in here
and make up a bed for myself upon the floor. Then there'll be
three of us if the snake comes again." She affected a bravery she
did not feel. "It seems that snakes don't frighten me as much as
they do some people. I am not at all afraid."</p>

<p>Dr. Bevan arrived the next day, before eleven o'clock. He had
only received the letter that morning and was very concerned when
he learnt what had taken place the previous night.</p>

<p>"But the whole thing's nonsense, Aunt Margaret," he said
angrily. "It's impossible there could be any poisonous snake
here. It's mass hysteria among you all. The cook imagined things,
first, and then scared all the others into imagining they had
heard the hissing when, in reality, they had heard nothing at
all. It's been all imagination, nothing more and nothing
less."</p>

<p>"But it isn't imagination, Robert," insisted his aunt
tearfully. "I heard the hisses as plainly as I am hearing you
now." Her voice choked. "And think of my dear Sloper. He wasn't
bitten to death by imagining it."</p>

<p>"Ah, the cat!" exclaimed Dr. Bevan instantly. "I'll go and
look at him. I'll be able to tell at once if he's died of a snake
bite."</p>

<p>But to the doctor's intense annoyance the cat's body had been
burnt. It appeared Mr. Snap thought that because the animal had
died of snake-bite the body would be dangerous for anyone to
touch. So he had made a big bonfire in the garden, and, carrying
the body out in the kitchen tongs, had thrown it into the middle
of the flames, taking great care that every particle of it should
be consumed.</p>

<p>"You're a fool!" exclaimed the doctor angrily. "You've spoilt
the only chance I had of convincing you all how silly you've
been. Well, now I'm going to talk to you all, perfectly
plainly."</p>

<p>But the talk brought no satisfaction to him; indeed, rather
the reverse, for, instead of convincing the servants that their
imaginations had been running riot, he himself was left with the
uneasy feeling that, after all, there might be something in what
they said. They all stuck to their stories, and he could not make
them contradict themselves. So, his mind made up what he would
do, he returned to Mrs. Bevan.</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt," he said, "I suppose there's no chance of getting
you to come away for a week or two until things blow over. No,
no, I won't argue with you, but this is what I'll do. Professor
James, of the Zoological Gardens is a friend of mine, and I'll go
straight back to town to see him. He'll tell me at once if it is
possible for an escaped snake to have made his way here. In the
meantime, from the first moment when it begins to get dark you're
to have cook with you, as well as nurse. Now, don't worry. I'll
do the best I can."</p>

<p>And certainly he was as good as his word, for he returned that
afternoon, bringing the head keeper of the snake house of the zoo
with him.</p>

<p>"Professor James couldn't manage to get away, or he'd have
come himself," he explained, "but he's sent this gentleman, who
knows all about snakes. He's brought a tame Indian mongoose with
him, and we'll soon know if there's any snake hiding in the
house."</p>

<p>"If there's one here, mum," corroborated the keeper
reassuringly, "Rikky will nose him out at once." He shook his
head doubtfully. "But I don't think there can be one. If any
snake did escape from that menagerie it'd be almost a miracle if
he'd found his way as far as here."</p>

<p>He produced the mongoose from a box for Mrs. Bevan's
inspection. Slender and about 18 inches long, it was covered with
a greyish fur and had a long sweeping tail. The old lady thought
it looked very fierce.</p>

<p>"But where will you put it to find the snake?" she asked. "The
snake only comes out at night."</p>

<p>"Behind the wainscoting, mum," replied the keeper. "That'll be
the best place, so that he can get under the foundations of the
house. That's where the snake'll be if he's anywhere."</p>

<p>So a piece of the wainscoting in the passage by the kitchen
was prized away, and the mongoose put through. "Now, if he comes
upon any reptile," the keeper informed those standing round, "we
shall know it at once, for he'll get excited and make a noise
like the humming of a hive of bees. There'll be no mistaking the
sound."</p>

<p>But no noise came to gladden their hearts. Five, ten minutes,
a quarter of an hour passed, and then the mongoose reappeared,
looking disinterested in everything. He was taken into the
kitchen and, in turn, to every room and place where the hissing
of the snake had been heard, but nothing happened, and, in the
end, he wanted to curl up and go to sleep.</p>

<p>"No snake here," announced the keeper decisively. "He'd have
smelt him if there was."</p>

<p>There was general disappointment, and Dr. Bevan returned to
town in a very worried frame of mind. He had left strict orders
that the cook was to continue to sleep in his aunt's room, and
the butler to report to him every night and morning from the
telephone in the village.</p>

<p>The following morning the report was a negative one. No more
hissing had been heard, and Mrs. Bevan had passed an undisturbed,
if rather anxious night. Still the doctor was by no means easy in
his mind. Although quite convinced now that there was no snake in
the house, that something of the nature of hissing had been heard
he was equally certain, and until he found out what it was there
could be no peace or freedom from anxiety for his aunt.</p>

<p>So it was in that frame of mind he went out to lunch that day
with another medical man, an old hospital friend of his who
practised in Norfolk, but who was now up in town upon holiday for
a few days. They sat at a table by themselves in the fashionable
Semiris restaurant, and during the course of the meal, told his
friend about the mysterious happenings at the Grange. The other
was most interested, but could suggest no explanation for what
had taken place.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the latter whistled. "But I say, I say," he
exclaimed with animation, "there's a chap over there who could
probably hazard a good guess. That man at the table by the
window, who's just lighting a cigarette. He lives not far from
me, and I know him pretty well. He's Gilbert Larose, and used to
be a famous detective once, but he married the wealthy Lady
Ardane and, of course, has retired from Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"By Jove, I've heard of him!" exclaimed Dr. Bevan
interestedly. "The man who never failed! Introduce him, George.
Perhaps he'll help us. Be quick. He's getting up to go!"</p>

<p>So a well-dressed, smiling-looking man in the middle thirties
was brought up to the table and the introduction took place.
"Look here, Mr. Larose," said Dr. Bevan's friend laughingly,
"we've got a little problem which would just suit your subtle
mind. Now can you spare a few minutes for us to tell you about
it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Larose, "but let's go out into the foyer.
We can talk better there."</p>

<p>Dr. Bevan told his tale, and Larose listened with increasing
interest as he proceeded. "And do any ideas come to you, sir?"
asked the doctor when he had finished.</p>

<p>Larose nodded thoughtfully. "Yes, some do." He considered for
a few moments. "Now you say the anxiety is likely to have a
serious effect upon your aunt?"</p>

<p>"A very serious one. In fact, another such a shock as she had
the night before last may easily prove fatal to her."</p>

<p>"And then who would benefit by her death?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Dr. Bevan frowned. "Oh, a lot of people. I, for one, all the
servants, except the nurse, and a number of her tenants in the
village. She is a well-to-do woman and her estate will be quite a
big one."</p>

<p>"Do you know to what extent the servants will benefit?"</p>

<p>"The cook and the butler get £500 each, and the two maids
£100."</p>

<p>"And they know that?" frowned Larose.</p>

<p>"Certainly, not," replied the doctor quickly. "My aunt is
always reticent about her affairs and is not likely to have told
them anything." He spoke warmly. "You're on the wrong tack there,
sir, for even if they did know it they'd be the last people to
wish her harm. The cook has been with her for more than twenty
years and the butler for nearly as long. The girls are above
suspicion, too. They are both the daughters of former servants.
They are all devoted to her." He looked incredulous. "You don't
for a moment imagine they have been making those hisses?"</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "Well, on the face of it, it doesn't seem
probable, does it?" He hesitated. "Still, you never
can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, goodness gracious, they must all be in the conspiracy,"
broke in the doctor testily, "for not only have they, one by one,
heard the hissing, but it has been heard when they have all been
together."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and then Larose said briskly, "Well,
look here. If you like you can run me down and I'll see what I
can make of it. No, no, you needn't thank me. It's quite an
interesting case and will amuse me. Yes, I can come straight
away. I'm quite free this afternoon."</p>

<p>So, little more than an hour and a half later Larose had
arrived at the Grange and was listening to the stories as told by
Mrs. Bevan and Nurse Bateman. It had been his express wish that
they should be together when he started to question them in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>His questions over, he left them and was taken into the
library. There, one by one, and commencing with the butler, he
interviewed the other servants, with Dr. Bevan being present all
the time. Half an hour and longer went by, and then the doctor
returned to the drawing-room and said Larose wanted to speak to
the nurse again.</p>

<p>Another half-hour passed and Larose came into the drawing-room
once more. He was by himself this time and holding a piece of
paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Have they helped you at all?" asked Mrs. Bevan nervously.
"Have you any news?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded very solemnly, "Yes, both good and bad. We've
found out about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the old lady interrupted him suddenly. Through the window,
she had caught sight of her nephew's car going down the drive,
with him at the wheel. "But what does that mean?" she cried
plaintively. "Why's Robert, why's my nephew going off without
seeing me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's quite all right," replied Larose reassuringly.
"He'll be back again in a few minutes." He laughed. "He's only
gone off to give the snakes a lift to the railway station."</p>

<p>"The snakes!" ejaculated Mrs. Bevan. "Then you've found them
and there were more than one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we found them," nodded Larose, "and there were two of
them." He spoke in a grave tone. "I'm sorry to tell you that your
butler and the nurse were the snakes. It was they who had been
doing the hissing all along, and Dr. Bevan insisted they should
leave instantly. We stood over them while they packed and now
he's driven them away."</p>

<p>The old lady's face was the very picture of horror and
distress. In her emotion, she could hardly get her breath, and
Larose went on quickly to distract her attention from herself,
"Yes, of course, it's terribly upsetting for you to learn it, but
it's only the old, old story of an elderly man's infatuation for
a much younger woman goading him on to commit any kind of
wickedness." He held up the paper in his hand. "Here's his signed
confession. The nurse was at the bottom of everything. One night
about a month ago, she looked into your desk and read the draft
of your new will. She saw the butler was to get £500 at your
death, and the dreadful idea came to her of giving you a fatal
shock, so that he would receive the money at once. Snap was
horrified when she first suggested it to him, but in the end she
won him over by promising to marry him directly he got the money.
They were going to take a public-house in Saffren Walden, and the
matter had to be settled soon."</p>

<p>"How awful, how awful!" wailed Mrs. Bevan. "I've always tried
to be so kind to Snap, and he's seemed to be so grateful."</p>

<p>Larose took a little folded piece of tin out of his pocket.
"She showed him how to make the loud hissing with this. It's like
a plaything schoolboys used to startle one another."</p>

<p>"But how did you come to find this all out?" asked the old
lady, shakily, and now beginning to get over her amazement. "What
made you suspect them at all?"</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "Well, directly Dr. Bateman told me about your
having left money to the servants my thoughts turned to them, but
when I saw Snap as he opened the door to us I felt sure he would
not have had the imagination to think of such an idea. He looked
much too simple. That, however, was not my opinion of the nurse,
and directly I saw her she gave me a rather bad impression. For
one thing, she struck me as one of the last kind of women to lose
her head and shriek as she had done when, as she said, she had
both heard the hissing and seen the snake. Later, too, I knew she
was lying to me when she declared the snake had been hissing as
it glided away. I've killed lots of wild snakes in Australia, and
they don't hiss when they're on the run. They can't, for to hiss
they have to have their heads up, which means they must be
standing still. So, I suspected her at once of something&mdash;I
didn't know exactly what&mdash;as I could not see then how she
stood to benefit if anything happened to you. However, things
became clearer when I got out of cook that Snap was paying court
to the nurse and was completely under her thumb."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment and then went on. "But I really worked
out everything by means of a pencil and piece of paper. I put
down every time the hissing had been heard and who had been on
the spot to hear it. All the servants had heard it, not only when
they were alone, but also and quite a number of times, when they
had been in company with some of the others. Then, when I had
questioned everyone and put down what they told me upon a piece
of paper, the significant fact emerged that never once had the
hissing been heard when both the butler and the nurse had been
present among them at the same time."</p>

<p>"You mean that they had taken it in turn to do the hissing?"
quavered the old lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, and when they wanted to frighten anyone they used to get
the steps and hiss through the ventilator of one of the adjoining
rooms. That's what Snap did when you heard the hissing in your
bedroom the other night."</p>

<p>"Oh, how wicked!" exclaimed poor Mrs. Bevan. She started up
suddenly. "But if there was no real snake, how did poor Sloper
come to die?"</p>

<p>"Nurse Bateman poisoned him with strychnine,"replied Larose
very solemnly. "She put mouse poison in his saucer of milk and
made bite marks afterwards on his leg with a pair of scissors.
She put them there in case you wanted to see the body, and then
she made Snap burn the body before the doctor had had time to get
here. That letter you wrote your nephew was, purposely, not
posted until the evening."</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Yes, I bluffed him into it. After I had
finished with the others I had him in the library again. I could
see that he was frightened at being called back, for his forehead
was perspiring and his hands were twitching. So I looked at him
furiously and asked him why he had been lying to us and telling a
different tale from that of Nurse Bateman. He thought at once, as
I had intended him to, that we had found out something, and he
began to breathe hard and stammer. Then I thundered at him that
the game was up, and he'd better make a clean breast of it and
confess. He started to whimper and then blurted out everything.
He blamed the nurse for it all, and produced the piece of tin she
had made from his pocket."</p>

<p>"And did nurse confess, too?" choked Mrs. Bevan.</p>

<p>"Not she!" scoffed Larose. "She confessed nothing, but you
should have seen the look she gave Snap when, as she was being
brought back into the library, I made him hiss through the piece
of tin to show me how he'd done it. She went white to the lips,
and I thought she was going to faint. No, she didn't confess, but
she never denied anything. She just flung her clothes into her
box, too, as if she didn't care what happened. Oh, she was guilty
right enough! She didn't even ask for the money due to her."</p>

<p>"Poor Snap!" sighed the tender-hearted old lady. "Both my
husband and I thought such a lot of him. I expect he's very sorry
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is," agreed Larose instantly. "He cried like a little
child, and implored us to let him come to ask your forgiveness.
When we refused he said that would be his greatest punishment.
Yes, I'm sure his remorse was quite real." He nodded, "Well, he's
got his deserts and is certainly well punished."</p>

<p>But life is not always just, and the butler's punishment was
by no means as great as it should have been, for the excitement
of the day proving too much for Mrs. Bevan, she passed away that
night in another heart attack, having had no time to alter her
will.</p>

<p>So Snap got his £500 after all. Still, he did not marry Nurse
Bateman, although she tried her hardest to make him, even to
threatening an action for breach of promise. However, he would
have nothing at all to do with her, and started a pig farm
instead.</p>
