  <p>The wireless&nbsp;tells and the cable tells<br>
    How our boys behaved by the Dardanelles.<br>
    Some thought in their hearts &ldquo;Will our boys make good?&rdquo;<br>
    We knew them of old and we knew they would!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would;<br>
    We were mates of old and we knew they would.</p>
  <p>They laughed and they larked and they loved likewise,<br>
    For blood is warm under Southern skies;<br>
    They knew not Pharoah (&rsquo;tis understood),<br>
    And they got into scrapes, as we knew they would.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would;<br>
    And they got into scrapes, as we knew they would.</p>
  <p>They chafed in the dust of an old dead land<br>
    At the long months&rsquo; drill in the scorching sand;<br>
    But they knew in their hearts it was for their good,<br>
    And they saw it through as we knew they would.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would;<br>
    And they saw it through as we knew they would.</p>
  <p>The Coo-ee called through the Mena Camp,<br>
    And an army roared like the Ocean&rsquo;s tramp<br>
    On a gale-swept beach in her wildest mood,<br>
    Till the Pyramids shook as we knew they would.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would.<br>
    (And the Sphinx woke up as we knew she would.)</p>
  <p>They were shipped like sheep when the dawn was grey;<br>
    (But their officers knew that no lambs were they).<br>
    They squatted and perched where&rsquo;er they could,<br>
    And they &ldquo;blanky-ed&rdquo; for joy as we knew they would.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would;<br>
    They &ldquo;blanky-ed&rdquo; for joy as we knew they would.</p>
  <p>The sea was hell and the shore was hell,<br>
    With mine, entanglement, shrapnel and shell,<br>
    But they stormed the heights as Australians should,<br>
    And they fought and they died as we knew they would.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would;<br>
    They fought and they died as we knew they would.</p>
  <p>From the southern hills and the city lanes,<br>
    From the sandwaste lone and the Blacksoil Plains;<br>
    The youngest and strongest of England&rsquo;s brood!&mdash;<br>
    They&rsquo;ll win for the South as we knew they would.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew they would;<br>
    They&rsquo;ll win for the South as we knew they would.</p>

  <p>When&nbsp;at first in foreign parts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was her flag unfurled,<br>
    England was a Gipsy lass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling round the world.<br>
    Sailing on the Spanish Main&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere you roam&mdash;<br>
    Peddling in the Persian Gulf<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things she&rsquo;d made at home.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  round the world,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  round the world&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England was a Gipsy lass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  round the world.</p>
  <p>England&nbsp;<i>never</i>&nbsp;wanted war,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not on land or sea&mdash;<br>
    Other nations rising up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t let her be.<br>
    England only wanted peace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ocean&rsquo;s breath;<br>
    So there came, in course of time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen
  Elizabeth&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen
  Elizabeth&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came a plain, bad-tempered
  queen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called
  Elizabeth.</p>
  <p>Queen Elizabeth, she called<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake, and Raleigh too&mdash;<br>
    Essex, Howard, and the rest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pirate crew;<br>
  &ldquo;See what you can do,&rdquo; she said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;England&rsquo;s feeling sick&mdash;<br>
    If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll hang you all!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better do it quick.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Better
  do it quick,&rdquo; she said&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Better
  do it quick&rdquo;;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they knew she&rsquo;d keep
  her word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
  they did it quick.</p>
  <p>Drake and Raleigh sailed away&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Only Bess they feared)<br>
    Cleared the Spanish Main and singed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Spain his beard&mdash;<br>
    Singed the King of Spain his beard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his hair they curled.<br>
    England was a Gipsy&rsquo;s love<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling round the world.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  round the world,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  round the world.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England was a Gipsy&rsquo;s
  love<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  round the world.</p>
  <p>Once again, when Cromwell came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England wanted room;<br>
    So he lowered Holland&rsquo;s tone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smashed the Dutchman&rsquo;s broom.<br>
    Sent a message to Algiers;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made its meaning plain&mdash;<br>
    On the way they called once more<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the King of Spain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
  the King of Spain&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
  the King of Spain:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called, to jog his memory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
  the King of Spain.</p>
  <p>So the years went round and round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over hills and flats&mdash;<br>
    England was a Gipsy wife&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England had her brats;<br>
    Peddling in the China Sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from English ground;<br>
    Doing biz with Mrs. Jap&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling all around.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  all around&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  all around;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making friends with Mrs. Jap&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling
  all around.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>When the war is past and gone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its blood and tears;<br>
    And the world may count upon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace for fifty years&mdash;<br>
    When the gory battle-flags<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round their sticks are furled&mdash;<br>
    Then you&rsquo;ll see a Gipsy crone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peddling round the world.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-peddling
  round the world!</p>
  <p>Shawl as old as Joseph&rsquo;s coat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair as white as snow,<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="GreyWolvesGrey"></a>Grey Wolves Grey</b></h2>
  <p>The Russian&nbsp;march is soft and slow,<br>
    Through dust and heat, or slush and snow,<br>
    When the Russian skies hang grey and low<br>
    To the frontiers far where the Russians go;<br>
    And they march to-night and they march to-day<br>
    Like the grey wolves grey, like the grey wolves grey.</p>
  <p>Nor song nor sound their track reveals,<br>
    Save the ceaseless &ldquo;clock&rdquo; of the waggon wheels;<br>
    But a rift in the mist shows a glint of sun<br>
    On the long, dark shape of a toiling gun;<br>
    And they strain by night and they drag by day<br>
    To a distant goal, like the grey wolves grey.</p>
  <p>As the horses toil at the ends of trains,<br>
    And the ends of roads on the Blacksoil Plains.<br>
    And Ivan digs in the frozen clay,<br>
    And he rolls the logs a bed to lay<br>
    For a gun that&rsquo;s five hundred miles away,<br>
    But as sure to come as the grey wolves grey.</p>
  <p>He is marching on with a purpose grand,<br>
    For brother Slav in another land;<br>
    Whose tongue, perchance, he cannot understand.&mdash;<br>
    But he knows the cry from the far-away,<br>
    And he smells the blood like the grey wolves grey.</p>
  <p>And Ivan&rsquo;s wife in her den at home,<br>
    While hunger looms and his lean wolves come&mdash;<br>
    With her grey-black bread like the Darling mud,<br>
    And her tea-bricks bound with the bullock&rsquo;s blood&mdash;<br>
    She shields her cubs by night and day<br>
    Like the crouching sluts of the grey wolves grey.</p>
  <p>And I march with Ivan where&rsquo;er he be,<br>
    With the foreign blood that is strong in me,<br>
    And the love and the hate that is fantasy,<br>
    Like the ghosts of a father&rsquo;s memory.<br>
    With the blood that is strange to us to-day<br>
    As the strange wild blood of the grey wolves grey.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey wolves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey wolves&mdash;<br>
    The strange wild blood of the grey wolves grey.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ANewJohnBull"></a>A New John Bull</b></h2>
  <p>A&nbsp;tall, slight, English gentleman,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an eyeglass to his eye;<br>
    He mostly says &ldquo;Good-Bai&rdquo; to you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he means to say &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo;;<br>
    He shakes hands like a ladies&rsquo; man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the world to see&mdash;<br>
    But they know, in Corners of the World.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ladies&rsquo; man is he.</p>
  <p>A tall, slight English gentleman,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hates to soil his hands;<br>
    He takes his mother&rsquo;s drawing-room<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the most outlandish lands;<br>
    And when, through Hells we dream not of,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His battery prevails,<br>
    He cleans the grime of gunpowder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blue blood from his nails.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;s what our blokes in Egypt call<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A decent kinder cove.&rdquo;<br>
    And if the Pyramids should fall?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d merely say &ldquo;Bai Jove!&rdquo;<br>
    And if the stones should block his path<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a twelve-month, or a day,<br>
    He&rsquo;d call on Sergeant Whatsisname<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clear those things away!</p>
  <p>A quiet English gentleman,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dots the Empire&rsquo;s rim,<br>
    Where sweating sons of ebony<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would go to Hell for him.<br>
    And if he chances to get &ldquo;winged,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or smashed up rather worse,<br>
    He&rsquo;s quite apologetic to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor and the nurse.</p>
  <p>A silent English gentleman&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though sometimes he says &ldquo;Haw.&rdquo;<br>
    But if a baboon in its cage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appealed to British Law<br>
    And Justice, to be understood,<br>

  <p>There&rsquo;s&nbsp;the same old coaching stable that was used by Cobb and
    Co.,<br>
    And the yard the coaches stood in more than sixty years ago;<br>
    And the public-private parlour, where they serve the passing swell,<br>
    Was the shoeing forge and smithy up at Callaghan&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the same old walls and woodwork that our fathers built to
    last,<br>
    And the same old doors and wainscot and the windows of the past;<br>
    And the same old nooks and corners where the Jim-Jams used to dwell;<br>
    But the Fantods dance no longer up at Callaghan&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
  <p>There are memories of old days that were red instead of blue;<br>
    In the time of &ldquo;Dick the Devil&rdquo; and of other devils too;<br>
    But perhaps they went to Heaven and are angels, doing well&mdash;<br>
    They were always open-hearted up at Callaghan&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
  <p>Then the new chum, broken-hearted, and with boots all broken too,<br>
    Got another pair of bluchers, and a quid to see him through;<br>
    And the old chum got a bottle, who was down and suffering Hell;&mdash;<br>
    And no tucker-bag went empty out of Callaghan&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
  <p>And I sit and think in sorrow of the nights that I have seen,<br>
    When we fought with chairs and bottles for the orange and the green;<br>
    For the peace of poor old Ireland, till they rang the breakfast bell&mdash;<br>
    And the honour of Old England, up at Callaghan&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>

  <p>Are you&nbsp;coming, Ivan, coming?&mdash;Ah, the ways are long and slow,<br>
    In the vast land that we know not&mdash;and we never sought to know.<br>
    We are watching through the daybreak, when the anxious night is done,<br>
    For the dots upon the skyline&mdash;black against the rising sun;<br>
    We are watching through the morning haze, and waiting through the night,<br>
    For the long, dark, distant columns that proclaim the Muscovite!</p>
  <p>Are you coming, Ivan, coming? (Oh! the world is growing gray<br>
    With the terror of the future and the madness of to-day!)<br>
    Are you marching, Ivan&mdash;forward? (Oh! the world is dark&rsquo;ning fast,<br>
    For the crimes of greater nations &rsquo;gainst the small ones in the past.)<br>
    Yours, in part, to make atonement, so remember what you are!<br>
    Ivan! Sing!&mdash;&ldquo;The Slav is coming! On for Russia and the Czar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Ivan&rsquo;s Song</b> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m coming, Ivan, coming&mdash;I am marching out again<br>
    On the weary roads of Russia, past the forest, marsh and plain;<br>
    Past the field and past the village, in the shine and in the rain&mdash;<br>
    By the cart-rut and the grass-track and the jolting cattle-train.<br>
    (And, maybe, some gleam of glory penetrates my sluggish brain)<br>
    I am marching out for Russia, and for Europe and for you&mdash;<br>
    But, maybe, I&rsquo;m mainly marching just because they told me to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have marched to many frontiers, in the pregnant days gone by,<br>
    When they told us where to march to, but they did not tell us why.<br>
    And they showed us whom to fight with, and they told us where to die.<br>
    I have seen our grey battalions to their Heaven&mdash;or Hades&mdash;hurled&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas enough it was for Russia!&mdash;what cared we about the world?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did one moan of Ivan&rsquo;s mother penetrate to other lands?<br>
    Did one prayer of Ivan&rsquo;s father&mdash;with his old and knotted hands?<br>
    Did one sob from Ivan&rsquo;s sweetheart, or one cry from Ivan&rsquo;s wife?<br>
    Or a wail from Ivan&rsquo;s children, for the loss of Ivan&rsquo;s life?<br>
    Marching with the Wolf of Hunger&mdash;marching with the Bear of Strength!<br>
    We have marched for many winters&mdash;but the end is near at length!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a long, long march from Plevna, when the Bear went to
    his den.<br>
    It is far from the Crimea; Oh! you did not want us then!<br>
    From the shambles of Port Arthur, &rsquo;twas a weary way and slow&mdash;<br>
    And our track was always dotted with the black dots on the snow.<br>
    By black dots and crimson splashes you may trace poor Ivan&rsquo;s track&mdash;<br>
    And I think that Ivan&rsquo;s banner should be red, and white and black.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er was Present-blinded tyrant who learnt wisdom from the
    Past,<br>
    And there&rsquo;s one forgot the errand that brought Ivan this way last!<br>
  &lsquo;To the frontier, and no further&rsquo; seemed our motto and our vow,<br>
    Since we marched from burning Moscow&mdash;<i>but we&rsquo;re marching further
    now!</i><br>
    Neighbour&rsquo;s burning house&mdash;or city!&mdash;they are easy to forget;<br>
    But we lit a light for Europe that shall be rekindled yet!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never song of Ivan&rsquo;s valour, or of  &lsquo;Russia&rsquo;s Flag
    Unfurled!&rsquo;<br>
    Or the Iron Cross of Russia, penetrates the Outer World.<br>
    Ye! who civilise and peddle, ye who hesitate and lag,<br>
    Never heard the Russian March and never saw the Russian flag!<br>
    You have called on us to save you, never saying why, or how,<br>
    But the samovar is boiling! and you&rsquo;ll hear and see us now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From our garrets and our cellars&mdash;from the little all we had&mdash;<br>
    Where the winter brings the sleigh-bells to the streets of Petrograd;<br>
    From our huts and from our hutches&mdash;from wherever we may be&mdash;<br>
    From our goat&rsquo;s-flesh and our mare&rsquo;s milk and our black unsweetened
    tea,<br>
    From the silence of Siberia, and the strange, snow-deadened streets&mdash;<br>
    From the blazing banks of Jordan, where we dip our winding-sheets.<br>
    From our black bread and our vodka&mdash;asking naught, and undismayed&mdash;<br>
    From our never-empty cradles!&mdash;we are coming to your aid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we leave no bands behind us, blaring tunes of Tyranny,<br>
    And we wave no swords above us, yelling songs of Liberty;<br>
    And no blatant voice of ruler, as we tramp through dry and wet,<br>
    Blares: &lsquo;Remember You are Russians!&rsquo;&mdash;we&rsquo;re not likely
    to forget.<br>
    There are some who have forgotten&mdash;merely men, like you and me&mdash;<br>
    And one object of our marching is to jog their memory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall hear us, you shall see us&mdash;save the dead and deaf
    and blind&mdash;<br>
    While the armour of our winter hardens thick and fast behind.<br>
    We are marching, we are coming,&nbsp;<i>and we are not on the sea</i>&mdash;<br>
    You shall see us on the furthest frontier of our enemy!<br>
    And while you fix up your frontiers, and remember what you are,<br>
    We shall march with Peace for Europe!&mdash;back to Russia and the Czar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was&nbsp;Peter the Barbarian put an apron in his bag<br>
    And rolled up the honoured bundle that Australians call a swag;<br>
    And he tramped from Darkest Russia, that it might be dark no more,<br>
    Dreaming of a port, and shipping, as no monarch dreamed before.<br>
    Of a home, and education, and of children staunch and true,<br>
    Like my father in the fifties&mdash;and&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;name was Peter,
    too.<br>
    (<i>He</i>&nbsp;could build a ship&mdash;or fiddle, out of wood, or bark,
    or hide&mdash;.<br>
    Sail one round the world and play the other one at eventide.)</p>
  <p>Russia&rsquo;s Peter (not&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;father) went to Holland in
    disguise,<br>
    Where he laboured as a shipwright underneath those gloomy skies;<br>
    Later on he went to England (which the Kaiser now&mdash;condemns)<br>
    Where he studied as a ship-smith by old Deptford on the Thames&mdash;<br>
    And no doubt he knew the rope-walk&mdash;(and the rope&rsquo;s end too, he
    knew)&mdash;<br>
    Learned to build a ship and sail it&mdash;learned the business through and
    through.<br>
    And I&rsquo;d like to say&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;father mastered navigation
    too.<br>
    (<i>He</i>&nbsp;was born across in Norway, educated fairly well,<br>
    And&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;grafted in a ship-yard by the Port of Arundel.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter Michaelov&rdquo; (not Larsen)&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;work was
    by no means done;<br>
    For he learned to make a ploughshare, and he learned to make a gun.<br>
    Russian soldiers must have clothing, so he laboured at the looms,<br>
    And he studied, after hours, building forts and building booms.<br>
    He would talk with all and sundry, merchants and adventurers&mdash;<br>
    Whaling men from Nova Scotia, and with ancient mariners.<br>
    Studied military systems (of which Austria&rsquo;s was the best).<br>
    Hospitals and even bedlams&mdash;class distinctions and the rest.</p>
  <p>There was nothing he neglected that was useful to be known&mdash;<br>
    And he even studied Wowsers, who had no creed of his own.<br>
    And, lest all that he accomplished should as miracles appear,<br>
    It must always be remembered he&rsquo;d a secret Fund for Beer.<br>
    When he tramped to toil and exile he was only twenty-five,<br>
    With a greater, grander object than had any man alive.<br>
    And perhaps the lad was bullied, and was sad for all we know&mdash;<br>
    Though it isn&rsquo;t very likely that he&rsquo;d take a second blow.<br>
    He had brains amongst the brainless, and, what that thing means I knew,<br>
    For before I found my kingdom, I had slaved in workshops too.</p>
  <p>But they never dreamed, the brainless, boors that used to sneer and scoff,<br>
    That the dreamy lad beside them&mdash;known as &ldquo;Dutchy Mickyloff&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
    Was a genius and a poet, and a Man&mdash;no matter which&mdash;<br>
    Was the Czar of all the Russias!&mdash;Peter Michaelovich.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>Sweden struck ere he was ready&mdash;filled the land with blood and tears&mdash;<br>
    But he broke the power of Sweden though it took him nine long years.<br>
  <i>For he had to train his army</i>&mdash;He was great in training men&mdash;<br>
    And no foreign foe in Russia have had easy times since then.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>

    of mighty drains&mdash;<br>
    (Ours of irrigation channels&mdash;or it should be, on the plains).<br>
    So he brought from many countries strong adventurers with brains.<br>
    It was marshes to horizons, it was pestilential bogs;<br>
    It was stoneless, it was treeless, so he brought Norwegian logs.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a land without a people, &rsquo;twas a land without a law;<br>
    But the lonely Gulf of Finland heard the axe and heard the saw;<br>
    He&nbsp;<i>compelled</i>&nbsp;the population to that desert land and lone&mdash;<br>
    Shifted them by tens of thousands as we&rsquo;ll&nbsp;<i>have</i>&nbsp;to
    shift our own.<br>
    He imported stone and mortar (<i>he</i>&nbsp;supplied the labouring gang),<br>
    Brought his masons from all Russia&mdash;let the other towns go hang;<br>
    Brought his carpenters from Venice&mdash;<i>they</i>&nbsp;knew how to make
    a port!<br>
    Till he heard the church bells ringing in the town of Petersfort!<br>
    Brought his shipbuilders from Holland, built his navy feverishly&mdash;<br>
    Till the Swedish fleet was shattered and the Baltic routes were free,<br>
    And his Port was on the Neva and his Ships were on the sea!</p>

    Let them have it, who will have it&mdash;those who do not understand&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Peter lived and died a savage&rdquo;&mdash;<i>but he civilized the land.</i><br>

  <i>We&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;have saved a lot of bother had we whacked our women,

  <p>Things have been mixed up in Europe till there&rsquo;s nothing in a name,<br>
    So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whence the Brandenburgers came;<br>
    But they did no pioneering as&nbsp;<i>our</i>&nbsp;fathers did of old&mdash;<br>
    Only bullied, robbed and murdered till they bought the land with gold.<br>
    And they settled down in Prussia to the bane of Germany,<br>
    With a spike upon the helmet where three brazen balls should be.<br>
    And they swaggered, swigged and swindled, and by bullying held sway,<br>
    And they blindly inter-married till they&rsquo;re madmen to this day.<br>
    And the lovely nights in Munich are as memories of the dead;<br>
    Night is filled with nameless terrors, day is filled with constant dread.<br>
    But Bavaria the peaceful, ere the lurid star is set,<br>
    She shall lead her neighbours on to pluck the Prussian Eagles yet.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ll pass over little Denmark, as the brave historians can,<br>
    Austria suffered at Sadowa, France was sorry at Sedan.<br>
    And for England&rsquo;s acquiescence in the crime she suffers too.<br>
    Meanwhile Denmark drained her marshes, planted grain and battled through.<br>
    (We, who never knew what war is&mdash;who had gold without the pain&mdash;<br>
    Never locked a western river that might save a western plain.)<br>
    You may say the Danes were pirates, and so leave them on the shelf?<br>
    Given youth and men and money, I would pirate some myself!<br>
    Why should I be so excited for another nation&rsquo;s pains?<br>
    I am prejudiced and angry, for my forefathers were Danes.<br>
    What have I to do with nations? Or the battle&rsquo;s lurid stars?&mdash;<br>
    I am Henry, son of Peter, who was Peter, son of Lars;<br>
    Lars the son of Nils&mdash;But never mind from whence our lineage springs&mdash;<br>
    Yes,&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;forefathers wore helmets, but their helmets wore
    the wings&mdash;<br>
    (There&rsquo;s a feather for your bonnet, there is unction for your souls!)<br>
    And the wings bore us to England, and Australia and the Poles.<br>
    What did&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;for little Denmark? Well, we sent our thousands
    through;<br>
    But, without the guns or money, what could Scandinavia do?<br>
    (It is true of some Australians, by the sea or sandwaste lone,<br>
    That they hold their father&rsquo;s country rather dearer than their own.<br>
    But the track is plain before them, and they know who blazed the track,<br>
    To the work our Foreign Fathers did in Early Days, Out Back.<br>
    As a mate can do no mean thing in the bushman&rsquo;s creed and song,<br>
    So a fellow&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s country [seems to me] can do no wrong.)</p>
  <p>Where was I? The Wrong of Denmark&mdash;or the chastening of her soul?<br>
    And perhaps her rulers &ldquo;got it&rdquo; where &rsquo;twas needed, on
    the whole.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas the gentlemen of Poland crushed the spirit of the Pole,<br>
    Till he didn&rsquo;t care which nation he was knouted by, and served;<br>
    So the gentlemen of Poland got wiped out, as they deserved.<br>
    Freedom shrieked (where was no freedom), and perhaps she shrieked for shame.<br>
    But let Kosciusko slumber&mdash;<i>we&rsquo;ve</i>&nbsp;immortalised his

    I took Finland, I took Poland, but I left their creeds alone.<br>
    I, the greater, kindlier Tyrant, bade them live and showed them how&mdash;<br>
    They are free, and they are happy, and they&rsquo;re marching with me now&mdash;<br>
    Marching to the War of Ages&mdash;marching to the War of Wars&mdash;<br>
    Hear the rebel songs of Warsaw! Hear the hymn of Helsingfors!<br>
    From the Danube to Siberia and the northern lights aflame.<br>
    Many freed and peaceful millions bless the day when Ivan came.<br>
    Travel through the mighty Russland&mdash;study, learn and understand<br>
    That&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;people are contented, for my people have their land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was spring-time in Crimea, coming cold and dark and late,<br>
    When I signed the terms you offered, for I knew that I could wait;<br>
    When I bowed to stronger nations or to Universal Fate.<br>
    And the roofs of guiltless kinsmen blazed across my frontiers still,<br>
    Where the bloody hordes of Islam came to ravish, rob and kill;<br>
    And the lands were laid in ashes over many a field and hill;<br>
    And the groans of tortured peasants (dreaming yet and sullen-mad)&mdash;<br>
    And the shrieks of outraged daughters echoed still in Petrograd;<br>
    So we taught and trained and struggled, and we cursed the Western Powers,<br>
    While we suffered in the awful silence of your God, and ours.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the safety of the White Race and the memory of Christ,<br>
    Once again I marched on Turkey, only to be sacrificed,<br>
    To the Sea-Greed of the Nations, by the pandering of the weak,<br>
    And the treachery in Athens of the lying, cheating Greek.<br>
    Once again I forced the Balkans over snow and rock and moss,<br>
    Once again I saw the passes stormed with unavailing loss;<br>
    Once again I saw the Crescent reeling back before the Cross,<br>
    And the ships of many nations on the billows dip and toss.</p>
  <p>Once again my grey battalions, that had come with Christian aid,<br>
    Stood before Constantinople! Ah, you wish that we had stayed!<br>
    But the Powers raised their fingers, fearful even once again,<br>
    With the jealous fear that lingers even now (and shall remain);<br>
    Frigid as the polar regions were your hearts to others&rsquo; pain&mdash;<br>
    So I dragged my weary legions back to Russia&mdash;<i>once again</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thrice again they raised their fingers when I came with purpose true,<br>
    And I bowed and smirked and grovelled as I had been used to do.<br>
    Till my kin in bloody visions saw their homes in ruins laid<br>
    From the Danube to the ocean, from the ocean to Belgrade;<br>
    I was ready, for the last time, when they called on me for aid.</p>
  <p>From the Dardanelles, denied me, shall my outward march be set;<br>
    And you&rsquo;ll see my fleets of commerce sail the Adriatic yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Grey Day.</b> </p>
  <p>Daybreak on the world of Europe! Daybreak from the Eastern arch;<br>
    Hear the startling sound of bugles! Load and limber up and march!<br>
    On! for Ivan and his children, Peace and Rest and Morning Star!<br>
    On for Truth and Right and Justice. On for Russia and the Czar!</p>

  <p align="center"><b>I.</b> </p>
  <p>We wrote&nbsp;and sang of a bush we never<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had known in youth in the Western land;<br>
    Of the dear old homes by the shining river,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep, clear creeks and the hills so grand.<br>
    The grass waved high on the flat and siding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild flowers bloomed on the banks so fair,<br>
    And younger sons from the North came riding<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To vine-clad homes in the gardens there.<br>
  <i>We wrote and sang&mdash;and the Lord knows best&mdash;<br>
    Oh, those dear old songs of the fairy West!</i></p>
  <p>We dreamed and sang of the &ldquo;bustling mother&rdquo;;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brick-floored kitchen we saw so clear,<br>
    The pranks and jokes of the youngest brother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening songs of our sisters dear.<br>
    The old man dozed in the chimney corner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or smoked and blinked at the cheerful blaze,<br>
    Or yarned with a crony&mdash;old Jack Horner&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d known him back in the Digging Days.<br>
  <i>We worked and sang&mdash;and the Lord knows best&mdash;<br>
    Oh, those dear old homes of the fairy West!</i></p>
  <p>By tracks that ran &rsquo;neath the granite ridges<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children played on their way from school&mdash;<br>
    By the fairy dells and the sapling bridges,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stole a swim in the willowed pool.<br>
    And home they flocked with their ceaseless chatter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, happy and tired, and washed and fed&mdash;<br>
    (The wash came after&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said their prayers and they went to bed.<br>
  <i>We worked and dreamed&mdash;and the Lord knows best&mdash;<br>
    Oh, those dear old ways of the fairy West!</i></p>
  <p>We rose at daylight, refreshed and hearty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drank our tea while the children slept;<br>
    We worked with the zest of a camping party,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the morning breeze through the gum-trees crept.<br>
    We worked till the signal of &ldquo;Breakfast ready!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ate our fill of the good land&rsquo;s best;<br>
    And Jimmy and Mary, and Nell and Teddy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the children were washed and dressed.<br>
  <i>Oh, those grand old farms of pleasure and rest<br>
    In the fairy tales of the Golden West!</i></p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a land overflowing with milk and honey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eggs and bacon and butter and beer.<br>
    We came to Sydney, with whips of money,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the world about twice a year.<br>
    The girls got married to rich young farmers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did no work save to populate;<br>
    And we had the pick of the city charmers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took our brides to the country straight.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buried in bitterness out of sight;<br>
    The scene was gone and the folk were banished,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the vision I saw last night&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be wrong and it may be right&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the corners, cobweb-immeshed,<br>
    To the dusty &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; where &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; lie sleeping,<br>

    They&rsquo;ve done the work of the able-bodied,<br>

  <p>The skimmin&rsquo;, and scaldin&rsquo; (in loo&rsquo;-warm water,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrowed mind of the elder son.<br>
    The sulky scowl of the younger brother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning greeting of &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo;<br>
    The rasping voice of the worn-out mother:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now git yer breakfus&rsquo; an&rsquo; git ter

  <p>Three miles to the school-house&mdash;and often more in<br>

  <b>A Phantasy of Optimism.</b></h2>
  <p>The president&nbsp;to Kingdoms,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the Days of Old;<br>
    The King to the Republic,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it had been foretold.<br>
  <i>They could not read the spelling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would not hear the call;<br>
    They would not brook the telling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Writing on the Wall.</i></p>
  <p>I buy my Peace with Slaughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Peace I fashion War;<br>
    I drown the land with water,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With land I build the shore.<br>
    I walk with Son and Daughter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Ocean rolled before.<br>
    I build a town where sea was<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tower where tempests roar.</p>
  <p>From bays in distant islands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rocks in lonely seas,<br>
    With unseen Death in silence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smite mine enemies!<br>
    The great Cathedral crashes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where once a city stood;<br>
    I build again on ashes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breed on clotted blood!</p>
  <p>I link the seas together,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at my sign and will<br>
    The train runs on the ocean bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great ship climbs the hill!<br>
    For pastime I flood deserts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With water from the rill;<br>
    And in my tireless leisure hours<br>
    I empty lakes, and fill.</p>
  <p>I plumb the seas beneath us<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fathom skies above,<br>
    Yet I make Peace for hatred<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I make War for love.<br>
    I race beneath the ranges<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit where Mystery dwells&mdash;<br>
    Yet mankind sees no changes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>They ask for &ldquo;miracles!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>I own the world and span its<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lone lands from Pole to Pole;<br>
    I live in other planets,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do not know my soul&mdash;<br>
    The soul that none may fathom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose secrets none may tell,<br>
    The soul that none may humble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soul Unconquerable!</p>
  <p>I am the God of Ages!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Unknown God!<br>
    My life is written pages<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever man hath trod.<br>
    From bounds of Polar regions,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where the Desert reigns,<br>
    I&rsquo;ve left my myriad legions<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On countless vanished plains.</p>
  <p>And I shall reign for ever<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On earth while oceans roll,<br>
    In shape of man, or woman,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my immortal soul;<br>
    Yet I can love and suffer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be angry, or be mild,<br>
    And I can bow me down and weep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like a mortal child.</p>
  <p>I conquer Death and Living,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fiends in shape of men,<br>
    For I rejoice in giving<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to receive again.<br>
    For I am Man!&mdash;and Mortal!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mammon&rsquo;s Towers must fall,<br>
    Though Greed draws all his pencils through<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Writing on the Wall!</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheCaptains"></a>The Captains</b></h2>
  <p>The Captains&nbsp;sailed from all the World&mdash;from all the world and
    Spain;<br>
    And each one for his country&rsquo;s ease, her glory and her gain;<br>
    The Captains sailed to Southern Seas, and sailed the Spanish Main;<br>
    And some sailed out beyond the World, and some sailed home again.</p>
  <p>And each one for his daily bread, and bitter bread it was,<br>
    Because of things they&rsquo;d left at home&mdash;or for some other cause.<br>
    Their wives and daughters made the lace to deck the Lady&rsquo;s gown,<br>
    Where sailors&rsquo; wives sew dungarees by many a seaport town.</p>
  <p>The Captains sailed in rotten ships, with often rotten crews,<br>
    Because their lands were ignorant and meaner than the ooze;<br>
    With money furnished them by Greed, or by ambition mean,<br>
    When they had crawled to some pig-faced, pig-hearted king or queen.</p>
  <p>And when a storm was on the coast, and spray leaped o&rsquo;er the quays,<br>
    Then little Joan or Dorothy, or Inez or Louise,<br>
    Would kneel her down on such a night beside her mother&rsquo;s knees,<br>
    And fold her little hands and pray for those beyond the seas.<br>
    With the touching faith of little girls&mdash;the faith by love embalmed&mdash;<br>
    They&rsquo;d pray for men beyond the seas who might have been becalmed.</p>
  <p><i>For some will pray at CHRIST&nbsp;His feet, and some at MARY&rsquo;S&nbsp;shrine;<br>
    And some to Heathen goddesses, as I have prayed to mine;<br>
    To Mecca or to Bethlehem, to Fire, or Joss, or Sol,<br>
    And one will pray to sticks or stones, and one to her rag doll.<br>
    But we are stubborn men and vain, and though we rise or fall,<br>
    Our children&rsquo;s prayers or women&rsquo;s prayers, GOD&nbsp;knows we
    need them all!<br>
    And no one fights the bitter gale, or strives in combat grim,<br>
    But, somewhere in the world, a child is praying hard for him.</i> </p>
  <p>The Captains sailed to India, to China and Japan.<br>
    They met the Strangers&rsquo; Welcome and the Friendliness of Man;<br>
    The Captains sailed to Southern Seas, and &ldquo;wondrous sights&rdquo; they
    saw&mdash;<br>
    The Rights of Man in savage lands, and law without a law.<br>
    They learnt the truth from savages, and wisdom from the wild,<br>
    And learned to walk in unknown ways, and trust them like a child.<br>
    (The sailors told of monstrous things that be where sailors roam&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
  <i>But none had seen more monstrous things than they had seen at home.</i>)</p>
  <p>They found new worlds for crowded folk in cities old and worn,<br>
    And huts of hunger, fog and smoke in lands by Faction torn.<br>
    (They found the great and empty lands where Nations might be born.)<br>
    They found new foods, they found new wealth, and newer ways to live,<br>
    Where sons might grow in strength and health, with all that God would give.<br>
    They tracked their ways through unknown seas where Danger still remains,<br>
    And sailed back poor and broken men, and some sailed back in chains.<br>
    But, bound or free, or ill or well, where&rsquo;er their sails were furled,<br>
    They brought to weary, worn-out lands glad tidings from the World.</p>
  <p>The Seasons saw our fathers come, their flocks and herds increase;<br>
    They saw the old lands waste in War, the new lands waste in Peace;<br>
    The Seasons saw new gardens made, they saw the old lands bleed,<br>
    And into new lands introduced the curse of Class and Creed.<br>
    They saw the birth of Politics, and all was ripe for Greed.<br>
    And Mammon came and built his towers, and Mammon held the fort:<br>
    Till one new land went dollar-mad, and one went mad for Sport.</p>
  <p>Where men for love of Science sailed in rotten tubs for years,<br>
    To hang or starve, while nought availed a wife or daughter&rsquo;s tears&mdash;<br>
    Where men made life-long sacrifice for some blind Northern Power,<br>
    Now Science sinks a thousand souls, and sinks them in an hour.<br>
    You would be rich and great too soon&mdash;have all that mortal craves;<br>
    The day may come ere you have lived when you&rsquo;ll be poor and slaves.<br>
    You heeded not the warning voice, for Self and Sport prevailed;<br>
    You yet might wish, in dust and dread, those Captains had not sailed.</p>

  <p>Oh!&nbsp;this is a joyful dirge, my friends, and this is a hymn of praise;<br>
    And this is a clamour of Victory, and a p&aelig;an of Ancient Days.<br>
    It isn&rsquo;t a Yelp of the Battlefield; nor a Howl of the Bounding Wave,<br>
    But an ode to the Things that the War has Killed, and a lay of the Festive
    Grave.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a triolet of the Tomb, you bet, and a whoop because of Despair,<br>
    And it&rsquo;s sung as I stand on my hoary head and wave my legs in the air!</p>
  <p>Oh! I dance on the grave of the Suffragette (I dance on my hands and dome),<br>
    And the Sanctity-of-the-Marriage-Tie and the Breaking-Up-of-the-Home.<br>
    And I dance on the grave of the weird White-Slave that died when the war
    began;<br>
    And Better-Protection-for-Women-and-Girls, and Men-Made-Laws-for-Man!</p>
  <p>Oh, I dance on the Liberal Lady&rsquo;s grave and the Labour Woman&rsquo;s,
    too;<br>
    And the grave of the Female lie and shriek, with a dance that is wild and
    new.<br>
    And my only regret in this song-a-let as I dance over dale and hill,<br>
    Is the Yarn-of-the-Wife and the Tale-of-the-Girl that never a war can kill.</p>
  <p>Oh, I dance on the grave of the want-ter-write, and I dance on the Tomb
    of the Sneer,<br>
    And poet-and-author-and-critic, too, who used to be great round here.<br>
    But &ldquo;Old Mother Often&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mother of Ten&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; escaped
    from the grave&mdash;<br>
    And &ldquo;Pro Bono Publico&rdquo; liveth again, as &ldquo;Victis,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Honour
    the Brave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oh, lightly I danced upon Politics&rsquo; grave where the Friend of the
    Candidate slept,<br>
    And over the Female Political Devil, oh wildly I bounded and leapt.<br>
    But this dance shall be nothing compared with the dance of the spook of the
    writer who sings<br>
    On the grave of the bard and the&nbsp;<i>Bulletin&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;grave,
out there at the Finish of Things!</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheVanguard"></a>The Vanguard</b></h2>
  <p>They say, in all kindness, I&rsquo;m out of the hunt&mdash;<br>
    Too old and too deaf to be sent to the Front.<br>
    A scribbler of stories, a maker of songs,<br>
    To the fireside and armchair my valour belongs!<br>
    Yet in campaigns all hopeless, in bitterest strife,<br>
    I have been at the Front all the days of my life.</p>
  <p>Oh, your girl feels a princess, your people are proud,<br>
    As you march down the street, &rsquo;midst the cheers of the crowd;<br>
    And the Nation&rsquo;s behind you and cloudless your sky,<br>
    And you come back to Honour, or gloriously die;<br>
    While for each thing that brightens, and each thing that cheers,<br>
    I have starved in the trenches these forty long years.</p>
  <p>The cities were silent, the people were glum,<br>
    No sound of a bugle, no tap of a drum;<br>
    Our enemies mighty and Parliaments sour,<br>
    Our Land&rsquo;s lovers few, and no Man of the Hour.<br>
    The Girl turned her nose up (maybe &rsquo;twas before),<br>
    And they voted us Cracked when we marched to the war.</p>
  <p>Our army was small and &rsquo;twas scattered afar,<br>
    And our headquarters down where the Poor People are.<br>
    But I knew the great hearts of the Jims and the Bills,<br>
    And we signalled by wireless as old as the hills.<br>
    There were songs that could reach to our furthermost wing,<br>
    And Sorrow and Poverty taught me to sing.</p>
  <p>Our War Hymn the war hymn that ever prevails&mdash;<br>
    Oh, we sang it of old when we marched from Marseilles!<br>
    And our army traditions are cherished with pride<br>
    In streets and in woods where we triumphed, or died;<br>
    Where, rebel or loyal, by farmhouse and town,<br>
    The chorus waxed faint as they volleyed us down.</p>
  <p>No V.C. comes to us, no rest nor release,<br>
    Though hardest of all is this fighting in peace.<br>
    Small honour to wife or to daughter or son,<br>
    Though noblest of all are the deeds that are done.<br>
    But we never are conquered, we never can die,<br>
    For we live through the ages, my army and I!</p>

  <p class="note">[According to Commissioner Hay, Chief Officer of the Salvation Army in Australia,
    who has just returned from Europe, there are already about 20,000 Salvationists
    at the Front, and more going, and a lot more getting ready in a hurry to
    go.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In Europe there are brigades of nurses and
    Red Cross workers under the control of &ldquo;Brigadier&rdquo; Mary Murray.
    She is a daughter of General Sir Alexander Murray of the Indian Military
    forces, and she has been a member of the Salvation Army for twenty years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The
    Army has placed a number of its homes (and presumably all its barracks) at
    the disposal of the naval and military authorities for use as hospitals.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In
    Australia there are several Salvation Army training camps that have been
    visited and complimented by the Minister for Defence, who has accepted the
    offer of the Army to accommodate and care for children orphaned by the war,
    and for whom succour in private homes cannot be found. Belgian children will
    be welcomed and cared for.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Eighty Salvation Army
    people have volunteered for Red Cross work; the majority well trained as
    surgical nurses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;All those trained as officers
    have special training in first aid; over 600 young men have already gained
    certificates. Tents are being erected at Rosehill, where men in training
    will be provided with writing material, reading matter, games, music, etc.,
    and a coffee canteen. I don&rsquo;t know what the &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; is,
    but, incidentally, the Army handed in its little bit of &pound;1,000 for
    the widow&rsquo;s and orphans&rsquo; fund&mdash;just to keep things going
    like. Glory, Alleluia!]</p>
  <p>They&nbsp;were &ldquo;ratty&rdquo; they were hooted by the meanest and the
    least,<br>
    When they woke the Drum of Glory long ago in London East.<br>
    They were often mobbed by hoodlums&mdash;they were few, but unafraid&mdash;<br>
    And their Lassies were insulted, but they banged the drum&mdash;and prayed.<br>
    Prayed in public for the sinners, prayed in private for release,<br>
    Till they saved some brawny lumpers&mdash;<i>then</i>&nbsp;they banged the
    drum in peace.<br>
    (Saved some prize-fighter and burglars)&mdash;and they banged the drum in
    peace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booth&rsquo;s Drum.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hook-nosed, he was &ldquo;scrawny,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was nothing of a Don.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his business ways seemed Yiddish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his speeches &ldquo;kid&rdquo;&mdash;or kiddish;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we doubted his &ldquo;convictions&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his drum is going on.</p>
  <p>Oh, they drummed it ever onward with old Blood-and-Fire unfurled,<br>
    And they drummed it ever outward to the corners of the world.<br>
    Till they banged the drum in Greenland and they banged in Ispahan,<br>
    And they banged it round to India and China and Japan.<br>
    And they banged it through the Islands where each seasoned Son of Rum<br>
    Took them for new-fangled Jim Jams when he heard the Army Drum.<br>
    (For a bran&rsquo; new brand of Horrors, when he saw the Army come.)<br>
    So they banged it in the desert, and they banged in the snow&mdash;<br>
    They&rsquo;d have banged the Drum to Mecca! with the shadow of a &ldquo;show.&rdquo;<br>
    (But Mohammed cut their heads off, so they had to let it go.)</p>
  <p>Somewhere in the early eighties they had banged the drum to Bourke,<br>
    Where the job of fighting Satan was white-hot and dusty work.<br>
    Oh, the Local Lass was withered in the heat that bakes and glares,<br>
    And we sent her food and firewood but took small heed of her prayers.<br>
    We were blasphemous and beery, we were free from Creed or Care,<br>
    Till they sent their prettiest Lassies&mdash;and they broke our centre there.<br>
    So that, moderately sober, we could stand to hear them sing&mdash;<br>
    And we&rsquo;d chaff their Testifiers, and throw quids into the ring.<br>
    (Never less than bobs or &ldquo;dollars&rdquo;&mdash;sometimes quids into
    the ring.)</p>
  <p>They have &ldquo;stormed&rdquo; our sinful cities&mdash;banged for all that
    they were worth&mdash;<br>
    From Port Darwin to Port Melbourne, and from Sydney round to Perth.<br>
    We&rsquo;d no need for them (or woman) when we were all right and well,<br>
    But they took us out of prison, and they took us out of Hell.<br>
    And they helped our fallen sisters who went down for such as we,<br>
    And our widows and our orphans in distress and poverty.<br>
    And neglected wives and children of the worst of us that be;<br>
    And they made us fit for Glory&mdash;or another Glorious Spree.<br>
    (So I rather think there&rsquo;s something that is up to you or me.)</p>
  <p>Oh! the Blindness of the Future!&mdash;Ah, we never reckoned much<br>
    That they&rsquo;d beat the quids we gave them into bayonets and such.<br>
    That the coin would be devoted, when our world was looking blue,<br>
    To another kind of orphan&mdash;wife, or child, or widow too.<br>
    But the times have changed a sudden, and the past is very dim;<br>
  <i>They Have Found a Real Devil, and They&rsquo;re Going After Him.</i><br>
    (With a Bible and a Rifle they are going after him.)</p>
  <p>For the old Salvation Army, and their Country, and their King,<br>
    They are marching to the trenches, shouting, &ldquo;Comrades! Let us Sing!&rdquo;<br>
    They&rsquo;ll find foreign &ldquo;Army&rdquo; soldiers here and there and
    everywhere,<br>
    Who will speak their tongue and help them. And they&rsquo;ll surely breathe
    a prayer<br>
    For the Spy&mdash;before they shoot him; and another when he&rsquo;s still.<br>
    And they&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;fire a volley&rdquo; in the Land of Kaiser
    Bill.<br>
    But, when all is done and quiet&mdash;as before they march away&mdash;<br>
    They will kneel about their banner, saying &ldquo;Brethren. Let us pray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They have long used army rank-terms, and oh, say what it shall be,<br>
    When a few come back the real thing, and when one comes back V.C.!<br>
    They will bang the drum at Crow&rsquo;s Nest, they will bang it on &ldquo;the
    Shore,&rdquo;<br>
    They will bang the drum in Kent-street as they never banged before.<br>
    And At Last they&rsquo;ll frighten Satan from the Mansion and the Slum&mdash;<br>
    He&rsquo;ll have never heard till that time such a Banging of the Drum.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was lonely with his thousands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely in his household too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his children had deserted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his captains, not a few.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was old and white and feeble<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his sight was nearly gone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he &ldquo;could not see his people,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his drum is rolling on.<br>

  <p>My army! My army&mdash;I hear the sound of drums<br>
    Above the roar of battles&mdash;and, lo! my army comes!<br>
    Nor creed of man may stay it&mdash;nor war, nor nation&rsquo;s law&mdash;<br>
    The pikes go through the firing-lines as pitchforks go through straw&mdash;<br>
    Like pitchforks through the litter, while empires stand in awe.</p>
