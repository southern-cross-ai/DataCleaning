  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN James Cook lifted the veil that had long masked the Terra Incognita
    of the south, a fresh breeze of adventure blew across the souls of Englishmen.
    Here for conquest were virgin lands&mdash;lands with no history, no legend
    of achievement or shame&mdash;and needing for their conquest no sword, but
    only strong hearts and an enduring purpose. Men might have seen in their
    dreams a wider, sweeter England rising as by magic over far oceans, free
    of fettering old-world traditions, a source of light and leading to all.
    To claim that such a vision has been realized would be as yet too much; but
    the foundations have been laid. The wide spaces of the Australian continent
    are developing a race British in fibre and texture, yet unlike the peoples
    of Britain in every mere external. It is hard to discern the heights to which
    this race may attain in the brave days yet to be; but a nation in the making
    is always an object of supreme interest. Processes that in the days of the
    Heptarchy moulded Kent and Yorkshire are even now moulding Tasmania and Queensland.
    It was inevitable that such a race in the making, such a land in the shaping,
    should find its singer; and that, the singer found, his music should be different
    from that of all others. </p>
  <p>Henry Lawson is the first articulate voice of the real Australia. Other
    singers in plenty the southern continent knows and has known men and women
    following bravely in the broad pathway where Byron strode and Wordsworth
    loitered; but one alone has found the heart of the new land, its rugged strength,
    its impatience of old restraints, its hopes and fears and despairs, its irreverence
    and grim humour, and the tenderness and courage that underlie them all. Lawson
    is never exquisite as are our greater lyrists. The axemarks show in his work
    everywhere. But he is sincere and strong and true; and the living beauty
    in that sincerity and strength and truth grips us more than any delicate
    craftsmanship. His laughter is as genuine as that of the wind and the sea;
    he weeps as Australians of the bush weep, with dry eyes and a hard curving
    mouth. He knows men and women&mdash;his men and women. In the world&rsquo;s
    loneliest places he has grasped hard hands alive with heroic meaning; in
    crowded cities, where the shames of older nations have overflowed into the
    new, he has felt the throb of emotions too fine for civilization&rsquo;s
    sordid setting. In Lawson, too, there is a splendid scorn the scorn of the
    Things-that-Are and always as he looks into the eyes of his world, seeking
    the best in the worst, his indignation biases against the shams and the shows
    that have been brought across the seas to hold Liberty from her purpose.
    Lawson has lived his people&rsquo;s life, seen with their eyes, felt throb
    for throb with them in pain and joy; and he sets it all to a rugged music
    of his own that goes straight to the heart. </p>
  <p>When in April, 1915, Australians made the historic landing at Gaba Tepe,
    the unexpectant world saw young soldiers from a peaceful Commonwealth bearing
    themselves in the stress of war like veterans of the older fighting nations.
    The spectacle arrested and surprised. But Lawson had sung of these things
    more than twenty years before. Nothing that Australians did in Gallipoli,
    or later in the fields of France, was new or strange to those who remembered
    the bugle note of his early poems. With prophetic insight he had dreamed
    a people&rsquo;s dream had felt in that soldier-heart of his early manhood
    the tremor of a coming tempest, though the world skies were then clear and
    had foreknown with every fibre of his being the way in which men of the bush
    and the mountain and plain would respond to the battle-call. </p>
  <p>What of the man who has done and felt these things? He lives his life in
    Australia still a life very close to ours, yet remote and lonely as that
    of genius is wont to be. London called to him, and he left us for a while,
    but came back more Australian than when he went away. You meet him in the
    street and are arrested by his eyes. Are there such eyes anywhere else under
    such a forehead? He has the softened speech of the deaf, but the eyes speak
    always more than the voice; and the grasp of his hand is brotherly. A sense
    of great sympathy and human kindliness is always about him. You will not
    talk much with Lawson, but you will not lightly forget your first meeting.
    A child will understand him better than a busy city man, for the child understands
    the eternal language of the heart written in the eye; and Australia, strong-thewed
    pioneer though she be, has enough of the child left in her to understand
    her son. </p>
  <p>Henry Lawson was born in a tent on the Grenfell gold field in 1867. His
    father was a Norse sailor who became a digger; his mother came of a Kentish
    family of gipsy blood and tradition. Henry spent his boyhood on old mining
    fields, and on a selection his father had taken up. Later, he came to Sydney
    and learned coach painting, attended a night school, dabbled in spiritualism,
    and was caught in the wave of socialism. Very early his verses attracted
    attention. He was the voice of a new movement; the ringing, surging rebellion
    of his song echoed the unrest of the eighties and nineties, years full of
    great labour strikes and the breaking up of old political parties. Then he
    wandered far into the interior of Australia&mdash;his fame growing all the
    while&mdash;saw and shared the rude strenuous life of his brothers in a dozen
    varieties of toil, crossed over to New Zealand, and added to the tang of
    the gum leaves something of the salt of the great Southern Ocean. He has
    lived the life that he sings and seen the places of which he writes; there
    is not a word in all his work which is not instantly recognized by his readers
    as honest Australian. The drover, the stockman, the shearer, the rider far
    on the skyline, the girl waiting at the sliprails, the big bush funeral,
    the coach with flashing lamps passing at night along the ranges, the man
    to whom home is a bitter memory and his future a long despair, the troops
    marching to the beat of the drum, the coasting vessel struggling through
    blinding south-westerly gales, the great grey plain, the wilderness of the
    Never-Never&mdash;in long procession the pictures pass, and every picture
    is a true one because Henry Lawson has been there to see with the eyes of
    his heart. </p>
  <p>At twenty-one, Lawson was probably the most remarkable writer of verse in
    Australia. Some critics of those days thought his genius prematurely developed,
    and likely to flame up strongly and fade away swiftly. Lawson disappointed
    their predictions. He remained; he continued to write; he gathered grip and
    force as the years went by. The dates of original publication attached to
    each poem in this collection will enable the reader to follow the author&rsquo;s
    progress. They cover a wide range of years. Before he had reached his twenty-first
    birthday, Lawson, keenly alive to all the movements about him in Sydney,
    found one political faction discussing a closer imperialism of a rather mechanical
    pattern, while another cried for an equally machine-made socialism. He listened
    to the outpourings of oratory one night, and, remembering the growth of wealth
    and luxury on the one hand and the increasing squalor of the city slums on
    the other, went home and wrote FACES IN THE STREET&mdash;a notable achievement
    that brought him immediate local fame. Seven years afterwards, still with
    the passionate hope of a purifying revolution in his heart, he saw THE STAR
    OF AUSTRALASIA rise through tumult and battle smoke and foretold, in lines
    that surge and sweep, the storm that was to break down divisions between
    rich and poor, and to call to life a great nationhood through a baptism of
    blood. At forty-eight he sang of MY ARMY, O MY ARMY, the struggling &ldquo;Vanguard&rdquo; always
    suffering in the trenches of civilization that others might go on to victory.
    Never was the view of the final triumph obscured; but the means by which
    it might be attained seemed more clouded in doubt as the years went by. Then,
    when he had completed his full half-century of life, the poet&rsquo;s vision
    cleared. At fifty he wrote ENGLAND YET, a song of pride in a greater nationality,
    wider and more embracing than the old Australia of his dreams. Here is natural
    progression of thought&mdash;a mind growing with the years, a hope enlarging
    with the great movements of the race. </p>
  <p>In simpler and homelier themes the continual widening of his sympathy is
    equally marked. THE DROVER&rsquo;S SWEETHEART, with its sob of delight in
    the last stanza, was written at twenty-two. Ten years afterwards he penned
    the tenderest and most perfect of all his poems, THE SLIPRAILS AND THE SPUR.
    Dear old BLACK BONNET&mdash;a picture as true as it is sweet in all years
    and all places&mdash;first tripped to church in his verse when he was forty-
    nine; at fifty, SCOTS OF THE RIVERINA showed that he had not lost his power
    of dealing with the tragedy that underlies life&rsquo;s commonplace. The
    reader may trace a similar growth of sympathy for the men and women whom
    civilization condemns, or who have come to be regarded as &ldquo;down and
    out.&rsquo; He saw SWEENEY with battered humorous face and empty bottle in
    1891; PAST CARIN&rsquo;, with its completeness of heartbreak, was written
    in 1899; and the grim realism of ONE-HUNDRED-AND-THREE, which must stand
    among Lawson&rsquo;s greatest efforts, appeared in 1908. Always there is
    growth, apparent from year to year and decade to decade. The verses vary
    greatly in merit and manner, but the thought and feeling behind them move
    on into wider places. Lawson fulfilled his first promise and did something
    more. </p>
  <p>Of Lawson&rsquo;s place in literature it is idle to speak. Something of
    what Burns did for Scotland, something of what Kipling did for India, he
    has done for Australia; but he is not in the least like either Kipling or
    Burns. Judged as verse, his work has nearly always a certain crudity; fudged
    by the higher standard of poetry, it is often greatest when the crudity is
    most apparent. In the coming chances and changes it is daring to predict
    immortality for any writer. The world is being remade in fire and pain; in
    that remaking every standard of achievement may be altered utterly from those
    to which we have been accustomed; but if permanency is to be looked for anywhere,
    it is in vital, red-blooded work such as Lawson&rsquo;s&mdash;work that came
    so straight from the heart that it must always find a heart to respond to
    it. All Australia is there, painted with a big brush in the colours in which
    its people see it. </p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="EnglandYet"></a>England Yet</b></h2>
  <p>She&rsquo;s England yet! The nations never knew her;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if they knew, were ready to forget.<br>
    She made new worlds that paid no homage to her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she called for none as for a debt.<br>
    The bullying power who deemed all nations craven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that her star of destiny had set,<br>
    Was sure that she would seek a coward&rsquo;s haven &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tempted her, and found her England yet!</p>
  <p>We learn our England, and we soon forget,<br>
    To learn again that she is England yet!</p>
  <p>They watched Britannia ever looking forward,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But could not see the things her children saw.<br>
    They watched in Southern seas her boats pull shoreward,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only marked the eyeglass, heard the &ldquo;Haw !&rdquo;<br>
    In tents, and bungalows, and outpost stations,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin white men ruled for her, unseen, unheard,<br>
    Till millions of strange races and far nations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were ready to obey her at a word.</p>
  <p>We learn our England, and in peace forget,<br>
    To learn in storm that she is England yet.</p>
  <p>She&rsquo;s England yet; and men shall doubt no longer;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mourn no longer for what she has been.<br>
    She&rsquo;ll be a greater England and a stronger &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better England than the world has seen.<br>
    Our own, who reck not of a king&rsquo;s regalia,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinsel of crowns, and courts that fume and fret,<br>
    Are fighting for her &mdash; fighting for Australia &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blasphemously hail her &quot;England Yet!&quot;</p>
  <p>She&rsquo;s England yet, with little to regret &mdash;<br>
    Ay, more than ever, she&rsquo;ll be England yet!</p>
  <p><i>1917</i></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStarofAustralasia"></a>The Star of Australasia</b></h2>
  <p>We&nbsp;boast no more of our bloodless flag, that rose from a nation&rsquo;s
    slime;<br>
    Better a shred of a deep-dyed rag from the storms of the olden time.<br>
    From grander clouds in our &ldquo;peaceful skies&rdquo; than ever were there
    before<br>
    I tell you the Star of the South shall rise&mdash;in the lurid clouds of
    war.<br>
    It ever must be while blood is warm and the sons of men increase;<br>
    For ever the nations rose in storm, to rot in a deadly peace.<br>
    There comes a point that we will not yield, no matter if right or wrong,<br>
    And man will fight on the battle-field while passion and pride are strong&mdash;<br>
    So long as he will not kiss the rod, and his stubborn spirit sours,<br>
    And the scorn of Nature and curse of God are heavy on peace like ours.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>There are boys out there by the western creeks, who hurry away from school<br>
    To climb the sides of the breezy peaks or dive in the shaded pool,<br>
    Who&rsquo;ll stick to their guns when the mountains quake to the tread of
    a mighty war,<br>
    And fight for Right or a Grand Mistake as men never fought before;<br>
    When the peaks are scarred and the sea-walls crack till the furthest hills
    vibrate,<br>
    And the world for a while goes rolling back in a storm of love and hate.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>There are boys to-day in the city slum and the home of wealth and pride<br>
    Who&rsquo;ll have one home when the storm is come, and fight for it side
    by side,<br>
    Who&rsquo;ll hold the cliffs against armoured hells that batter
    a coastal town,<br>
    Or grimly die in a hail of shells when the walls come crashing down.<br>
    And many a pink-white baby girl, the queen of her home to-day,<br>
    Shall see the wings of the tempest whirl the mist of our dawn away&mdash;<br>
    Shall live to shudder and stop her ears to the thud of the distant gun,<br>
    And know the sorrow that has no tears when a battle is lost and won,&mdash;<br>
    As a mother or wife in the years to come, will kneel, wild-eyed and white,<br>
    And pray to God in her darkened home for the &ldquo;men in the fort to-night&rdquo;.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>But, oh! if the cavalry charge again as they did when the world was wide,<br>
    &rsquo;Twill be grand in the ranks of a thousand men in that glorious race
    to ride,<br>
    And strike for all that is true and strong, for all that is grand and brave,<br>
    And all that ever shall be, so long as man has a soul to save.<br>
    He must lift the saddle, and close his &ldquo;wings&rdquo;, and shut his
    angels out,<br>
    And steel his heart for the end of things, who&rsquo;d ride with a stockman
    scout,<br>
    When the race they ride on the battle track, and the waning distance hums,<br>
    And the shelled sky shrieks or the rifles crack like stockwhip amongst the
    gums&mdash;<br>
    And the &ldquo;straight&rdquo; is reached and the field is &ldquo;gapped&rdquo; and
    the hoof-torn sward grows red<br>
    With the blood of those who are handicapped with iron and steel and lead;<br>

    They&rsquo;ll fight for honour and fight for love, and a few will fight for
    gold,<br>
    For the devil below and for God above, as our fathers fought of old;<br>
    And some half-blind with exultant tears, and some stiff-lipped, stern-eyed,<br>
    For the pride of a thousand after-years and the old eternal pride;<br>
    The soul of the world they will feel and see in the chase and the grim retreat&mdash;<br>

    With arsenals west of the mountain range and every spur its gun.<br>

    Will trace the field with his pipe, and shirk the facts that are hard to

    As grey old mates of the diggings work the old ground over again&mdash;<br>

    And every heart in the town leaps high at the first loud thud of the drum.<br>
    They&rsquo;ll know, apart from its mystic charm, what music is at last,<br>
    When, proud as a boy with a broken arm, the regiment marches past.<br>
    And the veriest wreck in the drink-fiend&rsquo;s clutch, no matter how low

    been.<br>
    And fools, when the fiends of war are out and the city skies aflame,<br>
    Will have something better to talk about than an absent woman&rsquo;s shame,<br>
    Will have something nobler to do by far than jest at a friend&rsquo;s expense,<br>
    Or blacken a name in a public bar or over a backyard fence.<br>
    And this we learn from the libelled past, though its methods were somewhat
    rude&mdash;<br>
    A Nation&rsquo;s born where the shells fall fast, or its lease of life renewed.<br>
    We in part atone for the ghoulish strife, and the crimes of the peace we
    boast,<br>
    And the better part of a people&rsquo;s life in the storm comes uppermost.</p>
  <p>The self-same spirit that drives the man to the depths of drink and crime<br>
    Will do the deeds in the heroes&rsquo; van that live till the end of time.<br>
    The living death in the lonely bush, the greed of the selfish town,<br>
    And even the creed of the outlawed push is chivalry&mdash;upside down.<br>
    &rsquo;Twill be while ever our blood is hot, while ever the world goes wrong,<br>
    The nations rise in a war, to rot in a peace that lasts too long.<br>
    And southern nation and southern state, aroused from their dream of ease,<br>

  <p> They lie, the men who tell us, for reasons of their own, <br>
    That want is here a stranger, and that misery&rsquo;s unknown;<br>
    For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet<br>
    My window-sill is level with the faces in the street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting past, drifting past,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beat of weary feet &mdash;<br>
While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
  <p> And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,<br>
    To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care;<br>
    I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet<br>
    In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting on, drifting on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the scrape of restless feet;<br>
    I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
  <p>In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky<br>
    The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,<br>
    Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,<br>
    Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing in, flowing in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beat of hurried feet &mdash;<br>
    Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
  <p>The human river dwindles when &rsquo;tis past the hour of eight,<br>
    Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;<br>
    But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat<br>
    The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grinding body, grinding soul,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielding scarce enough to eat &mdash;<br>
    Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
  <p>And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down<br>
    Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town,<br>
    Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street<br>
    Tells of the city&rsquo;s unemployed upon his weary beat &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting round, drifting round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the tread of listless feet &mdash;<br>
    Ah! My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street.</p>
  <p>And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away,<br>
    And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day,<br>
    Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat,<br>
    Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebbing out, ebbing out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the drag of tired feet,<br>
    While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street.</p>
  <p>And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day&rsquo;s sadend is seen,<br>
    For while the short &ldquo;large hours&rdquo; toward the longer &ldquo;small
    hours&rdquo; trend,<br>
    With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat,<br>
    Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking down, sinking down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battered wreck by tempests beat &mdash;<br>
    A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street.</p>
  <p>But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes,<br>
    For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums,<br>
    Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet,<br>
    And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotting out, rotting out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lack of air and meat &mdash;<br>
    In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street.</p>
  <p>I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure<br>
    Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor?<br>
    Ah! Mammon&rsquo;s slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror
    beat,<br>
    When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong things and the bad things<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad things that we meet<br>
    In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.</p>
  <p>I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still,<br>
    And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill;<br>
    But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet,<br>
    They haunted me &mdash; the shadows of those faces in the street,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitting by, flitting by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitting by with noiseless feet,<br>
    And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street.</p>
  <p>Once I cried: &ldquo;Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure,<br>
    Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.&rsquo;<br>
    And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city&rsquo;s street,<br>
    And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming near, coming near,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a drum&rsquo;s dull distant beat,<br>
    &rsquo;Twas Despair&rsquo;s conscripted    army that was marching down
    the street.</p>
  <p>Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall,<br>
    The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all,<br>
    And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution&rsquo;s heat,<br>
    And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pouring on, pouring on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a drum&rsquo;s loud threatening
  beat,<br>
    And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street.</p>
  <p>And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course,<br>
    The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse,<br>
    But not until a city feels Red Revolution&rsquo;s feet<br>
    Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreadful everlasting strife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For scarcely clothes and meat<br>
    In that pent track of living death &mdash; the city&rsquo;s cruel street.</p>

I wander for ever and dream as I go.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He will dream things and he&rsquo;ll see things<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor a friend to prove untrue;<br>
    For I leave my love ere the turning tide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my friends are all too new.<br>
    The curse of the Powers on a peace like ours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its greed and its treachery&mdash;<br>
    A stranger&rsquo;s hand, and a stranger land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rest of the world for me!</p>
  <p>But why be bitter? The world is cold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one with a frozen heart;<br>
    New friends are often so like the old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem of the Past a part&mdash;<br>
    As a better part of the past appears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When enemies, parted long,<br>
    Are come together in kinder years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their better nature strong.</p>
  <p>I had a friend, ere my first ship sailed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend that I never deserved&mdash;<br>
    For the selfish strain in my blood prevailed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as my turn was served.<br>
    And the memory haunts my heart with shame&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, rather, the pride that&rsquo;s there;<br>
    In different guises, but soul the same,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meet him everywhere.</p>
  <p>I had a chum. When the times were tight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We starved in Australian scrubs;<br>
    We froze together in parks at night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughed together in pubs.<br>
    And I often hear a laugh like his<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a sense of humour keen,<br>
    And catch a glimpse in a passing phiz<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his broad, good-humoured grin.</p>
  <p>And I had a love&mdash;&rsquo;twas a love to prize&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I never went back again . . .<br>
    I have seen the light of her kind grey eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many a face since then.</p>

  <p>The sailors say &rsquo;twill be rough to-night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they fasten the hatches down,<br>
    The south is black, and the bar is white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the drifting smoke is brown.<br>
    The gold has gone from the western haze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-birds circle and swarm&mdash;<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SinceThen"></a>Since Then</b></h2>
  <p>I&nbsp;met&nbsp;Jack Ellis in town to-day&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Ellis&mdash;my old mate, Jack,<br>
    Ten years ago, from the Castlereagh,<br>
    We carried our swags together away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Never-Again, Out Back.</p>
  <p>But times have altered since those old days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the times have changed the men.<br>
    Ah, well! there&rsquo;s little to blame or praise&mdash;<br>
    Jack Ellis and I have tramped long ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On different tracks since then.</p>
  <p>His hat was battered, his coat was green,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toes of his boots were through,<br>
    But the pride was his! It was I felt mean&mdash;<br>
    I wished that my collar was not so clean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the clothes I wore so new.</p>
  <p>He saw me first, and he knew &rsquo;twas I&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holiday swell he met.<br>
    Why have we no faith in each other? Ah, why?&mdash;<br>
    He made as though he would pass me by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he thought that I might forget.</p>
  <p>He ought to have known me better than that,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tracks we tramped far out&mdash;<br>
    The sweltering scrub and the blazing flat,<br>
    When the heat came down through each old felt hat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hell-born western drought.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p>He took my hand in a distant way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I thought how we parted last),<br>
    And we seemed like men who have nought to say<br>
    And who meet&mdash;&ldquo;Good-day&rdquo;, and who part&mdash;&ldquo;Good-day&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who never have shared the past.</p>
  <p>I asked him in for a drink with me&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Ellis&mdash;my old mate, Jack&mdash;<br>
    But his manner no longer was careless and free,<br>
    He followed, but not with the grin that he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wore always in days Out Back.</p>
  <p>I tried to live in the past once more&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the present and past combine,<br>
    But the days between I could not ignore&mdash;<br>
    I couldn&rsquo;t help notice the clothes he wore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he couldn&rsquo;t but notice mine.</p>
  <p>He placed his glass on the polished bar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he wouldn&rsquo;t fill up again;<br>
    For he is prouder than most men are&mdash;<br>
    Jack Ellis and I have tramped too far<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On different tracks since then.</p>
  <p>He said that he had a mate to meet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you again,&rdquo; said he,<br>
    Then he hurried away through the crowded street<br>
    And the rattle of buses and scrape of feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed suddenly loud to me.</p>
  <p><i>1895</i></p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sweeney"></a>Sweeney</b></h2>
  <p>It was&nbsp;somewhere in September, and the sun was going down,<br>
    When I came, in search of copy, to a Darling-River town;<br>
  &ldquo;Come-and-have-a-drink&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll call it&mdash;&rsquo;tis a
  fitting name, I think&mdash;<br>
    And &rsquo;twas raining, for a wonder, up at Come-and-have-a-drink.</p>
  <p>Underneath the pub  verandah I was resting on a bunk<br>
    When a stranger rose before me, and he said that he was drunk;<br>
    He apologised for speaking; there was no offence, he swore;<br>
    But he somehow seemed to fancy that he&rsquo;d seen my face before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No erfence,&rsquo; he said. I told him that he needn&rsquo;t mention
    it,<br>
    For I might have met him somewhere; I had travelled round a bit,<br>
    And I knew a lot of fellows in the Bush and in the streets&mdash;<br>
    But a fellow can&rsquo;t remember all the fellows that he meets.</p>
  <p>Very old and thin and dirty were the garments that he wore,<br>
    Just a shirt and pair of trousers, and a boot, and nothing more;<br>
    He was wringing-wet, and really in a sad and sinful plight,<br>
    And his hat was in his left hand, and a bottle in his right.</p>
  <p>He agreed: &ldquo;Yer can&rsquo;t remember all the chaps yer chance to meet,&rdquo;<br>
    And he said his name was Sweeney&mdash;people lived in Sussex-street.<br>
    He was campin&rsquo; in a stable, but he swore that he was right,<br>
  &ldquo;Only for the blanky horses walkin&rsquo; over him all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d apparently been fighting, for his face was black-and-blue,<br>
    And he looked as though the horses had been treading on him, too;<br>
    But an honest, genial twinkle in the eye that wasn&rsquo;t hurt<br>
    Seemed to hint of something better, spite of drink and rags and dirt.</p>
  <p>It appeared that he mistook me for a long-lost mate of his&mdash;<br>
    One of whom I was the image, both in figure and in phiz&mdash;<br>
    (He&rsquo;d have had a letter from him if the chap were living still,<br>
    For they&rsquo;d carried swags together from the Gulf to Broken Hill.)</p>
  <p>Sweeney yarned awhile and hinted that his folks were doing well,<br>
    And he told me that his father kept the Southern Cross Hotel;<br>
    And I wondered if his absence was regarded as a loss<br>
    When he left the elder Sweeney&mdash;landlord of the Southern Cross.</p>
  <p>He was born in Parramatta, and he said, with humour grim,<br>
    That he&rsquo;d like to see the city ere the liquor finished him,<br>
    But he couldn&rsquo;t raise the money. He was damned if he could think<br>
    What the Government was doing. Here he offered me a drink.</p>
  <p>I declined&mdash;<i>&rsquo;twas</i>&nbsp;self-denial&mdash;and I lectured
    him on booze,<br>
    Using all the hackneyed arguments that preachers mostly use;<br>
    Things I&rsquo;d heard in temperance lectures (I was young and rather green),<br>
    And I ended by referring to the man he might have been.</p>
  <p>Then a wise expression struggled with the bruises on his face,<br>
    Though his argument had scarcely any bearing on the case:<br>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; sober? Fellers rise and
  fellers fall;<br>
    What I might have been and wasn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t trouble me at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he couldn&rsquo;t stay to argue, for his beer was nearly gone.<br>
    He was glad, he said, to meet me, and he&rsquo;d see me later on;<br>
    He guessed he&rsquo;d have to go and get his bottle filled again,<br>
    And he gave a lurch and vanished in the darkness and the rain.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>And of afternoons in cities, when the rain is on the land,<br>
    Visions come to me of Sweeney with his bottle in his hand,<br>
    With the stormy night behind him, and the pub verandah-post&mdash;<br>
    And I wonder why he haunts me more than any other ghost.</p>
  <p>I suppose he&rsquo;s tramping somewhere where the bushmen carry swags,<br>
    Dragging round the western stations with his empty tucker-bags;<br>
    And I fancy that, of evenings, when the track is growing dim,<br>
    What he &ldquo;might have been and wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo; comes along and troubles
    him.</p>

  <p>Above&nbsp;the ashes straight and tall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through ferns with moisture dripping,<br>
    I climb beneath the sandstone wall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My feet on mosses slipping.</p>
  <p>Like ramparts round the valley&rsquo;s edge<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tinted cliffs are standing,<br>
    With many a broken wall and ledge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a rocky landing.</p>
  <p>And round about their rugged feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep ferny dells are hidden<br>
    In shadowed depths, whence dust and heat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are banished and forbidden.</p>
  <p>The stream that, crooning to itself,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes down a tireless rover,<br>
    Flows calmly to the rocky shelf,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there leaps bravely over.</p>
  <p>Now pouring down, now lost in spray<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mountain breezes sally,<br>
    The water strikes the rock midway,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaps into the valley.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Now in the west the colours change,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue with crimson blending;<br>
    Behind the far Dividing Range,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is fast descending.</p>
  <p>And mellowed day comes o&rsquo;er the place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And softens ragged edges;<br>
    The rising moon&rsquo;s great placid face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks gravely o&rsquo;er the ledges.</p>

    And the Warder says, in a softened tone: &ldquo;Catch step, One-Hundred-and-Three.&rdquo;</p>

    But One-Hundred-and-Three, he catches step with a start, a shuffle and jerk.<br>

    Twenty-three hours of the twenty-four, to brood on his virtues there.<br>

    On eyes that had followed the distant haze out there on the Level Lands.</p>
  <p>Bread and water and hominy, and a scrag of meat and a spud,<br>
    A Bible and thin flat Book of Rules, to cool a strong man&rsquo;s blood;<br>

  <p>Though every creed hath its Certain Hope, yet here, in hopless doubt,<br>
    Despairing prisoners faint in church, and the warders carry them out.<br>
There are swift-made signs that are not to God as they march us hellward then;<br>
It is hard to believe that we knelt as boys to &ldquo;For ever and ever, Amen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rules, regulations&mdash;red-tape and rules; all and alike they bind:<br>

    say.</p>
  <p>They lay their fingers on well-hosed walls, and they tread on the polished
    floor;<br>

    is done;<br>

    Years Hard.<br>
    They send a half-starved man to the Court, where the hearts of men they carve&mdash;<br>

    You get the gaol-whine in your voice and in every letter you write.<br>
    And in your eyes comes the bright gaol-light&mdash;not the glare of the world&rsquo;s
    distraught,<br>
    Not the hunted look, nor the guilty look, but the awful look of the Caught.</p>
<p>The brute is a brute, and a kind man kind, and the strong heart does not
    fail&mdash;<br>
    A crawler&rsquo;s a crawler everywhere, but a man is a man in gaol;<br>
    For the kindness of man to man is great when penned in a sandstone pen&mdash;<br>

  <p>We crave for sunlight, we crave for meat, we crave for the Might-have Been,<br>

    It comes like tobacco in prison, or like news to the separate cell.

    And drunkards in judgment on drunkards sit, (Keep step, One-Hundred-and-Three!)</p>
  <p>The clever scoundrels are all outside, and the moneyless mugs in gaol&mdash;<br>
    Men do twelve months for a mad wife&rsquo;s lies or Life for a strumpet&rsquo;s
    tale.<br>
    If the people knew what the warders know, and felt as the prisoners feel&mdash;<br>
    If the people knew, they would storm their gaols as they stormed the old
    Bastile.</p>
  <p>Warders and prisoners all alike in a dead rot, dry and slow&mdash;<br>
    The author must not write for his own, and the tailor must not sew.<br>
    The billet-bound officers dare not speak and discharged men dare not tell,<br>
    Though many and many an innocent man must brood in this barren hell.</p>
  <p>Ay! clang the spoon on the iron floor, and shove in the bread with your
    toe,<br>
    And shut with a bang the iron door, and clank the bolt&mdash;just so;<br>

    And nothing is heard, save a whispered word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roar of the shearing-shed.</p>
  <p>The tall, shy rouser has lost his wits,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his limbs are all astray;<br>
    He leaves a fleece on the shearing-board,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his broom in the shearer&rsquo;s way.<br>
    There&rsquo;s a curse in store for that jackaroo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down by the wall he slants&mdash;<br>
    And the ringer bends with his legs askew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wishes he&rsquo;d &ldquo;patched them pants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They are girls from the city. (Our hearts rebel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we squint at their dainty feet.)<br>
    And they gush and say in a girly way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That &ldquo;the dear little lambs&rdquo; are &ldquo;sweet.&rdquo;<br>
    And Bill, the ringer, who&rsquo;d scorn the use<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a childish word like &ldquo;damn,&rdquo;<br>
    Would give a pound that his tongue were loose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he tackles a lively lamb.</p>
  <p>Swift thoughts of homes in the coastal towns&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rivers and waving grass&mdash;<br>
    And a weight on our hearts that we cannot define<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes as the ladies pass;<br>
    But the rouser ventures a nervous dig<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his thumb in the next man&rsquo;s back;<br>
    And Bogan says to his pen-mate: &ldquo;Twig<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the last un, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Moonlight gives her a careless glance&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he catches his breath with pain&mdash;<br>
    His strong hand shakes and the sunlights dance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he bends to his work again.<br>
    But he&rsquo;s well disguised in a bristling beard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronzed skin, and his shearer&rsquo;s dress;<br>
    And whatever he knew or hoped or feared<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were hard for his mates to guess.</p>
  <p>Jack Moonlight, wiping his broad, white brow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explains, with a doleful smile:<br>
  &ldquo;A stitch in the side,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he leans on the beam awhile,<br>
    And gazes out in the blazing noon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the clearing, brown and bare . . . . <br>
    She has come and gone, like a breath of June,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&rsquo;s heat and glare.</p>

  <p>An hour before the sun goes down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the ragged boughs,<br>
    I go across the little run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring the dusty cows;<br>
    And once I used to sit and rest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the fading dome,<br>
    For there was one that I loved best<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d bring the cattle home.</p>
  <p>Our yard is fixed with double bails,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round one the grass is green,<br>
    The Bush is growing through the rails,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spike is rusted in;<br>
    It was  from there his freckled face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would turn and smile at me&mdash;<br>
    He&rsquo;d milk seven in the race<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was milking three.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2001121h-images/page056.jpg" width="609" height="750"></p>
  <p>He kissed me twice and once again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rode across the hill,<br>
    The pint-pots and the hobble-chain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear them jingling still . . . <br>
  About the hut the sunlight fails,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fire shines through the cracks&mdash;<br>
I climb the broken stockyard rails<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch the bridle-tracks.</p>
  <p>And he is coming back again&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote from Evatt&rsquo;s Rock; <br>
    A flood was in the Darling then<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And foot-rot in the flock. <br>
  The sheep were falling thick and fast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred miles from town,<br>
And when he reached the line at last<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trucked the remnant down.</p>
  <p>And so he&rsquo;ll have to stand the cost;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His luck was always bad,<br>
    Instead of making more, he lost<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money that he had;<br>
    And how he&rsquo;ll manage, heaven knows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(My eyes are getting dim),<br>
    He says&mdash;he says&mdash;he don&rsquo;t&mdash;suppose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll want&mdash;to&mdash;marry&mdash;him.</p>
  <p>As if I wouldn&rsquo;t take his hand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Without a golden glove&mdash;<br>
    Oh! Jack, you men won&rsquo;t understand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much a girl can love.<br>
    I long to see his face once more&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack&rsquo;s dog! thank God, it&rsquo;s Jack!&mdash;<br>
    (I never thought I&rsquo;d faint before)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s coming&mdash;up&mdash;the track.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MyLiteraryFriend"></a>My Literary Friend</b></h2>
  <p>Once&nbsp;I wrote a little poem which I thought was very fine,<br>
    And I showed the printer&rsquo;s copy to a critic friend of mine,<br>
    First he praised the thing a little, then he found a little fault;<br>
  &ldquo;The ideas are good,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but the rhythm seems
  to halt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So I straighten&rsquo;d up the rhythm where he marked it with his pen,<br>
    And I copied it and showed it to my clever friend again.<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve improved the metre greatly, but the rhymes are bad,&rdquo; he
  said,<br>
    As he read it slowly, scratching surplus wisdom from his head.</p>
<p>So I worked as he suggested (I believe in taking time),<br>
    And I burnt the midnight taper while I straightened up the
    rhyme.<br>
  &ldquo;It is better now,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;you go on and you&rsquo;ll
  succeed,<br>
  It has got a ring about it&mdash;the ideas are what you need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So I worked for hours upon it (I go on when I commence),<br>
    And I kept in view the rhythm and the jingle and the sense,<br>
    And I copied it and took it to my solemn friend once more&mdash;<br>
    It reminded him of something he had somewhere read before.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Now the people say I&rsquo;d never put such horrors into print<br>
    If I wasn&rsquo;t too conceited to accept a friendly hint,<br>
    And my dearest friends are certain that I&rsquo;d profit in the end<br>
    If I&rsquo;d always show my copy to a literary friend.</p>

    Some flee a squalid home to work their own salvation out.<br>
    Some dared not see a mother&rsquo;s tears nor meet a father&rsquo;s face&mdash;<br>
    Born of good Christian families some leap, head-long, from Grace.</p>
  <p>Oh we are men who fought and rose, or fell from many grades;<br>
    Some born to lie, and some to pray, we&rsquo;re men of many trades;<br>
    We&rsquo;re men whose fathers were and are of high and low degree&mdash;<br>
    The sea was open to us, and we sailed across the sea.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;re haunted by the Past at times&mdash;and this is very bad, <br>
    Because we drink till horrors come, lest, sober, we go mad. <br>
    We judge not and we are not judged&mdash;&rsquo;tis our philosophy;<br>
There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that sails upon the sea.</p>
  <p>From shearing shed to shearing shed we tramp to make a cheque&mdash;<br>
    Jack Cornstalk and the Ne&rsquo;er-do-well&mdash;the Tar-boy and the Wreck.<br>
    We know the tucker tracks that feed&mdash;or leave one in the lurch&mdash;<br>
The &ldquo;Burgoo&rdquo; (Presbyterian) track&mdash;the &ldquo;Murphy&rdquo; (Roman
Church).</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve humped my swag to Bawley Plain, and further out and on;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve boiled my billy by the Gulf, and boiled it by the Swan;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve thirsted in dry lignum swamps, and thirsted on the sand,<br>
    And eked the fire with camel dung in Never-Never Land.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tramped, and camped, and &ldquo;shore&rdquo; and drunk with many
    mates Out Back&mdash;<br>
    And every one to me is Jack because the first was Jack&mdash; <br>
    A lifer sneaked from gaol at home&mdash;the straightest mate

A ratty Russian Nihilist&mdash;a British Baronet!</p>

  By camp-fires I have learned, or, say, unlearned it all again.</p>
  <p>We hold him true who&rsquo;s true to one however false he be<br>
    (There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that lies beside the quay);<br>
    We lend and borrow, laugh and joke, and when the past is drowned,<br>

    A scribbler of stories, a maker of songs,<br>
    To the fireside and armchair my valour belongs.<br>
  <i>Yet in hopeless campaigns and in bitterest strife<br>
    I have been at the Front all the days of my life.</i></p>

  <p>He shall live to the end of this mad, old world, he has lived since the
    world began,<br>
    He never has done any good for himself, but was good to every man.<br>
    He never has done any good for himself, and I&rsquo;m sure that he never
    will;<br>
    He drinks and he swears, and he fights at times, and his name is mostly Bill.</p>
  <p>He carried a freezing mate to his cave, and nursed him, for all I know,<br>
    When Europe was mostly a sheet of ice, thousands of years ago.<br>
    He has stuck to many a mate since then, he is with us everywhere still<br>
    (He loves and gambles when he is young, and the girls stick up for Bill).</p>
  <p>He has rowed to a wreck, when the life-boat failed, with Jim in a crazy
    boat;<br>
    He has given his lifebelt many a time, and sunk that another might float.<br>
    He has &ldquo;stood &rsquo;em off&rdquo; while others escaped, when the niggers
    rushed from the hill.<br>
    And rescue parties who came too late have found what was left of Bill. </p>
  <p>He has thirsted on deserts that others might drink, he has given lest others
    should lack.<br>
    He has staggered half-blinded through fire or drought with a sick man on
    his back.<br>
    He is first to the rescue in tunnel or shaft, from Bulli to Broken Hill,<br>
    When the water breaks in or the fire breaks out, a leader of men is Bill!</p>
  <p>He wears no Humane Society&rsquo;s badge for the fearful deaths he braved;<br>
    He seems ashamed of the good he did, and ashamed of the lives he saved.<br>
    If you chance to know of a noble deed he has done, you had best keep still;<br>
    If you chance to know of a kindly act, you mustn&rsquo;t let on to Bill.</p>
  <p>He is fierce at a wrong, he is firm in right, he is kind to the weak and
    mild;<br>
    He will slave all day and sit up all night by the side of a neighbour&rsquo;s
    child.<br>
    For a woman in trouble he&rsquo;d lay down his life, nor think as another
    man will;<br>
    He&rsquo;s a man all through, and no other man's wife has ever been worse
    for Bill.</p>
  <p>He is good for the noblest sacrifice, he can do what few men can;<br>
    He will break his heart that the girl he loves may marry a better man.<br>
    There&rsquo;s many a mother and wife to-night whose heart and eyes will fill<br>
    When she thinks of the days of the long-ago when she well might have stuck
    to Bill. </p>
  <p>Maybe he&rsquo;s in trouble or hard up now, and travelling far for work,<br>
    Or fighting a dead past down to-night in a lone camp west of Bourke.<br>
    When he&rsquo;s happy and flush, take your sorrow to him and borrow as much
    as you will;<br>
    But when he&rsquo;s in trouble or stony-broke, you never will hear from Bill.</p>
  <p>And when, because of its million sins, this earth is cracked like a shell,<br>
    He will stand by a mate at the Judgment-Seat!&mdash;and comfort him down
    in&mdash;Well,<br>
    I haven&rsquo;t much sentiment left to waste, but let cynics sneer as they
    will,<br>
    Perhaps God will fix up the world again for the sake of the likes of Bill.</p>

    You may be a man of sorrow, and on speaking terms with Care,<br>
    But as yet you&rsquo;re unacquainted with the Demon of Despair;<br>
    For I rather think that nothing heaps the trouble on your mind<br>
    Like the knowledge that your trousers badly need a patch behind.</p>
  <p>I have noticed when misfortune strikes the hero of the play<br>
    That his clothes are worn and tattered in a most unlikely way;<br>
    And the gods applaud and cheer him while he whines and loafs around,<br>
    But they never seem to notice that his pants are mostly sound;<br>
    Yet, of course, he cannot help it, for our mirth would mock his care<br>
    If the ceiling of his trousers showed the patches of repair.</p>
  <p>You are none the less a hero if you elevate your chin<br>
    When you feel the pavement wearing through the leather, sock and skin;<br>
    You are rather more heroic than are ordinary folk<br>
    If you scorn to fish for pity under cover of a joke;<br>

    Some will say that for your troubles you can only thank yourself;<br>
    Some will swear you&rsquo;ll die a beggar, but you only laugh at that<br>
    While your garments hang together and you wear a decent hat;<br>
    You may laugh at their predictions while your soles are wearing through&mdash;<br>
    But a man&rsquo;s an awful coward when his pants are going too!</p>
  <p>Though the present and the future may be anything but bright,<br>
    It is best to tell the fellows that you're getting on all right.<br>
    And a man prefers to say it&mdash;&rsquo;tis a manly lie to tell,<br>
    For the folks may be persuaded that you&rsquo;re doing very well;<br>
    But it&rsquo;s hard to be a hero, and it&rsquo;s hard to wear a grin,<br>
    When your most important garment is in places very thin.</p>
  <p>Get some sympathy and comfort from the chum who knows you best,<br>
    Then your sorrows won&rsquo;t run over in the presence of the rest;<br>
    There&rsquo;s a chum that you can go to when you feel inclined to whine,<br>
    He&rsquo;ll declare your coat is tidy, and he&rsquo;ll say: &ldquo;Just look
    at mine!&rdquo;<br>
    Though you may be patched all over he will say it doesn&rsquo;t show,<br>
    And he&rsquo;ll swear it can&rsquo;t be noticed when your pants begin to
    go.</p>
  <p>Brother mine, and of misfortune! times are hard, but do not fret,<br>
    Keep your courage up and struggle, and we&rsquo;ll laugh at these things
    yet.<br>
    Though there is no corn in Egypt, surely Africa has some&mdash;<br>
    Keep your smile in working order for the better days to come!<br>
    We shall often laugh together at the hard times that we know,<br>
    And get measured by the tailor when our pants begin to go.</p>

    No matter who fell, it were better to fight as they did when the world was

    There was room in the long, free lines of the van to fight for it side by
    side&mdash;<br>
    There was beating-room for the heart of a man in the days when the world
    was wide.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>With its dull, brown days of a-shilling-an-hour the dreary year drags round:<br>

    Outward Bound?<br>
    Is this the sequel of Westward Ho!&mdash;of the days of Whate&rsquo;er Betide?<br>
    The heart of the rebel makes answer &ldquo;No! We&rsquo;ll fight till the
    world grows wide!&rdquo;</p>

    East and North shall the wrongs be hurled that followed us South and West.<br>

  <p>A son of elder sons am I<br>
    Whose boyhood days were cramped and scant;<br>
    Who lived the old domestic lie<br>
    And breathed the old familiar cant.<br>
    Come, elder brothers mine, and bring<br>
    Dull loads of care that you have won,<br>
    And gather round me while I sing<br>
    The ballad of the elder son.</p>
  <p>The elder son on barren soil,<br>
    Where life is crude and lands are new,<br>
    Must share the father&rsquo;s hardest toil,<br>
    And see the father&rsquo;s troubles through.<br>
    With no child-thoughts to match his own,<br>
    No game to play, no race to run,<br>
    The youth his father might have known<br>
    Is seldom for the elder son.</p>
  <p align="center">* * *&nbsp; * * * * *</p>
  <p>A certain squatter had two sons<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up Canaan way some years ago.<br>
    The graft was hard on those old runs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was hot and life was slow.<br>
    The younger brother coolly claimed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portion that he hadn&rsquo;t earned,<br>
    And sought the &ldquo;life&rdquo; for which untamed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And high young spirits always yearned.</p>
  <p>A year or so he knocked about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spent his cheques on girls and wine,<br>
    And, getting stony in the drought,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a job at herding swine;<br>
    And though he was a hog to swig,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fool with girls till all was blue&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas rather rough to mind the pig<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have to eat its tucker too.</p>
  <p>But coming to himself, he said&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reckoned shrewdly, though dead beat&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;The rousers in my father&rsquo;s shed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have got more grub than they can eat;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve been a fool, but such is fate&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I&rsquo;ll talk the guv&rsquo;nor round:<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve acted cronk,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell him straight;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He&rsquo;s had his time, too, I&rsquo;ll be bound).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him straight I&rsquo;ve had my fling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell him &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been on the beer,<br>
    But put me on at anything,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll graft with any bounder here.&rsquo; &rdquo;<br>
    He rolled his swag and struck for home.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(By this time he was pretty slim),<br>
    And, when the old man saw him come&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you know how he welcomed him.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;ve brought the best robe in the house,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring, and killed the fatted calf,<br>
    And now they hold a grand carouse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eat and drink and dance and laugh:<br>
    And from the field the elder son&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose character is not admired&mdash;<br>
    Comes plodding home when work is done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely hot and very tired. </p>
  <p>He asked the meaning of the sound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such unwonted revelry,<br>
    They said his brother had been &ldquo;found&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He&rsquo;d found himself, it seems to me);<br>
  &rsquo;Twas natural the elder son<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should take the thing a little hard<br>
    And brood on what was past and done<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While standing, pensive, in the yard.</p>
  <p>Now, he was hungry and knocked out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would, if they had let him be,<br>
    Have rested and cooled down, no doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hugged his brother after tea<br>
    And welcomed him, and hugged his dad.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the wine-cup to the brim&mdash;<br>
    But, just when he was feeling bad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man came and tackled him.</p>
  <p>He well might say with bitter tears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While music swelled and flowed the wine&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Lo, I have served thee many years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor caused thee one grey hair of thine.<br>
    Whate&rsquo;er thou bad&rsquo;st me do I did<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for my brother made amends;<br>
    Thou never gavest me a kid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For merry-making with my friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>(He was no heavy clod and glum<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could not trespass, sing or dance&mdash;<br>
    He could be merry with a chum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed, if he had half a chance;<br>
    Perhaps, if further light we seek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew&mdash;and herein lay the sting&mdash;<br>
    His brother would clear out next week<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And promptly pop the robe and ring.) </p>
  <p>The father said, &ldquo;The wandering one,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lost is found, this son of mine,<br>
    But thou art always with me, son&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou knowest all I have is thine.&rdquo;<br>
    (It seemed the best robe and the ring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love and fatted calf were not;<br>
    But this was just a little thing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in his joy forgot.)</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Oh! if I had the power to teach&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength for which my spirit craves&mdash;<br>
    The cant of parents I would preach<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slave and make their children slaves.<br>
    For greed of gain, and that alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their youth they steal, their hearts they break;<br>
    And then the wretched misers moan&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We did it for our children&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And all I have&rdquo;&mdash;the paltry bribe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might slave contented yet.<br>
    While envied by his selfish tribe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birthright he might never get:<br>
    The worked-out farm and endless graft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortgaged home, the barren run&mdash;<br>
    The heavy, hopeless overdraft&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portion of the elder son.</p>
  <p>He keeps his parents when they&rsquo;re old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps a sister in distress,<br>
    His wife must work and care for them<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bear with all their pettishness.<br>
    The mother&rsquo;s moan is ever heard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, whining for the worthless one,<br>
    She seldom has a kindly word<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say about her eldest son.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis he, in spite of sneer and jibe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stands the friend when others fail:<br>
    He bears the burdens of his tribe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keeps his brother out of jail.<br>
    He lends the quid and pays the fine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the family pride he smarts&mdash;<br>
    For reasons I can not divine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hate him in their heart of hearts.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the Eldest takes the track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things at home have got too bad&mdash;<br>
    He comes not crawling, canting back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek the blind side of his dad.<br>
    He always finds a knife and fork<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meat between on which to dine,<br>
    And, though he sometimes deals in pork,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never eats his meals with swine.</p>
  <p>The happy home, the overdraft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His birthright and his prospects gay,<br>
    And likewise his share of the graft.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaves the rest to grab. And they&mdash;<br>
    Who&rsquo;d always do the thing by halves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything for him was done&mdash;<br>
    Should kill a score of fatted calves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome home the eldest son.</p>

  <p>The old year went, and the new returned, in the withering weeks of drought.<br>
    The cheque was spent that the shearer earned, and the sheds were all cut
      out;<br>
    The publican&rsquo;s words were short and few, and the publican's looks were
    black&mdash;<br>
    And the time had come, as the shearer knew, to carry his swag Out Back.</p>
  <p><i>For time means tucker, and tramp you must, where the scrubs and plains
      are wide,<br>
    With seldom a track that a man can trust, or a mountain peak to guide;<br>
    All day long in the dust and heat&mdash;when summer is on the track&mdash;<br>
    With stinted stomachs and blistered feet, they carry their swags Out Back.</i></p>
  <p>He tramped away from the shanty there, when the days were long and hot.<br>
    With never a soul to know or care if he died on the track or not.<br>
    The poor of the city have friends in woe, no matter how much they lack,<br>
    But only God and the swagmen know how a poor man fares Out Back.</p>
  <p>He begged his way on the parched Paroo and the Warrego tracks once more,<br>
    And lived like a dog, as the swagmen do, till the Western stations shore:<br>
    But men were many, and sheds were full, for work in the town was slack&mdash;<br>
    The traveller never got hands in wool, though he tramped for a year Out Back.</p>
  <p>In stifling noons when his back was wrung by its load, and the air seemed
    dead,<br>
    And the water warmed in the bag that hung to his aching arm like lead.<br>
    Or in times of flood, when plains were seas, and the scrubs were cold and
    black,<br>
    He ploughed in mud to his trembling knees, and paid for his sins Out Back.</p>
  <p>He blamed himself in the year &ldquo;Too Late,&rdquo; for the wreck of his
    strong young life,<br>
    And no one knew but a shearing mate &rsquo;twas the fault of his faithless
    wife.<br>
    When the wrongs of your kindred bid you roam, and treacherous tongues attack,<br>

  <p>And dirty and careless and old he wore, as his lamp of hope grew dim;<br>
    He tramped for years till the swag he bore seemed part of himself to him.<br>
    As a bullock drags in the sandy ruts, he followed the dreary track,<br>
    With never a thought but to reach the huts when the sun went down Out Back.</p>
  <p>It chanced one day when the north wind blew in his face like a furnace-breath,<br>
    He left the track for a tank he knew&mdash;&rsquo;twas a shorter cut to death;<br>
    For the bed of the tank was hard and dry, and crossed with many a crack,<br>
    And. oh! it&rsquo;s a terrible thing to die of thirst in the scrub Out Back.</p>
  <p>A drover came, but the fringe of law was eastward many a mile;<br>
    He never reported the thing he saw, for it was not worth his while.<br>
    The tanks are full, and the grass is high in the mulga off the track,<br>
    Where the bleaching bones of a white man lie by his mouldering swag Out Back.</p>
  <p><i>For time means tucker, and tramp they must, where the plains and scrubs

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends forth its tribute flood&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In charge of stock again.</p>
  <p>The faithful dog a moment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies panting on the bank,<br>
    Then plunges through the current<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where his master sank.<br>
    And round and round in circles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fights with failing strength,<br>
    Till, gripped by wilder waters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fails and sinks at length.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slopes of sodden loam<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take dumb tidings home;<br>

  <p>Rest, for your eyes are weary, girl&mdash;you have driven the worst away&mdash;<br>
    The ghost of the man that I might have been is gone from my heart to-day;<br>
    We&rsquo;ll live for life and the best it brings till our twilight shadows
    fall;<br>
    My heart grows brave, and the world, my girl, is a good world after all.</p>

  <p>A day of seeming innocence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glorious sun and sky,<br>
    And, just above my picket fence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Bonnet passing by.<br>
    In knitted gloves and quaint old dress,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a spot or smirch,<br>
    Her worn face lit with peacefulness,<br>

  <p>Her hair is richly white, like milk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That long ago was fair&mdash;<br>

  <p>The parasol of days gone by&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old days that seemed the best&mdash;<br>
    The hymn and prayer books carried high<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against her warm, thin breast;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come hardship, aye, and worse&mdash;<br>
    On market days, through faded years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender household purse. </p>

    And in the chapel, sweet and low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As girls her daughters sung.<br>
    And when in church she bends her head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But not as others do)<br>
    She sees her loved ones, and her dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hears their voices too.</p>
  <p>Fair as the Saxons in her youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not forward, and not shy;<br>
    And strong in healthy life and truth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As after years went by; <br>
    She often laughed with sinners vain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet passed from faith to sight&mdash;<br>
    God gave her beauty back again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more her hair grew white.</p>
  <p>She came out in the Early Days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Green seas, and blue&mdash;and grey) &mdash;<br>
    The village fair, and English ways,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed worlds and worlds away.<br>
    She fought the haunting loneliness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where brooding gum trees stood;<br>
    And won through sickness and distress<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Englishwomen could.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black blots against the green.<br>
    The dull, suburban people meet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buzz in little groups,<br>
    While down the white steps to the street<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quaint old figure stoops.</p>
  <p>And then along my picket fence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where staring wallflowers grow&mdash;<br>
    World-wise Old Age, and Common-sense!&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Bonnet, nodding slow.<br>
    But not alone; for on each side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little dot attends<br>
    In snowy frock and sash of pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these are Granny&rsquo;s friends. </p>
  <p>To them her mind is clear and bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her old ideas are new;<br>
    They know her &ldquo;real talk&rdquo; is right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her &ldquo;fairy talk&rdquo; is true.<br>
    And they converse as grown-ups may,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the news is told;<br>
    The one so wisely young to-day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two so wisely old.</p>
  <p>At home, with dinner waiting there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smooths her hair and face,<br>
    And puts her bonnet by with care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dons a cap of lace.<br>
    The table minds its p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest one perchance be hit<br>
    By some rare dart which is a part<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her old-fashioned wit.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the youngsters gone.<br>
    There&rsquo;s scarce a sound of dish on dish<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cup slipped into cup,<br>
    When left alone, as is her wish,<br>

    My army, O my army! The signs are manifold!</p>
  <p>My army, O my army! My army and my Queen!<br>
    I sang your Southern battle-songs when I was seventeen!<br>
    They echoed down the Ages, they came from far and near;<br>
    They came to me from Paris, they came to me from Here!&mdash;<br>
    They came while I was marching with the Army of the Rear.</p>
  <p>My Queen&rsquo;s dark eyes were flashing (oh, she was younger then!)<br>

  <p>My army kept no order, my army kept no time;<br>
    My army dug no trenches, yet died in dust and slime;<br>
    Its troops were fiercely ignorant, as to the manner born;<br>
    Its clothes were rags and tatters&mdash;patched rags, the patches torn&mdash;<br>
    Ah, me! It wore a uniform that I have often worn.</p>
  <p>The faces of my army were ghastly as the dead;<br>
    My army&rsquo;s cause was Hunger, my army&rsquo;s cry was &ldquo;Bread!&rdquo;<br>
    It called on God and Mary and Christ of Nazareth;<br>
    It cried to kings and courtesans that fainted at its breath&mdash;<br>
    Its women beat their poor, flat breasts where babes had starved to death.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>

  <p>Jack Denver died on Talbragar when Christmas Eve began,<br>
    And there was sorrow round the place, for Denver was a man;<br>
    Jack Denver&rsquo;s wife bowed down her head&mdash;her daughter&rsquo;s grief
    was wild,<br>
    And big Ben Duggan by the bed stood sobbing like a child.<br>
    But big Ben Duggan saddled up, and galloped fast and far,<br>
    To raise the biggest funeral yet seen on Talbragar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
  station home<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  shearing shed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben
  Duggan cried, &ldquo;Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll
  up at Talbragar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He borrowed horses here and there, and rode all Christmas Eve,<br>
    And scarcely paused a moment&rsquo;s time the mournful news to leave;<br>
    He rode by lonely huts and farms until the day was done,<br>
    And then he turned his horse&rsquo;s head and made for Ross&rsquo;s Run.<br>
    No bushman in a single day had ridden half so far<br>
    Since Johnson brought the doctor to his wife at Talbragar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
  diggers&rsquo; camps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll
  up at Talbragar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That night he passed the humpies of the splitters on the ridge,<br>
    And roused the bullock-drivers camped at Belinfante&rsquo;s Bridge;<br>
    And as he climbed the ridge again the moon shone on the rise&mdash;<br>
    Did moonbeams glisten in the mist of tears that filled his eyes?<br>
    He dashed the rebel drops away&mdash;for blinding things they are&mdash;<br>
    But &rsquo;twas his best and truest friend who died on Talbragar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At

  <p align="center"><img src="2001121h-images/page096.png" width="609" height="750"></p>
  <p>At all the shanties round the place they heard his horse&rsquo;s tramp,<br>
    He took the track to Wilson&rsquo;s Luck, and told the diggers&rsquo; camp;<br>
    But in the gorge by Deadman&rsquo;s Gap the mountain shades were black,<br>
    And there a newly-fallen tree was lying on the track&mdash;<br>
    He saw too late, and then he heard the swift hoof&rsquo;s sudden jar,<br>
    And big Ben Duggan ne&rsquo;er again rode home to Talbragar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
  wretch is drunk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  Denver&rsquo;s dead&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
  burning shame!&rdquo; the people said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next
  day at Talbragar.</p>
  <p>For thirty miles round Talbragar the boys rolled up in strength,<br>
    And Denver had a funeral a good long mile in length;<br>
    Round Denver&rsquo;s grave that Christmas Day rough Bushmen&rsquo;s eyes
    were dim&mdash;<br>
    The Western Bushmen knew the way to bury dead like him;<br>
    But some returning homeward found, by light of moon and star,<br>
    Ben Duggan lying in the rocks, five miles from Talbragar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  far and wide<br>

    His mother&rsquo;s arms were about him; but the old man&rsquo;s back was

    The daughters begged for pardon till the old man raised his hand&mdash;<br>
    A Scot of the Riverina who was hard to understand.</p>
  <p>The boy was killed in Flanders, where the best and bravest die.<br>
    There were tears at the Grahame homestead and grief in Gundagai;<br>

  <p>The big rough boys from the runs out back were first where the balls flew
    free,<br>
    And yelled in the slang of the Outside Track: &ldquo;By God, it&rsquo;s a
    Christmas spree!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too dusty&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;Wool away!&mdash;stand
  clear o&rsquo; the blazin&rsquo; shoots!&rdquo;<br>

    And often the sight of a head cut off was hailed by a yell for &ldquo;Tar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>I heard the Push in the Red Redoubt, grown wild at a luckless shot:<br>
  &ldquo;Look out for the bloomin&rsquo; shell, look out!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Gorblimy,
  but that&rsquo;s red-hot!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bill the Slogger&mdash;poor bloke&mdash;he&rsquo;s done.
  A chunk of the shell was his;<br>
    I wish the beggar that fired that gun could get within reach of Liz.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Those foreign gunners will give us rats, but I wish it was Bill they&rsquo;d
  missed.<br>
    I&rsquo;d like to get at their bleedin&rsquo; hats with a rock in my (something)

    the belt.<br>
    If we get the waddle I&rsquo;ll swag you through, if the blazin&rsquo; mountains
    melt;<br>
    You remember the night I was held by the traps for stoushing a bleedin&rsquo; Chow,<br>
    And you went for &rsquo;em proper and laid out three, and I won&rsquo;t forget
    it now.&rdquo;<br>
    And, groaning and swearing, the pug replied: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done . . .
    . they&rsquo;ve knocked me out!<br>
    I&rsquo;d fight &rsquo;em all for a pound a side, from the boss to the rouseabout.<br>
    My nut is cracked and my legs is broke, and it gives me worse than hell;<br>
    I trained for a scrap with a twelve-stone bloke, and not with a bursting
    shell.<br>
    You needn&rsquo;t mag, for I knowed. old chum. I <i>knowed</i>, old pal,
    you&rsquo;d stick;<br>
    But you can&rsquo;t hold out till the boys come up. and you&rsquo;d best
    be nowhere quick.<br>
    They&rsquo;ve got a force and a gun ashore, and both of our wings is broke;<br>
    They&rsquo;ll storm the ridge in a minute more, and the best you can do is &lsquo;smoke.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
    And Jim exclaimed: &ldquo;You can smoke, you chaps, but me&mdash;Gor&rsquo; bli&rsquo; me,
    no!<br>
    The Push that ran from the George-street traps won&rsquo;t run from a foreign
    foe.<br>
    I&rsquo;ll stick to the gun while she makes them sick, and I&rsquo;ll stick
    to what&rsquo;s left of Bill.&rdquo;<br>
    And they hiss through their blackened teeth: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stick! by
    the blazin&rsquo;  flame, we will!&rdquo;<br>
    And long years after the war was past, they told in the town and bush<br>
    How the ridge of death to the bloody last was held by a Sydney push;<br>
    How they fought to the end in a sheet of flame, how they fought with their
    rifle-stocks.<br>
    And earned, in a nobler sense, the name of their ancient weapons &mdash;rocks.</p>

  &ldquo;If the enemy&rsquo;s forces take the coast, they must take the mountains,
  too;<br>
    They may force their way by the Western line or round by a northern track,<br>
    But they won&rsquo;t run short of a decent spree with the men who are left
    Out Back!&rdquo;<br>
    When we burst the enemy&rsquo;s ironclads and won by a run of luck,<br>
    We whooped as loudly as Nelson&rsquo;s lads when a French three-decker struck;<br>
    And when the enemy&rsquo;s troops prevailed the truth was never heard&mdash;<br>
    We lied like heroes, and never failed to explain how that occurred. </p>
  <p>You Bushmen sneer in the old bush way at the new-chum jackeroo,<br>
    But cuffs-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-collars were out that day, and they stuck to their
    posts like glue;<br>
    I never believed that a dude could fight till a Johnny led us then;<br>
    We buried his bits in the rear that night for the honour of Pitt-street men.<br>
    And Jim the Ringer&mdash;he fought, he did. The regiment nicknamed Jim<br>
  &ldquo;Old Heads-a-Caser&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heads-a-Quid.&rdquo; but it never
  was tails with him.<br>
    The way that he rode was a racing rhyme, and the way that he finished grand;<br>
    He backed the enemy every time, and died in a hand-to-hand!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll never forget when the Ringer and I were first in the Bush Brigade,<br>
    With Warrego Bill, from the Live-till-you-Die, in the last grand charge we
      made.<br>
    And Billy died&mdash; he was full of sand&mdash;he said, as I raised his
    head:<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full of love for my native land, but a lot too full of lead.<br>
    Tell &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Billy; &ldquo;and tell old Dad to look after
    the cattle pup&rdquo;;<br>
    But his eyes grew bright, though his voice was sad, and he said, as I held
    him up:<br>
  &ldquo;I have been happy on western farms. And once, when I first went wrong,<br>
    Around my neck were the trembling arms of the girl I&rsquo;d loved so long.</p>
  <p>Far out on the southern seas I&rsquo;ve sailed; I&rsquo;ve ridden where
    brumbies roam,<br>
    And often when all on the station failed I&rsquo;ve driven the outlaw home.<br>
    I&rsquo;ve spent a cheque in a day and night, and I&rsquo;ve made a cheque
    as quick;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve struck a nugget when times were tight and the stores had stopped
    our tick.<br>
    I&rsquo;ve led the field on the old bay mare, and I hear the cheering still,<br>
    When mother and sister and <i>she</i> were there, and the old man yelled
    for Bill;<br>
    But, save for <i>her</i>, could I live my time again in the old Bush way,<br>
    I&rsquo;d give it all for the last half-mile in the race we rode to-day!&rdquo;<br>
    And he passed away as the stars came out&mdash;he died as old heroes die&mdash;<br>
    I heard the sound of the distant rout, and the Southern Cross was high.</p>

    There were brighter days an&rsquo; better when he always travelled aft&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
  his rug an&rsquo; gladstone, aft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
  his cap an&rsquo; spyglass, aft&mdash;<br>
    A careless, rovin&rsquo;, gay young spark as always travelled aft.</p>
  <p>Therc&rsquo;s a notice by the gangway, an&rsquo; it seems to come amiss,<br>
    For it says that second-classers ain&rsquo;t allowed abaft o&rsquo; this;<br>
    An&rsquo; there ought to be a notice for the fellows from abaft&mdash;<br>
    But the smell an&rsquo; dirt&rsquo;s a warnin&rsquo; to the first-salooners,
    aft;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
  their tooth and nail-brush, aft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
  their cuffs an&rsquo; collars, aft&mdash;<br>
    Their cigars an&rsquo; books, an&rsquo; papers, an&rsquo; their cap-peaks
    fore-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-aft.</p>
  <p>I want to breathe the mornin&rsquo; breeze that blows against the boat,<br>
    For there&rsquo;s a swellin&rsquo; in my heart, a tightness in my throat.<br>
    We are for&rsquo;ard when there&rsquo;s trouble! We are for&rsquo;ard when
    there&rsquo;s graft!<br>
    But the men who never battle always seem to travel aft;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
  their dressin&rsquo;-cases, aft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
  their swell pyjamas, aft&mdash;<br>
    Yes! the idle and the careless, they have ease an&rsquo; comfort aft.</p>
  <p>I feel so low an&rsquo; wretched, as I mooch about the deck.<br>
    That I&rsquo;m ripe for jumpin&rsquo; over&mdash;an&rsquo; I wish there was
    a wreck!<br>
    We are driven to New Zealand to be shot out over there,<br>
    Scarce a shillin&rsquo; in our pockets, nor a decent rag to wear,<br>
    With the everlastin&rsquo; worry lest we don&rsquo;t get into graft&mdash;<br>
    Oh, there&rsquo;s little left to land for if you cannot travel aft.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
  anxiety abaft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
  have stuff to land with, aft&mdash;<br>
    There is little left to land for if you cannot travel aft.</p>
  <p>But it&rsquo;s grand at sea this mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; Creation almost
    speaks,<br>
    Sailin&rsquo; past the Bay of Islands with its pinnacles an&rsquo; peaks,<br>
    With the sunny haze all round us an&rsquo; the white-caps on the blue,<br>
    An&rsquo; the orphan rocks an&rsquo; breakers&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s glorious
    sailin&rsquo; through!<br>
    To the south a distant steamer, to the west a coastin&rsquo; craft,<br>
    An&rsquo; we see the beauty for&rsquo;ard&mdash;can they see it better aft?&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite
  of op&rsquo;ra-glasses, aft;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But,
  ah well, they&rsquo;re brothers aft&mdash;<br>
    Nature seems to draw us closer&mdash;bring us nearer fore-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-aft.</p>
  <p>What&rsquo;s the use of bein&rsquo; bitter? What&rsquo;s the use of gettin&rsquo; mad?<br>
    What&rsquo;s the use of bein&rsquo; narrer just because yer luck is bad?<br>
    What&rsquo;s the blessed use of frettin&rsquo; like a child that wants the
    moon?<br>
    There is broken hearts an&rsquo; trouble in the gilded First Saloon!<br>
    We are used to bein&rsquo; shabby&mdash;we have got no overdraft&mdash;<br>
    We can laugh at troubles for&rsquo;ard that they couldn&rsquo;t laugh at
    aft!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite
  o&rsquo; pride an&rsquo; tone abaft<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Keepin&rsquo;  up
  appearance, aft)<br>
    There&rsquo;s anxiety an&rsquo; worry in the breezy cabins aft.</p>
  <p>But the curse of class distinctions from our shoulders shall be hurled,<br>
    An&rsquo; the sense of Human Kinship revolutionize the world;<br>
    There&rsquo;ll be higher education for the toilin&rsquo; starvin&rsquo; clown,<br>
    An&rsquo; the rich an&rsquo; educated shall be educated down:<br>
    Then we all will meet amidships on this stout old earthly craft,<br>
    An&rsquo; there won&rsquo;t be any friction &rsquo;twixt the classes fore-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-aft.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll
  be brothers, fore-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-aft!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,
  an&rsquo; sisters, fore-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-aft!<br>
    When the people work together, and there ain&rsquo;t no fore-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-aft.</p>
