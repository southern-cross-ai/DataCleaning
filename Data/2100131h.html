<h1><b>The Story of Tommy Bear and the Zookies</b>
</h1>

<p align="center">by<br>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src="2100131h-images/page04.png" width="330" height="350"
hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" alt="">LITTLE Tommy Bear lived
at the top of a very tall gum tree with his Mother and Father. He
was a very lonely little bear because he had no brothers and
sisters to play with, and he spent most of the day sitting on the
branch of the tree growling and grumbling.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Bear became very worried and sent for a doctor,
&ldquo;Perhaps he can tell me what is wrong with Tommy,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>When the doctor arrived Mrs. Bear had great trouble in finding
Tommy as he was hiding with the Zookies in the gum tree. Look at
the picture and you will see the Zookies. Nice fat little
things&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open your mouth and put your tongue out Tommy,&rdquo;
said Mrs Bear.</p>

<p>Tommy did as he was told being a good little bear.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at his tongue and felt his pulse, and then
said to Mrs. Bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This child must have some fun, and I think you had better
take him to Sydney for a change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the rest of the day was spent in packing up, and Mrs. Bear,
being a kind thoughtful soul, picked some of the youngest and
sweetest gum leaves to take with them, so that Tommy should not get
hungry on the way.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2100131h-images/page05.jpg" width=

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src="2100131h-images/page06.png" width="282" height="400"
hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" alt="">When they arrived in
Sydney Mr. Bear found a lovely big gum tree in one of the parks,
and here they decided to make their home. They had a grand view all
over the town and harbour, and there was only one thing against it,
Mrs. Bear said the smuts were something frightful.</p>

<p>Dear little Tommy was much happier already and had ceased
growling quite a lot. They had hardly unpacked their bags when Mrs.
Bear was attracted by a small voice quite near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please Mrs. Bear, may Tommy come and play with
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking round Mrs. Bear found two dear little bear boys and they
also had with them some little Zookies; but they looked rather
cheeky, much cheekier than country Zookies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! my dears,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bear, &ldquo;Tommy may
play with you; but don&rsquo;t let him fall off the
tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this way Tommy made many friends; but still he was not as
happy as he should be. &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bear to Mr.
Bear, &ldquo;I think the child needs exercise, so I shall make
arrangements for him to join the &ldquo;Gum Tree Boxing
Club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here you see Tommy boxing with Sammy Bear. They have great fun,
and the Zookies always come to watch them; but, I am sorry to say,
they call out many cheeky remarks.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2100131h-images/page07.jpg" width=

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src="2100131h-images/page08.png" width="350" height="326"
hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" alt="">One day Tommy came home
with a broken nose after playing at boxing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear&rdquo; said Mrs. Bear, &ldquo;I was so proud of
your nose before. It was just like your Father's! but now &mdash;
well &mdash; look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Needless to say Tommy was too upset to look at his nose; but he
said it felt terribly big. However Mrs. Bear made a poultice of gum
leaves (she believes in them) and put this on poor Tommy&rsquo;s
nose. Very soon it was better; but it had a little bump on it ever
after. Mr. Bear thought boxing was too rough for Tommy, so he
decided to make arrangements for him to join a golf club.</p>

<p>Tommy spent very many happy days playing golf; but he could not
hit the little balls. Somehow he always seemed to hit the ground.
One day he distinctly heard some Zookies, who were watching him,
say something about being cross-eyed.</p>

<p>This annoyed Tommy so much, that he went home and told his
Mother and Father. &ldquo;The very idea!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bear,
&ldquo;these town Zookies are indeed too rude altogether. I shall
not allow Tommy to play golf again. Tommy didn&rsquo;t care very
much, as he said golf was for old Father bears, and not for little
boy bears; but as his entrance fee had been paid in advance, Mr.
Bear said he would play and so the money would not be wasted.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2100131h-images/page09.jpg" width=

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src="2100131h-images/page10.png" width="450" height="312"
hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" alt="">Very shortly after this
Tommy was sitting on a little branch of the tree all by himself and
feeling very lonely when Sammy bear came along and said &ldquo;How
about a game of football Tommy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before Tommy was sliding down the gum
tree and needless to say he tore a great big hole in his shirt. I
am sorry to tell you children, that when Tommy went home that night
and his mother asked him how he managed to get that big hole in his
shirt, he told a story and said, &ldquo;Well, mum, I was climbing
down the tree, and a moth bit it.&quot;</p>

<p>Just look at him in the picture&mdash;</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t he look happy? Look at his great big boots. His
Father paid a lot of money for those boots, so I hope Tommy will be
careful with them and not wear them out kicking stones along the
road.</p>

<p>Tommy very nearly won the game; but a nasty little bear who was
a friend of the Zookies, poked a Stick in front of him just as he
was nearly home, and poor Tommy fell over skinning all his little
knees.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Zookies had something to do with it.</p>

<p>The rest of the day Tommy spent in bed and his knees were very
stiff and painful.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Bear was in tears, and I think she was wishing she had
never left the gum tree in the country.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2100131h-images/page11.jpg" width=
"575" height="750" alt="">
</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src="2100131h-images/page12.png" width="267" height="350"
hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" alt="">When Tommy&rsquo;s
knees were well again Mr. Bear decided to give him a great big
surprise. Mr. Bear had a very good business in the country, He was
a tailor, and made gum leaf skirts for the lady bears and gum leaf
trousers for the gentleman bears, so money was no object to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, said Mr. Bear, I have made arrangements for you
to go up in an aeroplane this afternoon and you may take some of
your little friends with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good old Dad!&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>

<p>I think he should have said &ldquo;Thank you Father dear,&rdquo;
but he was very excited and forgot his manners.</p>

<p>Tommy could hardly get to the aeroplane quickly enough, and as
there was room for only one bear inside, his little friends hung on
the best way they could outside.</p>

<p>Look at the picture.</p>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t they having a lovely time? but I don&rsquo;t think
they look too safe, and the Zookies were rude enough to call out
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got dirty toes;&rdquo; but they were only
jealous because they were not asked to go up.</p>

<p>Tommy just loves flying and his Father has promised him an
aeroplane of his own when he gets home, and, as Mr. Bear says, it
will not cost so very much after all as he can send Tommy round
with the gum leaf suits to his different customers.</p>

<p>Tommy has promised to give Sammy a ride one day.</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2100131h-images/page13.jpg" width=
"582" height="750" alt="">
</h3>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src="2100131h-images/page14.png" width="334" height="450"
hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" alt="">To-day being Mr.
Bear&rsquo;s birthday, Mrs. Bear said he could go to the races, so
of course he took Tommy also,</p>

<p>I am really very sorry Mr. Bear went, because he lost a lot of
money and also lost his temper.</p>

<p>Tommy felt very sad also. Look at the picture and you will see
why.</p>

<p>See the poor little bear being carried to the hospital in a
stretcher.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it sad! Tommy began to cry, so Mr. Bear took him
home, and decided to go back to the country the following week, and
no one was sorry.</p>

<p>The last few days Tommy spent at the sea-side. Mrs. Bear enjoyed
the salt water such a lot. Her poor legs were bruised and scratched
terribly, with climbing up and down the gum tree, and the salt
water did them a great deal of good. Mr. Bear also enjoyed it, as
it was much cheaper than flying and playing golf.</p>

<p>Tommy managed to float a big board out onto the waves and then
he would stand up on it and fly in on the top of the wave.</p>

<p>Oh! it was grand fun. There were plenty of other little bears
there also, and Tommy saw some bears saving another one from
drowning.</p>

<p>Look at them! Aren&rsquo;t they brave?</p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="2100131h-images/page15.jpg" width=
"570" height="750" alt="">
</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src="2100131h-images/page16.png" width="365" height="450"
hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" alt="">Notice how strong they
look.</p>

<p>They saved the little bear, and had a present of a basket of gum
leaf tips sent to them, by the little bear&rsquo;s father, with a
card inside, on which was written &ldquo;God bless you.&rdquo;
Tommy went home feeling very tired and as soon as he was put to bed
went straight to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day they all went home to the gum-tree in the country
and although Mr. Bear had spent all his money, no one worried, and
Mrs. Bear and Tommy were very happy to be home once more.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bear says Sammy may come and stay with Tommy for good so
that he will not get lonely again.</p>

<p>Tommy Bear sends his love to you all and says he will write to
you soon if you are good little children.</p>
