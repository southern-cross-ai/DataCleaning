<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>EVERYONE who has lived in Australia any length of time has heard of
Buckley, "The Wild White Man," as he was familiarly called by the early
settlers. Two separate accounts were published during the 1850's,
purporting to give to the curious reader Buckley's savage life among
the native black wanderers and hunters. Both these books have been
out of print for over twenty years, during which period inquiries for
them at the booksellers have been numerous and continuous, though, of
course, unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The present chapters are an attempt to make use of the life of Buckley
as a groundwork for imparting a readable, reliable, and fairly
complete description of the manners and customs of the strange people
with whom he lived for more than a generation. In compiling it many
books and pamphlets have been consulted and, I think, every statement
contained herein may be verified by reference to the best acknowledged
authorities.</p>

<p>It is a strange fact, but nevertheless true, that no cheap work on the
Australian Aboriginal black is procurable. Students and specialists
are recommended to read Curr's <i>Australian Race</i>, 2 vols., £2 2s.;
Brough Smyth's <i>Aborigines of Australia</i>, 2 vols., £3 3s.; Dawson's
<i>Australian Aborigines</i>, 13s 6d.; Beveridge's <i>Aborigines of Victoria
and Riverina</i>, 5s. In addition to these publications there are some
pamphlets and reports in the Public Library, Melbourne, where also
may be seen the journals, &amp;c., of various Australian explorers, which
contain incidentally information on the blacks.</p>

<p>BUCKLEY'S EARLY LIFE&mdash;TAKES THE KING'S SHILLING&mdash;FIGHTS THE KING'S
ENEMIES&mdash;HIS DISGRACE&mdash;TRANSPORTED TO PORT PHILLIP.</p>


<p>ONE of the most curious and romantic incidents connected with the
early history of the Colony of Victoria is the story of the life and
adventures of William Buckley, a runaway convict, and his thirty-two
years' wanderings with the blackfellows of Port Phillip.</p>

<p>I purpose in the present narrative to give a short account of William
Buckley's life, and to interweave with it a description of the manners
and customs of his black companions, together with a brief sketch of
the history of the founding and settlement of the great Colony of
Victoria.</p>

<p>Our hero, if we way presume to call the object of our tale a hero,
was born near Macclesfield in the county of Cheshire, England in the
year 1780, ten years after the discovery by Captain Cook of the great
south land* of which poor Buckley was destined to become the sole
though unwilling British colonist for more than a generation; perhaps
not monarch of all he surveyed but at any rate with no other white man
to dispute his right to the title if he had claimed such an exalted
dignity.</p>

<p>[<i>* The land first discovered on the Continent of Australia by Captain
Cook's expedition was Cape Everard, within the boundary of the Colony
of Victoria. Captain Cook named it Point Hicks, in honour of Lieutenant
Hicks, of the Endeavour, who first sighted it on Thursday, April 19th,
1770.]</i></p>

<p>Buckley the elder, his father, tilled a small farm in the neighbourhood
of Macclesfield and tried to raise his domestic crop of boys and girls
as respectably as his very limited means would allow him. He was fairly
successful with the others, but William seems to have been the tare
among the wheat. The seeds of good advice falling in his case on stony
ground did not take root, and therefore brought forth no fruit in the
shape of improved conduct. So his father, like a good husbandman,
plucked him out, and transplanted him from his own family circle into
that of the boy's grandfather.</p>

<p>His grandfather took him in hand, and sent him to a small night-school,
where he received the rudiments of reading and writing.</p>

<p>When the lad was about fifteen years of age, he was apprenticed to a
brick-layer; but work did not agree with him: he seems to have been
born tired, like the lazy man in the story. Disliking restraint,
or continuous exertion, he often quarrelled with his master, who
endeavoured to make him industrious and useful. These frequent attempts
to shirk or scamp his work brought well-merited punishment upon his
shoulders, which he submitted to with a very bad grace. For two or
three years a continuous warfare waged between master and man.</p>

<p>At length the sullen and rebellious boy resolved to quit the employment
of his taskmaster on the first opportunity which might present itself.
And the opportunity came when he was about nineteen years of age.</p>

<p>In those troublous times when every nation of Europe was embroiled
in Napoleon's wars, the recruiting-sergeant was to be found in every
likely village in England, beating up yokels and other simpletons as
food for powder, or candidates for glory. Attracted by the brilliant
and gorgeous uniforms of the soldiery, and inspired by plenty of beer,
the patriotism of the sergeant's victims was very easily aroused.</p>

<p>To William Buckley, lazy, stupid, and discontented with his condition,
the sergeant's glowing descriptions of a soldier's life and the
glorious pomp and circumstance of war opened to his mental vision a
bright vista of future greatness, or perhaps swaggering independence
and pot-house popularity. The King's shilling and the large bounty
of ten guineas were gladly accepted by him, and he enlisted in the
Cheshire Militia. After serving about a year in the Militia, he
volunteered into the 4th or King's Own Regiment, receiving another
bounty, for soldiers were badly wanted in those days.</p>

<p>In a few weeks his regiment was ordered to Holland, where the English
and Russian forces were fighting the French and Dutch republicans. The
privations and dangers of a disastrous campaign, rendered still more
terrible by the severities of a Dutch winter, were passed through.
Buckley's regiment suffered heavily, the elements assisting the enemy
not a little in harassing its movements and reducing its numbers. A
shot from a Frenchman's gun wounded Buckley in the right hand, and
rendered him for some time unfit for duty.</p>

<p>When the war was over his regiment returned to England and was
quartered in Chatham Barracks.</p>

<p>After having been in the army about four years, Buckley received a
third bounty, this time for extended service. His officers were pleased
with his attention to duty and general conduct, and perhaps were proud
of him, for he was a fine-looking fellow, probably the biggest man in
his regiment, being nearly six feet six inches in height and splendidly
proportioned.</p>

<p>The dull monotony of barrack life at length had a demoralizing effect
upon poor Buckley's character. An inactive existence tests every man's
moral backbone, and Buckley's was not one of the strongest. He became
associated with some of the worst men in the regiment, with a result
that blasted his whole future career.</p>

<p>Returned from six weeks furlough, during which he had visited his
relatives and old acquaintances in the country, he was arrested and
tried for receiving stolen goods. The charge against him was proved,
and the smart soldier who had helped to fight the King's enemies had
now to serve His Majesty in a more menial capacity. His bright scarlet
uniform was exchanged for one of a more sombre colour, decorated with
broad arrows and other insignia of degradation and servitude; and the
daily routine of barrack life for the arduous and not at all congenial
task of trundling a heavy wheelbarrow full of stones and earth at the
fortification of Woolwich.</p>

<p>Six months had slowly passed at this work, when he was drafted with the
first batch of prisoners, selected by the Government, to found a new
penal settlement in Australia, on the shores of Port Phillip.</p>

<p>This expedition, which had been several months in preparation, was
originally destined for Port Jackson, or Botany Bay as it was then
popularly called, the parent settlement in Australia; but political and
commercial reasons had induced the Government to alter their decision,
and fix upon Port Phillip as a more suitable place. Jealousy of
England's historic enemy, France, and the fear of Napoleon founding a
rival colony somewhere on the Australian coast, which had only recently
been explored in detail by the great French navigator, Baudin, were
good political reasons for starting another colony, 500 miles away from
the old one.</p>

<p>An additional incentive to such a proceeding was also given by the
report that valuable forests of timber suitable for shipbuilding
purposes abounded on the southern coast. England was then projecting a
very large increase to her navy, and her own forests of British oak had
shown signs of not meeting the large demands made upon them during the
long naval wars in which she had been engaged, and which were about to
be renewed with increased vigour.</p>

<p>Commercially, it was thought the new settlement ought to prove very
valuable as a station or emporium for the numerous vessels employed in
the sealing industry, for at that time the neighbouring coasts abounded
with thousands and thousands of that useful amphibian, an animal which
had become very scarce and difficult to obtain in northern latitudes.</p>

<p>By the 26th day of April, 1803, the convicts, their keepers, and a few
free settlers, were embarked, and the doleful expedition set sail out
of Portsmouth Harbour. It consisted of two vessels, the <i>Calcutta</i>, a
fifty gun frigate, under the command of Captain Daniel Woodriff, and a
chartered East Indiaman named the <i>Ocean</i>.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Old Convict Ship.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>To Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins of the Royal Marines, who had had
some colonial experience as Judge-Advocate of the elder colony for the
first ten years of its existence, was given the position of supreme
command, under the title of Lieutenant-Governor, his superior officer
being Governor King of the Port Jackson settlement.</p>

<p>The convicts numbered 307, all males; and there were 17 free women on
board, prisoners' wives who had offered to share the hard lot of their
worse halves. Seven children of the convicts also accompanied their
exiled parents. It may be mentioned that one of these children was
John Pascoe Fawkner, who afterwards became one of the founders of the
City of Melbourne, and figured in political life for many years in the
Colony of Victoria.</p>

<p>Besides officials, seamen, and soldiers, only twelve free people
(eleven men and one women) were on board&mdash;a very little quota of
goodness to leaven so huge a mass of human iniquity and misery.</p>

<p>The voyage out was not marked by any extraordinary events. On
the whole the prisoners behaved very well, and were treated with
consideration by their keepers. But any insubordination or breach of
regulations was promptly punished by the free application of that
most useful instrument, the cat-o'-nine-tails. In those days anything
like tender-heartedness in the treatment of convicts would have been
regarded as a direct incentive to mutiny. Two prisoners died, and the
wife of another one also succumbed to the severities of ship life. The
usual ports of call were touched at, the usual storms were weathered,
and on October 10th, 1803, land was sighted by the look-out man of
the <i>Calcutta</i>&mdash;King Island, in Bass Straits, being the first point
descried within Australian waters.</p>

<p>A raging gale which came on shortly afterwards compelled them to stand
off till next day. Then the entrance to Port Phillip was made, and the
<i>Calcutta</i> glided through its narrow and shallow opening and dropped
anchor just inside the Heads near where is now situated the popular
holiday resort of Sorrento. The <i>Ocean</i> was already there, riding at
anchor, having anticipated the arrival of her crime-laden consort by a
few days.</p>

<p>STARTING A COLONY&mdash;TROUBLES WITH THE BLACKS&mdash;LIFE IN THE CONVICT
CAMP&mdash;FREQUENT ESCAPES OF CONVICTS&mdash;BUCKLEY TAKES TO THE
BUSH&mdash;ABANDONMENT OF THE SETTLEMENT.</p>


<p>BUT little time was lost in preparing for the disembarkation of the
ships' companies. Soon the place was lively with the hum of busy people
engaged in felling trees, constructing huts, making paths, landing
provisions and stores, and all the other manifold duties attending the
formation of a new settlement in the primeval wilds, where hitherto
none but the stealthy and suspicious black, the timid kangaroo, or the
feathered denizen of the woods had broken the deep solitude.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Australian man and woman.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>In three weeks everything had been got ashore, and the <i>Ocean</i>
transport was discharged from His Majesty's Service and free to resume
her voyage to China as soon as she was able to take in ballast.</p>

<p>The black inhabitants seemed to regard the invaders of their dominions
with but very little apprehension, and showed not the slightest desire
to contest the right or the power of the new-comers to settle amongst
them. They manifested the childish curiosity common to all inferior
peoples, and took with great avidity and delight the presents of
biscuits, trinkets, blankets, etc., proffered to them by the white men.
Generally, after receiving the gifts, they immediately departed into
the seclusion of the bush, to more thoroughly enjoy them, or to make
known their good fortune to their friends.</p>

<p>The first act of impropriety on their part was committed by one of
their number who stole the wash-streak of a boat, and made off with it
behind some neighbouring bushes. But the delinquent and his conniving
companions were very soon brought to their bearings. All the presents
which had just been given to them were forcibly taken back again, and
they were made to understand by signs that they would not receive
anything more until the stolen article was restored to its rightful
owners&mdash;a very practical and humane way of teaching the poor ignorant
creatures the difference in <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>.</p>

<p>A few weeks later a serious affray with the natives took place, in
which, it is to be regretted, some blood was shed. With it the conflict
of the two races may be said to have had its beginning. It happened
while Tuckey, First-Lieutenant of the <i>Calcutta</i>, and Mr. Harris, the
Surveyor of the settlement, were exploring the shores of the bay in
company with two boats' crews. They had landed on the western side of
Port Phillip, near the entrance to what is now named Corio Bay. We will
describe what occurred in Lieutenant Tuckey's own words, as recorded in
his journal :&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%"><i>

'The N.W. side of the port, where a level plain extends to the
northwards as far as the horizon, appears to be by far the most
populous. At this place, upwards of two hundred natives assembled
around the surveying boats, and their obviously hostile intentions made
the application of firearms absolutely necessary to repel them, by
which one native was killed and two or three wounded.<br><br>

'Previous to this time, several interviews had been held with
separate parties, at different places, during which the most friendly
intercourse was maintained, and endeavoured to be strengthened on our
part by presents of blankets, beads, &amp;c. At these interviews they
appeared to have a perfect knowledge of firearms, and as they seemed
terrified even at the sight of them, they were kept entirely out of
view.<br><br>

'The last interview which terminated so unexpectedly hostile, had at
its commencement the same friendly appearance. Three natives, unarmed,
came to the boats, and received fish, bread, and blankets. Feeling no
apprehension from three naked and unarmed savages, the First-Lieutenant
proceeded with one boat to continue the survey, while the other boat's
crew remained on shore to dress dinner and procure water.<br><br>

'The moment the first boat disappeared, the three natives took leave,
and in less than an hour returned with forty more, headed by a chief,*
who seemed to possess much authority. This party immediately divided,
some taking off the attention of the people who had charge of the boat
(in which was Mr. Harris the Surveyor of the colony), while the rest
surrounded the boat; the oars, masts, and sails of which were used in
erecting the tent.<br><br>

'The intention to plunder was immediately visible, and all the
exertions of the boat's crew were insufficient to prevent them
possessing themselves of a tomahawk, an axe, and a saw. In this
situation, as it was impossible to get the boat away, everything
belonging to her being on shore, it was thought advisable to temporise
and await the return of the other boat, without having recourse to
firearms, if it could possibly be avoided; and, for this purpose,
bread, meat and blankets were given them. These condescensions however,
seemed only to increase their boldness, and their numbers, having been
augmented by the junction of two other parties, amounted to more than
two hundred.<br><br>

'At this critical time the other boat came in sight, and observing the
crowd and tumult at the tent, pushed towards them with all possible
despatch. Upon approaching the shore, the unusual warlike appearance of
the natives was immediately observed; and as they seemed to have entire
possession of the tent, serious apprehensions were entertained for Mr.
Harris and two of the boat's crew, who it was noticed were not at the
boat.<br><br>

'At the moment that the grapnel was hove out of the Lieutenant's boat,
to prevent her taking ground, one of the natives seized the master's
mate, who had charge of the other boat, and held him fast in his arms.<br><br>

'A general cry of "Fire sir; for God's sake, fire!" was now addressed
from those on shore to the First-Lieutenant. Hoping the report only
would sufficiently intimidate them, two muskets were fired over their
heads. For a moment they seemed to pause, and a few retreated behind
the trees, but immediately returned, clapping their hands, and shouting
vehemently. Four muskets with buckshot and the fowling-pieces of the
gentlemen with small shot, were now fired among them, and from the
general howl, very different from their former shouts, many were
supposed to be struck. This discharge created a general panic, and,
leaving their cloaks behind, they flew in every direction among the
trees.<br><br>

'It was hoped the business would have terminated here, and orders were
therefore given to strike the tent, and prepare to quit the territory
of such disagreeable neighbours. While thus employed, a large party
were seen again assembling behind a hill, at the foot of which was our
tent. They advanced in a compact body to the brow of the hill, every
individual armed with a spear, and some carrying bundles of them.<br><br>

'When within a hundred yards of us they halted, and the chief, with
one attendant, came down to the tent, and spoke with great vehemence,
holding a very large war spear in a position for throwing. The
First-Lieutenant, wishing to restore peace if possible, laid down his
gun, advanced to the chief and presented him with several cloaks,
necklaces, and spears, which had been left behind in their retreat.
The chief took his own cloak and necklace and gave the rest to his
attendant. His countenance and gestures all this time betrayed feelings
more of anger than of fear, and his spear every moment appeared on the
point of quitting his hand.<br><br>

'When the cloaks were all given up, the main body on the hill began
to descend, shouting and flourishing their spears. Our people were
immediately drawn up, and ordered to present their muskets loaded with
ball, while a last attempt was made to convince the chief that, if his
people continued to approach, they would be immediately fired upon.
These threats were either not properly understood, or were despised,
and it was deemed absolutely necessary for our own safety to prove the
power of our firearms, before they came near enough to injure us with
their spears.<br><br>

'Selecting one of the foremost, who appeared to be the most violent,
as a proper example, three muskets were fired at him, at fifty yards
distance, two of which took effect, and he fell dead on the spot. The
chief, turning round at the report, saw him fall, and immediately fled
among the trees; a general dispersion succeeded, and the dead body was
left behind.'</i></p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>
[*Lieutenant Tuckey is wrong. The Australian blacks had no chiefs,
in the ordinary sense of the term. The husband was the chief of his
own household; but the people, as a tribe, recognised no personal
authority. Each man or family was under no restraint but that imposed
by custom. As in all communities, civilised or savage, some men in
every tribe were naturally looked up to by the others, on account of
superior intelligence or physical strength. These might be taken for
chiefs by white strangers.]</i></p>

<br>

<p>But the native blacks were not the only trouble which the authorities
had to encounter and overcome. The convicts were not easily amenable to
discipline, and their red-coated janitors, in many respects, were not
much better. Drunkenness was extremely rife. The Lieutenant-Governor
regarded its prevalence with indignation and dismay, and issued orders
for its abatement or suppression, but with little effect. The soldiers
constantly appearing on parade in most unsoldierly unsteadiness
evoked his strong reprobation, and consequently after a time no one
was allowed to take his allowance of spirits into the privacy of his
tent, but was obliged to drink it while standing in the presence of
his superior officer. Thus the thrifty teetotallers, if there were any
teetotallers among them, were prevented from trading their allowance to
their more thirsty or convivial comrades.</p>

<p>Rumour sayeth that the Governor himself was rather fond of the ruddy
wine, and that he had an able <i>confrére</i> in his chaplain 'Old Bobby
Knopwood,' as that reverend gentleman was familiarly called by the
unrighteous or facetious. But as Shakespeare has it &mdash;'What in the
officer is but a choleric word, is in the soldier rank blasphemy;' and
in those days it was no uncommon thing for a 'gentleman' (God save the
mark) to drink himself under the table. The old saying that example
goes further than precept does not seem to have been thought of by
those in authority in the little settlement.</p>

<p>However, it was not all beer and skittles with the convicts. They were
aroused from their slumbers at sunrise, and immediately set to work at
their several tasks, which they were kept at till seven in the evening,
with about two hours and a half of intervals for rest and refreshment.
But in extenuation of the hard labour, the discipline to which they
had to submit was not very severe when we take into consideration all
surrounding circumstances; their food was good, and there appears to
have been plenty of it&mdash;in fact, the convicts in this respect fared
quite as well as their keepers.</p>

<p>But the excessive heat constantly referred to, and complained of, by
the Rev. Robert Knopwood, made continuous work irksome to men who had
been enjoying or enduring a forced idleness on shipboard for so many
months. To escape from this uncongenial toil, many convicts eluded
the vigilance of their guards, and took to the bush. But they found
out that by doing so they had jumped out of the frying-pan into the
fire. The surrounding country was so barren that absconders were soon
compelled to return. Yet, notwithstanding the non-success of these,
hardly a day passed without one or more of the others running away, the
object of most of them being to reach Port Jackson. A very hazy idea of
the geography of their position prevailed among the convicts, it being
generally imagined that the older colony was but a short distance off.</p>

<p>To correct this mistaken notion and lessen the number of escapes, the
Governor printed notices warning all of the difficulties and dangers
of such a desperate course, and the utter impossibility of men, almost
naked and totally inexperienced in bush craft, being successful in an
attempt to reach a settlement 1,000 miles away along the coast; and
adding, that even should they by any chance elude the lynx-eyed and
blood-thirsty natives, they would be immediately brought to justice and
severely punished on their arrival at their destination.</p>

<p>In the month of November a batch of six convicts absconded, but in a
few days returned in a very sorry plight, repentant and crestfallen. On
this occasion the Governor determined to make a striking example of the
culprits, and teach a solemn lesson to every convict in the encampment.
He therefore ordered a general parade of troops and prisoners, and
gave instructions to the chaplain to read his official commission
as Lieutenant-Governor. After the ceremony he sentenced each of the
miserable delinquents to a public castigation of 100 lashes each.</p>

<p>But this brutal punishment acted as no deterrent to their companions
in durance, for it is reported that even so early as the next day
some others made a bold dash for liberty. Three of these came back in
such an exhausted state that the punishment cat could not safely be
administered to them. In fact, their strength was so far gone that it
was found necessary to place them under the care of the doctor. They
stated to the authorities that their companions had levanted with the
provisions while they were searching for water. This story proving the
falsity of the old proverb about there being honour among thieves, the
Governor attempted to draw a moral from the treachery, and hoped that
so strong an indignation and mutual distrust would be aroused as to
prevent in future any such combinations to break away from their lawful
keepers.</p>

<p>Graver delinquencies broke out during the next month, among which
were store-breaking and plundering. Even the tents of the sick were
robbed of their provisions. On Christmas Eve a raid was made on the
commissary's tent, and, besides other articles, a gun was made off with.</p>

<p>Christmas day came. The smiling sun shining in a brilliant Australian
sky contrasted strongly with what our exiles had experienced in
northern climes. But old associations and customs were not wholly
forgotten or neglected under these new conditions, and a slight
indulgence was offered to the prisoners in the shape of 1 lb. of
raisins each for Xmas plum-pudding, so that all could enjoy this
time-honoured Christmas luxury.</p>

<p>Our hero, Buckley, now appears on the records in a new light. He
had started well. His behaviour on shipboard was exemplary, and a
considerable amount of liberty was accorded him in consequence. Most of
his time was spent on deck, where he made himself useful in a variety
of ways among the seamen. The Governor took notice of him, being, no
doubt, attracted by his fine upstanding soldierly appearance, and
promoted him to the rank of his own body-servant, which position he
held till his services were required to assist in the erection of the
more substantial structures of the settlement&mdash;the powder magazine
and storeroom&mdash;skilled labour, such as he possessed by virtue of his
early training as a brick-layer, being lamentably wanting in the little
community.</p>

<p>His ingrained hatred of hard or continuous labour again showed itself.
Bricklaying had not agreed with him in his youthful years, and now
in his manhood the old aversion marked another turning-point in his
career. Perhaps the sudden change from flunkey to artisan had something
to do with it this time. Anyhow, once more he listened to the voice of
the tempter, and became a party to a carefully prepared plot, which was
devised in company with five other black-sheep of the convict fold who
longed for fresh fields and pastures new.</p>

<p>The work they were employed upon frequently took them outside the line
of sentinels, and they availed themselves of any little opportunity
that might offer itself to 'plant' provisions or any other articles
they thought would come in useful to them in the bush. On the 27th
December they were ready, and agreed to make a start for freedom that
night.</p>

<p>When the shades of evening had given place to the deep gloom of night,
and the last weary convict had at length fallen into a troubled
slumber, and naught broke the solemn stillness but the drowsy sentinels
on their watchful rounds, or the weird cry of a native bird or animal
in the ghost-like bush around, then did the six conspirators quietly
steal forth from the presence of their comrades into the outer air,
pass the line of sentinels, and make for their secreted hoard. But&mdash;</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:25%">

"The best laid schemes o' mice and men<br>

Gang aft a'gley,<br>

And leave us naught but grief and pain<br>

For promised joy."</p>

<br>

<p>and Buckley and his friends found this out to their cost.</p>

<p>They managed to 'spring their plant,' as getting away with hidden booty
is called in convict parlance, but the authorities, suspecting that
a number of the convicts had concerted a plot amongst themselves to
break away, had that night stationed an extra line of outposts beyond
the confines of the settlement. Unfortunately for the fugitives, these
piquets were on the <i>qui vive</i>, and opened fire just as the retreating
men began to feel that they had completely eluded the vigilance of
their guards, with the result that one man was brought down by a
well aimed bullet. Another one was so terrified and dazed at seeing
his comrade fall that he paused in his flight and was immediately
surrounded and captured.</p>

<p>Shot after shot reverberated through the woods, but none of the other
runaways were hit. Dodging behind trees and bushes and any inequalities
of the ground that they could take advantage of, they gradually got out
of range and made good their escape.</p>

<p>We will now leave them for a time, and follow the fortunes of the
settlement. The success of this daring outbreak greatly alarmed the
authorities, who considered that so large a number of the exiles being
free in the bush, was a strong menace to the maintenance of order
within the boundaries of the settlement. It was feared that others
would strive to emulate the enterprise of Buckley and his party.</p>

<p>The night-watch was immediately strengthened, and shortly afterwards a
voluntary association of civil officers and free settlers was formed
to assist the military in their police functions. The officers of this
kind of special constabulary carried firearms, and the men were armed
with batons. Their self-appointed duties consisted of a patrol of the
encampment, independently of the military rounds. Being irregular in
their movements, and not wearing a uniform like the soldiers, it could
never be foretold by the convicts when or where they would turn up
next, and consequently they soon became very useful in checking crime;
and many an unfortunate misdemeanant was pounced upon by them, and
promptly brought to justice.</p>

<p>In consequence of large fires being seen at some distance from the
encampment, it was concluded that the escapees were still in the
neighbourhood. It was therefore determined that an effort should be
made to retake them.</p>

<p>With this object an expedition was organised on the 6th of January,
1804, in which the civil association and several marines joined their
forces. They managed to follow the tracks of the fugitives for several
miles, but could trace them no further, and perforce had to come back
unsuccessful. No other attempt was made in this direction, as the
Governor thought that it was unnecessarily harassing to the small force
under his command, and he felt sure that the runaways would return or
else perish by starvation.</p>

<p>A week after this fruitless expedition one of Buckley's companions
surrendered himself at the camp, after having, according to his own
account, accompanied his fellow fugitives almost around Port Phillip,
a distance of one hundred miles. He brought back the stolen gun with
him and stated that he had subsisted almost entirely on shell-fish and
gum&mdash;a very inferior bill of fare, even for a convict.</p>

<p>The last days of the settlement were now drawing nigh.
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins had never liked Port Phillip. He had pitched
upon probably the worst spot upon its shores; and although he had sent
out many exploring parties, these had performed their duties in so very
perfunctory a manner that no practical good came of them. It is true
that he was told of the existence of a large stream* at the head of the
bay, but this he considered to be too far away from the entrance for
the safety of such an establishment as his.</p>

<p><i>[* The Yarra]</i></p>

<p>Collins seems to have had an extreme dread of the natives, and they
were reported to be very numerous and ferocious around the northern
shores. The small body of troops at his command were scarcely
sufficient to keep his unruly charges in check, and he deemed it too
great a risk to venture further from the open sea, to a place where he
would in all likelihood have a large body of black foes without his
walls, to contend with, as well as the many white blackguards within.</p>

<p>Excessive prudence seems to have been a very noticeable feature of
Collins's character. To us looking back over the past, and knowing what
has been done by but poorly equipped later comers, his cautious conduct
may be said to have amounted to timidity, and quite unworthy of the
leader of a colonizing expedition.</p>

<p>Within a month after landing he was already seeking to quit Port
Phillip. He had an idea that Van Diemen's Land would be superior both
from a commercial and a military point of view. The following quotation
from a despatch to Governor King clearly conveys his opinion of Port
Phillip and at the same time shows what a bad prophet he was. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%">

'I am well aware that a removal hence must be attended with much
difficulty and loss; but, upon every possible view of my situation, I
do not see any advantage that could be thereby attained, nor that by
staying here I can at all answer the intentions of the Government in
sending hither a colonial establishment. The bay itself, when viewed
in a commercial light, is wholly unfit for any such purpose, being
situated in a deep and dangerous bight, between Cape Albany Otway*
and Point Schanck, to enter which must ever require a well-manned and
well-found ship, a leading wind, and a certain time of tide, for the
ebb runs out at the rapid rate of from five to seven knots an hour, as
was experienced by the store-ship. The <i>Calcutta</i> had fortunately a
fair wind, and the tide of flood when she came in, and she experienced
a very great in-draught, which had brought her during the night much
nearer than she expected. With a gale of wind upon the coast, and well
in between the two above-mentioned points, a ship would be in imminent
risk of danger.'</p>

<p><i>[*Now Cape Otway.]</i></p>

<p>He writes further under date 14th November, 1803, to Lord Hobart, the
Secretary of State, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%">
'I regret that I have not a better report to make to your lordship of
the probable success of an expedition, equipped under your lordship's
auspices with a liberality that inspired every one concerned in the
undertaking with the most sanguine hopes of success. You may rest
assured that what is possible shall be done by me to ensure it, if
it should be Governor King's opinion that I am to remain here. I
have suggested to that gentleman, in a private letter which I wrote
to him, that Port Dalrymple, on the northern side of Van Diemen's
Land, appears to possess those requisites for a settlement in which
this very extensive harbour is so wholly deficient. Every day's
experience convinces me that it cannot, nor ever will, be resorted to
by speculative men. The boat that I sent to Port Jackson was three days
lying at the mouth of the harbour before she could get out, owing to
a swell occasioned by the wind meeting the strong tide of ebb. A ship
would undoubtedly find less difficulty, but she must go out at the top
of the tide and with a leading wind, which is not to be met with every
day. When all the disadvantages attending this bay are publicly known,
it cannot be supposed that commercial people will be very desirous of
visiting Port Phillip.'</p>


<p>He was vested with discretionary power to remove the settlement, if he
considered the site unfit, and he resolved to communicate with Governor
King at Port Jackson, in order to find whether any port likely to be
suitable for a colony had been discovered along the south coast of
Australia.</p>

<p>It was, however, a difficult matter to convey his dispatch, as the
<i>Calcutta</i> was wanted in the bay, and the transport <i>Ocean</i>, having
completed her charter, could not be utilised without additional expense
to the government.</p>

<p>In this emergency a cousin and namesake of the Lieutenant-Governor
gallantly volunteered to make the voyage to Sydney in an open boat.
His offer was gladly accepted, and he started, with a crew of six
convicts, upon what turned out to be a most tempestuous and perilous
voyage. After nine days' buffeting of wind and wave he and his plucky
crew arrived within 60 miles of Sydney heads, when they were overtaken
by the <i>Ocean</i>, which took them on board and carried them on to their
destination. The despatches were duly delivered, and Governor King thus
received the first intimation of the arrival of the expedition within
the boundaries of his extensive dominions.</p>

<p>Governor King concurred with his coadjutor Collins, as to the
advisability of removing the settlement to the island of Van Diemen's
Land. Should the French attempt to form a colony in the neighbourhood
he thought that they would more likely select that island than the
mainland. He accordingly re-chartered the <i>Ocean</i> to assist Collins in
the removal of his establishment across the water from Port Phillip,
either to Port Dalrymple on the northern coast, or to Storm Bay on the
southern coast, whichever he preferred.</p>

<p>The return of the <i>Ocean</i> on the 12th of December, with Governor
King's reply was therefore gladly welcomed. The agreeable news brought
by it was, however accompanied by the very disagreeable and disturbing
intelligence, that war was again raging between England and France.</p>

<p>Captain Woodriff of the <i>Calcutta</i>, on learning this, resolved, with
the true patriotism characteristic of a British sailor, to leave the
colony, and bring his vessel within the fighting arena without any
loss of time. Its departure, less than a week afterwards, somewhat
inconvenienced the authorities of the settlement, and delayed
arrangements for the removal; so that it was not till the end of
January that the first shipload, consisting of one hundred and twenty
convicts and twenty marines where taken on board the <i>Ocean</i>.</p>

<p>After sailing through Port Phillip Heads, it took her twenty days to
reach the river Derwent, truly a very tardy voyage. She left again on
March the 22nd, and did not arrive at Port Phillip till April 17th, a
voyage of almost a month.</p>

<p>In three days the remainder of the establishment was embarked, and
again sail was set. This time, owing to the very tempestuous weather
prevailing, the voyage occupied the long period of thirty-five
days, more than is now taken to steam half-way round the globe. The
very elements seem to have protested against the abandonment of the
settlement.</p>

<p>Thus the attempted colonisation of Victoria was finally relinquished
by our colonel of marines and his recreant crew, and the native
inhabitants were left for another generation to roam in the primeval
solitudes of the pathless woods, or along the lonely beach of the
sea-girt shore undisturbed by the unruly intrusion of the white invader.</p>

<p>THE FOUR ABSCONDERS&mdash;A GLIMPSE OF THE BLACKS&mdash;SUFFERINGS IN THE
BUSH&mdash;SIGNALLING THE '<i>CALCUTTA</i>'&mdash;BUCKLEY'S COMRADES LEAVE HIM.</p>


<p>HAVING seen the last of our first colonisers, we will now return and
follow the footsteps of William Buckley. That worthy and his three
companions kept close together, and made rapid progress in their
flight through the bush. Fear lent them wings, and by the morning a
considerable space had been placed between themselves and their late
prison home. They then slackened their speed, feeling now very little
apprehension of being pursued and retaken, as it was not customary for
Governor Collins to prosecute a search to any such distance as they
had by this time reached. However, to make assurance doubly sure they
continued on till the shades of evening began to fall, when coming to a
small creek they concealed themselves within a clump of tangled bushes,
and lay down thoroughly fagged with their strenuous exertions.</p>

<p>They slumbered till daybreak. On awaking, they felt much refreshed, and
relieved to find that they had not been disturbed during the night.
They then unpacked their provisions, and ate a hearty breakfast. How to
reach Sydney was the next question for consideration. Their instincts
urged them to seek the haunts of fellow white men, and at Sydney they
thought they would be able to mingle unobserved with the general
population, and perhaps be enabled to earn a living as free men, or
mayhap in time escape the country altogether and return to old England
once more.</p>

<p>The creek on the bank of which they had slept now barred their
progress. They travelled along it some distance, seeking a suitable
crossing place, but could not find one. A number of natives suddenly
appeared a little distance off, completely blocking the way and causing
a fearful dread in the minds of the not over-courageous convicts. The
blackfellows advancing towards them warily with spears poised and
boomerangs ready for throwing, looked formidable indeed; but they were
really as frightened of the unknown trespassers on their domains as our
runaways were afraid of them, so that when Buckley discharged his gun
they all made off with a terrified howl into the inner recesses of the
woods.</p>

<p>Much relieved at this unexpected retreat of their black foes, the
convicts determined to cross the creek without more ado. One of their
number, however, had had enough of this perilous liberty, and refused
to go any further. He therefore took the gun and began to retrace his
steps. In spite of his faint-heartedness the others were not deterred.
Buckley, being a splendid swimmer, stripped, and jumping into the water
helped each of his companions over separately, and then returned for
their clothes and the provisions.</p>

<p>A cumbrous iron pot or kettle which had been carried by the party all
along was here thrown into the scrub, being no longer of any use to
them, as they had eaten the provisions with which it had been filled,
and they possessed no tea, that prime necessity to every true bushman
nowadays. Buckley mentions in his autobiography that this pot was
picked up thirty-two years after by a party of men who were clearing
ground for agricultural purposes.</p>

<p>The creek crossed, their march was continued. By night time they were
within a few miles of the present site of Melbourne. The Yarra was
reached during the morning of the third day of their flight, and by
the friendly aid of some fallen giant gums which had been caught by a
natural bed of protruding rock they passed safely over to the other
side.</p>

<p>The prospects of the party were now becoming ominous. Their original
scanty stock of stolen provisions not having been supplemented by wild
food of any kind, was by this time almost exhausted. Hunger stared
them in the face, unless they could devise some means of obtaining
sustenance.</p>

<p>They arrived at the foot of the You Yangs after a lengthy tramp over
miles and miles of flat country. Here they ate the last morsels of
their provisions.</p>

<p>They were now on the same footing as the native dweller of the soil,
but without his experience in the art of providing for his daily wants.</p>

<p>Morning come, and they were assailed by the sharp pangs of hunger, but
were without the wherewithal to satisfy them. Buckley proposed that
they should make for the sea-shore, because to remain where they were
meant certain death to all from starvation. Acting on his suggestion
they turned their steps coastwards and reached the beach after a long
and weary tramp. Here they found a few shell-fish which they devoured
ravenously, and thus in a measure appeased their hunger.</p>

<p>Journeying on, they at length were fortunate enough to meet with a
water hole, at which they quenched their thirst and then lay down
beside it for the night.</p>

<p>Now their struggle for a merest existence began. They wandered
despairingly along the shore, toilfully gathering such shell-fish as
they could pick up on the sand or tear off the rocks, and now and then
varying their diet with a crab or lobster, and supplementing these with
gum which they found oozing from the trunks of trees.</p>

<p>This miserable and unwholesome fare soon injuriously affected their
health, and they were forced by sheer exhaustion and pain, to halt for
several days. When recovered a little, they resumed the march, on the
way sighting several native camping-places, luckily deserted by their
owners, much to the satisfaction of our runaways, for they were now
less able than ever to cope with the savage native.</p>

<p>One morning they were surprised by discovering the white sails of the
<i>Calcutta</i>, which was riding at anchor in the offing. They then knew
that, instead of being on the road to Sydney, they had completely
travelled round the bay to a point directly opposite the site of their
old quarters.</p>

<p>Broken down as they were with their privations, they hailed the sight
of the ship with wild exclamations of delight. If they could only get
aboard the old ship again they would risk any punishment which might be
inflicted upon them, rather than continue where they were, and suffer
as they now suffered. To attract the attention of those on board they
stripped off their tattered clothing, and waved it from branches of
trees, the while gesticulating and shouting like madmen.</p>

<p>But it was of no avail; no one saw them. When evening came on they
gathered a huge pile of timber and bushes, and made an enormous fire.
But this had no better effect. Even if the blaze had been seen by the
<i>Calcutta</i> people, they probably thought that the natives were the
originators of it.</p>

<p>For several days they continued making the same signals, and at last
were rewarded by seeing a boat put off from the ship's side and steer
towards them, as they imagined. Deliverance then seemed so near that
fear of the brutal punishment of the lash meted out to returned or
recaptured absconders arose in their breasts, and nothing but the
instant dread of death by starvation kept them from hiding themselves
in the bush. However, this conflict of feeling did not last long, for
the boat, after advancing some distance in their direction, turned
its head towards the ship, and then both hope of rescue and fear of
punishment vanished.</p>

<p>They continued signalling for a short time, but at length gave it
up. Then, in desperation at their woeful predicament, Buckley's two
companions signified their determination of retracing their steps
around the bay, and surrendering themselves to the authorities. They
argued that the lash of the taskmaster could not inflict greater
suffering upon them than they were then enduring, and in the convict
settlement they certainly had been served with a plentiful and regular
supply of food, even if they had been compelled to work laboriously for
it.</p>

<p>Buckley was earnestly urged to accompany them, but he obstinately
repelled their entreaties, and said he would stay where he was, and
risk any suffering and privation rather than surrender his liberty.
The two men then reluctantly left him. Neither of them reached the
settlement. They, no doubt, perished miserably in the bush, for they
were never again heard of.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV_BUCKLEYS_CRUSOE_LIFE" id="CHAPTER_IV_BUCKLEYS_CRUSOE_LIFE">CHAPTER IV.&mdash;BUCKLEY'S CRUSOE LIFE.</a></h2>

<p>ALONE&mdash;SEES SIGNS OF THE NATIVES&mdash;RETREATS TO THE SHORE&mdash;DISCOVERED BY
THE NATIVES&mdash;THEY TAKE HIM AWAY&mdash;ALONE ONCE MORE&mdash;TERRORS OF SOLITARY
LIFE&mdash;RESOLVES TO GIVE HIMSELF UP&mdash;PERILS AND PRIVATIONS&mdash;TAKES SPEAR
FROM NATIVE GRAVE&mdash;LIES DOWN TO DIE.</p>


<p>LEFT to himself we can imagine that Buckley's rejections were none
of the happiest. Although not naturally of a social or a friendly
disposition, yet he bitterly felt the loss of his companions in
misfortune, and fain would have followed them, had not pride or
stubbornness kept him back. Perhaps he thought they would return to him
and urge him once more.</p>

<p>As the evening came on and melted into night he experienced a
desolateness almost unbearable. The silent horror of his whole
surroundings terrified and appalled him. Every moving shadow or
gentle sigh of the breeze as it rustled through the branches of the
overhanging trees, awakened within his mind an awful sense of his utter
loneliness, and his distance from human help, at his own powerlessness,
and a gloomy foreboding of the future.</p>

<p>Sleep he could not. Once or twice he fell into a sort of troubled
slumber disturbed with dreams of his past life&mdash;every event of his
fitful career obtruded itself upon him&mdash;his childhood's home, his
disobedience of his parents' wishes, his old master the brick-layer,
the recruiting sergeant, his soldier days when gallantly fighting his
country's enemies; and so on to his disgrace, the convict ship, and the
hard life at the settlement. All these passed vividly in succession
before him as he lay there that night.</p>

<p>The rising sun at length told him that another day had broken. He got
up and searched the beach in quest of shell-fish for breakfast.</p>

<p>After several days of mental prostration, during which he felt like one
bereft of his reason, he somewhat recovered, and began to adapt himself
to his new circumstances. Once more the old idea of reaching Sydney
asserted itself, and he resumed his journey along the coast, still
going however in a southerly direction, towards Cape Otway.</p>

<p>His movements for several days were accompanied by great privations,
his staple article of diet being nothing better than shell-fish. Fresh
water becoming scarce, he was forced to go a considerable distance
inland to find some. Here he almost stumbled on an encampment of the
dreaded natives, but he eluded them by swimming across a stream.</p>

<p>That night he had to sleep in his wet clothing, and awoke next morning
suffering severe pains, and it was not till the day had well advanced
that he was sufficiently recovered to be able to move about. To add to
his discomfort a lighted piece of bark which he had carried with him
was extinguished in the stream, and he had not the wherewithal to light
a fire.</p>

<p>Another deserted camp again aroused his alarm but this time no natives
appeared to be in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Thinking he would be safer on the shore, he made for it again, passing
on his way a burning tree which had probably been set afire by the
natives, where he obtained another torch. Here he also found some
berries growing on a bush, and on taking his fill of them he felt much
refreshed at such a welcome change in his diet.</p>

<p>For months this sort of life continued. Sometimes he had much ado to
escape the watchful aborigines. At times starvation stared him in the
face. On one occasion he was nearly drowned by the advancing ocean
while he was asleep beneath the shelter of a huge rock.</p>

<p>At last he settled down to a listlessness born of despair, and instead
of attempting his self-allotted journey, he wandered aimlessly to
and fro within a radius of a few miles, with no other object than
to procure his daily food. A low fever attacked him, and laid him
prostrate for weeks. Luckily he happened at the time to be camped in
a more sheltered spot than usual, having the protection of several
shelving rocks around and above him, and a plentiful supply of fresh
water trickling from a spring at a short distance off.</p>

<p>The fever gradually wore off. But he kept to the place, as it was the
best he had come across in his wanderings.</p>

<p>Buckley called this nook his 'Sea-beach Home.' The place was to him
what the fertile oasis in the desert is to the wandering Arab. He was
there well provided with food, for besides having an abundant supply of
shell-fish lying about on the rocky shore, there grew over the cliff a
creeping plant, which in season, offered him numerous water-melons of a
luscious taste, and there were also bushes in the neighbourhood which
produced currants, both black and white. Faring daily on this variety
of food, he continued to dwell there content with his lonely lot, or,
at least, in a not unhappy apathetic condition.</p>

<p>At length the even tenor of his Robinson Crusoe-like life was rudely
disturbed. Solitude had engendered a brooding habit, and in this he was
one day indulging, and gazing in a meditative mood out to sea, taking
little heed of the sights or sounds around him, except, perhaps, the
ripple of the wavelets over the low rocks and shingly beach at his
feet, when the sound of human voices broke on his ear and startled him
from his reverie.</p>

<p>Standing up and turning quickly round he beheld three blackfellows on
the cliff directly over him. A sudden impulse led him to hide himself,
and he darted precipitately into a deep fissure between the rocks.
Never perhaps had the slow-going Buckley moved with such celerity,
and he fervently hoped, and half believed, he had escaped observation
by the blacks. He was, however, soon bitterly disappointed. Bounding
lightly down from rock to rock, they were in a few moments at the
narrow opening, in the deepest recess of which he was crouched, and by
shouting and beckonings they so worked upon his fears, that he thought
it would be good discretion to creep out and stand before them.</p>

<p>The natives seemed wonder-stricken at beholding him. No doubt Buckley
was the first white man they had viewed so closely, or, perhaps, ever
seen at all. They examined him curiously, opening his shirt to see
whether all of his body was white, and, uttering the while a sort of
whine, caught hold of both his arms, and pulled here and there at his
tattered garments. The scrutiny was after a few minutes completed by
their striking their own breasts several times, and then that of their
captive, who, still trembling from the first shock, thought their
strange behaviour must be the prelude to some personal injury.</p>

<p>None of the three blackfellows were of very powerful build. Their
limbs, from the elbows and the knees, tapered off towards the
extremities, more than is the case with the average white man. However,
they were wonderfully agile in appearance, and, moreover, carried
spears of portentous length, which Buckley eyed with fear, for had they
made a target of his massive frame, his naturally gigantic strength
would have availed little. Over their fairly proportioned shoulders
each wore a cloak of furred skin, the fur inside next the body. This
garment reached almost to the knees.</p>

<p>When the astonishment of the trio had somewhat subsided, they made
an inspection of the rough shelter-hut which the lonely man had
constructed, and after a time one of them, without any apology for the
liberty he was taking with another man's property, used some of the
material in making a roaring fire. Another threw off his only garment,
and waded to some rocks a short distance off shore, and soon returned
with a good-sized lobster, which he threw alive into the flames.</p>

<p>When it was roasted to his own satisfaction, he broke it in four
portions, and generously gave the largest and best to Buckley, who
felt greatly relieved in his mind by this evidence of hospitality.
He had hitherto fancied that the first act of the savage natives on
getting hold of him, would be to kill him for the purpose of banqueting
upon the daintiest portions of his huge body. The lobster was eaten
ravenously to the last morsel, and then the natives made signs to
Buckley that he must go away with them. He was scarcely yet free from
misgivings as to their intentions, and held out some time before he
would understand their signs.</p>

<p>At last he was led quietly around the cliff and into the bush under
their vigilant guidance until dusk, when they all halted beside two
very rudely constructed bark and turf shelters. These were the mia-mias
of the natives, and consisted merely of three stems stuck in the ground
and inclined so as to support a few slabs of bark, which, with one end
on the ground, leaned a contrary way so as to rest on the tree stems,
the interstices between the bark slabs being filled up with tufts of
grass. They were entirely open on one side, and of about sufficient
height to allow a native to sit in them but not to stand, and the depth
of each was just enough to afford shelter to a couple of natives lying
side by side at full length.</p>

<p>The party divided and went to rest in these primitive habitations.
Buckley, whose position was next the bark, was rather cramped by his
bed-fellow, who was altogether an extremely offensive individual to
pass the night with in such close quarters. Dirt and grease, with which
he was bedaubed, increased the disagreeable odour natural to his black
skin, and he kept awake throughout the night, muttering to himself as
if in fear of some enemy; or was it the nightmare, brought on by an
undigested portion of the lobster he had digested some hours before?
This wakefulness prevented Buckley from slipping away as he intended to
do in the darkness of the night; but at dawn when the natives wished to
resume the march, he put his foot down against going any further.</p>

<p>The blacks on this had some warm wranglings between themselves, and
much violent gesticulations with their obstinate captive; but finally
the victory remained with Buckley. They consented to leave him, but
signified that they wished to have his tattered socks, probably as a
pledge or maybe a <i>souvenir</i>. Luckily for him that he had Australian
blacks to deal with. Had he been in the hands of the wild Red-men they
might have insisted on taking a lock of his hair, with a goodly portion
of his scalp attached. However, Buckley would not take the socks
off, and although the blackfellows stamped their feet, struck their
breasts, and looked disappointed and fierce, still he was obdurate. His
determined opposition was in this instance also a complete success,
for presently they went away. After several minutes one of them came
back bringing with him a rush basket full of berries, which he offered
in exchange for the much coveted convict hose. But Buckley, who, as we
have seen more than once, could be very resolute at times, kept to his
first determination, and the black, seeing that he could not gain his
object, departed, leaving the basket of berries in the mia-mia.</p>

<p>This basket was a skilfully contrived article; the rushes of which
it was made having been split and ingeniously entwined so as to make
a small open basket of neat appearance. The berries, most likely the
native cherry, were fresh and wet with the morning dew, and made a very
acceptable breakfast to our unsocial and friendless wanderer.</p>

<p>Buckley waited a few hours, and finding himself again quite alone, made
off as fast as he could towards the coast. He reached a spot where the
sea beat violently upon a rocky and shingly beach. A short distance out
were several seals, some sporting about, some sleeping on a cluster of
rocks. He trudged along the sea-shore, and as the day drew to a close
he looked about in vain for a supper, and then regretfully bethought
him of the previous day's repast with the natives. He decided to return
to them and started off in search of them, but lost his way in the
endeavour, and went hungry to bed that night within the hollow trunk of
an old gum tree.</p>

<p>During the day he had picked up a fire-stick&mdash;a torch of bark about
two feet long, commonly carried by the native women from one camping
place to another in order to ignite the domestic fire. With this
Buckley lighted a fire in front of his natural bedroom, for the weather
was chilly. The blaze attracted a number of wild dogs, opossums,
and native bears, and the horrid howls of the one mingling with the
shrill childlike cries of the others, kept the highly wrought man in
a tremulously nervous state. Only once throughout that blood-curdling
night did he peer into the darkness, and then, seeing nothing around
him but the phantom-like trees, he turned his head and tried to shut
out the hideous noises which seemed as a weird chorus in which he was
the central figure, with invisible forms flitting everywhere above him
and around him.</p>

<p>Towards morn the fire had burned low, and he cared not to venture out
from his shelter to replenish it. A fitful slumber consequent on his
thorough exhaustion from his long watching came over him, but it did
not last long. Suddenly a hideous noise from the overhanging branch of
a tree close by broke forth on the crisp morning air, and awoke him
with a terrified stare. Gazing upwards in his fright he descried a
number of brown sombre-looking birds rather larger than a pigeon, with
clumsy heavy bodies and disproportionately large heads. Their widely
distended beaks gave forth the unearthly combination of chuckle, hoot,
and bray, which had aroused him from his sleep. The birds, to his
imagination, seemed to be jeering at him, as just before each outburst
they looked at him curiously and knowingly, with their heads slightly
bent as if intent on peering into his very marrow. They were laughing
jackass birds which have a delightful habit of arousing with their
fiendish cachinnation just before sunrise, all lie-a-beds, human or
feathered. Presently the other birds in the forest took up the strain,
and the whole air was filled with the warblings and chatterings of
thousands of the feathered race inhabiting the neighbourhood, and thus
was heralded in the birth of another day.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun shed sufficient light, Buckley again essayed to
track the natives, but ere the day was out he was completely bewildered
by the labyrinth of gums and similar trees, and the general sameness
of the landscape which has not unfrequently been noticed by later
travellers. Consequently, for several days, he rambled distractedly
through a thick bush, finding no food, and only occasionally getting
any water. Every night he was visited with the same seemingly unearthly
noises which had banished sleep when first heard. A man of average
strength would, under such circumstances, have been completely tired
out and unable to move; the giant Buckley, however, although gradually
becoming more dazed, continued in a dreamy manner to wander here and
there, sometimes obtaining a few roots or berries with which to stay
the gnawings of his empty stomach.</p>

<p>At length he came to a large lake* at a spot where ducks, black swans,
and other wild fowl in great numbers swam, dived, and hovered about
its surface. In their very live condition they were a very tantalizing
eye-sore to the hungry, helpless, and hopeless wanderer. He noticed
that a stream of considerable size ran out of the lake, and believing
that it emptied itself into the ocean, on the shores of which he
would surely come across some creatures of a catchable kind, such as
lobsters, mussels, and other shell-fish, he dragged his weary way along
the river's bank and ultimately arrived at the beach, near to the place
from which he had seen the seals gliding off the slippery rocks.</p>

<p><i>[*Probably Lake Connewarre.]</i></p>

<p>Somewhat cheered at recognizing the spot after the perplexities of his
struggle through the bush mazes, he made another endeavour to reach the
native huts. This time his efforts were successful, and lying down in
one of them he indulged himself in a long, and much needed, refreshing
sleep. On waking, he went out and picked handfuls of berries of the
kind the natives had left him, and these sustained him for several
days. His next movements took him back to his 'Sea-beach Home,' where
he again settled down for a long period.</p>

<p>Winter came again, and the weather grew so inclement that the bleak
beach became a miserable dwelling-place. As the cold increased, his
chief food, shell-fish, became more and more difficult to find, and he
began to think he had eaten out the neighbourhood. His clothes, too,
after their long and rough services were worn to shreds, and afforded
him hardly any warmth. The accumulating weight of these hardships was
too much for the animal spirits of Buckley. His long sojourn in the
bush by himself at last told terribly upon him, and completely cowed
his stubborn nature. He longed for a change. Anything would be better
than his present position. He therefore determined, like the prodigal
son in the parable, to arise and go unto his legal keepers, and once
more endure the thraldom of the convict settlement. With this intention
he set off, bitterly regretting that he had not done so many months
ago, when his more sensible companions had made up their minds to
return.</p>

<p>One evening, when worn out with many days' trudging on the sands,
he found himself hemmed in by the inflowing tide against an almost
perpendicular rise of rock. To escape a watery grave he clambered
into a large cavern just above high water mark, and was about to seek
repose there for the night, when several seals or seal-elephants came
splashing, snorting, sprawling in at the opening of his retreat. Being
a close prisoner till the sea should go down he was horrified at their
arrival. Fear caused him to spring up and utter a wild yell, and in so
doing he struck terror into the slimy invading monsters. Scrambling
one over the other they tumbled back again into their native element,
leaving Buckley an easy victor, and sole possessor of their rocky lair.
They did not again disturb him during the night, and when the tide
receded next morning he resumed his return journey.</p>

<p>He made but little progress. His strength was failing fast, and he
could keep up for only very short stages. After several days he got
back to the river in which his first fire-stick had been extinguished,
and on its banks he dragged himself into a thick scrub.</p>

<p>Here he constructed a rude shelter to protect himself in a measure
from the icy coldness which severely affected him, and then he went to
sleep. Waking early in the morning his eyes lighted on a mound of earth
with part of a native's spear stuck upright on top of it. He was in
want of a strong staff to support his enfeebled body, and, therefore,
feeling no compunctions in desecrating the grave, if indeed he knew at
the time that it was a grave, he appropriated the spear. This spear
subsequently proved a veritable staff of life to him, as we shall see
later on.</p>

<p>Next day he nearly lost his life in crossing the river, which was
running with a swift and flooded current. He was carried some way
down stream, but by good fortune an eddy or cross current drew him
near enough to the oppose bank to enable him to clutch an overhanging
branch, and with its assistance he struggled out. After these great
exertions, so exhausted was he, that it was with the utmost difficulty
he managed to crawl on his hands and knees to the shelter of a few
bushes, where, bitterly cold and miserable, he lay down and passed a
most wretched night.</p>

<p>He felt that his last hours had now surely come. The dismal dingoes'
horrible howls in the surrounding darkness, awakened anew in his breast
the old superstition common all over England, that a dog's howling
always forebodes death; and he felt that it could be none other than he
who would now be the victim of the grim and gaunt messenger of eternity.</p>

<p>But when morning broke, the instinct of self-preservation asserted
itself, and he determined to postpone for a day at least the feast
which the dogs seemed to presage they would have on his carcase. He
hobbled about from tree to tree picking gum bit by bit, and eating it
as he went. However, the exertion soon became too much for him, and
he was presently forced to abandon his search for food and sink to
the ground at the foot of a large Eucalyptus. In blank despair he lay
there, he knew not how long, awaiting death to end his sufferings. With
his spear clutched convulsively in one hand, he at length swooned away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V_ADOPTED_BY_THE_BLACKS" id="CHAPTER_V_ADOPTED_BY_THE_BLACKS">CHAPTER V.&mdash;ADOPTED BY THE BLACKS.</a></h2>

<p>SAVED FROM DEATH&mdash;JUMP UP, WHITE-FELLOW&mdash;PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF HIS
NEW FRIENDS&mdash;THEIR ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOUR&mdash;THE BLACK ENCAMPMENT&mdash;A TRIBAL
JOLLIFICATION&mdash;PRIMITIVE ANGLERS&mdash;'POSSUM HUNTING&mdash;CLAIMED AS A
RELATIVE&mdash;PRESENTED WITH NATIVE GARMENTS.</p>


<p>ALTHOUGH hope was gone, help was close at hand. While he was thus lying
there, the sharp eyes of two dusky daughters of the forest perceived
him, and, with the truly universal curiosity of their sex, approached
closer to get a better view. It is not surprising that they were
greatly astonished, if not alarmed, when the closer inspection revealed
to their gaze a man different from any they had ever beheld. To convey
to their husbands the intelligence that they had discovered a monstrous
man with white features and limbs, did not take them long, and very
soon those worthies returned with their better, and uglier, halves to
the spot where the object of their discovery lay prostrate.</p>

<p>With a caution quite natural, although there were four to one, they
surrounded him. Then, seeing that he was utterly helpless and bearing
the marks of long privation, they summoned up sufficient courage to
touch him. This aroused Buckley from his stupor, and he struggled into
a sitting posture with the help of the spear, which had all this time
been clutched by him as a dying man clutches a straw.</p>

<p>As he gazed in a dazed sort of a way at them, he looked like one
just arisen from the dead. And this idea seems to have taken hold of
the minds of his black discoverers, for these simple-minded children
of nature, on seeing the familiar spear in his hand, thought they
recognised in Buckley the re-embodied ghost of a departed warrior
belonging to a neighbouring and friendly tribe, at whose burial they
had only lately assisted. According to aboriginal theology, the spirit
of the late lamented man ought to be still hovering around. It was also
an article of popular belief that the black-fellow after death jumped
up white-fellow, and here, truly, was a case in confirmation. *</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
<i>[* "They have a belief that when they die, they go to some
place or other and are there made white men, and that they then return
to this world for another existence. They think all the white people
previous to death belonged to their own tribes. In cases where they
have killed white men, it has generally been because they imagined them
to have been originally enemies, or belonging to tribes with whom they
were hostile. In accordance with this belief, they fancied me to be one
of their tribe who had been recently killed in a fight, in which his
daughters had been killed also."<br><br>

Some observant writers on the aborigines dispute this. They aver
that it is a modern notion derived from intercourse with the whites
since the first settlement of Port Jackson in 1788. Other reliable
authorities hold with the statement here quoted from Buckley's
autobiography.<br><br>

The belief or idea probably is a very old one, at least among the
tribes whose territory bordered on the sea coast. It may have taken its
rise from the fact of white men occasionally landing. The blacks, not
knowing how to account for their appearance from the illimitable ocean,
settled the matter by inventing as an explanation the legend expressed
in the words: "Go down black-fellow, jump up white-fellow."]</i></p>
<br>

<p>They laid hold of the worn-out Buckley by the arms, and, after greeting
him with friendly thumps on the chest, managed to set him on his
feet. Then the women got one on each side and helped him along, while
the men marched on ahead shouting, making hideous noises, and wildly
tearing their hair, and behaving in a very extraordinary, not to
say extravagant, manner generally. Whether these gesticulations and
outcries denoted joy or sorrow, Buckley does not say.</p>

<p>They proceeded thus for a short distance and came to a couple of
mia-mias where the women obtained a bowl or calabash, a rough sort of
basin made by the natives out of the knotty excrescence of a tree by
the aid of fire and a flint stone, and into it put gum and water which
they mixed into a pulp and offered to the almost expiring Buckley, who
devoured the mixture eagerly. Next they gave him some large fat grubs,
which the women procured at the roots of trees and underneath decayed
logs. These grubs completed his meal, and such was his famishing
condition at the time that he thought them delicious, and a luxury
equal to the sweetest marrow he had ever tasted. The meal ended,
Buckley felt greatly revived, although still very weak.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hospitality shown to him, he had no confidence in
a continuance of the good offices of his black benefactors, and would
have left them had he been able.</p>

<p>He did not like their looks. Certainly they were not beauties. More
foreboding countenances could scarcely be imagined. The nose was flat,
with widely distended nostrils, and had through its septum, as an
effort at ornamentation, a short stick or reed, which certainly did
not add to their attractiveness in Buckley's eyes. Their mouths were
large and cavernous, with hanging heavy thick lips; below these a large
underjaw denoted great strength, very necessary for the tearing asunder
and mastication of the coarse food they had to subsist on, their teeth
performing many offices which civilized people delegate to knives and
forks. Remarkably quick eyes, sunken afar back and overhung by bushy
brows, bespoke a watchful and suspicious, if not a treacherous, nature.
Retreating foreheads and high cheekbones completed the delineation of
their features. Surmounting all was a luxuriant growth of jet black
hair on the head of both men and women, and rather longer on the
latter. Both men had thick shaggy beards, and on shoulders and chest
the hair also grew strong and thick. Each had a band made of bark
fibres wound round the head, either for ornament or to keep the hair
within bounds. Their faces might be described as speaking faces; every
mood was reflected in them as in a mirror. In repose they bore a very
sullen, not to say morose, aspect, but when interested in anything
this completely vanished, and in its place a most animated and bright
expression revealed to the onlooker that the blacks had within them
considerable vivacity and nerve.</p>

<p>They could not boast of extravagance as regards dress. The women's
attire was bunches of feathers tied with a bark cord at the waist, and
hanging around the loins in form of a skirt somewhat shorter than that
of a stage fairy; while the men were content with wearing strips of
furred skin depending about 12 inches before and behind from a skin
belt.</p>

<p>Both sexes had slim limbs and walked pigeon-toed, but with a graceful
and an active step. The bodies, it might also be mentioned, were
plentifully bedaubed with the fat of some animal; this probably served
a utilitarian as well as an ornamental purpose, for the greasy coating
must, in a measure, have warded off the inclemencies of the weather
from their otherwise almost bare skins.</p>

<p>During the night Buckley was continually disturbed by the moans of
the women, who seemed to him to be lamenting deeply over something
that had happened. Next morning he observed that their faces and limbs
were frightfully lacerated. Their natural ugliness had been largely
augmented by the wounds from which blood was flowing freely. It was a
frightfully sickening sight to him, and made him still more eager to
quit such undesirable company. If, thought he, they could thus inflict
such pain or torture upon themselves without any apparent reason, what
might they not do to him should they choose to consider him as enemy.</p>

<p>Early next day the men by signs told Buckley they were going a journey
on which he must accompany them. The start was soon afterwards made,
the men in front with Buckley in the middle between them, the women,
carrying the baggage, following at a little distance. The blacks were
all watchful that their captive should not escape them, and marched
along in silence until a river (now called the Barwon) was reached.
After a while they forded the river, and on the other side of it
entered on a marshy plain, where Buckley, to his great dismay, detected
the forms of numbers of natives moving about among the scrub. On seeing
him and his captors, whom they evidently expected, fully one hundred
natives emerged and steered towards them. Presently Buckley, quivering
from head to foot with anxiety for his future safety, was closely
regarded by their enquiring and interested looks, while his rescuers
told with a great deal of volubility the story of their wonderful
discovery.</p>

<p>This introduction to the tribe was a trying ordeal to the runaway
convict, but at length his fears were in a measure allayed when he
noticed that no blood-thirsty passions seemed to be awakened in their
black breasts by the recital. He was soon conducted to the native
encampment. This was on a rising ground, and consisted of a number of
rude bark-and-bough dwellings, built in similar manner to those already
described in which he had previously lodged. Besides these, there were
other shelters in the camp which gave no protection at all on top, they
were merely boughs and bark heaped up to a yard or so in height to
form a screen or shelter of a semicircular form, and might properly be
described as 'break winds,' for they were nothing more. Before each of
these primitive structures was a little fire, notwithstanding that the
day was rather warm, for the aborigines were partial to heat, and also
never neglected to keep the domestic cinders in readiness for a chance
broil.</p>

<p>Buckley's first friends in the tribe made signs for him to be seated,
but being still distrustful he kept standing in order that he might
the better watch the movements of the others, and guard against any
treachery. While thus on the <i>qui vive</i>, he witnessed a disturbance
among some of the women who had gone to the marsh to dig for roots. In
this occupation they used poles about five feet long, which were burnt
to a hard round point at one end. These implements, so necessary in
pulling up tubers, were now diverted from their proper and peaceful
purpose and used as weapons&mdash;and dangerous ones too&mdash;in an all round
fight that had begun in a squabble about dividing the roots. The men,
however, did not allow the combat to continue, but rushing to the spot
soon stopped the fray in no gentle manner, and drove their quarrelling
mates to their respective mia-mias. The roots collected were directly
afterwards thrown on the smouldering ashes of the several fires, and
taken off to be eaten when they were warmed not quite through.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Katta.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>Buckley was regaled with this food and found it very palatable,
resembling a sweet carrot, as near as he could tell. It was the
first cooked vegetable food he had tasted since he had run away
from the settlement so many months ago. He ravenously ate his fill
notwithstanding his latent fears, and his black benefactors deemed
highly gratified at his doing so well.</p>

<p>When he could eat no more, the whole tribe gathered around him and
began to manifest signs of great excitement. He could not understand
whether sorrow or joy was the cause of it. Perhaps it might be
described as extravagant joy at recovering him whom they thought to be
dead and lost to them for ever, coupled with intense sorrow for the
awful and unknown suffering he must have undergone, in that bourne
whence no traveller is supposed to return.</p>

<p>Their feelings, congratulatory and condolatory, were expressed in
savage fashion by what might be called the ceremony of self-infliction.
The men wildly beat their breasts, and hammered their heads with heavy
clubs, the violent genuineness of their grief being made evident by
the loud thuds which were very clearly audible. The women gave vent
to their feelings by demoniacal shrieks, and by each pulling out her
own hair in handfuls, and by other equally mad actions. These striking
demonstrations were mingled with moanings and bewailings and were
continued for some time, even until many seemed quite giddy and dazed
with the blows and injuries which they had inflicted upon themselves.</p>

<p>At length, much to Buckley's mental comfort, the ceremony ended, and
the participators in it, much the worse for the performance, dispersed,
and sought retirement in the shade of their rude shelters, where they
soon were engaged in recouping and refreshing themselves with roasted
roots. Buckley was left with the people who had discovered him, and the
whole tribe settled down into a state of domestic quietude.</p>

<p>Towards evening, however, the peaceful scene was again changed, and a
great deal of bustling and hurrying to and fro told the apprehensive
Buckley of preparations for something on a large scale, probably, he
thought, the carrying out of one of their savage customs in which he
would be the central figure; perhaps they were going to offer him as a
sacrifice to some blood-thirsty deity; perhaps they would now change
their vegetarian diet of the day and regale themselves with roast
Englishman for supper.</p>

<p>The young people of both sexes busied themselves in gathering together
broken wood and bark into a huge heap. When the darkness of night had
settled over the camp, this pile was lighted, and soon flared up into
an enormous bonfire. Buckley, on seeing this, withdrew and ensconced
himself in his friend's mia-mia; but his two custodians followed
him into his retreat, and led him forth towards the blazing mass
accompanied by all the women of the tribe. In trembling suspense, for
he half believed the hour for roasting him had now come, he intently
watched every movement around him. The women then seated themselves by
the flaring pile, and its bright glare revealed to him that they were
innocent of any kind of clothing, though each one had a furred skin
or small rug rolled up in her hand. Presently from the surrounding
darkness outside the environs of the camp, came the men carrying clubs
about two feet long, and with pipeclay plentifully bedaubed over their
naked bodies. On some the pipeclay was only smeared here and there so
as almost to cover their black skins; but others were 'got up' quite
artistically&mdash;round the eyes, down each cheek, along the nose, and so
on to points meeting at the chin; other streaks again ran fantastically
over the body and down each leg. The runaway convict could not have
been more horrified had a number of skeletons suddenly sprung up in
front of him.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/The Kuri Dance.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>The women, at the approach of their lords, stretched the rugs, skin
side up, tight across their knees, and thus improvised a sort of drum.
One of the old men sat himself in front and led them in chanting
and playing a monotonous kind of music, in which the men joined by
knocking their clubs one against the other in time with the singing.
The ears of Buckley, just from the quietude of his lonely life, were
not yet adapted to catch the air of such wild strains, and, instead of
appreciating the <i>ensemble</i>, he considered it to be a frightful din.
By-and-bye the master of the drum and voice band, took upon himself
to conduct the whole of the ceremonies, and at his pleasure, and with
seeming ease and an air of authority, kept the entire mob of men,
women, boys, and girls, playing, dancing, and marching backwards and
forwards for fully three hours, in a manner that would have satisfied
the most fastidious admirer of a theatrical <i>corps de ballet</i>. The
culmination of this wild fantastical display of leg, arm, and lung
power, was reached by the actors in it giving three tremendous shouts
and simultaneously raising their clubs towards the heavens. They then
rushed towards Buckley and surrounded him, beating their breasts the
while, apparently as a token of friendliness.</p>

<p>These agreeable greetings both surprised and relieved the helpless
white man, and made him feel much safer than he had previously felt,
and, moreover, engendered some thoughts of gratitude towards those
who had discovered him and rescued him from his desolateness and slow
starvation.</p>

<p>The company now separated and went towards their several mia-mias,
leaving him with his four friendly guardians, who soon followed their
example. He ate of more roots which they handed him, and then sought
slumber on some dried twigs and grass which were laid for him in a
sheltered spot. Very necessary repose soon settled on him, and the
morning was well advanced ere he awoke, very much refreshed in body and
reassured in mind.</p>

<p>No traces of the previous night's orgie could he detect. All was as
calm as anyone could wish, each man and woman being engaged in some
peaceful pursuit. One of his custodians was sent off early in the day
with a message to a neighbouring tribe on business connected with
himself, so he was given to understand by their signs. The other
strolled with Buckley down to the river side where some of the men were
engaged in fishing.</p>

<p>It would have done our old friend the gentle Isaac Walton good to have
seen the adroitness with which they handled their very rude appliances,
for luring to destruction the finny inhabitants of the water. The bait
they used was large earth worms, which were strung on pieces of long
grass fixed at the end of a length of elastic bark. This primitive line
was tied to a rough rod and dropped into the stream; the want of a hook
being made up for by the dexterity of the aboriginal angler, who, when
he had a good bite, jerked the line adroitly on the bank, and as the
fish generally kept a tenacious hold for a moment, it was almost always
successfully landed. Shortly afterwards Buckley saw the natives fishing
for eels at night, with the aid of a torch to attract the fish, and the
haul then made was larger than any he witnessed during daytime. On the
present occasion several fine specimens were captured, and portions of
these, after being cooked on the embers of his companion's domestic
fire, supplied Buckley with a most delicious repast.</p>

<p>All the blacks he now came across evinced good feeling towards him,
and he on his part endeavoured to keep up the friendly relationship
and make himself useful to them. In this spirit he gallantly assisted
the women in fetching water, carrying wood, and in other ways
domestic&mdash;proceedings which, no doubt, surprised the whole camp,
and might even have shaken their belief in his being their quondam
associate, for it was very exceptional to see one of the male sex
employed in such drudgery. The aboriginal 'lords of creation' usually
expended their energies during peaceful periods in 'pot hunting,' and
this, owing to the bounty of nature in the district where Buckley was
placed, was not an arduous occupation. The principal diet provided
by the hunters at this time was the flesh of the opossum. It was
substantial, though tough and only half cooked, but these being the
only 'square meals' he had partaken of, except fish and tree-grubs,
since running away from his prison home, he relished them exceedingly.</p>

<p>Numbers of the animal that afforded Buckley such gustatory
gratification had their abode in the branches of some large trees which
grew by the river side. In shape, they reminded him of a large cat,
and, indeed, the resemblance is a good one in many respects, only that
the tail of an opossum is longer and thicker, and is often used by its
owner to catch at a branch and hang by, whereas the swinging of poor
puss would cause her considerable pain.</p>

<p>One morning Buckley stole away to the river for the purpose of having a
bath and a swim in private, but his black friends missed him and were
soon on his heels. In returning he saw, for the first time, a native
after an opossum. The animal was hidden in a hollow high up in a gum
tree, their usual place of daily ensconcement, and the huge trunk was
marked with many small scratches made at different times, by various
animals in going up and coming down. But the sharp-eyed black-fellow
at once detected some very recent ascending claw-marks. These were
a sufficient guide for him, and with a stone hatchet in one hand he
essayed to reach the animal's lofty retreat.</p>

<p>First he cut in the bark of the tree at about a yard from the ground a
notch, in which he put his big toe, and pulled himself up; then, after
making a second notch, he lifted himself up further in a similar way;
a third time he did the same, and so on again and again, embracing
the tree with one arm, while with the other he wielded his primitive
hatchet, and made notches to receive the ball of his big toe, on which
he rested and mounted until he had climbed the great long straight
trunk and was on a level with the opossum. Then he examined the decayed
branches and other portions near him, and seeming satisfied that his
prey was inside at the bottom of a hollow, he quickly chopped through
the bark and wood; and sure enough brought to light a blinking opossum,
holding it by the tail, and before it could bite or scratch him had
bashed its head against the tree, and then flung the stunned animal
from the giddy height to the ground.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Climbing a Tree.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>While Buckley was wholly engrossed in the doings of the agile
black-fellow up the tree, a slight commotion was occasioned among
his companions by the return of the messenger, whom we have said
was sent out on the day after Buckley's arrival among them. He was
accompanied by a strange native, who, it turned out, was the bearer of
an invitation from the tribe visited. The whole of Buckley's friends
therefore left their mia-mias, and after travelling a few miles came up
to the other tribe. It was the tribe to which had belonged the fallen
warrior whose spear Buckley had appropriated.</p>

<p>The object of the meeting was soon completed. Buckley was given over
to the strangers to take up the position occupied in the tribe by
his supposed predecessor when in the flesh. A man, a woman, and a
youth, claimed relationship as a brother, sister-in-law, and nephew,
respectively, and took him under their special charge. Everybody seemed
friendly, and amid the general rejoicing which ensued Buckley was led
up to the family mia-mia, where the fatted calf, or rather opossum, was
roasted.</p>

<p>Like the prodigal in the parable, Buckley was also provided with soft
raiment, to wit, an opossum rug or cloak. He was highly gratified in
receiving it at their hands, and its warm fur made him feel quite
comfortable. He noticed that many other of the cloaks worn in the camp
were each of a single kangaroo hide, with the portion that had covered
the animal's hind legs brought over the wearer's left shoulder, and
fastened with a bone pin. Such cloaks were far inferior to his handsome
and richly-tinted furred one, and being more easy to make, were more
numerous.</p>

<p>In manufacturing the opossum-skin cloaks, the natives displayed a good
deal of skill and also patience, for the collecting together of the
number of small skins requisite in a comfortable cloak took some time.
When stripped from the carcasses, the skins were freed from all hanging
bits of flesh by cutting and scraping with shells and sharp stones,
and then laid out to dry, either pegged on the ground in the sun, or
stretched on pieces of bark before the ordinary fire. Preparatory to
sewing them together, lines were scratched across each skin to make
it more pliable. A fish-bone, deftly handled as an awl, served the
aboriginal tailor or tailoress in place of a needle, and the thread
used was generally the sinews of the tail of the kangaroo, which were
always carefully drawn out and dried for such use whenever that animal
was killed. The finishing touches to the cloak were given by daubing
the inside with red-ochre.</p>

<p>It might be mentioned <i>en passant</i> that the opossum skin after being
clipped and coloured makes at the present day a valuable commercial
commodity, mantles made up of it being largely sold as imitation
seal-skin. And further, that kangaroo-tail sinews are preferred to the
finest silken threads by the leading English surgeons.</p>

<p>Buckley wore the extremely welcome gift <i>á la mode
d'aborigènes</i>&mdash;fastened at the neck and drawn with thongs so as to
leave the right arm free for action. Attired thus, he, no doubt, looked
very imposing, if not the <i>beau ideal</i> of a savage chief. Not to be
outdone in generosity he reciprocated by throwing his own threadbare
convict-jacket over the shoulders of his black sister-in-law. The fact
of it being almost as full of holes as a colander did not prevent the
dusky Venus from showing that she was highly delighted at receiving it.
And the others manifested almost as much pleasure at witnessing this
first evidence of friendliness on Buckley's part.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI_FIGHTING_AND_HUNTING" id="CHAPTER_VI_FIGHTING_AND_HUNTING">CHAPTER VI.&mdash;FIGHTING AND HUNTING.</a></h2>

<p>THE TWO TRIBES&mdash;NATIVE BATTLE&mdash;WOMAN SLAIN&mdash;BURNING THE CORPSE&mdash;HUNTING
THE KANGAROO&mdash;THE WILD TURKEY AND THE EMU&mdash;NATIVE WEAPONS.</p>


<p>BUCKLEY now recognised that his lot was thrown in with the natives,
if not for the remainder of his natural life, at any rate for an
indefinite period, and he therefore determined in his mind to
propitiate them as much as lay in his power, to become as one of them,
and in so doing gain the confidence of all.</p>

<p>The tribe that had brought Buckley to his supposed kinsmen next
proceeded to erect some temporary shelters, having apparently decided
to make the visit last over the night. Each head of a family got the
material for his mia-mia by first finding a tree with bark on it
suitable for his purpose; then by the aid of his rude stone tomahawk he
deftly stripped the tree of its covering, and soon had the wherewithal
to build a temporary home for himself and domestic belongings.</p>

<p>The two tribes, following the usual precautionary custom of the natives
of not camping together promiscuously, had formed themselves into
separate groups some thirty or forty yards apart at nearest points.</p>

<p>The night passed peacefully. But very early next morning a great
tumult aroused Buckley from a sweet dream of peace, and he found to
his great surprise that both sides were at violent loggerheads. The
tremendous blustering grew hotter and hotter until at length it vented
itself in more active hostilities. On seeing the turn affairs had
taken, Buckley's new relatives, with careful solicitude for his safety,
withdrew with him to an eminence a short distance off. Here he had a
good view of everything that happened.</p>

<p>The belligerents on both sides rushed for every available shelter
behind shrub and tree, and from their cover glared hatefully,
threatened loudly, and awaited an opportunity to do execution with
their spears. Presently, as the tension increased, the threatenings
ceased, and almost a silence prevailed as each party cautiously sought
to draw the other from its vantage ground. At length a spear was
thrown, and this was the signal for a general engagement. They all
came out of cover, and for a few minutes the spears literally darkened
the air, so quickly were they hurled from one side to the other.
Never did Buckley see so much lissomness displayed in any battle he
had been in. Every spear, so accurately was it thrown, seemed to make
for its mark with a deadly certainty; but yet no one was touched, so
keen was the perception and judgment of time on the part of all of the
combatants. How they could avoid being hit and at the same time carry
on activities, he could not understand. The way each one dodged the
weapon of his opponent by nimbly jumping aside, or warding it off with
the narrow shield of thin wood or bark carried in his left hand, was
simply marvellous.</p>

<p>This continued for about half an hour, neither side appearing to get
the best of the other, till a well-aimed spear struck a man belonging
to Buckley's new tribe in the thigh and remained embedded in it. He
fell to the ground, and was dragged into the scrub by one of his
friends. A woman was next hit, the weapon striking her under the
upraised arm, and killing her instantaneously.</p>

<p>The spear-throwing then ceased; and the side which considered it had
gained the victory, rent the air with a hoarse shout, and closed in
upon its opponents, club in hand. But the battle was now practically
over. A few red-hot members banged each other over their tough heads,
but did not do much harm beyond cracking a skull or two, and raising
several hard lumps. The others soon interposed and stopped these fiery
combatants, and peace once more smiled upon the scene.</p>

<p>Both sides then went their several ways, leaving only about twenty of
Buckley's party in possession of the field. The wounded man now had the
spear drawn out of his leg, and did not appear much the worse for the
mishap, although to Buckley such a wound would seem serious enough to
entitle a man to at least a few weeks in a hospital to recover.</p>

<p>The company now collected together a quantity of wood and bark, and
heaped it up into a pile. On this they placed the corpse of the woman
who had been slain in the fray. They then applied a fire-stick to it
and set the whole mass into flames. When the body was sufficiently
cremated, they raked the embers of the fire together over what remained
of the dead body; then into the mound thus formed they stuck upright
the long digging stick with which the deceased used to dig up the
roots. No ceremony was performed over the grave, and not the slightest
display of feeling was manifested by any of the males, although the
women uttered a low mournful wail, but this did not last any time. She
was only a woman, and, as among all savage tribes, was not considered
of much importance in the body politic. Had a man been killed, the
mourning would have been considerable, the whole welkin would have rung
with their howls of lamentation.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the remaining blacks took their departure, leaving
there only Buckley's supposed relatives and another family. The
ex-convict felt some satisfaction on being left with only these two
small families, as his very recent experience of large numbers was to
him not at all conducive to a peaceful frame of mind. If their conduct
on that occasion was their usual style of expressing a neighbourly
feeling, he would greatly prefer to live in seclusion with a single
family, than with a tribe that was on visiting terms with any others.</p>

<p>He felt his own weakness in his new surroundings, notwithstanding his
being a member of a superior race and trained to the use of arms. He
feared that should he become involved in one of their quarrels he would
stand but a poor chance against the rapidly and skilfully-thrown spear
of a native warrior. His burly and slow-moving body would be a better
mark than any afforded by his black companions. In a hand to hand fight
with musket and bayonet he could have taken a dozen of them armed
likewise; but with their weapons, or against their weapons, he could
never hope to do anything either as an aggressor or in defence.</p>

<p>The two families now removed further into the bush, and erected their
mia-mias for a lengthened sojourn. Buckley was here made acquainted
with some of the more peaceful habits of his black friends. Near
the place where they were encamped was a considerable number of
kangaroos&mdash;animals, which on his first beholding them, filled him with
amazement. Such an animal he had never heard of, and its ungainly
appearance and peculiar way of hopping on its enormous hind legs
awakened his curiosity to the utmost. When one of the party, his
self-appointed brother by the way, cautiously sallied forth to spear
one, he watched anxiously for the result, and observed every movement
of the hunter and his unsuspecting prey.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Spearing a Kangaroo.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>The native carried in his hand a smooth sharp-pointed spear, about
seven feet in length, made out of a ti-tree sapling. It was balanced at
the butt end with about two feet of the stalk of a grass tree. He also
had with him the indispensable wommera, or throwing-stick: a piece of
wood, three-quarters of an inch thick, about thirty inches long, and
two or three inches broad in the centre, but tapering off at one end
into a long rough handle, and at the other into a hook or projection in
front.</p>

<p>A herd of kangaroos were quietly grazing a short distance off. He
stealthily approached them from the leeward, out of consideration for
the sensitive olfactory nerves of the animals, for if they had scented
him they would have been out of shot in a twinkling.</p>

<p>When within sixty or seventy yards of a fine monarch of the forest,
the black hunter suddenly and deftly fixed the butt end of his spear
against the hook or projection of his throwing-stick, somewhat in the
same manner as an arrow in a crossbow. The wommera or throwing-stick
thus answered the purpose of an extra section to the arm, and, giving
additional leverage, tremendously increased the power of propulsion
of that member. In another moment his arm was upraised well over the
shoulder, and out sped the light and quivering spear upon its deadly
mission. So swift and truly was the weapon aimed, and so well had the
animal been stalked, that it met its death almost before it realised
the dangerous proximity of its human enemy.</p>

<p>The carcase was pounced upon by the party, and soon skinned and hacked
to pieces. Portions were then placed upon the embers of a fire, and one
black officiated as cook, expertly using two short sticks as a pair
of tongs to pick up coals and drop them upon the frizzling viands as
occasion required. The daintiest bits, such as heart, liver, kidneys,
and the other portions of the viscera were hurriedly grilled and eaten
by the men, while the more substantial parts were being done more
leisurely. The tail also was regarded as a very choice portion, and
received considerable attention in the cooking operation. The hair was
singed off, and the tough sinews, so valuable in a variety of ways
to the natives, were carefully drawn out to be dried for future use.
Prepared in this fashion the juices were all retained, and the meat
when cooked was very savoury and nutritious.</p>

<p>The skull and bones of the beast were broken open, and the brains and
marrow contained in them were roasted, and eaten with great gusto as
specially toothsome morsels.</p>

<p>What a feast they had! Buckley thought they would never have done
eating. They gorged and gorged, at first ravenously, and then more
leisurely, till their stomachs visibly distended. At last they had no
room for more, and perforce were compelled to lie down to sleep off the
effects. He could only compare their condition to that of the state of
stupor resulting from a long-continued drunken bout. In this delightful
condition they remained for hours.</p>

<p>Buckley's next experience in the hunting field happened a few days
later when he witnessed the capture of a wild turkey. His nephew was
the hero of the chase on this occasion. The <i>modus operandi</i> pursued,
which was very clever, was as follows:&mdash;The youth first caught a large
moth, and with it in his hand crawled from the clump of trees where
they were encamped, over to several clusters of grass tussocks growing
a little distance off on an expansive open space, where several wild
turkeys or bustards were quietly feeding. Arriving there unobserved by
the wary birds, he fixed the moth upon a prominent reed, and dropped
down under cover to await results.</p>

<p>He must have been a lineal descendant of Job, for he lay there
patiently for hours, the moth all the time quivering and fluttering,
and making strenuous endeavours to break loose. At last the curiosity
or cupidity of one of the birds was aroused, and it shyly came up to
see what was the matter. It approached closer and closer till the moth
was almost within gobbling distance. Now was the cunning native's
chance. With stick in hand, to which was attached a slip noose made
of twisted fibres, he awaited the victim of curiosity. The bird,
open-mouthed, stretched out to engulph the insect. Its greed was its
destruction. Just at the same moment, with a rapidity and dexterity
perfectly astounding to one of Buckley's stolid nature, the noose was
thrown round its neck, and the blacks had another and a more sumptuous
dish added to their larder.</p>

<p>The blacks shortly afterwards had an opportunity of trying their skill
against that feathered monarch of the Australian forest&mdash;the emu. Like
the turkey bustard, it also proved to be very shy and difficult of
approach, and they had to exercise the utmost caution in order to get
within spear-throwing distance. The slightest strange sound, or the
sight of an advancing man would be the signal for the birds to cut and
run&mdash;and with amazing swiftness.</p>

<p>To circumvent them, therefore, the huntsman adopted the ruse of
procuring a bushy bramble sufficiently large to conceal his whole form
from the vigilance of the bird. Behind this leafy sheltering screen
he went forth on his stalking expedition. Pausing every now and then
to allay any latent suspicions, should the bird have any at seeing a
moving tree coming towards it, he gradually crept up till within range.
Once there the death of the emu was a certainty. Its fat, oily flesh
was, of course, discussed in their usual able manner. The large bird's
hair-like feathers were set apart to be used as dress material.</p>

<p>These were indeed halcyon days for Buckley. The two families wandered
about within a short radius. Food was plentiful, and they therefore
fared well. The weather also was everything that one could wish for.
How long this lasted Buckley knew not, but the time passed vary
agreeably with him.</p>

<p>He felt a new interest in life. A desire was awakened in him to learn
all he could of the habits of these strange people. Day by day he
learned more of them. He also found himself dropping almost insensibly
into their ways and becoming as one of them.</p>

<p>The blacks noticed this, and showed their gratification by presenting
him with a stone hatchet and a couple of spears. These implements,
though necessarily of rude workmanship, were greatly valued by the
blacks, and cost them much labour and perseverance to manufacture. The
hatchet or tomahawk, which was almost always in use, was very hard
stone split somewhat in the shape of a wedge, and ground to a rough
edge. It was most firmly fixed in its handle, two strong flat pieces
of wood, by means of fibres of bark, tendons of animals, and a strong
coating of cement made of gum and powdered mussel shells.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Tomahawks.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>One of the spears given to him was of the kind used chiefly for killing
game. This has already been described in our account of the killing
of the kangaroo. The other spear was a longer and a heavier one, and
used only against their human enemies. It was nine feet long and made
of iron-bark sapling. His appearance now was truly formidable, dressed
as he was in an opossum skin robe and thus armed. But although all
that could be desired in appearance, he was very far from having the
necessary skill to use his weapons effectively against the veriest tyro
among the natives.</p>

<p>Here it may not be out of place to describe the various weapons of
offence and defence possessed by Buckley's present companions, and
their country-men generally. They were of a great variety of shapes and
sizes, and each man took particularly good care of his own, as much
time and trouble had to be expended in their manufacture with the very
primitive appliances available for his use. In addition to the spears
of the kinds just mentioned, they had a very formidable kind about
fifteen feet long. Some of these were jagged for a foot from the point
with bits of sharp flint or bones of an animal fixed in the shaft by
means of gum and cement, or a row of teeth cut in the solid wood in
a manner that suggested a refinement of cruelty on the part of their
owners.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Spears.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>Many shapes and weights of shillelahs, or waddies, used in hand-to-hand
conflicts as skull-crackers were also carried. Some of these were
carefully fashioned, others were merely a young ti-tree pulled up by
the roots and cut to a handy size, with the root forming the <i>nob</i> or
business end. Some ended in a sharp point, and thus combined, in one
weapon, the advantages of a club and a heavy blunt dagger.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Clubs.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>Perhaps the most dangerous weapon in skilful hands for a close-quarter
fight was the leangle, an instrument made of heavy hardwood, straight
for about two and a half feet and then curved for about nine inches
at almost a right angle to the shaft or handle. In appearance it was
somewhat like a wooden pick.</p>

<p>Lighter weapons like walking sticks, straight and crooked, were used
as missiles, either to be thrown at enemies or to bring down birds or
small animals.</p>

<p>The most curious of all their weapons was the boomerang,* a blade
of tough grained wood varying from somewhat like a crescent-shaped
leaf to the outline of an obtuse angle. The commonest of them was a
wooden blade bluntly edged all round, of irregular thickness, one side
flat, the other rounded. In extreme length they were about two feet;
in direct line from end to end, about 20 inches, and had an average
breadth of two and a quarter inches. They were also twisted throughout
their length as though they had been slightly bent, as though strong
hands had taken them at the ends and pulled and pushed contrary ways.
The battle boomerangs were larger and much heavier, and without this
peculiar twist, and did not possess the power of returning to their
throwers, which has made the lighter sort the most widely known of
all Australian weapons. A weapon more simple in appearance could
scarcely be imagined, yet it might be said to be one of the most useful
possessed by the blacks.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Boomerangs.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>


<p style="margin-left:5%">
[* The boomerang is a paradox in missile power. There are two kinds
of boomerangs, that which is thrown a distance ahead, and that which
returns on its own axis to the thrower. I saw a native of slight
frame throw one of them two hundred and ten yards, and much further
when a <i>ricochet</i> was permitted. With the latter he made casts truly
surprising to witness. The weapon, after skimming breast high nearly
out of sight, suddenly rose high into the air, and returning with
amazing velocity towards it owner, buried itself six inches in the
turf within a few yards of his feet. An enemy or quarry ensconced
behind a tree safe from spear, may be taken in the rear and severely
hurt or killed by the recoil of the boomerang. The emu or kangaroo are
stunned or disabled, not knowing how to avoid its eccentric gyrations;
amongst a flight of wild ducks just rising from the water, or a flock
of pigeons on the ground, this weapon commits great havoc. At close
quarters it becomes no bad substitute for a cutlass.<br><br>

Sir Thomas Mitchell, on observing the motion of the boomerang in the
air whirling round a hollow centre, and leaving a vacant centre of
gravity, was struck with the idea of adopting its principle to the
propulsion of ships, and, if I mistake not, he received in 1848 a
patent for the invention. <i>The Times</i>, September 29th, 1852, contains
an extract from a Sydney journal stating that the "Boomerang Propeller"
had been fitted to a small steamer, and obtained a speed of twelve
knots against a head wind.&#8212;COLONEL MONDAY.<br><br>

Sir Thomas Mitchell was most enthusiastic in his admiration of the
weapons of the aborigines. In a lecture on the boomerang propeller,
which was delivered before the "Australian Society," on December 30th,
1850, he says:&#8212;"But it is in the use of such missiles and clubs that
these children of nature show how well they know her laws. By means
of the wommera, or throwing-stick, the spear is thrown with greater
momentum, and, of course, increased velocity. The angular club, the
rotary shield, the elastic handle of the stone hatchet all appear very
original, but yet strictly consistent with whatever science teaches,
and not susceptible of improvement by anything to be learned at
colleges.<br><br>

"The missiles are nicely adapted to resist the laws of gravitation. The
boomerang is one of the most remarkable of these. Its flight through
the air from the hand of an Australian native seems in strict obedience
to his will. In its return after a varied course to the foot of the
thrower, this weapon seems so extraordinary that a Vice-President of
the Royal Society observed to me, 'that its path through the air was
enough to puzzle a mathematician.'"<br><br>

<p>Such a remark from one of the ablest mathematicians of his time was
not forgotten. On the contrary, it was remembered on the next occasion
when I had opportunities of studying the flight of boomerangs thrown
by the hand of Australian aborigines, and then I perceived that in
its rotary motion through the air, a hollow centre of greater or less
diameter, but usually of about one-third of the disc, was described by
the whirling boomerang. The discovery of this centre, insignificant
as it may appear, was still something new, for on attaching a centre
to a boomerang, it was possible to show that this centre was not only
during its rotary motion the centre of that motion, but also a centre
of gravity when in a state of rest, while it was apart from and quite
clear of every part of it. Sir Thomas tried a number of experiments
with the weapon, the ultimate result of which is the boomerang
propeller.&#8212;Quoted from R. Brough Smith's work on the Aborigines.]</p>


<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Throw Sticks.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>For defence against the clubs of their enemies, the natives carried
heavy convex or bow-shaped shields about three feet long and very
narrow, being not more than six inches in the centre. They were very
hard and strong, and their handles were formed by hacking and chopping
a hole in the solid body of wood. A lighter and wider shield with a
handle made of another piece of wood, was used to ward off the spears
of their enemies.</p>

<p>A KANGAROO BATTLE&mdash;A NATIVE PANTOMIME&mdash;A BLACK LOTHARIO&mdash;A NATIVE
DUEL&mdash;MIDNIGHT ASSASSINATION&mdash;A BURIAL&mdash;<i>LEX TALIONIS</i>&mdash;A CURIOUS DUEL.</p>


<p>These peaceful wanderings amidst the lonely glades of the bush were
brought to an abrupt termination by the two families falling in with a
tribe of about fifty individuals. The tribe was friendly towards them,
so they joined their forces, and travelled with it across the country
to meet another tribe.</p>

<p>In two or three days they came up with the people they were seeking,
or had appointed to meet. Preparations were then made for an extensive
raid upon the kangaroos, which ware grazing in large herds upon the
lightly timbered plains in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The blacks divided their party, and placed themselves at several
vantage points on the confines of the forest, so as to hem in the
animals on all sides. They then began making a most horrible din by
beating the bushes and yelling vociferously in order to scare their
timid prey; and gradually closing in the while, at length forced a
considerable number of them into close quarters, whence there was no
escape. Then the work of destruction among the entrapped animals took
place. Spear and waddy were both brought into requisition, and the spot
was converted into a veritable shambles. Some of the marsupials ran
into the scrub, and this being set on fire for the purpose of scaring
them out, they soon shared the fate of the others.</p>

<p>The jubilant hunters returned to the camping-ground literally groaning
under the weight of the spoils of the chase. Their better halves,
during their absence, had not been idle, and in anticipation of the
results, had busied themselves in preparing ovens for a grand roast.</p>

<p>These ovens were made by digging large circular holes in the earth,
and spreading good-sized stones completely over the bottom, on which
they lighted fierce fires, and kept them burning till their lords and
masters brought home the game. The burning logs and branches were then
quickly taken out, and the carcases laid on the heated stones. The
smaller animals were put in entire and unskinned, but the larger ones
were cut up in pieces. Over them were then spread leaves, branches, and
sheets of bark to keep in the heat, with the burning logs and embers
replaced on top of all. In these excellent ovens the provisions were
cooked in a style that would gratify the palate of a gourmand. Then
a great feast followed, in which all the blacks joined with hearty
goodwill and tremendous appetite.*</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
[* Mr. Peter Beveridge, who had many years' personal contact with
the natives, thus describes the way they conducted themselves on the
opportunity offering itself:&mdash;<br><br>

"When food is plentiful they feast and riot to the top of their savage
hearts, gorging themselves (as certainly none of the brute creation do)
until their abdominal regions become so distended as to be decidedly
uncomfortable. Not being so learned in medicine as Heliogabalus was,
they do not avail themselves of the relief offered by emetics. To
remove their discomfort, however, they lay themselves prone on the
ground, face downwards, and get women suffering less from repletion
than themselves, to roll up and down on their bodies until the desired
end is gained, either by expulsion or extension. When the happy result
is successfully achieved, they commence to gorge again, and continue
doing so until the rolling process is once more found necessary to
animal comfort; and this continues just so long as the feast lasts."]</p>
<br>


<p>After they had somewhat slept off the effects of their gluttony, some
hilarious spirits among them got up a species of entertainment, which
evoked much merriment. It was supposed to represent the kangaroo
hunt&mdash;a kind of pantomime, mimicking the stirring events of the day. As
with a modern troupe of stage actors, they spared no pains to make the
representation realistic&mdash;to hold the mirror up to nature.</p>

<p>Their preparations included greasing their bodies all over with the
fat of the animals, and then plentifully bedaubing themselves with a
sort of red ochre. Some small branches were fixed to their girdles in
imitation of tails, and then the fun began. Those with the tails hopped
about the camp like a scared herd of kangaroos, the tails sticking
out, and their peculiar attitudes having a most comical effect; while
those personating the hunters followed them closely, hallooing and
gesticulating wildly so they pretended to spear them.</p>

<p>Buckley was no less amused than his black companions, and laughed as
loud as any of them.</p>

<p>The jollity of the evening gave place next morning to proceedings of
quite an opposite character. When Buckley awoke he found the camps in
quite a commotion, and the two tribes haranguing each other violently.
He gathered, as well as the imperfect knowledge of the language he had
by this time acquired could reveal to him, that a gay Lothario of one
tribe had kidnapped the wife of a member of the other tribe, or else
had persuaded her to elope from her liege lord. The guilty pair had
been discovered&mdash;hence the tumult.</p>

<p>The injured one demanded satisfaction and the restitution of his
property. The abductor refused to do the latter, and was quite willing
to oblige him as to the former; in fact he seemed rather inclined to
have recourse to the arbitrament of blows and so settle the little
affair, and perhaps the husband at the same time. The interposition
of the tribes decided that the woman should return to her husband's
mia-mia, which she at once did.</p>

<p>The two men thereupon prepared for the fray, each arming himself
with a waddy and shield. They entered the lists courageously, being
well matched both in size and general strength. With shield and club
upraised over the head so as to form a protecting arch, they warily
advanced upon each other. The deeply-set eyes of both men glistened
beneath their shaggy beetling brows in an extremely vengeful manner,
which augured, it seemed to Buckley, a fatal termination to the fight.</p>

<p>The antagonists soon closed, and then blow after blow fell with
lightning rapidity. Their shields warded off many, but a sickening thud
heard every now and then betokened that they were both being severely
punished on head and shoulders. This hammer-and-tong business could not
last long, and they soon began to show signs of exhaustion. The blood
flowed freely from many wounds in the head and the upper portion of the
body.</p>

<p>When the tribes considered that each combatant had had enough for
one day, they interposed and separated them, and led them to their
different camps, each man looking dazed and half unconscious, and
reeling like a drunken man.</p>

<p>This duel revealed to Buckley the astonishing and marvellous thickness
of skull possessed by the people he was living with. He knew that any
one of the blows which had been showered with so little effect upon
their black heads, would have laid his own skull open, and so have
placed him <i>hors de combat</i> in one act.</p>

<p>The gay Lothario and his tribe shortly took their departure for fresh
hunting grounds. The injured husband, as soon as he had recovered a
little from his wounds, sought out his spouse and belaboured her with
his waddy in a manner that made Buckley's blood run cold, although
the rest of the encampment regarded the conjugal correction with
indifference.</p>

<p>The sequel to this love escapade took place a night or two after. The
fires had all gone out, and the whole camp was buried in deep slumber,
when suddenly a loud cry awakened every one. Each man clutched his
spear, and rushed to the spot whence the alarm had come. Buckley was
one of the first there, and, by the aid a fire-stick he had snatched
up, beheld the lately aggrieved husband transfixed through the body
with a spear. The poor fellow was writhing in a death agony. They
tried to pull the spear out, but could not, as the weapon was barbed
for about six inches from the point. He lingered on till morning, when
death put an end to his excruciating sufferings.</p>

<p>His wife had disappeared; and this fact told to the blacks the whole
story. It was clearly a case of murder and elopement or abduction.</p>

<p>The friends of the deceased showed much grief, and uttered frightful
imprecations against the vile assassin and all his relations.</p>

<p>Early in the day preparations were made for the funeral. The corpse
was taken in hand and bent almost round, the knees being tied close to
the neck, and the feet and hands brought together and fastened with
the arms straight alongside. Their reason for thus rolling up the body
and securing the limbs, Buckley afterwards learned, was to prevent the
ghost of the departed from arising and revisiting the glimpses of the
moon. For the blacks had a mortal dread of spirits, and they believed
that the spirit of a man recently dead would work them great harm if
he got the chance to break out of the tomb. The opossum rug, which
had been his covering by night and mantle by day, was now his shroud.
With this wrapped around him he was consigned to the grave&mdash;a hole dug
to the depth of three or four feet in the soft ground. Then his late
companions heaped up the earth over him to the height of two or three
feet, and placed logs on top to prevent the wild dogs from rooting up
the corpse.</p>

<p>During the ceremony of interment all his male relatives gashed their
heads with tomahawks and waddies till the blood streamed forth, and
smeared their faces and beards with pipeclay and mud. The women joined
in these expressions of deep affliction by scorching themselves on the
thigh and stomach with fire-sticks, and also by spreading mud all over
their heads. The mother of the dead man was especially demonstrative in
her grief, her moans and groans sounding horribly in Buckley ears. Her
lamentations were genuine, and for several nights afterwards he heard
her giving way to her feelings when by herself, after all the camp had
retired to rest.</p>

<p>Poor old woman, she was a miserable and most repulsive-looking specimen
of humanity. Her attenuated frame was shrunk almost to a skeleton, so
shrivelled and drawn was the skin across her crooked bones. She fared
worse than anyone in the tribe, being looked upon rather as a burden.
Her clothes consisted of an old dilapidated and worn-out opossum skin.
Almost blind and imbecile, none but the children seemed even to notice
her, or give her more than a passing thought. Her conduct to these was
kind and sympathetic, and she often rendered them such slight services
as was within the range of her limited powers. Her only requital was a
permission to live, or rather just to exist, upon the very refuse of
the food. But she took her hard lot as a matter of course, patiently
and uncomplainingly.</p>

<p>Several men of the tribe set out on the tracks of the murderer, but
returned before night without having accomplished their object. This
man, by his daring and dastardly conduct, had thus embroiled the two
tribes in an enmity only to be assuaged by the spilling of his blood or
the blood of one of his own tribe.</p>

<p>As Buckley afterwards learned, the blacks always held the whole tribe
responsible for the actions of any of its members. Blood for blood was
one of their laws, and if they could not bring the actual delinquent to
punishment they always endeavoured to wreak their vengeance upon any of
his relatives, father, brother or son, or failing them any of his tribe
would do; they were not very particular so long as they could in some
such way compensate themselves for the injury done.</p>

<p>It was some months before Buckley's party again came across the path
of this tribe, and then the trouble commenced anew. Spears, clubs and
boomerangs were brought into requisition and a great battle was fought,
at least from an aboriginal point of view. Revenge was satisfied by the
killing of the murderer's brother and the wounding of his mother, but
the actual culprit escaped unharmed.</p>

<p>Shortly after this vicarious sacrifice to justice or vengeance, Buckley
witnessed another duel between two men of his tribe. Like the other
affair of honour, it was brought about by the faithlessness of a woman,
or the jealousy of her husband, he knew not which.</p>

<p>The quarrel began in a wordy way, between a black, who was the lawful
owner of three wives, and a young spark who possessed none. The very
much married man opened warlike proceedings in a little while by
throwing his club towards the other and then bending his body down
with his hands on his knees, and in this attitude invited the other
to strike him on the head. The younger man picked up the club, raised
it in the air, and brought it down with considerable force on the
proffered skull. The blow caused the recipient to reel, but he soon
recovered, and then took up the club which the other man had flung on
the ground. Following the example of the elder, the younger man now
in turn postured himself with his head bent forward and received a
dose of the same medicine. This curious give-and-take dual lasted till
the younger man was felled with a blow that knocked him stiff. There
he lay for over an hour, and Buckley thought he was dead. But at the
end of that time he slowly sat up, and by the evening had completely
recovered, and what astonished Buckley more than anything, there did
not appear to be any malice borne between the two late antagonists.
In fact, like a couple of schoolboys after a bout of fisticuffs, they
seemed the better friends for the quarrel.</p>

<p>BUCKLEY'S BLACK WIFE&mdash;WOMAN'S POSITION&mdash;MARRIAGE CUSTOMS&mdash;BUCKLEY'S
FIRST FRIENDS MURDERED&mdash;KIDNEY FAT&mdash;BLIND BOY AND HIS
SISTER&mdash;INFANTICIDE&mdash;GENERAL TREATMENT OF CHILDREN&mdash;CURIOUS CEREMONIES.</p>


<p>BUCKLEY soon lost all notions of the time he had been living
with the natives. Indeed, it would have been rather remarkable,
all circumstances considered, had it happened otherwise. In the
circumscribed sphere in which they moved and lived and had their being,
one season brought about very much the same events as another, and thus
there was scarcely anything to mark the flight of time.</p>

<p>He gradually learned their language, much to the delight of his dusky
teachers, who watched his progress in it with great interest. His fears
for his own safety grew less and less, as he became more accustomed to
their habits. As time went on, and he knew the blacks better, he was
able to mingle with them on equal terms, and stood much the same chance
as they did in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>The family with whom he lived appears to have been of a very unsettled
disposition. They wandered about rather promiscuously, sometimes by
themselves, and at other times in company with one or more of the many
friendly tribes they happened to fall in with.</p>

<p>One day his bachelor life was brought to an abrupt end by the tribe
presenting him with a charming young widow as a wife. He says that he
was not consulted in the matter, and it is pretty certain that Mrs.
Buckley had no say in it either, for among the natives women had no
rights. They were simply regarded as chattels, and as such were bought,
sold, and exchanged by their parents or responsible guardians.</p>

<p>The usual custom followed, when a man wanted a wife, was for him to
exchange his sister or daughter for one. A native never married a
woman born in his own tribe; therefore, he generally sought a wife
from a neighbouring friendly tribe. The old men frequently had two or
three wives, while many young men had to be content with a bachelor
existence. There were no such things as old maids among the blacks,
for the men generally numbered about two to one of the women. Nor did
a widow wear her weeds longer than a week at the outside. She was
inherited by her husband's brother, or some other near relation of his,
who either took her into the bosom of his family, or exchanged her for
another woman. Perhaps if she was old and ugly, he parted with her as a
gift to a bachelor friend.</p>

<p>When a woman became so old and decrepit as to trammel the movements of
her husband's tribe, she not infrequently received a quietus in the
shape of a knock on the head with a waddy, just as we more civilized
people kill a dog whose existence has become a misery to himself and an
offence to us, or else was abandoned to her fate.*</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
[* Mr. Curr relates an instance which came under his own observation
where the natives placed an old woman on a pile of wood, and then set
fire to it, after doing which they all deserted the spot, and left the
poor helpless old body to burn slowly to death.]</p>
<br>

<p>One peculiarity of the blacks, in connection with their marriage
customs was very marked. They never, under any circumstances, married
blood relations. Indeed, such an idea would have been regarded with an
indignation amounting almost to horror. And to prevent the slightest
probability of a black committing such a heinous crime, in their eyes,
they had a system of dividing their tribes into classes. All people of
one class were counted as being connected by blood, and, therefore,
could not intermarry. Thus a man could not marry a woman belonging
to his father or his mother's class. Some scientists have noted this
custom, and infer from it that the blacks possessed knowledge of the
dangers of inbreeding; but they probably, like many other people in
this world, have tried to make out a case on insufficient grounds&mdash;the
scientifically coloured spectacles through which they have regarded
these ignorant savages, helping to deceive them.</p>

<p>Mothers-in-law, among us civilized folks, have been made the subjects
of much merriment, and are popularly held up as a class of beings to be
avoided on every possible occasion by the sterner sex. It is a strange
fact that the latter idea prevailed among the male portion of the
blacks, in so far as the avoidance of the mother-in-law is concerned;
and she, unlike her more aggressive white compeer, showed a singular
bashfulness in his presence. She would hide herself at his approach,
or, if she had to pass his way, endeavoured to cover herself with her
cloak and slink by unobserved; and it was only in extreme instances of
pressing necessity that they would open their lips to each other in
conversation.</p>

<p>Buckley appears to have lived with his black spouse for several months,
if not in a blissful dream of enchantment, at least contentedly.
She was distinctly an acquisition to him, as a wife always is to a
black-fellow, and Buckley was one practically by this time.</p>

<p>A woman's place in the domestic economy of the blacks was to do as she
was told and to ask no questions. When her lord and master went forth
in all the dignity of his majestic manhood, carrying his weapons, which
added not a little to his stately bearing, she humbly and laboriously
followed, bowed down by the weight of the family chattels contained in
a large grass bag slung across her shoulders. If she was a mother, her
last child was no mean addition to her load. Its fat chubby form could
be seen on her back, snugly ensconced within the folds of her opossum
skin cloak. In her right hand she usually carried a digging-stick about
her own length, with which she had to forage round for vegetables or
roots for the family larder. A lighted piece of bark or fire-stick
carried in the other hand was no uncommon appurtenance of her outfit
when the family were moving from one camping place to another. Failing
this fire-stick, to light a fire was a task requiring not a little
patience, especially if the weather was at all damp. The method pursued
was to rub two pieces of wood together till the friction produced a
spark sufficiently lively to be blown into a flame. It usually took
about a minute to do this, and the wood chosen was generally a flat
piece which was held firmly under his feet by the stooping native while
he rapidly twirled round between his palms a long pointed piece, which
he pressed against the other in a little indentation till the object
was accomplished.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Australian Mothers.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>Hard work and hard blows she received in abundance; her husband was
sparing only in the amount or quality of food he allowed her. All the
choicest portions he kept for himself and gorged to repletion. When
he had had enough then his wife might have her share, if there was
anything left for her to try her teeth upon. Consequent upon this
ill-treatment, and the early age at which they were married, the women
were for the most part undersized in proportion to the men, and soon
lost the very slight pretentions to good looks ever possessed by them.</p>

<p>A black-fellow never considered that his wife was a relation or that
she became one of his own tribe by her marrying into it. On her part,
most of her sympathies were with the tribe she had been born in. Her
husband was her master, and fear, more than love, inspired her conduct
towards him. His power over her was unlimited; within the domestic
circle he reigned supreme. The tribe never interfered between man and
wife. He could kill her it he so liked, although he seldom went so far
in his chastisement of a recalcitrant wife, not because his tribe would
prevent it, but because her relatives or some other members of her
tribe would take a bloody revenge upon him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her hard knocks she managed to live in some degree
happily with her better and more powerful half, after she had been
broken in to the duties and responsibilities of conjugal existence.</p>

<p>To return to Buckley and his wife in particular. As the old couplet
hath it:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:25%">
Needles and pins, needles and pins,<br>

When a man's married his trouble begins.</p>
<br>


<p>And Buckley's troubles began anew a few months after joining in the
holy bonds of matrimony with the young ("tolerably good looking, after
a fashion, and apparently mild tempered," as he describes her) widow.
Like Mr. Samuel Weller, whose matrimonial venture with a 'vidder'
turned out so unfortunately, Buckley was most abominably deceived,
though in a different manner.</p>

<p>One night when he had retired to his mia-mia with his dearly beloved,
there broke in upon their privacy several men of a neighbouring tribe,
and bore her away unresistingly; her willingness to go was so very
apparent to Buckley that he made no attempt to detain her.</p>

<p>Next day some <i>amour propre</i> on his part being aroused, perhaps by his
black friends' knowledge of what had been done, he went over to the
tribe to which the intruders belonged, and complained of his treatment.
His friends urged him to challenge the man who now had her in his
possession. But he declined, probably because, although he was rather
dense, he considered he was not quite thick enough in the skull to
resist the onslaught of a waddy.</p>

<p>However, he found someone to champion his cause in the person of
another of his tribe&mdash;a brother of her former husband. This man made
himself judge, jury, and executioner, by summarily felling her with
his waddy. The blow was so severe that she died soon afterwards from
its effects. Whether it was his intention to thus kill her, or merely
to punish her, Buckley knew not. A general scrimmage followed in which
many heads were broken.</p>

<p>Buckley took no part in the fight. With his usual caution he kept out
of harm's way, but was in readiness to defend himself should it be
necessary. He had now been for some time past quite an adept with the
spear and boomerang.</p>

<p>As in most of their battles little damage was done beyond a number
of ugly bruises and concussions, which would be soon healed, and no
lives were lost. The affair ended at last in peace being restored,
and to cement the renewal of friendly relations, both sides joined
their forces in a grand terpsichorean display in the shape of a large
corroboree.</p>

<p>A short time after this eventful incident in Buckley's chequered
career, he and his supposed brother-in-law and family, with another
family or two, detached themselves from their tribe, as had often
happened before, and set out on a wandering expedition on their
own account. It may be remarked that a tribe, or several families
constituting a tribe, did not keep together under the authority of
a leader or the compulsion of a majority. Each head of a family was
a free agent, and was at liberty to do as he liked, and go where he
liked, of course, within the recognised boundaries of his tribe or the
tribes with which it was on friendly terms. To go outside or beyond
these limits would be dangerous, and the adventurous man or family
would most certainly be killed for such temerity by the tribe upon
whose domain they had encroached. "Kill the Stranger" was the motto of
every black-fellow.</p>

<p>By the side of a flowing stream they settled down, and for many weeks
swimming, fishing and hunting, made the days pass pleasantly enough.
But this life was too peaceful to last long, and the quiet of their
existence was rudely dispelled by a horrible event unsurpassed in
Buckley's previous experience of the ways of his black companions.</p>

<p>They had retired to rest in their several mia-mias, and were all
soundly sleeping, save Buckley who had not taken the trouble to
construct a shelter for himself, but lay under the shadow and
protection of a fallen tree. Strangely troubled was he in his mind this
night. Curious forebodings of evil haunted his brain and kept him awake
and sensitive to the slightest sound.</p>

<p>The low fires, almost burnt out, cast their fitful flickering shadows
around, and these seeming to mingle in an indescribable manner with
the sighing of the wind and the humming of insect life, made Buckley
unnaturally nervous.</p>

<p>At length he began to doze, but an unexpected spluttering into life
of one of the smouldering logs awoke him again, and at the same time
revealed to his horrified gaze the forms of several painted and armed
savages just within the circle of light. Slight crackling sounds, as
of the breaking of twigs underfoot, betokened that others were close
in the rear. Their stealthy approach under the shield of the darkness
of night would have told him that theirs was no errand of peace, even
if the horrible expression of their visages, distorted with looks of
murderous intent, had not but too clearly depicted their awful mission.</p>

<p>He felt tongue-tied, paralysed, and unable to move hand or foot. His
sleeping friends slumbered on, but he was unable to raise the alarm and
warn them of the dangerous proximity of their foes. But even had he
been able it was now too late.</p>

<p>Within a moment a frightful yell arose from every throat as each black
raised his spear to plunge it into the body of the helpless victim
at his feet. But a poor resistance could be made. Before any one of
them could raise an arm in self-defence the cruel barbed weapon was
thrust savagely through his body, and where it failed to accomplish the
foul deed the heavy waddy was brought into requisition. The women and
children shared the same fate as the men; in the revolting massacre
neither age nor sex was spared. Some of the men with the courage
born of desperation resisted valiantly, although transfixed with the
assassin's weapon; but so unequal a struggle could not last long.</p>

<p>It was soon over, and the dastardly victors then proceeded to mutilate
the bodies of the slain. The sides of the corpses were ripped open and
the kidney fat dragged out, and wrapped in pieces of opossum skin as
trophies of their exploit.</p>

<p>The blacks believed that the vital principle, the soul, or the strength
of a man lay in his kidney fat. Their object in thus appropriating and
preserving the fat of an enemy, was for the purpose of anointing their
own bodies with it. In doing so they felt that they became possessed
of his strength or prowess in addition to their own. Sometimes they
carried this fat about with them for months, hanging from their necks
as a charm, or perhaps as memento of their bravery, just as a Red
Indian wears the scalps of his slain enemies hanging from his moccasins.</p>

<p>After this feast of blood, for it could not be described otherwise, the
enemy prepared to depart from the scene of their awful atrocity. Then
they vanished almost as silently and stealthily as they had come. A
certain blood-guiltiness seemed to overshadow them as they filed slowly
away in the grey of the morn, and disappeared one by one from the gaze
of the horrified Buckley. Perhaps they had a latent and undefined
dread of the enormity of the deed they had committed, and its ultimate
consequences to themselves should it be discovered before they had
got clear away from the territory of the tribe to which their victims
belonged.</p>

<p>When they had been gone sufficiently long, Buckley cautiously crawled
out of his hiding-place and examined the bodies of his slaughtered
friends. The sun had just arisen, and its brighter light revealed
more clearly to him the full extent of the fell night's work. He was
completely unmanned, and wept like a child on beholding the mangled
remains. Fear for his own safety, which had governed his conduct and so
paralysed him during the night, now gave place to feelings of intense
grief at the cruel loss of these, his first friends among the wild
people he had been living with so long.</p>

<p>While thus lamenting he was startled by a rustling sound of footsteps
approaching him. He clutched his spear and waddy firmly, for with the
daylight, his craven heart plucked up courage, and he determined to
show fight, and, if needs be, sell his own life dearly.</p>

<p>But his alarm was soon allayed. To his great surprise, from out of
the scrub there came, not a savage thirsting for his life's blood and
kidney fat, but a boy and a girl, who had escaped the general slaughter
by little less than a miracle. These children were the offspring of
Buckley's <i>soi-distant</i> brother-in-law. The poor boy was blind, and
his little sister affectionately led him by the hand as they drew near
to the remains of the camp.</p>

<p>Buckley at once dropped his weapons, and advanced kindly towards them,
excessively pleased to find that there were any survivors, even though
they were but two powerless and defenceless children.</p>

<p>He very soon withdrew with the two children from the painful scene,
and determined to place a good distance between himself and it before
sundown. His little companions clung to him as the only friend they had
in the world, and he, on his part, did all he could to help them along,
carrying the helpless boy most of the day.</p>

<p>For several days he journeyed on, keeping a sharp look-out for signs
of the tribe to which his late friends had belonged. At length he came
upon their tracks, and duly arrived at an encampment of about a hundred
of them, among whom he recognised many of his former associates. He
soon told his sad tale. His audience listened with bated breath, and,
when he had finished, every man among them vowed vengeance upon the
murderers.</p>

<p>Next morning the whole camp was on the march to visit the scene of
carnage. Arrived there, they found scarce anything but the skeletons of
the victims, for the wild dogs and the birds of prey had been feasting
on the flesh of the carcases. The blacks gathered up the remains
together with their mia-mias, and made a huge pile of the lot, which
they set fire to and reduced to a calcined mass.</p>

<p>A camp was then formed a short distance off, and that night a council
was held, at which most of the elders spoke in turn. Each man stood
up before his little family fire, and forcibly spoke out aloud his
sentiments with much volubility, the while punctuating and emphasizing
his remarks by means of his throwing-stick or spear which he wielded in
his right hand.</p>

<p>Each speech was patiently listened to, and commented upon. Every man
had a right to utter his little say; for among the blacks, all men
were equal, there being no chief or kings as many people imagine. Of
course some among then of stronger natural talents or powers, mental or
physical, would occasionally be regarded as leaders in some particular
course of action, and would perhaps have a considerable following. But
these did not interfere with or coerce the minority, who were always
free to follow their several inclinations. In this respect the blacks
might be classed among that much abused section of civilised people
called anarchists, rather than among the democrats, as the dictum of
the right of the majority to rule did not hold sway with them.</p>

<p>The result of the present confabulation was apparent next morning, when
about twenty men set out in the track of the foe. On their return,
these champions had a proud tale to relate of how they had come up with
the enemy; how they had challenged them to mortal conflict; and how
they had worsted them in the contest, killing three of their number,
and wounding several others. In conclusive proof of these statements
they exhibited the kidney fat of those they had slain. The honour of
the tribe being thus vindicated, general satisfaction was expressed by
all.</p>

<p>Buckley became very much attached to the little boy and girl. He kept
them with him for many months. They always attended him on his fishing
and hunting excursions, and he shared with them anything he caught.
They looked upon him as their protector, which greatly gratified him,
and awakened in him quite an interest in their welfare.</p>

<p>At length, much to his regret, he was obliged to part with the little
girl, having fallen in with the tribe in which was a man to whom she
had been promised in marriage by her father. This man was one of the
patriarchs of the tribe, and already the proud possessor of one wife.</p>

<p>Buckley continued to keep the little boy who was so sadly afflicted.
A blind child, or in fact anyone unable to take care of himself from
physical defect, was so great a rarity among the natives, that such a
one might be regarded as a sort of curiosity.</p>

<p>When a child was born the father always asked himself the question
whether he was equal to the responsibility of rearing it, or rather
if his wife was equal to it. Their mode of life necessitated frequent
changing of their camping-places, and as the women were the pack-horses
on such occasions, children were always more or less encumbrances. One
infant was, therefore, as much as a woman could carry, in addition
to the various household goods. Consequently, if number two was born
inconveniently soon after its elder brother or sister, it stood a very
good chance of an early and a violent death, generally by means of
strangulation; its mother or another woman of the tribe doing the deed
at the instigation of the father.</p>

<p>A deformed child was never on any pretence allowed to live. Buckley
relates that he saw an instance of their brutal aversion to a child
that happened to be deformed at its birth. It's brains were dashed out
without any ceremony.</p>

<p>As a rule the blacks were kind to their children, and imposed scarcely
any restraint upon them. As soon as they could toddle, they naturally
began to search for food. The father usually kept a look-out upon the
boys, and the girls were instructed by their mother. Of course the
boys soon found out that they were members of the superior sex, and
acted accordingly, as their mothers and sisters felt to their cost.*
They were provided with playthings in the shape of diminutive spears,
throwing-sticks, and boomerangs, and other weapons, and also instructed
in their use. They were apt pupils, and soon became adepts in all the
native accomplishments.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
[* "It is a remarkable fact that I never saw, and only once heard of,
a native child being corrected by its parents or any other natives,
and as a consequence they grow up savagely impatient of any approach
to it. Walker told me one case where a native woman indeed did correct
a child, a boy about five years old, but the young savage almost
immediately stole his father's tomahawk, went stealthily behind his
mother, and brained his infant sister. Again, a lady who had adopted
a native boy, found it necessary one day to chastise him for some
offence, but in an instant he seized her arm with both hands and bit a
piece of flesh clean out. On another occasion I saw a young black boy
strike his mother savagely. I asked her why she did not correct him.
She said, meekly, that by-and-by he would be a man. Having no such
respect for his future manhood, I gave him a box on the ear, but had to
threaten him with my pistols in order to save myself from being speared
on the spot. Whether on war or hunting parties, a few boys always
accompany the party, and are more cruel than the men themselves. It is
seldom a white man is murdered without boys' spears being found in him.
I was told by a gentleman, that on one occasion, in an encounter, he
saw a fine powerful black on the ground with his leg broken by a ball,
defending himself against two boys belonging to their black allies, who
were dancing round him like two young demons, trying to beat his brains
out. They killed him at last."&#8212;GIDEON S. LANG.]</p>
<br>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Young man and boy.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>When arrived at the mature age of nine or ten, the boys were so far
advanced that the parental apron-strings no longer tied them, and
they were obliged to quit the mia-mia of their childhood, and were
transferred to the quarters allotted to the bachelors of all ages
belonging to the tribe. Here their lives were not quite so rosy. They
had to trust more to their own resources, and were forced to undergo
a series of tribal rites, which extended over many years, and which
entailed upon them a considerable amount of painful endurance.</p>

<p>The object of all the ceremonies imposed upon the boy or youth was to
make a man of him. First he was obliged to be very circumspect in his
behaviour to females, and to keep out of their way as much as possible.
He had also to suffer many restrictions in the use of food; choice
tit-bits being of course reserved for the respectable family-men of the
tribe. At one time during this period of probation he had to drink mud
and water. At another time his nose was taken in hand, and the septum
pierced with an awl made of a bone of a kangaroo. Through the hole thus
made, an ornament of bone or reed was thrust, which, no doubt, greatly
added to the beauty of his appearance in the eyes of the tribe, but
whether it added to the comfort of the neophyte was very questionable.</p>

<p>Another feature of his education was the severe ordeal of scarring his
body. This was done with a sharp flint or shell, which was drawn across
the chest, the back, and the upper portion of the arms. Frightful open
wounds were thus inflicted upon the luckless youth, who was obliged
to submit to the custom, although the yells of agony which he could
not repress testified how great was the torture he had to endure.
The ceremony reminded Buckley of punishment day in the old convict
settlement, when a refractory prisoner was taking his regulation
allowance of the cat-o'-nine tails. However, there was the difference
between the two cases: the white man after his castigation was sullen,
and cowed in spirit, and a bigger brute than before; whereas the black
proudly regarded his scars as an ornament and a sign of manhood after
they had set and showed up in prominent symmetrical lines or ridges on
his dark skin. It took several months to complete this operation, for
to make the <i>basso-relievo</i> marks indelible, the incisions in the skin
had to be kept open, and this was done by frequently rubbing in them
powdered charcoal or ashes.</p>

<p>Knocking out the centre tooth of the upper row was also an indignity
which the young native had to receive at the hands of his elders in
most tribes, although Buckley makes no mention of it as taking place
among the people with whom he lived. The ceremony has been minutely
described by Collins, who witnessed it in New South Wales, when
judge-advocate of that settlement under Governor Phillip.</p>

<p>How all these customs originated it is difficult and impossible
to imagine. From time immemorial they seem to have been slavishly
followed. No black ever took the trouble to inquire into the why
or wherefore. His father complied with them before him, and like
a dutiful son he did the same. There is no doubt that such trying
practices tested the endurance of the candidate for the honours
or responsibilities of manhood, and killed off any who showed the
slightest constitutional tendencies to weakness. Perhaps the primary
idea underlying them had in view the object of keeping up the physical
standard of the race&mdash;in other words, the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>When all these old-time obligations had been safely passed through, the
young man was at liberty to take unto himself a wife if he could obtain
one by purchase, conquest, or by gift. This was frequently a very
difficult matter, for the old men generally managed to monopolise the
eligible women and girls.</p>

<p>AN UNFORTUNATE DEATH&mdash;CANNIBALISM&mdash;BUCKLEY'S DISGUST&mdash;A STRANGE
REPRISAL&mdash;BUCKLEY'S HERMITAGE&mdash;FISHING EXTRAORDINARY&mdash;NATIVE
LANGUAGES&mdash;THE BLACK'S MENU&mdash; ANOTHER DEATH&mdash;SORCERY&mdash;AN ELEVATED GRAVE.</p>


<p>THINGS went on very quietly with Buckley and his friends for many
months, till, unfortunately, a man from another tribe joined them.
The new-comer took up his quarters with Buckley and his blind boy,
and lived very amicably with them, sleeping in the mia-mia. By some
unaccountable means, however, he was one night taken seriously ill.
Every effort was made on the part of the natives and Buckley to cure
him. The portions of his body and head which seemed to be affected were
scratched with sharp shells till the blood flowed rather copiously from
him. They then lit a fire in a hole in the ground and covered it with
wet herbage. Over this they held the sick man and threw on top of him
and the fire an opossum rug, in order to keep the steam in, thus making
a sort of rude vapour bath, which induced profuse perspiration.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these strenuous efforts made on his behalf, they
failed to bring him round, and after hovering between life and death
for a few days he died. The tribe were much concerned, fearing they
would be held responsible for his untimely death.</p>

<p>Coming up with the tribe to which the young man had belonged, an
explanation of his death was given. The relatives listened with savage
incredulity and charged Buckley's party with foul play. A wordy
warfare followed, but by a kind of mutual consent this ended, when
the aggrieved party seized the little blind boy who unluckily had
been sleeping in the same mia-mia with the deceased, and killed him
instantly before Buckley's eyes. They then roasted the body, and both
tribes proceeded to show that they had settled their little differences
by partaking of a friendly banquet composed of the charred remains.</p>

<p>Buckley was so horrified and disgusted at the turn affairs had taken,
that, as soon as he had realised what they were about, he plunged into
the bush and left them. This loss of the strongest, if not the only tie
of affection he had ever had in his life, grieved him so deeply, that
he determined never to have anything more to do with the blacks.</p>

<p>Dozens of times he certainly had seen atrocities perpetrated, equal if
not greater than what he had just witnessed; but this little fellow's
very helplessness which had caused him to cling to the big white man
for shelter and protection, had so endeared him to Buckley that the
sudden and awful deprivation engendered a feeling of profound hatred
and loathing in his mind against those who had thus wrested him away.</p>

<p>In this mood he wandered on, scarcely knowing or caring whither his
steps took him. By-and-bye he stumbled across the tribe to which
he had transferred the little girl. He told his story to them and
they professed indignation and vowed vengeance. Two or three of them
afterwards set off to execute it, and returned in two or three days
saying that they had killed two children in satisfaction!</p>

<p>But Buckley was tired of savage life, so he forsook this tribe and
made once more for the sea-coast. Here he lived a solitary melancholy
existence; although so far as food and physical comfort were concerned,
he fared well, being now an adept in all the arts of the natives.
A native woman who had run away from a tribe while it was fighting
with another, came to him one day and offered to share his heart and
hearth. She remained with him a long time, and helped him to obtain
the necessaries of life. In fact, they lived together over a year,
undisturbed by any visitors. They changed their place of habitation
frequently, as food became scare in each spot. This recluse life gave
mutual satisfaction, but it was at length terminated by a surprise
visit of his lady friend's relatives, who took her away with them.</p>

<p>Though the blacks had thus discovered his whereabouts, they did not
interfere with his liberty, but allowed him to do as he thought fit.
Sometimes he would have a tribe on a visit of friendliness; at others
he would be left for weeks together without seeing a soul.</p>

<p>He took up permanent quarters at the mouth of a little stream, where he
built a substantial hut with a chimney to it. He had now become quite
a Robinson Crusoe. Roots were readily obtainable, and large shoals of
fish visited the stream, and kept him supplied with abundance of animal
food.</p>

<p>He noticed one day a great shoal of bream come up with the tide to a
considerable distance from the stream's mouth. When the tide turned, he
also noticed these fish were carried out to sea with it. This suggested
to him the idea of constructing a weir across the stream where it was
shallowest, so as to arrest the fish and leave them struggling in
the shallow water. With this view, therefore, he collected together
branches of trees and scrub, and constructed hurdles; poles were driven
by him into the bed of the stream, and when the tide began to ebb, the
hurdles were placed in position against them, which allowed the water
to trickle through, but prevented the departure of the fish. This
manoeuvre was a splendid success, and he captured hundreds of the finny
tribe. He dried a large number of them in the sun, as he did not know
how long the fish would continue to come up the stream.</p>

<p>While he was engaged in this provident occupation, his seclusion was
broken into by a small party of natives, consisting of two women with
their children. On first seeing them, he rushed into his hut, and made
ready to receive them at the point of his spear should they prove
enemies. But their language reassured him when he heard them call out.
He recognised the words as those belonging to the people with whom he
had been living.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the blacks was that each tribe had a language of its
own. In some tribes the difference was merely a difference of dialect,
just as in England you find many dialect variations of the English
tongue. Intercourse between such tribes was moderately easily carried
on; no more difficulty being felt than, for instance, a Yorkshireman
would have in making himself understood by a man born and brought up in
Dorsetshire or Devonshire. Others, again, were so different as to be
almost distinct languages, just as the English and French are.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Native Baskets.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>The natives were overjoyed at beholding Buckley in the flesh once more.
He had been so long away from them that they had thought him dead. The
men capered about like children, and the women expressed their extreme
satisfaction in a very singular fashion by shedding tears copiously.</p>

<p>The leg of a kangaroo was produced from a basket, with a good supply of
roots and gum, and offered to him. In return Buckley showed them his
stock of fish. The great abundance astonished them. He then recounted
all his adventures since last seeing them, and took them to see his
weir. When its use was explained, they were delighted beyond measure.
The miraculous draught of fishes mentioned in Scripture could not have
yielded greater or more profound exaltation to the poor fishers of
Galilee than this revelation of the power of poor Buckley did to the
blacks. They, among other compliments, said that he certainly deserved
three or four wives; but for some reason or other, perhaps fearing that
Buckley would take them at their word, at the same time drove their own
women away.</p>

<p>Seeing provisions so plentiful, the blacks determined to settle
alongside of Buckley, and therefore speedily erected their mia-mias
near his hut. A smoke signal was then raised by stuffing a hollow tree
full of dry grass and bark, and setting fire to the lot. This summoned
the remainder of the tribe, which shortly afterwards arrived, bringing
with them a goodly supply of kangaroo flesh.</p>

<p>A peaceful period of several months ensued. Day followed day in quiet
succession. The occupations of all were of a useful nature. The men
spent a good deal of their time in manufacturing spears, shields,
clubs, and boomerangs, for future contingencies, and in making opossum
rugs for themselves and children, when not engaged in fishing; with an
occasional diversion by way of a change in the shape of a kangaroo hunt.</p>

<p>A little distance upstream was a lagoon in which eels were very
plentiful, and on calm nights the blacks often went there to fish. The
usual custom followed in the capture of these slimy creatures, was for
a party of blacks to wade into the water with torches in left hand,
and in the other a hunting spear to which a long sharp bone had been
lashed with the sinews of a kangaroo's tail. Attracted by the glare
of the burning brands, the eels soon crowded round and were quickly
transferred from their native element by the dexterously wielded spears
of their dusky hunters.</p>

<p>Fish was prepared for food by roasting. Indeed, roasting, baking,
or broiling were their only methods of cooking food, as they had no
utensils for boiling purposes. Fish was roasted between two thick
layers of green grass, the hot embers of the fire being placed both on
top and below.</p>

<p>The occupations of the women were more monotonous and laborious than
those of the men. They consisted in digging up roots with their yam
sticks, making baskets, bags, and nets, collecting firewood, and
attending to the wants of the children. The little daughters generally
imitated their mothers so far as they were able, while the boys
followed in the footsteps of their fathers.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the natives digging for wild roots. They
occasionally diverted themselves by digging out the wombat, a thick,
chubby-shaped, tailless, burrowing animal, which was esteemed a
delicacy by them. Its burrows extended a considerable distance in the
earth in an oblique direction. When the mouth of a wombat hole was
discovered, a native boy or girl was made to crawl in backwards till he
or she came to the animal, which would retreat on his or her approach
to the far extremity, where it would stand at bay in fear of the
intruder. It was a most cowardly animal, and never made any attempt at
defending itself. The little fellow, having thus cornered him and cut
off his retreat or advance, would yell out, and at the same time tap
the earth above so that the listening hunters on top could hear. These
would than set to work with their digging-sticks and scoop out the
earth over the animal. It would then be hauled to the surface, killed,
and cast on the flames, and quickly despatched down the capacious maws
of its hungry captors.</p>

<p>Buckley was rather fond of wombat, but turned up his nose at native
dog, which was another favourite dish with his black friends. With
this exception he appears to have been as omniverous an eater as any
of the natives. Their bill of fare included grubs, ants, gum, snakes,
lizards, frogs, and other nasty things, according to our more refined
imagination or prejudiced taste.</p>

<p>The plentiful food supply and absence of danger had the effect of
bringing out the better qualities of the whole camp. Eat, drink, and
be merry, was the order of the day when circumstances permitted,
among these children of Nature. Buckley's long experience of them had
taught him how variable were their moods. One day the black might be a
light-hearted, merry and impulsive boy in character; on the next, as
by a magic transformation this would be changed, and he would become a
vindictive, vengeful, stealthy, and dastardly assassin, sparing neither
man, woman or child.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Cooking a Snake.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>Time passed on and provisions becoming scarce in their immediate
neighbourhood, the blacks were compelled to seek fresh fields. On the
move once more, they came up with another tribe, who joined their
forces with them. Here an incident occurred which illustrated forcibly
the terrible hold which the superstition of sorcery or witchcraft had
over them.</p>

<p>One of the men while stepping over a log was bitten in the leg by a
venomous snake. Buckley, who was close behind, killed his snakeship
with a well-aimed blow of his waddy, or club. The man was of course
terrified, and immediately dropped to the ground. His two wives rushed
forward and did all they could to relieve him by tying strings above
and below the wounded spot, and gashing it with shells so as to induce
copious bleeding. But these rude remedies were of no avail and the poor
fellow gradually sank into a comatose condition.</p>

<p>At this stage, the services of the doctor, priest, or enchanter of the
tribe were invoked. This personage was a most important member of every
tribe. He was generally an old man of wily nature, whose office partook
of the nature of a doctor of medicine, doctor of divinity, government
astronomer and astrologer, conjurer, and sundry other functions
protective and aggressive to the tribe. He played his part well and did
not let the curious know any of his trade secrets; consequently he was
regarded by all with as much awe and veneration as a people of this
monkey-like nature was capable of feeling.</p>

<p>On the present occasion his reverence breathed, mumbled, and muttered
over the poor victim, squeezed the part affected, and behaved in a
generally extravagant manner. But these theological, medical, or
mystical antics, were no better than the more practical efforts of the
victim's wives, and death ensued ere long.</p>

<p>Now the immediate cause of death was most certainly a bite inflicted by
the snake that had been killed by Buckley, as they all knew. But the
blacks never recognised as natural any death, except that produced by
extreme old age, the natural end to a long existence, or that resulting
from a wound inflicted by the thrust or throw of a spear, the blow of a
waddy or other weapon of defence. Any other mode of dying, such as that
of sickness or of accident, was accredited to the machinations of an
enemy.</p>

<p>To find out the whereabouts of that enemy was now the duty of the
tribe, and to follow him to the death was their next task.</p>

<p>The dead man's body was then laid out on a bare piece of ground and
a deep line, or rather a little rut, drawn around it. The natives
then carefully watched to see if any insects crawled from the body to
this encircling rut. Presently an ant was seen to emerge, walk slowly
towards it, and cross over it. This was an indication to them that
the enemy would be found in the direction which the insect had taken.
Preparations were then soon made for the avenging party to set out,
meat was cooked for their journey, so that there would be no necessity
to light a fire, which might perhaps warn the enemy of their stealthy
approach. By long and cautious marches they arrived at their enemies'
camping-ground, and then a scene of butchery was enacted, rivalling in
cool atrocity anything that could be conceived of.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Tree-tomb of Australia.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>Buckley did not make one of this blood-thirsty band, which consisted of
about twenty of the men, but stayed behind with the others and assisted
in the funeral solemnities of the deceased. As a rule, dead bodies were
buried as before described in these pages, but occasionally they were
disposed of in another way. The corpse of this man was placed on sheets
of bark and lifted up into the branches of a tree, where it was left in
a horizontal position.</p>

<p>The tribe moved away and did not return to the spot for several months,
when the tree was revisited and the dead man's bones taken down and
brought to the camp. Then amid great lamentations and self-torture,
inflicted by burning brands being applied to their bodies, for the
deceased had been a great favourite, the bones were packed into a
compact parcel and given in charge of one of the women to carry. The
tribe then set off, and arrived, after promiscuous wanderings, at a
large hollow tree where they were finally disposed of by being dropped
down the cavity within its trunk.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X_TERPSICHOREAN_AND_COMMERCIAL" id="CHAPTER_X_TERPSICHOREAN_AND_COMMERCIAL">CHAPTER X.&mdash;TERPSICHOREAN AND COMMERCIAL.</a></h2>

<p>BARTER&mdash;MESSENGERS OR HERALDS&mdash;BIG MEETINGS&mdash;THE CORROBOREE DANCE.</p>


<p>THOUGH rude and very low in the scale of humanity as were Buckley's
black companions, they still had a few primitive commercial relations
between tribe and tribe. The exchange or barter of the special products
of one track of country, for the productions peculiar to another, was
frequently the occasion of large tribal congresses or meetings. Among
the articles exchanged might be mentioned flints, shells, stones for
tomahawks, gum, stalks of the grass tree, clay for painting the body,
and some articles of diet.</p>

<p>Prior to these great gatherings, messengers or heralds were sent out
to arrange matters between the tribes. These messengers were very
important personages, and might be said to be the most intelligent and
talkative members of a tribe. Their linguistic powers were of course
necessary, as they had frequently to carry news and information to
tribes whose language differed considerably from that spoken by their
own.</p>

<p>A solitary black-fellow always ran the risk of being killed if found
outside his own tribal domain; therefore, the messenger or courier,
was furnished with an insignia of his office as a sort of passport
when travelling. This was a stick six or seven inches long and an inch
or two broad, though often smaller, curiously carved with primitive
hieroglyphic notches and scratches, emblematic of his errand. It was
generally stuck in the netted band worn round his head, just as you
often see an Irish labourer's pipe drawn through his hat-band. The
message bearer usually kept a note of the time occupied in a journey by
marking one of his arms with a stripe of clay for each day. Another man
in the tribe also kept tally in a similar manner.</p>

<p>On arriving at his destination, the messenger delivered himself of his
message, peaceful, warlike, commercial, matrimonial, or terpsichorean,
as the case might be, to the most important man of the tribe visited.
They listened with great interest, and ordered the women to prepare
for him some refreshment. After this he retired to that portion of the
camp usually occupied by the single men, where he silently watched for
awhile the effect of his communication. If they did not desire to have
any intercourse with his people, or were antagonistic to his proposals,
a significant hint would be given him to depart.</p>

<p>His non-successful overtures were never productive of any injury to
himself, for, like an ambassador from one European court to another,
his person was always held sacred, and he was allowed to return in
peace; or, at any rate, to get well on his way back to his own people,
before any attempt would be made to overtake him in order to wreak
vengeance on his head.</p>

<p>Big meetings were always held during the summer months, and on such
occasions the opportunity was taken to hold large corroborees. These
corroborees were a source of keen enjoyment to the heart of every
black-fellow. No schoolboy ever revelled in the delights of a pantomime
or harlequinade with half the ecstasy felt by our dusky friends at
their grand tribal festival. When several friendly-disposed tribes came
together, a party from each tribe took it in turn nightly to give a
corroboree, the other tribes meanwhile being the audience.</p>

<p>Great emulation existed among them to produce a good entertainment, and
therefore many rehearsals would take place long before the meetings of
the tribes. Every black&mdash;man, woman and child&mdash;closely followed the
performance with eager and greedy eyes and ears, in order to learn
any new or original tune or antic that might be introduced. So quick
were they at learning, and so retentive were their memories, that it
was no uncommon thing for a new song or chant that particularly struck
the fancy to be carried from tribe to tribe for hundreds of miles,
although the meanings of the words were not understood by any of the
singers beyond the original composer and the members of his tribe.
Consequently, although many features of the performance were common to
all corroborees, yet no two were exactly alike.</p>

<p>Every phase and experience of aboriginal life were fit subjects for
mimic reproduction of them. Fanciful representations evolved out of
the fertile minds of some imaginative individuals among them were also
frequently given; and these added not a little to the delight of the
spectators, and not less to the performers.</p>

<p>Night was the time always chosen by the blacks for these national
entertainments. The theatre, if we might call it such, where the
corroboree was acted was always a flat piece of ground, unobstructed by
bushes or trees, and from which all impediments in the shape of sticks,
stones and other movables had been carefully cleared away so that the
free play of the performers might not be baulked or interfered with.
Two immense heaps of dry bushes and branches were piled up, and to keep
up the fire without any undue interruption, a plentiful supply of other
combustibles were collected in readiness.</p>

<p>When the time arrived for the exhibition, pantomime, or theatrical
performance&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;to begin, a fire-stick was applied
to the two piles. The orchestra, consisting of the women led by an old
man black-fellow as conductor, took up their position in a sort of
semicircle just within the confines of the light cast by the blazing
fires, and rather in the shadow if anything.</p>

<p>Up to this time the male performers in the little drama had not been
idle. Before sundown they had all retired to the seclusion of the
surrounding forest to make their preparations. In their green-room
supplied by Dame Nature they made a free use of her products in
ornamenting their persons. Each man decorated himself according to the
ideal of beauty or fitness running through his own inner consciousness.</p>

<p>The groundwork used by all was generally red ochre. On this some
painted themselves along the ribs, round the eyes, and down the legs
and arms, so that they much resembled skeletons; but whether it was
their intention to pose as skeletons is not known. Others, again,
fantastically bedaubed designs which would have puzzled the most
erudite or imaginative Egyptologist or Assyriologist to find out the
meaning. Some had plumes of feathers sticking through their head-bands;
others wore necklaces of the teeth of animals strung by the roots to
a thin strip of skin, or of reeds strung on a bark cord; they all had
fixed to their ankles bunches of leafy twigs, which made a rustling
noise as the performers moved about.</p>

<p>Everything was now ready. Darkness had settled over the land. The
audience had assembled at a respectful distance from the stage, and
the orchestra had received its signal to strike up. The first notes
were low and plaintive as befitted the solemnity of the whole scene.
The enormous light thrown by the two fires had made the background of
forest look unusually dark by contrast, and cast thousands of fitful
jumping shadows with every slight rustling wind that shivered the leafy
branches overhead. The scenic effect was very weird and phantom-like
and quite in keeping with what followed.</p>

<p>Presently from the forest gloom beyond, there appeared the first
of the performers, who glided within the circle of light, and with
arms extended at right angles to his body, executed some fantastic
saltatorial movements. Another and another followed in the same way,
till the whole of the actors were extended in one quivering line.
The vocal music and thumping on the opossum-skin drums increased and
increased while this was going on, so that the original low plaintive
sounds grew into a most discordant clamouring. The dancers also
added their quota to the noisy dissonance in the utterance of partly
suppressed grunts and murmurs.</p>

<p>The whole line of dancers then gradually disappeared behind the scenes,
making their exit much in the same manner as they had entered upon
the stage. But not for long. In a moment or two the spectators were
gladdened by seeing them return to go through similar evolutions. This
appearing and disappearing was kept up for some time, and at last was
brought to the climax in a grand final tableau.</p>

<p>Fast and furious then went everyone. There seemed to be a very vortex
of dancing legs, flourishing arms, and convulsive contortions of
bodies. The performers now moved as if endowed with the flexibility of
the tempered steel. The sticks or the boomerangs in the hands of each
were beaten together to add to the music. Demoniacal they all looked
in their earnestness as with eyes dilated, chests expanded, nostrils
and cheeks inflated, and teeth glistening in their whiteness, they
glared at each other, and seemed as though they intended to tear one
another to pieces. Lines or ranks were rapidly formed and reformed
with marvellous celerity and the precision of a company of soldiers,
and so straight that the reed ornament stuck through the hose of each
black-fellow appeared at times to be one continuous long skewer. A
series of concerted jumps followed, one row to the right another to the
left. The action was then changed. They all mingled, and afterwards
assumed a new formation in which they drew closer to the fire and
towards the orchestra, who now beat their hardest and sang their
loudest, while the dancers or pantomimists so rapidly twirled and
knocked together their implements that it seemed wonderful no heads
were broken.</p>

<p>The performance was now almost over, and a last burst was made to
increase the pace of both voice and limb. The leaders exerted every
effort. Their corroboree sticks were held high in the air, and then,
amid a perfect pandemonium of tumultuous noise and impish gyrations,
the entertainment ended. The dancers, terribly exhausted with their
exertions, filed off into the shade of the trees, whence they yet again
emerged shortly afterwards to mingle with the audience for a time, and
receive its congratulations or criticisms before finally retiring to
their several mia-mias.</p>

<p>A corroboree usually lasted three or four hours. Though it might be
regarded as a friendly performance, it not unfrequently was the first
cause of an enmity between tribes; licentiousness and atrocities and
consequent revenge being often the outcome of these social dances.
Again, on the other hand, tribes which had hitherto been hostile to
one another would, on ending their disputes, celebrate the occasion by
holding a corroboree.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_HOPES_OF_RESCUE" id="CHAPTER_XI_HOPES_OF_RESCUE">CHAPTER XI.&mdash;HOPES OF RESCUE.</a></h2>

<p>A TRIBE ANNIHILATED&mdash;WHITE VISITORS&mdash;BUCKLEY'S FRANTIC SIGNALS&mdash;A DARK
DEED&mdash;WRECKAGE&mdash;THE TWO SAILORS&mdash;TREASURE TROVE&mdash;DESPONDENCY.</p>


<p>YEAR followed year, and Buckley saw children grow up into manhood and
womanhood. The young people of his first sojourn among them had become
grey-headed men and women, and many of his early friends had died of
the infirmities of old age. He became quite a patriarch among his
people, and relates that he exercised considerable influence over them.
Being of a peaceful disposition and dearly loving his ease, he was
often instrumental in preventing fights.</p>

<p>One curious incident is related by him of a tribe being totally
annihilated by suffocation. This tribe, which was of a light copper
colour in complexion, and credited with possessing tremendously large
and protruding bellies, was notorious for its extreme partiality to
human flesh as an article of diet, not only eating it greedily after a
fight, but whenever they got an opportunity. In consequence, they were
very much dreaded by the surrounding tribes. Another peculiarity of
theirs was that they never erected any hut or shelter to sleep in, but
lived promiscuously in the scrub, lying about anyhow and anywhere. At
last, to put an end to their incessant murderous onslaughts, several
tribes combined and set fire to the scrub that secreted them, and
the wind being favourable to the spread of the flames, the loathsome
cannibals were wiped off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Only once during the whole period of Buckley's existence with the
blacks, was the hope of being restored to civilization quickened
into vigorous life within him. By a curious chance it was a flag&mdash;an
emblem of a civilized nation&mdash;that carried his thoughts away from his
barbarian surroundings, and revived the long since relinquished desire
to escape them. At the time when thus aroused he was in the bush, and
a little distance from the camp of his black friends. He noticed a
black-fellow strutting about with the piece of bunting hanging <i>à la</i>
opossum rug over his sooty shoulder. With anxious steps Buckley drew
nearer to the prodigiously vain fellow, and questioned him concerning
the object of his conceit. He was told that several of the tribe,
while seeking for mussel shells on the beach, had seen a large ship
at anchor, and whilst watching her had observed a boat-load of white
men put off, leaving the ship apparently deserted. After eyeing the
vessel narrowly for some time, and seeing no signs of life on board,
three of the blacks swam alongside and, with cat-like celerity climbed
up to the deck. The first object to rivet their gaze was the 'colours'
which they at once dragged down and appropriated. Then they snatched
up bits of rope and sails, and also some glass bottles, most of them
broken. They did not go below, being afraid to venture there, and soon
cleared off with the few things they had hurriedly obtained. After
secreting their plunder, they were about to make another raid, when
they were baulked by the return of the boat. The crew, on reaching the
ship, saw the shifted state of the deck trappings, and, guessing the
cause, discharged a thundering blaze of musketry, which so intimidated
the native looters that they sheered off, satisfied with the fruits of
their first flying visit.</p>

<p>Buckley was kept in the highest pitch of excitement while listening
to the story. Soon afterwards he stealthily left the camp and almost
ran the whole distance to the sea-coast. The ship was still anchored,
and Buckley, shaking with nervous tremor, stood almost abreast of it.
Standing thus, the desire to make himself known grew stronger and
stronger. So much moved did he become, that large tears steaming from
his eyes coursed down his hairy cheeks and over his long and matted
beard. He attempted to hail them in English, and was almost maddened
to find that he could not articulate a single word of his mother
tongue. In a perfect frenzy he paced hither and thither, making violent
beckonings and wild shouts for the seamen to take him away. They,
however, walked about the deck unconcernedly, saving once when one of
them levelled a musket at him. This act prevented Buckley from swimming
towards them. He stayed at the water's edge for the rest of the day,
and at night he lighted a fire there and retired into the scrub close
by.</p>

<p>In the morning a boat was put off from the ship's side, and sailed two
or three miles off to a small island that lay a few hundred yards from
the shore. Buckley followed eagerly along the beach, but the breeze
greatly aided those in the boat. Ere he could catch up to them they
had landed on the island, and having completed the object of their
trip, were tacking back to the ship. At one time he was so near them
that he could see an amused expression on their rough countenances,
as though the men were much diverted by his continued gesticulating
efforts to make himself understood. It is great wonder that Buckley in
his temerity was not shot as a warning to those who had committed the
depredation on the ship, for with his native weapons and opossum-skin
cloak, and his sun-dried, darkly-tanned and rugged features, he looked
every whit as much a black as any aborigine.</p>

<p>Disheartened with his unavailing endeavours, he next swam over to where
the sailors had been employed. He examined the spot carefully in hopes
of finding an axe or some other useful relic. The search brought him
to a mound of earth, and, thinking it might be 'a place of concealment
of some kind of treasure,' he turned over the newly-placed sods. His
quest for greed revealed to him the appalling sight of a dead white
man wrapped up in a blanket. Recovering from his shock, he became so
gruesomely utilitarian as to consider whether the nice warm shroud
might not be taken to keep off the cold blasts from his own half-naked
body. After a little debating, however, he felt that 'he could not find
it in his heart to rob the dead,' and therefore put back the earth over
the blanketed corpse, and also spread some boughs on the lonely grave.</p>

<p>His next movements took him back near to the vessel, where he again
made frantic signals for several days, but without opening up any
communication with his white fellow-beings. The terrible misery of
this suspense was at length terminated by the ship weighing anchor
and sailing away. With the departure of the vessel all his hopes of
deliverance vanished, and he returned to the camp of his black friends.</p>

<p>He then, for the first time, heard from the blacks that many years
previously another such vessel had arrived in the bay. From it a boat's
crew had landed, bringing with them two men as prisoners, whom they
bound to a tree and shot; afterwards, rapidly returning to their ship,
leaving the dead bodies tied up just as they had first fixed them.</p>

<p>Buckley, on another occasion, came across a large boat, stranded on the
sea-shore. In and about her were eight oars; three blankets, rigged as
sails, and a quantity of tackle. She had evidently been lying there a
considerable time, as some of the articles were buried in the sand. No
signs of the former occupants could be discovered. The treasure-trove
was, of course, pounced upon by our hero and his companions.</p>

<p>Later on he learned that two white men, evidently from this boat, had
been found wandering in the bush by a neighbouring tribe. They were
suffering frightfully from exposure and hunger and thirst. The natives
took care of them and relieved their wants till they were strong again.
An effort was then made to inform the strangers that another white man
was living in the vicinity, meaning Buckley, and that they would go
in search of him. The poor fellows, however, did not understand the
meaning of these signs, and took the first opportunity of escaping.
They got away as far as the head of the bay, but were there found
by the blacks of the Yarra tribe, who killed them while they were
attempting to cross the river.</p>

<p>Another evidence of civilization was discovered by Buckley during one
of his solitary rambles along the sea-shore. This time it was a large
cask, or hogshead, partly buried in the sand&mdash;probably thrown up by
the sea from a wrecked ship. It was too heavy for him to lift, so he
knocked the end in and took a draught of the contents. He had been so
long addicted to water-drinking that he had forgotten the taste of the
invented beverages of man, but thought that the liquor now before him
was either beer or wine. Anyhow, the flavour appeared to be horribly
offensive, and the smell equally so. He reflected on the evils that
might ensue if the blacks came along and imbibed it, and therefore,
like a good prohibitionist, he stove in the side and emptied the 'wet
damnation' over the sands. The hoop-iron around the cask was, however,
a welcome addition to the weapons and implement of his black friends,
and the distribution of it amongst them increased his popularity not a
little.</p>

<p>These incidents were the only evidences he had, during the long
years of his wandering life, of the existence of any white people in
that part of the world. Many, many years ago the settlement had been
abandoned, as he had learned from his black companions, although he
had not been around to that side of the bay since his flight. Knowing
this, he had given up all hopes of returning to civilisation. But
the knowledge that chance voyagers sometimes appeared on the coast
awakened a natural desire to renew his acquaintance with people of his
own blood. These slight hopes, however, were quickly annihilated, and
left in their place a feeling of deep depression. The daily necessity
of providing for his wants somewhat cured him, and, in fact, compelled
him to be up and doing, thus acting as a potent balm, as occupation
always does in cases of even the most severe despondency, affliction,
or sorrow.</p>

<p>On many occasions he left the company of his black friends and retired
to a solitary life on the sea-shore. This hermit-like habit was never
interfered with. They allowed him the utmost liberty. A disgust at many
of their brutal customs seems to have prompted him to this. Perhaps
also the faint glimmering hope of being able to attract the attention
of some passing ship had something to do with it.</p>

DEATH.</p>


<p>AT LAST an end came to his troubles in a manner and at a time when he
was least expecting it.</p>

<p>One day, when a considerable distance from the coast, and engaged
in the peaceful and mild occupation of digging or grubbing up roots
for his evening meal, he was startled by the arrival of some young
men of his tribe with their spears gaily decorated with coloured
pocket-handkerchiefs. To say that he was agitated would be but a weak
way of expressing his feelings. Never did a flag proudly flying from
the mast of a gallant ship, as she bore down to rescue a raft-load of
shipwrecked mariners, revive more hope, or renew greater pent up desire
or yearning for a restoration to human society, than to poor Buckley
did these common pieces of cotton waving in the wind from the rude
weapons of the blacks.</p>

<p>To his eager inquiries the young men replied that the gaudy rags were
gifts which had been received from a party of strangers who had landed
on the coast. His further questions elicited the information that the
party consisted of three white men and six natives. They had been
brought there by a big ship, which had now sailed away. They lived in
two white houses, meaning tents, which they had erected on the shore,
and had in their possession plenty of provisions, blankets, tomahawks,
and other useful articles.</p>

<p>Having disburdened themselves of this important news, the natives
expressed their intention of calling a meeting of several tribes to
aid in a raid on the valuable possessions of the strangers. Buckley
was greatly concerned on hearing this. If the strangers were killed,
all his hopes would be blasted, and nothing would remain for him but
to end his days among the blacks. That night was a very anxious one
for him, and he lay awake a prey to many conflicting feelings. When
morning broke he had made up his mind to slip away from his companions
and make for the white encampment on the beach. He succeeded in eluding
observation, and arrived within sight of the tents after a journey of a
day and a night, the weather being very wintry and tempestuous all the
time.</p>

<p>The British ensign waving from a flag-pole showed him that his own
country-men had invaded the home of the black man once more. He was
completely overwhelmed and stupefied, and felt compelled to stand some
distance off in order to recover himself. Again he tried to remember or
recall his long-forgotten language, but without success. Like one in a
nightmare he was tongue-tied, and found, though his tongue moved, the
words he wished to utter came not at his bidding.</p>

<p>In this confused mental condition he strode over to where a number of
the coast natives were camped and sat with them. His arrival caused
great excitement among them, and when a white man came out of one of
the tents with a bucket to draw water from a well close by they pointed
Buckley out to him. Naturally he was greatly surprised and puzzled
at the appearance of the gigantic white man, with long matted hair
all over head and face, and dressed like the blacks in opossum skin,
and carrying the customary spears and boomerangs. His companions were
quickly called from the tent. They surrounded Buckley, asking him a
hundred questions, to none of which could he give an answer.</p>

<p>A glimmering of the meaning of some of the words at length seemed to
dawn upon him, though his tongue was still tied, and utterance came
not. By a sudden inspiration he bethought him of a tattoo mark, common
to sailors and soldiers, on his arm, and thrusting it forward he
pointed to the indistinct letters W. B. One of his interrogators then
made several guesses at their signification, but of course did not hit
upon the right one so far as his surname was concerned. At last the
mists of years rolled back, and Buckley remembered his own name, and
spoke. The words William Buckley came tremulously from his lips, almost
startling him with their strangeness. One of the men then asked him if
he would like some bread, and 'bread' was the next word Buckley managed
to articulate. His tongue having now been brought to use the speech of
his youth he, like a child, repeated several words, one by one, after
the white men.</p>

<p>It took him many days to regain sufficient knowledge of his lost
language, to understand from the strangers what object they had in view
in settling on this part of the coast. He then learned that they were
attached to Batman and Co.'s new association for the colonization of
the Port Phillip District. Batman, after concluding a treaty with the
natives, had returned to the island of Van Diemen's Land, whence the
expedition had originated, to obtain stores, stock, implements, and
men, in order to open up the new settlement.</p>

<p>The island of Van Diemen's Land to which Collin's expedition had sailed
in 1803, had by this time become an important colony, numbering 40,000
inhabitants. During Buckley's thirty-two years compulsory exile great
changes had also taken place throughout Australia. From the original
settlement at Port Jackson exploring expeditions had been fitted out,
and these were followed by the pioneer squatter into the far interior,
and thus ultimately the colony of South Australia had its beginning in
1834.</p>

<p>The colony of Western Australia (or the Swan River settlement) had
been founded in 1826. Portland Bay, two hundred miles west of Port
Phillip, had been settled by the Henty family in 1834; and now, in
June 1835, John Batman and his party had inaugurated the settlement on
the shores of Port Phillip. Both these later expeditions originated in
Van Diemen's Land, although Batman was influenced in his choice of the
site, by information which was given him by an old schoolmate of his in
New South Wales, Hamilton Hume, who had visited the neighbourhood in an
exploring expedition some years before.</p>

<p>To return to Buckley. He was invited to make himself at home till the
return of the vessel from Van Diemen's Land, which was expected in a
few days. Buckley's first heralds of the news of the arrival of the
white men now appeared on the scene, accompanied by a large number of
natives. They immediately camped around and about the settlement, and
invited Buckley to join them. Murder and robbery was their object,
and Buckley was asked to help them, saying that if he did not do so
they would sacrifice him with the others. Thereupon Buckley used some
diplomacy, and got them to postpone their idea till the coming back of
the ship, when, he said they would be able to gain more of the coveted
treasures. The blacks consented, but became very inpatient at last
and so threatening in their conduct that Buckley felt compelled to
throw off the mask of friendship and take side with the whites. Arming
himself with a gun, he swore that he would take the life of the first
man who raised a spear, and promised them presents in abundance should
they behave themselves. On seeing the turn affairs had taken their
courage failed them.</p>

<p>A few days later Batman (the leader), Wedge (the surveyor), and others
of the pioneering party arrived in the vessel. They were, of course,
astonished at seeing the white giant in the garb of a black man, and
his story greatly interested them. Batman, thinking that he would be
useful to the association as an interpreter and mediator between them
and the natives, offered to take him into their service. Buckley, on
his part, was willing, and once more resumed the garb of civilization.</p>

<p>It was not forgotten that he was a convict and still liable to serve
the unexpired term of his sentence. Mr. Wedge, with a kindliness
characteristic of him in his dealings with everybody, took Buckley's
case in hand, and drew up a petition in his behalf to the Governor of
Van Diemen's Land. In the course of a few weeks a conditional pardon
arrived with very commendable promptitude from Lieut.-Governor Arthur,
and Mr. Wedge records of Buckley, that 'on receiving his conditional
pardon his feelings were powerfully excited, so much so that it was
some time before he had the power of utterance. Never shall I forget
the joy that beamed in his countenance when I communicated that
he was a free man and again received within the pale of civilised
society. In desiring me to convey his grateful acknowledgements to
the Lieut.-Governor for his kindness, and to the gentleman who had
interested himself in his behalf, he was powerfully agitated; and if
ever man was sincere in giving vent to his feelings, Buckley was so in
expressing his thanks on this occasion.'</p>

<p>Little more remains to be said. Buckley's savage life was now over.
The association of settlers retained him in their services as a kind
of mediator and interpreter between themselves and the natives. The
headquarters of the settlement having been removed from Indented Heads
to the Yarra, Buckley was taken there, and had the honour of building
the first chimney for the embryo city. It was erected for the hut
occupied by John Batman and his family. As instancing the friendly
feeling which existed between the Batman family and Buckley, it might
be mentioned that Miss Batman very kindly provided the rescued giant
with a shirt made expressly for him by her own hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Wedge also took a fancy to Buckley, and got him to accompany him on
many expeditions into the bush. On one of these occasions, when out for
a week, they fell in with a family with whom Buckley had been living
for some months. He relates that the blacks were greatly affected when
they saw Buckley in his new garb, and wept bitterly when their old
companion prepared to depart from them; but Buckley says the present
of a blanket somewhat consoled them. These natives had never seen any
white man except Buckley, and now examined Mr. Wedge closely, even
going so far as to unbutton his waistcoat to see if he was white all
over.</p>

<p>Mr. Gellibrand, the solicitor to the Association, who arrived from
Van Diemen's Land shortly afterwards, became a friend to Buckley, and
took a great interest in his welfare. In fact, it was through his kind
offices that Buckley received the appointment of interpreter to the
association at a salary of £50 a year and rations.</p>

<p>Buckley had, however, one implacable enemy, in the person of John
Pascoe Fawkner, the rival of John Batman in the settlement of Port
Phillip. He regarded Buckley as an enemy to the whites, and an
encourager, if not the leader, of the blacks in depredations which were
frequently committed. Perhaps his expressions of dislike were evoked
by the fact of John Batman espousing the cause of the wild white-man,
for it is well known that 'little Johnny Fawkner,' with all his good
qualities, had a supreme abhorrence of those whose ideas clashed in any
way with his own interests or projects, and John Batman and party, who
had anticipated him in the founding of the colony by about a couple of
months, were a constant thorn in his side. *</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
[* Batman arrived May 30th, 1835. Fawkner's party arrived August 15th,
1835, and Fawkner himself on October 10th, 1835.]</p>
<br>

<p>On the arrival of Captain William Lonsdale as resident superintendent
in 1836, Buckley was given the position of constable; but the
appointment was a very irksome one to him, and he could not entirely
throw off the habits and ways of thinking engendered by his curious
experiences for more than a generation. Blacks and whites were equally
a disturbing element to him. Many of the latter were criminals at
large, and were not over particular in their dealings with the natives,
and consequently encounters frequently took place, in which blood
was not unfrequently shed. Buckley was no administrator. He could
not influence one or the other. He might be likened to a cork on the
surface of troubled waters, and was but the play of circumstances. His
old companions were rapidly becoming the victims of the white man, and
although reprisals were frequently taken, it was evident that but a
short period would elapse before they would all be obliged to succumb
to the superior force of the invader.</p>

<p>An event which stirred the little settlement to the utmost depths was
the disappearance of Messrs Gellibrand and Hesse, who had landed from
Hobart at Geelong, and had set out on horseback from that place for
Melbourne. They diverged a little from the usual track after leaving
the station of Dr. Thompson, taking with them a bullock-driver as a
guide, their object being to visit another run. They journeyed on
for some time, till they came to a thickly-wooded country, which was
entirely unknown to the guide. Becoming alarmed, he suspected that they
had now gone astray, and entreated them to retrace their steps; but
they were confident that ere long they would reach the place they were
seeking, and determined to push forward, whereupon the guide refused to
advance any further. He returned that same night from whence they had
all set out, and reported the circumstances of his unfortunate mistake.</p>

<p>Those on the station, however, felt that the two friends would not
come to harm, as Mr. Gellibrand had made frequent journeys into the
newly-settled country.</p>

<p>Twelve days later, when it was learned that the two gentlemen had not
arrived at Melbourne, great consternation was shown by everybody, and
fear was expressed that they had probably been murdered by the natives.
Search parties were organised. Buckley accompanied one of these, but
his services were found of no avail, as he says that his efforts were
frustrated by the proceedings of the rest of the party, who seemed
disinclined to trust him from their sight, either because they were
afraid to lose him as their guide, or because they were suspicious that
he would play them false. He returned to Melbourne, and was afterwards
given greater liberty in the prosecution of another search; but this
time his exertions were nullified by atrocities committed by the
whites, and some blackfellows whom they had armed with guns.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="2100161h-images/Woman and old man.jpg"><br><br></p>
<br>

<p>No trace of the missing gentleman was ever discovered, although all
available means were employed. Their mysterious disappearance cast a
gloom over everyone, and was the saddest incident connected with the
first settlement of Port Phillip. 'Mr. Gellibrand,' says Bonwick,
in his history of the settlement, 'was the prime mover of Batman's
expedition. He was the leading spirit of his times and colony. He was
recognised as the first lawyer in the island, and the most honest among
men. Defender of the oppressed, champion of freedom, denouncer of
wrong, he was not less esteemed as a private citizen, honoured for his
integrity, admired for his benevolence, and beloved for his domestic
virtues. Such a man brought dignity and character to the enterprise,
while aiding it by the wisdom of his counsels and the energy of his
efforts. The loss of so useful and so influential a leader was a
serious blow to the promoters in the infancy of their undertaking, and
deprived the unhappy natives of their best and most powerful friend.'
His loss was grievously felt by Buckley, and the poor fellow henceforth
seems to have taken no heart in his duties.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards he applied for permission to take a prisoner over to
Van Diemen's Land; and the little island appeared more to his liking
than the scene of his many years' wanderings under its new conditions.
On his return, therefore, he, after a few weeks' work at tracking some
sheep which had been stolen by the natives, tendered his resignation,
and left Port Phillip for ever.</p>

<p>He sailed from Melbourne on the 28th of December, 1837, and arrived at
Hobart Town on the 10th of January, 1838.</p>

<p>His appearance there created great interest, and a Van Demonian Barnum
of the period endeavoured to inveigle him on to the stage of the
theatre, there to exhibit him as the huge Anglo-Australian giant. But
Buckley did not fall into the trap, much to the chagrin of the man of
enterprise, who had publicly advertised his appearance.</p>

<p>An old shipmate of Buckley's, who had become a wealthy and respectable
settler, induced Buckley to live with him for a few weeks, and
afterwards applied to the Governor, Sir John Franklin, to give Buckley
some Government appointment. His efforts were successful, and Buckley
received the position of assistant storekeeper at the Immigrant's Home,
Hobart Town; and when this establishment was broken up a few months
later, he was transferred to the Female Nursery as gatekeeper.</p>

<p>In 1839 Buckley received the mournful news of the death of the
large-hearted John Batman, who had been such a true friend to him. This
grieved him very much, and it is related that the poor fellow wept most
bitterly, and for some time was inconsolable at the loss of one to whom
he had good reasons for feeling a sense of deep gratitude.</p>

<p>Whilst at the Immigrant's Home, Buckley made the acquaintance of a
respectable family, consisting of father, mother, and their daughter.
The father soon after left for Sydney, in order to better their
position, and while travelling overland from that place to Melbourne,
was speared by the natives of the Murray river. On hearing of his
death, Buckley offered his own hand and heart to the disconsolate
widow, and was accepted. They were married by the Rev. Mr. Ewing, of
the Church of England, Newtown, in the month of March, 1840. Buckley
was then sixty years old. His marriage was a happier one than his first
venture with the black widow; the care with which both his wife and her
daughter attended him shortly afterwards, during a serious illness from
typhus fever, fully attesting this.</p>

<p>In 1850 Buckley was pensioned off by the Convict Department on
£12 a year. A couple of years afterwards this small allowance was
supplemented by a grant of £40 a year from the Victorian Government.</p>

<p>Buckley lived on peacefully and unobtrusively till the year 1856,
when through an accident which happened while he was out in a gig, he
received such injury that death shortly followed.</p>

<p>Thus at the very old age of seventy-six passed away from life's fitful
scene one who had but too poorly played his part. Dull and reserved,
almost to stupidity, he was as a mere lay figure in the midst of his
surroundings. Had he possessed force of mind or intellect commensurate
with his gigantic stature and sturdy constitution, what a tale might
have been told of his exploits among the savages of New Holland! His
thirty-two years life with them might have changed the whole course
of their future history. It might have transformed the miserable
disjointed parties of wanderers and hunters, with their constant
internecine wars and diabolical practices, into something like a
homogeneous nation. But poor Buckley sank almost to the low level of
the blacks, and there is not the slightest evidence that his presence
modified their barbarous habits and customs in any way.</p>



<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII_THE_ABORIGINES_AND_THE_WHITES" id="CHAPTER_XIII_THE_ABORIGINES_AND_THE_WHITES">CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;THE ABORIGINES AND THE WHITES.</a></h2>


<p>WHEN Buckley made himself known to Batman's party at Indented Head
there were natives variously estimated at from 5,000 to 7,000 in number
in the district now called the Colony of Victoria. In the year 1889,
but fifty-four years after, there are not more than 500, including
half-castes. This rapid diminution has taken place notwithstanding
efforts on the part of the Government and many philanthropic societies.
The leaders of the original colonising party, Messrs. Batman, Wedge
and Gellibrand, and other gentlemen, were strongly desirous that the
natives should be treated with consideration, and did all in their
power to protect them from the cupidity and brutality of the rougher
element, necessarily constituting a portion of a community drawn from a
convict colony such as Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>As early as December 1836, a protectorate was formed to watch the
interests of the aboriginal inhabitants and to inculcate the tenets of
the Christian religion. This protectorate or mission station occupied
the site of the present Botanical Gardens on the banks of the Yarra.
Mr. George Langhorne, at a salary of £150 a year, was in charge of it,
and was assisted by John Thomas Smith, in the capacity of schoolmaster
to the natives at a salary of £40 a year. The latter gentleman
afterwards became Mayor of Melbourne on seven occasions. In course of
time, and as the white population increased, further efforts were made
to protect and provide for the dispossessed owners of the soil; but the
natives, even under the care of Philanthropy, Religion and the State,
could not adapt themselves to the new conditions. Consequently, at the
present time there are but few left, and these are kept, at an enormous
expenditure of money, apart from the white population on several large
stations or aboriginal reserves established by the Government.</p>

<p>The blacks who were not brought into these folds, but who preferred
to take their chances with the rest of the population, were quickly
disposed of. The more troublesome, who mistook sheep and cattle for
kangaroo and other native game, met their fate in a summary manner at
the hands of frontier shepherds and stockmen.</p>

<p>The aggressive ones who thus died off suddenly and violently by the
white man's pistols and guns, and not unfrequently by arsenic, were
followed in a little while by their more tractable brethren who
hung about squatters' stations and the townships, and were improved
out of existence by the no less effective weapons of superior
civilization&mdash;the white man's drink, diseases and vices.</p>

<p>Many of the natives evinced considerable aptitude for learning the
usual occupations of station life, and made themselves useful as
shepherds, stockmen, boundary riders, etc, etc. The Government utilised
a few as trackers, for their knowledge of bushcraft made them very
useful in the tracking of fugitive criminals. A native police force was
also organized. A body of the latter is still employed in Queensland,
where the blacks are numerous; but it is questionable whether the
Government has not unwittingly committed a crime in arming men having
the characteristics of Australian blacks. The atrocities these savage
and well-armed constabulary have been enabled to wreak upon their naked
country-men are past all description. *</p>

<p>[* See <i>Rusden's Australia,</i> E. M Curr's <i>Australian Race</i>, and
Gideon Lang's Lecture on the "Aborigines of Australia."]</p>

<p>The late Mr. Curr, the best authority on the Australian blacks, sums
up their present condition in the following sentences:&mdash;'The colonial
governments have collected the remnants of some or all of the tribes,
and located them on what in Victoria are called Aboriginal reserves.
These, of which there are six in Victoria, averaging between three
or four thousand acres each, are placed usually under the care of
missionaries, the blacks on them being fed, housed, and the young ones
educated, at the cost principally of the Treasury. Of the results
obtained on these reserves I can speak from experience, having
frequently visited them, and been for several years a member of a board
entrusted with their supervision. The missionaries, for the most part,
are Moravians from Germany, and some of them members of the Church
of England. On some of the reserves the teachers are officers of the
public Education Department. After a prolonged and careful inquiry into
the state of the blacks located on these establishments, I have come to
the following conclusions, which I think the records of the Aboriginal
Board of Victoria substantiate:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
'The children learn reading, writing, and arithmetic more easily
than white children, understand English pretty well, but speak it
indifferently, for the missionaries who teach them are generally
Germans, who themselves speak English badly.<br><br>

'The blacks on these reserves have easily been induced to give up
murder, cannibalism (to which they were never much addicted) and
polygamy. As regards religion and morality, passing over a little show,
it seems to me that they do not exist among them; and though these
blacks have been amongst us for forty years, and many of them were born
and brought up on our mission stations, I am convinced that were they
once more returned to their forests and cut off from communication with
the whites, they would in a single lifetime become again exactly what
we originally found them. . . . . . .<br><br>

'The only success which our treatment of them has had is in the
cultivation of their intellects; and if their education is persevered
with for several generations, I see no reason to prevent their being
brought in this particular to a level with ourselves. In bodily health
they have conspicuously receded. Their state of dependence on us has
undermined their former self-reliance, and left them without character.
Religion and civilisation our blacks have not attained. The white

<p>As published in the Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser, 23 April, 1897.</p>

<p>ABOUT the year 1847, when on an overland journey, I remained for some
time at Mr. Templar's station, Nanima, near Wellington, in New South
Wales, where there had been for many years, and until some three years
preceding my visit, a party of Moravian missionaries, who had been
very successful in civilizing the blacks. They had taken charge of the
natives, almost from infancy, and trained them up apparently free from
the vices and barbarities of the tribes.</p>

<p>While at Nanima, I constantly saw one of these blacks, named Jemmy,
a remarkably fine man, about twenty-eight years of age, who was the
'model Christian' of the missionaries, and who had been over and over
again described in their reports as a living proof that, taken in
infancy, the natives were as capable of being truly Christianized as a
people who had had eighteen centuries of cultivation.</p>

<p>I confess that I strongly doubted, but still there was no disputing the
apparent facts. Jemmy was not only familiar with the Bible, which he
could read remarkably well, but he was even better acquainted with the
more abstruse tenets of Christianity; and so far as the whites could
see, his behaviour was in accordance with his religious acquirements.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning I walked down to the blackfellows' camp, to have
a talk with Jemmy, as usual. I found him sitting in his gunyah,
overlooking the valley of the Macquarie, whose waters glanced brightly
in the sunshine of the delicious spring morning.</p>

<p>He was sitting in a state of nudity, excepting his waist-cloth, very
earnestly reading the Bible, which indeed was his constant practice;
and I could see that he was perusing the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p>I seated myself and waited till he concluded the chapter, when he
laid down the Bible, folded his hands, and sat with his eyes fixed
abstractedly on his fire. I bade him 'Good morning,' which he
acknowledged, without looking up. I then said, 'Jemmy, what is the
meaning of your spears being stuck in a circle round you?' He looked
me steadily in the eyes, and said, solemnly and with suppressed
fierceness, 'Mother's dead!' I said that I was very sorry to hear it,
'But what had her death to do with the spears being stuck around so?'
'Bogan black-fellow killed her!' was the fierce and gloomy reply.
'Killed by a Bogan black!' I exclaimed; 'Why, your mother has been
dying for a fortnight, and Dr. Curtis did not expect her to outlive
last night, which you know as well a I do.'</p>

<p>His only reply was a dogged repetition of the words, 'A Bogan
black-fellow killed her!' I appealed to him as a Christian&mdash;to the
Sermon on the Mount, that he had just been reading, but he absolutely
refused to promise that he would not avenge his mother's death.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of that day we were startled by a yell which can
never be mistaken by any person who has once heard the wild war-whoop
of the blacks when in battle array. On rushing out, we saw all the
blackfellows of the neighbourhood formed into a line, and following
Jemmy in an imaginary attack upon an enemy.</p>

<p>Jemmy himself disappeared that evening. On the following Wednesday
morning, I found him sitting complacently in his gunyah, plaiting a
rope of human hair, which I at once knew to be that of his victim.
Neither of us spoke; I stood for some time watching him as he worked
with a look of mocking defiance of the anger he knew I felt. I pointed
to a hole in the middle of his fire and said, 'Jemmy the proper place
for your bible is there;' he looked up with his eyes flashing as I
turned away, and never saw him again.</p>

<p>I afterwards learned that he had gone to the district of the Bogan
tribe, where the first black he met happened to be an old friend and
companion of his own. This man had just made the first cut in the bark
of a tree, which he was about to climb for an opossum; but on hearing
footsteps, he leaped down and faced round, as all blacks do, and whites
also when blacks are in question. Seeing that it was only Jemmy,
however, he resumed his occupation, but had no sooner set to work, than
Jemmy sent a spear through his back, and nailed him to the tree.</p>
