  <p align="center">1.</p>
  <p>IT  was the time when geese despond,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turkeys make their wills;<br>
    The time when Christians, to a man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive each other&rsquo;s bills;<br>
    It was the time when Christmas glee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of childhood fills.</p>
  <p align="center">2.</p>
  <p>Alas!  that, when the changing year<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings round the blessed day,<br>
    The hearts of little Queensland  boys<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wax keen to hunt and slay,&mdash;<br>
    As if the chime of Christmas time<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were but a call to prey.</p>
  <p align="center">3.</p>
  <p>Alas!  that when our dwellings teem<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With comfits and with toys&mdash;<br>
    When bat and ball and wicket call<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To yet sublimer joys&mdash;<br>
    Whatever can&rsquo;t be caught and killed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is stale to certain boys.</p>
  <p align="center">4.</p>
  <p>Strange  that, with such instructive things<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which to pick and choose,<br>
    With moral books and puzzle maps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That &ldquo;teach while they amuse,&rdquo;<br>
    Some boys can find no pleasure save<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In killing kangaroos.</p>
  <p align="center">5.</p>
  <p>Where  Quart Pot creek to Severn&rsquo;s stream<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mighty tribute rolls,<br>
    There stands a town&mdash;the happiest town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, betwixt the poles;<br>
    And all around is holy ground;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it&rsquo;s <i>full</i> of holes.</p>
  <p align="center">6.</p>
  <p>And  there, or thereabouts, there dwelt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Still dwells, for aught I know),<br>
    A little boy, whose moral tone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was lamentably low;<br>
    A shocking scamp, with just a speck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of good in embryo.</p>
  <p align="center">7.</p>
  <p>His  name was Bill; to wallabies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bore an evil will;<br>
    All things that hop on hinder legs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His function was to kill,<br>
    And from his show of scalps he won<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name, Marsupial Bill.</p>
  <p align="center">8.</p>
  <p>His  face and form were pinched and lean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dim his youthful eye:<br>
    Tis well that growing Queensland  boys<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should know the reason why;&mdash;<br>
    My little lads, &rsquo;twas all along<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of smoking on the sly.</p>
  <p align="center">9.</p>
  <p>Through  this was William small and lean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this his eye was dim,<br>
    Nor biceps rose on nerveless arm,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor calf on nether limb;&mdash;<br>
    Ye growing boys and hobbledehoys,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be warned by me&mdash;and him.</p>
  <p align="center">10.</p>
  <p>His  elevated shoulders stood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little way apart;<br>
    His elbow joints&mdash;but why rely<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mere descriptive art?<br>
    Come hither, hither, artist man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show them William&rsquo;s &ldquo;carte!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page008.jpg" width="342" height="550"></p>
  <p align="center">11.</p>
  <p>There.  That&rsquo;s the moral of himself;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if from it you guess<br>
    That Bill had thirteen summers seen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to acquiesce,<br>
    And further state his fighting weight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As five stun more or less.</p>
  <p align="center">12.</p>
  <p>And  should you ask how such a one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty hunter grew,<br>
    So many flying does outsped,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many boomers slew&mdash;<br>
    Bill owned a canine mate, to which<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His victories were due.</p>
  <p align="center">13.</p>
  <p>A  brute so complex that he set<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The fancy&rdquo; all agog;<br>
    Of breed that ne&rsquo;er found name in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibition catalogue!<br>
    Come hither, hither artist man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show them William&rsquo;s dog!</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page009.jpg" width="509" height="550"></p>
  <p align="center">14.</p>
  <p>On  Christmas-eve, at set of sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hollow tree he sought;<br>
    A match, a scratch, a puff, and Bill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was lost in smoke and thought,<br>
    And &ldquo;all his battles o&rsquo;er again&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fervid fancy fought.</p>
  <p align="center">15.</p>
  <p>No  ha&rsquo;penny thing, no penny thing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No thing of common clay<br>
    Such brilliant memories evoked,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hopes as bright as they&mdash;<br>
    It was his father&rsquo;s Sunday pipe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Bill had stolen away.</p>
  <p align="center">16.</p>
  <p>For  many a time and oft had he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admired the wondrous bowl,<br>
    The stem, the mouthpiece, and the <i>tout</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ensemble</i> of  the whole,<br>
    Until desire of it had grown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of his soul&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">17.</p>
  <p>Until  desire o&rsquo;ergrew the fear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of kick, or cuff, or stripe.<br>
    That eve, when Bill stepped forth from home<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guilty scheme was ripe&mdash;<br>
    His right-hand trouser-leg concealed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father&rsquo;s Sunday pipe.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page10.jpg" width="500" height="216"></p>
  <p align="center">18.</p>
  <p>And  now within a heaven of smoke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the tree he leant,<br>
    The while the mellow influence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all his vitals went,<br>
    And for the first time in his life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew what meerschaum meant.</p>
  <p align="center">19.</p>
  <p>So  subtly stole the influence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His inmost being through,<br>
    He did not mark the sudden bark<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That signalled kangaroo,<br>
    Nor noted that his constant mate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had vanished from his view.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page011.jpg" width="456" height="650"></p>
  <p align="center">20.</p>
  <p>His  mind and eye were on the pipe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he had just begun<br>
    To count how many scalps would go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To purchase such a one,&mdash;<br>
    When turning round his head, he saw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the setting sun,</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page012.jpg" width="594" height="650"></p>
  <p align="center">21.</p>
  <p>A  Boomer! . . . and, as when the waves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close o&rsquo;er a drowning head,<br>
    Sudden the whole forgotten past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the soul lies spread,<br>
    And all the charge-sheet of a life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one brief glance is read&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">22.</p>
  <p>Ev&rsquo;n  so in instant tumult thronged,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About his wildered mind,<br>
    A thousand shapes of wounded things,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every size and kind;<br>
    And some were scalped, and some were maimed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some were docked behind.</p>
  <p align="center">23.</p>
  <p>The  kangaroo, the wallaroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wallaby was there;<br>
    The &rsquo;possum jabbered in its fright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sore wept the native bear;<br>
    The stricken paddamelon moaned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its ineffectual prayer;<br>
    The battered &rsquo;guana fixed on him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its dull remonstrant stare;<br>
    While tail-less lizards swarmed and crawled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About him everywhere;<br>
    And limbless frogs denounced him with<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The croaking of despair;<br>
    And tortured bats with ghostly wings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clung to his stiffened hair;&mdash;<br>
    But suddenly the vision passed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bill became aware<br>
    That he was in the Boomer&rsquo;s arms,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bounding through the air.</p>
  <p align="center">24.</p>
  <p>Hop,  hop, they went o&rsquo;er broken wilds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, stacked in many a mound,<br>
    The hoards of clay-embedded ore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose grimly all around:&mdash;<br>
    Unheeding miners&rsquo; rights, they jumped<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim at every bound.</p>
  <p align="center">25.</p>
  <p>Then  on o&rsquo;er wastes so very bare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even &ldquo;stripping&rdquo; ceased;<br>
    And as they neared the hill countrie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frightful pace increased;<br>
    Nor granite slope nor timbered ridge<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told on the tireless beast.<br>
    The sun went down, the full-orbed moon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came swimming up the East,<br>
    Nor yet the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; slackened speed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet his prey released.</p>
  <p align="center">26.</p>
  <p>Still  on and on, till from a cliff<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentry challenged near,&mdash;<br>
    Though what the challenge or reply<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mortal man may hear;<br>
    We only know that for a sign<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each drooped his dexter ear.</p>
  <p align="center">27.</p>
  <p>Whate&rsquo;er  it meant, the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; checked<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His onward course thereat,<br>
    Dropped Bill, and dragged him by the wrists<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across a wooded flat,<br>
    To where the KANGAROO-GEMOT<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In full assembly sat.</p>
  <p align="center">28.</p>
  <p>Ringed  by the fathers of the tribe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surrounded yet alone,<br>
    The Bossaroo superbly posed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a granite throne&mdash;<br>
    A very old &ldquo;old man&rdquo; who had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four generations known.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page015.jpg" width="850" height="630"></p>
  <p align="center">29.</p>
  <p>Upon  his mournful eye the woes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all his race were writ;<br>
    Yet age and sorrow had not dimmed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His majesty a whit;&mdash;<br>
    And, oh, his metatarsal bones<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displayed the real grit!</p>
  <p align="center">30.</p>
  <p>Nor  unattended sat the sires;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them crouched their mates;<br>
    Nor kangaroos alone composed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Congress of the States,<br>
    But all proscribed marsupial breeds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had sent their delegates.</p>
  <p align="center">31.</p>
  <p>Lo,  at a signal from the boss<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serried ring gave way,<br>
    And through an opening in the throng<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captor dragged his prey,<br>
    Bowed to the chair, then called to aid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strapping M.L.A.</p>
  <p align="center">32.</p>
  <p>And  thus, betwixt a double guard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner found his place;<br>
    And all around were wrathful eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a gleam of grace;&mdash;<br>
    One wide concatenated scowl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was focussed on his face.</p>
  <p align="center">33.</p>
  <p>Now  hitherto poor Bill had been<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dumb as dumb could be,<br>
    But at that pandomoniac scowl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His struggling tongue got free;<br>
    He lifted up his voice and cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, please, it wasn&rsquo;t me;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">34.</p>
  <p>A  tumult rose; but with a sign<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss the riot checked,<br>
    Then cleared his throat, and bade the guard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner&rsquo;s clothes inspect:&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Ay, ay, Sir!&rdquo; came the prompt reply,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or words to that effect.</p>
  <p align="center">35.</p>
  <p>They  spake the language that was heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet the world was young;<br>
    And he who knows it knows all speech<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That out of it hath sprung:&mdash;<br>
    (With compliments to Doctor Hearn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Aryan tongue).</p>
  <p align="center">36.</p>
  <p>And  should you ask how Bill was up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To every word they said,<br>
    And how such antiquated lore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had got into his head&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas his pre-natal memory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That served him in such stead.</p>
  <p align="center">37.</p>
  <p>They  searched the prisoner&rsquo;s clothes, and first<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They brought the pipe to view,&mdash;<br>
    For, though it is a mystery<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me as well as you,<br>
    It is a solemn fact that Bill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had stuck to it all through.</p>
  <p align="center">38.</p>
  <p>Then  one by one his poor effects<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were collared by his guards,&mdash;<br>
    Peach-stones, fig-chew, a catapult,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greasy pack of cards,<br>
    A half-cut cake of cavendish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Prime quality&mdash;Gaujard&rsquo;s);</p>
  <p align="center">39.</p>
  <p>But  when from out a leathern sheath<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloodstained knife they drew,<br>
    All round the court, from hand to hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed it in review;<br>
    Each sniffed the blade in turn, and each<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn said&mdash;&ldquo;Kangaroo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">40.</p>
  <p>And  last, a printed document<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their simple souls perplexed;<br>
    Each eyed the paper learnedly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed it to the next;<br>
    But not an Aryan of them all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could even guess the text.</p>
  <p align="center">41.</p>
  <p>At  length they summoned to their aid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old and learned clerk,<br>
    Who, as tradition told, had been<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Noah in the ark&mdash;<br>
    Though possibly tradition here<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had overshot the mark.</p>
  <p align="center">42.</p>
  <p>And  while a murmur of applause<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the Congress ran,<br>
    Bowed with the weight of many years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopped forth that gray &ldquo;old man,&rdquo;<br>
    Mounted his moonlight barnacles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneezed thrice, and thus began:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">43.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whereas  it is expedient to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encourage the destruc-<br>
    -tion of marsupial animals&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sensation, and a ruc-<br>
    -tion in the court, with groans and cries<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From joey, doe, and buck)&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">44.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  it enacted therefore by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen&rsquo;s most Excellent<br>
  &mdash;er&mdash;Majesty&mdash;er&mdash;by and with<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advice and the consent<br>
    Of Council and Assembly of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queensland in Parliament&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">45.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the construction of this Act&mdash;&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here arose a sort<br>
    Of interruption from the Right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt a cough and snort,<br>
    While from the less fastidious Left<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came cries of &ldquo;Cut it short!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">46.</p>
  <p>Then  clause on clause with careless haste<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned clerk despatched;<br>
    But when he read, &ldquo;The scalps when shown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have the ears attached,&rdquo;<br>
    The whole assembly rushed the guard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the prisoner snatched.</p>
  <p align="center">47.</p>
  <p>But  when the reader raised his voice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus gave forth the sense,<br>
  &ldquo;For kangaroo scalps ninepence each,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wallabies&rsquo; <i>three </i>pence,&rdquo;<br>
    Division rose amongst his foes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stayed their violence.</p>
  <p align="center">48.</p>
  <p>For  those at ninepence each, elate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such a mark of fame,<br>
    Drew back, and left the threepenny mob<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do the deed of shame;<br>
    But the low-quoted wallabies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disgusted, dropped the game.</p>
  <p align="center">49.</p>
  <p>Bill  strove to speak; his voice was drowned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With catcall, groan, and hiss,<br>
    Until the Bossaroo, with slow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial emphasis,<br>
    Said, &ldquo;Capias-nisi-prius&mdash;Boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What say you to all this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">50.</p>
  <p>Then  silence fell upon the peers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the threepenny mob,<br>
    The while this wicked little boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, snivelling through a sob,<br>
  &ldquo;Oh please, I never done it, Sir&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, never; sepmebob!</p>
  <p align="center">51.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a gentle orphan boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor never jines no row:<br>
    My father is a tributer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother keeps a cow:<br>
    We always lives respectable:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tries it, anyhow:<br>
    The bill as that old bloke has read<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never seen till now;<br>
    And that &rsquo;ere blood&rsquo;s on that &rsquo;ere knife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since father killed the sow.</p>
  <p align="center">52.</p>
  <p>Then  spake the Boss:&mdash;&ldquo;The quality<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mercy is not strained;<br>
    Yet there is still a point or two<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;d like to have explained,<br>
    Ere we absolve you from the charge<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon you stand arraigned.</p>
  <p align="center">53.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  since the law is merciful,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hastes not to condemn,<br>

    The court will sit to-morrow night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nine fifteen, p.m.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You dare not home return,&mdash;<br>
    (Our ancient brother with the specs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has twigged the whole concern;<br>
    And, truly, what he doesn&rsquo;t know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain&rsquo;t worth your while to learn):&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">55.</p>
  <p>And  further, since the oath of man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but of scant avail,<br>
    And few like Regulus return<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spontaneously to jail&mdash;<br>
    (My fit is coming on; I feel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symptoms in my tail)&mdash;<br>
    We will dispense with oaths, and keep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meerschaum as your bail.</p>
  <p align="center">56.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;(oh  my vertebra!)&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow night at eight,<br>
    At the Wheal Edith, by the flume,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corp&rsquo;ral&rsquo;s guard will wait;<br>
    These shall escort your witnesses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blindfolded. Don&rsquo;t be late.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one of all the race<br>
    Whose leaders boss this scalping job<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May stand before my face;<br>
    The witness of a Britisher<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will prejudice your case</p>
  <p align="center">58.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process&mdash;(oh my toe!)&mdash;<br>
    Your downward path is up above,<br>

  <p align="center">59.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  take this for thy dowry, boy,<br>

  <p>Fast  flew the hours. We may not tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of William&rsquo;s weary quest,<br>
    How round the outskirts of the town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roamed like one possessed&mdash;<br>
    Nor with what guileful arts he plied<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign interest.</p>
  <p align="center">2.</p>
  <p>Enough  that at the appointed hour,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With backers at his back,<br>
    He faced the noble Bossaroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Still hypochondriac)&mdash;<br>
    And introduced his witnesses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A yellow and a black;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page025.jpg" width="500" height="434"></p>
  <p align="center">3.</p>
  <p>A  placid-eyed Mongolian<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From sandy Pechelee,<br>
    Who&rsquo;d stimulate an inch of soil<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do the work of three,<br>
    Or make a metamorphic rock<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprout into cabbagee;</p>
  <p align="center">4.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  big buck nigger&rdquo; next; who once<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowed down to stocks and stones,<br>
    (For years digested captives formed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tissue of his bones),<br>
    But now he is an Anglican,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who a live &ldquo;Bissop&rdquo; owns,<br>
    Besides a gorgeous suit of slops,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the proud name of Jones.</p>
  <p align="center">5.</p>
  <p>Slow  rose the lordly Bossaroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade unveil their eyes;<br>
    And, when those aliens gazed around<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all that dread assize,<br>
    They howled in unison and made<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night hideous with their cries.</p>
  <p align="center">6.</p>
  <p>For  Bill had lured them lyingly&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why should we explain;<br>
    The whole thing was exceptional,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can&rsquo;t occur again.<br>
    Besides, to poke at mysteries<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wanton and profane.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page027.jpg" width="569" height="600"></p>
  <p align="center">7.</p>
  <p>With  single will they turned on Bill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blazed his evil name;<br>
    With double tongue their charge they flung,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swore unto the same;<br>
    With treble spite did both unite<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spoil his little game.</p>
  <p align="center">8.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  see him catchce kangaloo,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deponed on oath Ah Chee;<br>
  &ldquo;Me see him&mdash;hi! hst!&mdash;soolem dog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mind my cabbagee&mdash;<br>
    Me lose hap clown, him knockee down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten twenty lettucee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">9.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Massoopy  Bill, him wicked boy,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deponed the South Sea swell;<br>
  &ldquo;Two moon, come Bissop preach in chuch,<br>

    Me run&mdash;him run&mdash;me catch&mdash;him say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree scalp if you no tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">10.</p>
  <p>So,  when the learned clerk had both<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their depositions read,<br>
    The judge drew forth his judgment cap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put it on his head,<br>
    And sentenced poor Marsupial Bill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hang till he was dead.</p>
  <p align="center">11.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  since&rdquo;&mdash;so spake the Bossaroo&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;From evidence we know<br>
    That many a scalped and gory head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night through him lies low,<br>
    We&rsquo;ll scalp him first!&rdquo;&mdash;and all the house,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Nem. con</i>.,  cried &ldquo;Be it so!&rdquo;<br>
    And as a sign and seal of doom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned down the right thumb-toe.</p>
  <p align="center">12.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  his own knife,&rdquo; the Boss resumed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah Chee shall do the deed.<br>
    The gods are just (oh, my poor back!)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make the assassin bleed<br>
    By his own proper instrument.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mongolian, proceed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page029.jpg" width="850" height="534"></p>
  <p align="center">13.</p>
  <p>What  followed next, who gave the word<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mate to link with mate,<br>
    Nor Bill, nor Jones, nor yet Ah Chee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can very clearly state;<br>
    But that &rsquo;twas a corroboree<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three corroborate.</p>
  <p align="center">14.</p>
  <p>In  vain poor William prayed&mdash;in vain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His suppliant knees he bowed,<br>
    And by a pile of sacred names<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mercy cried aloud&mdash;<br>
    The point was at his occiput,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, lo! from out the crowd</p>
  <p align="center">15.</p>
  <p>Stepped  forth a rare and radiant dame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boss&rsquo;s pride and stay,<br>
    (The dam of the Boss&aacute;rovitch,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still young, though somewhat gray,<br>
    An elegant marsupial,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-mannered, <i>bien  n&eacute;e</i>)&mdash;<br>
    Stepped forth before them, and remarked<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seductively, &ldquo;Belay!&rdquo;<br>
    Then, kneeling by the judgment seat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus sweetly said her say:&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Most Noble Grand, have you forgot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is Christmas Day?</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page031.jpg" width="550" height="556"></p>
  <p align="center">16.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beseech  you, bid that heathen hand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withhold the bloody knife!<br>
    Recall your fearful words of doom&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay turn not from your wife,<br>
    But give me as a Christmas Box<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little captive&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">17.</p>
  <p>Then  quickly from his granite throne<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down leaped the Noble Grand,<br>
    And, kneeling, kissed right courteously<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His royal lady&rsquo;s hand;<br>
    Then, as he raised her up, pronounced<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyful countermand;<br>
    Whereat the rest turned up their toes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Bill might understand<br>
    The Congress willed his days should yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be long upon the land.</p>
  <p align="center">18.</p>
  <p>Then  raged, the revelry anew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sound of drum and fife;<br>
    The Boss himself forgot his woes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And danced as if for life;<br>
    While the old clerk forgot <i>himself</i>.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed the Boss&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p align="center">19.</p>
  <p>And  when there fell a weariness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all the panting throng,<br>
    And Bossaroo and ancient clerk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike had nigh &ldquo;gone bong,&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
    Amid a jaded pause was heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A call for &ldquo;Joey&rsquo;s Song!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">20.</p>
  <p>And  presently a little head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a little nest,<br>
    Peeped o&rsquo;er a snug maternal pouch,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sang its little best;<br>
    (The song is very rare, and full<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of antique interest)</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page032.jpg" width="300" height="301"></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page033.jpg" width="850" height="450"></p>
  <p align="center">21.</p>
  <p>He  ceased; the pre-diluvian clerk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose on his quivering shanks,<br>
    And with a well-turned compliment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed a vote of thanks&mdash;<br>
    Just then a breathless picket broke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gory through the ranks!</p>
  <p align="center">22.</p>
  <p>But  ere his trembling tongue had time<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell his tale of woe,<br>
    And why thus grimly he disturbed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy <i>status  quo</i>,&mdash;<br>
    With giant bound, Bill&rsquo;s faithful hound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped madly on the foe!</p>
  <p align="center">23.</p>
  <p>Ah,  then and there was sudden scare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swiftest took the lead;<br>
    Ah, there and then&mdash;but oh, the pen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is impotent indeed!<br>
    Come hither, hither, artist man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show the Great Stampede!</p>
  <p align="center">24.</p>
  <p>What  next befel may somewhat strain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limits of belief;<br>
    But where so many marvels are,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why boggle at the chief?<br>
  &rsquo;Twere shame if lack of faith should cause<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our moral come to grief.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100421h-images/page035.jpg" width="850" height="532"></p>
  <p align="center">25.</p>
  <p>From  all the flying ruck the dog<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had singled out the queen;<br>
    Another instant, and the Boss<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A widower had been,<br>
    When&mdash;(that&rsquo;s a pithy saw that bids<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expect the unforeseen)&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">26.</p>
  <p>Bill  CALLED HIM OFF! The dog drew back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on a boulder leant.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas months ago, and still that dog<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is pondering the event,<br>
    And even to this very hour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can&rsquo;t fathom what it meant;<br>
    It was a thing so utterly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a precedent.</p>
  <p align="center">27.</p>
  <p>But  Bill, the Chinaman, and Jones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen, and you, and I,<br>
  <i>We</i> know the secret of the change,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>We</i> know the  reason why;<br>
    And&mdash;may I be allowed to add?&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral hangs thereby.</p>
  <p align="center">28.</p>
  <p>But  since nor boy nor man receives<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advice without a pang,<br>
    And this narrator&rsquo;s muse hath failed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the proper twang,&mdash;<br>
    The moral hanging plainly there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose we let it&mdash;hang.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Note"></a>Note</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Marsupial  Bill&rdquo; was preceded in the <i>Queenslander</i> by the following paragraph, which is here quoted, in order to show that the  story is not altogether without foundation in fact:&mdash;</p>
  <p>We  (<i>Stannum Miner</i>) are indebted to Mr.  James Warrell, of Sugarloaf, a gentleman on whose veracity we place the best  reliance, for the following account of a most extraordinary occurrence. We give  the statement as nearly as possible in Mr. Warrell&rsquo;s own words:&mdash;&ldquo;I give you the  details of a very rare occurrence. A boy of mine, about 11 years old, was sent  a message last Saturday week, about 1 o&rsquo;clock, p.m. About half-way between my  place and Connolly&rsquo;s, on a well used road, a kangaroo came from behind, took  him up, and carried him, without stopping, to the Maryland Company&rsquo;s  ground&mdash;about a mile and a-half&mdash;over some very rough country. The lad got back  home about dusk, his face bloody, and seemingly half mad. He soon became  sensible, however, and by the time I got home&mdash;an hour afterwards&mdash;he was  sufficiently recovered to be interviewed.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, Willie, did you  not see the kangaroo before he caught you?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; No, he was just on to  me before I knew.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Were there any more kangaroos ?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not  then, but about half-way there was a big mob of kangaroos, and we all went  together.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose you were crying?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; Yes, all the  way.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When he dropped you, what did he do?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing;  stood and looked at me for a minute, and then went off with the mob.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What  did you do then?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember anything after that. After  sundown I found myself at the Lincolnshire  mine, near where the engine was, and then I made for home.&rdquo; I think the lad  must have been crazy for awhile; his coat was split open down the back, but,  although his face was covered with blood when he got home, there was not a  scratch on him. The kangaroo must have been a good sized one to carry him  (about 65lbs. weight) so far, and without a spell; and it seems strange that in  the act of jumping he did not strike the boy with his foot. I have not the  slightest reason to doubt the truth of the boy&rsquo;s statement. What was the motive  that prompted the action? Some say that if there had been any water convenient  he would have drowned the boy. I have a notion that the kangaroo was one that  had lost its joey, and was making an attempt to adopt one. Moral: When a child  of tender years goes alone where kangaroos may be, a dog, large or small, is  very good company.</p>
