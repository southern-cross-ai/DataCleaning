  The Funeral Of The Elder Son</h2>
<p>A drizzling rain fell upon the long grass and the  moss-grown tombstones of the churchyard of Olney, a village in Lincolnshire, Every now and  then, beaten down by this incessant rain, a dead leaf fell from one of a row of  sycamores, which bordered the low churchyard wall, and dropped heavily upon the  graves beneath the trees.</p>
<p>No gleam of sunshine relieved the dull gray of the  September sky.</p>
<p>A cluster of villagers and village children,  grouped together at one angle of the irregular stone-wall, drew their wet  clothes closer round them, and shivered as if this September had been January.</p>
<p>From one side of the churchyard sounded the  monotonous voice of the curate, reading the funeral service.</p>
<p>At the white gate, on the other side of the church,  waited three mourning-coaches, surrounded by another group of village children,  who, regardless of the perpetual rain, stood staring open-mouthed at the long-tailed  black horses and the solemn-visaged charioteers.</p>
<p>The funeral service ended, the chief mourner walked  slowly through the churchyard, followed by the seven or eight gentlemen who had  been present at the ceremony, The grief of that chief mourner was evident to  all; his hollow eyes were dry and tearless, and he walked along the narrow  path, looking straight before him, with an air of gloomy abstraction. He took  his seat in one of the coaches, accompanied by his uncle, a gray-haired old  farmer, and the village attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must bear up &mdash; you must bear up, my dear Dudley,&rdquo; said the gray-haired man, as the mourning-coach  lumbered along the uneven paving of Olney High-street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Uncle Richard; but it&rsquo;s harder to bear  than I ever thought it would be,&rdquo; said the chief mourner; and to the surprise  of his companions he let down the window at his side, and, putting out his  head, looked back at the churchyard they had left. He remained in this position  till a turn in the street completely hid the burial-ground from his view, and  then drawing in his head, he closed the window with a short sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy, he wants to have a last look at his  brother&rsquo;s grave,&rdquo; said the gray-haired man to the lawyer, while his nephew  looked out of the carriage-window.</p>
<p>After this the chief mourner sat silent and  motionless, looking fixedly out at the flat high-road, and the dripping leaves  and shivering cattle in the wet fields.</p>
<p>He was a man of one-and-twenty, but looked much  older.</p>
<p>He had a fair complexion, a small straight nose, very  red, womanish lips, a slightly-receding chin, a low forehead, large blue eyes,  and light auburn hair. He was rather handsome, and was generally said to have a  most prepossessing countenance.</p>
<p>He was the younger son of the late Arthur Carleon,  gentleman farmer, and proprietor of the Grey Farm, an estate of some importance  in the estimation of the simple Olney folks.</p>
<p>The dwelling-house of this Grey Farm stood a mile  away from the high-road, and the pathway leading to it lay by the side of a  river &mdash; a narrow, dismal river, on which coal-barges went up and down between  Grimsby and Lincoln.</p>
<p>The lands of the farm, which consisted of three  hundred and eighty acres, lay flat and low on the border of this river,  stretching down to the shelving bank, and only divided by this bank from the  water, which constantly overflowed the meadows nearest to the river-side.</p>
<p>Along this bank the three mourning-coaches drove  slowly and carefully, &mdash; a road dangerous at the best of times; at night doubly  dangerous.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour&rsquo;s driving brought the dismal <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> to the gates of the garden in  front of the farmhouse. The mourners alighted, and silently assembled in a  long, low, oak-panelled apartment, furnished in the ponderous fashion of half a  century ago.</p>
<p>The Carleons were one of the oldest families in Lincolnshire. The house of  the Grey Farm was filled with portraits of fine gentlemen, in doublets and  hose; soldiers who had fallen at Bosworth and Flodden; cavaliers who had fought  at Worcester, and brave soldiers and loyal gentlemen who had helped to beat the  rebels on Marston Moor; but for the last hundred and fifty years the sword had  been exchanged for the ploughshare, and the Carleons had been farmers from  father to son.</p>
<p>The estate of the Grey Farm &mdash; which was so called  from having originally belonged to a body of the order of Grey Friars, who  built an abbey upon the land &mdash; was bought, in 1700, by a younger son of the  house of Carleon, the elder branch of which becoming extinct, all other estates  belonging to the family had fallen into Chancery, and the Carleons had sunk  into simple gentlemen farmers.</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon walked to the wide fireplace, in  which a dull flame struggled with the thick smoke from a mass of black coal.  The young man leant against the angle of the high chimney-piece, and turned his  face away from the other gentlemen, whom his gloomy silence considerably  embarrassed.</p>
<p>A young woman, the principal female servant,  dressed, like her master, in the deepest mourning, busied herself in handing  about wine and cake. After taking it to the visitors, she offered it to Dudley  Carleon; but the young man, hearing the jingle of the glasses at his elbow,  looked up suddenly, and shook his head with an impatient gesture. He was very  pale, and his eyes were surrounded by dark circles, which gave the light-blue  eyes a strangely-haggard appearance.</p>
<p>One of the gentlemen, an attorney from Olney, read  the will of the deceased. It was very simple. Martin Carleon had had nothing to  bestow but the farm and homestead, on which he was born, and on which he had  lived his short life of three-and-twenty years. He had died of an ague,  produced, according to the doctors, by the fatal dampness of the Grey Farm.  Young, handsome, vigorous, and athletic, the farmer had succumbed, after a  lingering illness, under this painful and exhausting disease. He had never  married, and Dudley was his only brother; so  no one had ever felt any doubt as to who would inherit his property. The  estate, though it had gone straight down from father to son for a hundred and fifty  years, had never been entailed, and the will of Martin&rsquo;s father had left no  provision for the event of the young man&rsquo;s dying childless; but the attachment  between the brothers was known to have been so sincere, that this will was  looked upon as a mere form. It was worded as everyone had expected:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Martin Carleon, being at this time of sound  mind, though weak in bodily health, do hereby give, will, and bequeath, to my  beloved brother, Dudley Carleon, all those lands, tenements, and out-buildings,  known as the Grey Farm, together with all live stock, farming implements,&rdquo;  &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>A few trifling legacies followed: a gold snuff-box  to his uncle, Richard Weston, the gray-haired old man present at the reading of  the will; his watch and chain to a young lady to whom he had been engaged to be  married; and some bequests to the servants.</p>
<p>During the reading of the will the young man had  never once lifted his head from its recumbent position against the angle of the  chimney-piece; but when it was quite finished, and the visitors rose from their  chairs, and approached Dudley, prior to taking their departure, he looked up at  them with the same expression his face had worn at the gate of the churchyard &mdash;  an expression that seemed to say, &ldquo;What ought I to do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he stammered in answer to the  consolatory speeches addressed to him. &ldquo;Yes, I will do my best to bear his  loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said these words again and again, in an absent,  helpless manner, and breathed a sigh of relief as the door closed upon the funeral  party, and he was left alone with his uncle. For some time he remained silent,  his face buried in his hands, while the old man sat looking at him furtively,  as if almost afraid to speak. Presently he looked up and said, with strange  abruptness, &ldquo;Do you know if Agnes Marlow is very sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes Marlow was the daughter of the Rector of  Olney, and had been the promised wife of Martin Carleon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say so at Olney,&rdquo; answered Mr. Weston, &ldquo;They  say that she is very ill, and has seen no one but her father since your  brother&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>She came here the night  before he died. When her father was sent for, she heard the message, and stole  out of the house after him, and followed him down here. I shall never forget  her white face as she stood at the door of Martin&rsquo;s room. I shall never forget  her white face &mdash; it haunts me to-day more than his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor boy, these are silly fancies. Agnes  Marlow&rsquo;s grief has nothing to do with you. You did your duty to your poor  brother from the first to the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; muttered Dudley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something! Everything. Martin was a good brother  to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon shivered involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very good brother. He had hard work to keep up  your allowance at college, I can tell you, Dudley. But he always said that one  farmer at a time was quite enough in the Carleon family, and that you should be  a man of education, and a polished gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a dependent on my brother&rsquo;s bounty,&rdquo; said Dudley bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dudley. Martin never thought anything he did  for you a bounty or a favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Martin, perhaps; but other people thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Weston gave a little murmur of deprecation, and  then, not knowing what further remark to make, lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>The old man was to dine and spend the night at the  Grey Farm, as Thorpe Grange, his own house, was ten miles on the other side of  Olney. The uncle and nephew dined in a room adjoining the oak parlour in which  the will had been read, and were waited on by a maid-servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will manage the farm yourself, Dudley?&rdquo;  said Mr. Weston, as they sat over their wine, the room only lighted by a  blazing fire, and the sky outside the windows darkening with the September  twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I may not know as much of agriculture as poor  Martin, but I know a little, and I can learn more. In short, I&rsquo;ll accept the  fate of the Carleons, and turn gentleman farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>There&rsquo;s only one thing I&rsquo;m  afraid of, Dudley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your chance of falling ill of the ague and fever  that killed Martin. The doctors attribute his illness to the air of the Grey  Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why is it that the men who live upon the  premises, and are at work in the fields from sunrise to sunset, from the first  of January to the thirty-first of December, have never fallen ill of the ague  that killed poor Martin? Take my word for it, it was not the Grey Farm that  caused my brother&rsquo;s death; his constitution could not have been a strong one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such a tall, broad-chested, powerful young  man,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is often the first to sink under an illness which  the ignorance of his medical attendant attributes to a wrong cause. Martin had  lived on the Grey Farm for three-and-twenty years, and if this autumn has been  cold and rainy, other autumns have been cold and rainy; if the farm has been  half under water this year, it has been half under water many a year. It&rsquo;s my  opinion, Uncle Weston, that Martin&rsquo;s life might have been saved if his doctor  had not been an inefficient blockhead. That&rsquo;s partly the cause of my grief for  my brother. I consider him a sacrifice to the ignorance of two medical  practitioners, and I shall never forgive myself for not having sent to London for a physician  before it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you did send, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I telegraphed to London half an hour before he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you have done your duty. But tell  me,&rdquo; continued the old man, anxious to change the conversation, <i>&ldquo;</i>about your domestic arrangements. You  retain all the servants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every labourer on the farm, every maid-servant in  the kitchen. No servant ever leaves the Carleons &mdash; except for the churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young woman who handed the wine round after  the funeral &mdash; she looks rather superior to the rest &mdash; who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I suppose it was Martha. She was my brother&rsquo;s  housekeeper. She is the sister of my bailiff, a very clever young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is rather a handsome girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so? Too pale, too dark, too heavy. She  has never been young, I think, that girl; I can always remember her equally  grave and puritanical, with a pale solemn face and straight hair plastered over  her forehead; but she is an excellent housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a very young housekeeper, Dudley. I should  be rather afraid of her, if I were you. Bachelor farmers sometimes marry their  housekeepers, nowadays. It has grown into a fashion; and the women know it, and  play their cards accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must play a deeper game than I give her credit  for, clever as she is, if she wants to catch me,&rdquo; said Dudley.  &ldquo;I have a little of the ambition of the old Carleons, and there is no record of  any of them having married their servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little after ten o&rsquo;clock Dudley Carleon led his  uncle up the wide oak staircase to the apartment prepared for him.</p>
<p>To reach this room they had to pass through a long  corridor, on one side of which was a row of solid oak doors, leading into the  bedrooms. Before the first of these doors Dudley Carleon stopped, with a  ghastly face, and leaned for support against the wall behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely; &ldquo;the room he  died in. This is the very spot on which Agnes Marlow stood on the night of my  brother&rsquo;s death. Talk of ghosts,&rdquo; he said with a hollow laugh; &ldquo;if you can  fancy a corpse galvanised into life, you can fancy how she looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, my dear boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pity me. I&rsquo;m a coward &mdash; a miserable,  superstitious coward. I never thought this was in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man brushed his hand across his forehead,  drew himself to his fullest height, and walked before his uncle to the end of  the corridor. He opened a door, led the way into a comfortable, old-fashioned  apartment, communicating with another room of about the same size. Fires had  been lighted in both bedchambers, and a cheerful blaze was reflected in every  panel of the wainscot. Richard Weston, farmer, slept as well on the night after  his eldest nephew&rsquo;s funeral as he always slept under his own roof at the  Grange. Once or twice, however, in the dismal hours of the long autumnal night,  he was awoke by the monotonous step of the new owner of the Grey Farm, pacing  up and down the oak floor of his bedroom. &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; muttered the old man,  as he buried his head in the pillows and dropped off again to sleep&mdash; &ldquo;poor  fellow, what a sincere affection there has been between those two boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AShadowThatHears"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  A Shadow That Hears</h2>
<p>For a considerable time there was a great deal of  curiosity felt in Olney about Dudley Carleon, and the way in which he would  manage his newly-acquired property. Everybody knew that the Carleons were not  rich, and that the Grey Farm required a great amount of expenditure before it  would produce much money. The land wanted draining, but poverty had prevented  this being ever effectually done; and the owners of the land had dragged on,  through good harvests and bad harvests, without ever enriching themselves or  their children, and only too glad if they could pay their way. <i>&ldquo;</i>How, then,&rdquo; asked the inhabitants of  Olney, &ldquo;would Dudley Carleon succeed with the property out of which his father  and his brother had obtained so little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Olney people soon confessed that Dudley  Carleon was by no means a bad farmer. He set vigorously to work, and with small  expenses contrived to make great improvements. Useless hedges and old trees  were ruthlessly done away with; ditches were dug in the low fields, and the  water carried back to the river from which it came, while a superior breed of  cattle fed in the dry pastures to those that had grazed in the sloppy meadows  during Martin&rsquo;s management. In short, to the surprise of everybody, the young  Cantab seemed to be a better farmer than his brother had been.</p>
<p>But when complimented on his good management, Mr.  Carleon was wont to say that he himself had very little part in the  improvements on the Grey Farm, since they were the work of Ralph, his bailiff,  and his greatest treasure.</p>
<p>If this remark happened to be made by Dudley while  showing a neighbour over the farm, a closely-cropped black head, a pale face,  and two gray eyes would generally emerge from behind some barn or out-building,  or look down from the top of some haystack, and Ralph, the farm-bailiff,  himself would appear, tugging at the close-cropped black hair in acknowledgment  of his master&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<p>It seemed to Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s acquaintance rather a  peculiarity in the manners and customs of this farm-bailiff that wherever his  master happened to be there he was to be found. This was, of course, purely accidental;  but it was an accident of such frequent occurrence that it became a subject for  observation. If Dudley Carleon gave a dinner-party, Ralph the bailiff took upon  himself the office of butler, and waited at table, bringing with him into the  dining-room a powerful odour of hay and beans, and generally doing some small  damage to the service of old china which had belonged to his master&rsquo;s  great-grandmother. It was perfectly obvious that the awkwardness of the  farm-servant gave considerable annoyance to the polished host; it was still  more obvious that he hesitated to show such annoyance; he appeared, indeed, to  consult the feelings of his bailiff before those of his guests or himself.</p>
<p>Sleek, dark, and pale, Ralph, the treasure of  servants, would stand behind his master&rsquo;s chair, listening attentively to every  word that was said.</p>
<p>If on a summer&rsquo;s evening Dudley  lounged with a friend smoking his cigar on the grass-plot in front of the  house, the farm-bailiff suddenly became a gardener, and was busy transplanting  geraniums or setting cuttings of pinks. If, on a dark night, the young man  accompanied an acquaintance part of the way back to Olney, the farm-bailiff was  always at his heels ready to open the gates or show the way with a lantern. If Dudley, on a Sunday, after church, stopped to talk to his  neighbours in the churchyard, Ralph the bailiff, with his sister Martha on his  arm, was generally to be seen looking at a tombstone, or reading an epitaph, a  few paces from his master. But the young farmer was constantly praising his  servant&rsquo;s fidelity and usefulness, and generally wound up his encomiums by  declaring that if Ralph were ever to take it into his head to leave the Grey  Farm, he should be a ruined man.</p>
<p>Ralph the bailiff, always appearing at this juncture,  would generally say, as he pulled off his hat and tugged at his sleek black  hair, <i>&ldquo;</i>Lord, Muster Dudley, I&rsquo;ll  never leave &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph, his master said, was very much above his  station. He could read and write; and when the other labourers were lolling of  a night over the kitchen-fire, smoking their pipes, or pulling the ears of the  great sheep-dog, the bailiff would shut himself up in his own room and devote  himself to his education. Dudley and Martin had taught him a good deal, when as  boys they had lounged together on summer evenings watching the labourers at  their work; for Ralph the bailiff had been born on the estate, as well as his  sister Martha, Dudley&rsquo;s housekeeper.</p>
<p>The new master of the farm had given a little  sitting-room in the servants&rsquo; wing to Martha and her brother as their own  peculiar property, and here of an evening after dark, the two used to sit, she  at her needlework, he seated before a great old-fashioned desk that had been  his mother&rsquo;s, writing or reading.</p>
<p>The brother and sister were much alike, both in  person and manners. Both pale and dark, with heavy features, straight, sleek  black hair, and deep-set gray eyes; both tall and slim; both grave, reserved,  and silent; orderly in their habits; precise in their way of speaking. They were  not much liked by the other servants, but they were very much respected, and  everyone of the farm-labourers knew that it was wiser to offend Mr. Dudley  Carleon than to run the risk of displeasing Ralph the bailiff.</p>
<p>Actual master of all the men, possessed of  unlimited executive power, Ralph Purvis, the bailiff, walked with a steady and  a stealthy step, day by day, over the Grey Farm.</p>
<p>Wherever the owner of the land went, full across  his path fell the shadow of his confidential servant; whomsoever he spoke to,  or whomsoever he saw, there was Ralph the bailiff to hear his words and to  watch his looks.</p>
<p>As time went by the inhabitants, of Olney began to  say that Dudley Carleon had changed month by month, week by week, day by day,  and hour by hour, since the September morning on which his elder brother had  been buried. He had grown thin and pale, fitful and moody in his manners,  reserved and uncertain in his address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His grief for his brother&rsquo;s death is really  absurd,&rdquo; said the gentlemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to form a new attachment &mdash; and marry,&rdquo;  said the ladies.</p>
<p>But nothing seemed further from the young farmer&rsquo;s  thoughts than the holy state of matrimony. Secluded in the great stone mansion,  he saw very little society of any kind, but sat moodily over his solitary  hearth when the weather was bad, or, on fine evenings, strolled listlessly  about the farm, talking over the business of the next day with Ralph the  bailiff.</p>
<p>Three years had passed since the funeral of Martin  Carleon; and the third September after that on which the drizzling rain had  drenched the scarves and hatbands of the mourners, and the thin garments of the  village children, drew to a cold and dismal close.</p>
<p>On the last day of the month, Mr. Theodore  Broughton, the only solicitor resident in Olney, dined with Dudley Carleon. He  had ridden over to the Grey Farm, to talk about some law-business he had on  hand for the young farmer, and Dudley had  persuaded him to stop to dinner. The two gentlemen dined at five o&rsquo;clock, in  the oak dining-room &mdash; a cold and draughty apartment, which the largest fire  that could be piled up in the wide grate could never thoroughly warm. This oak  dining-room was lighted, like the drawing-room, by three windows, two of which  were situated in the front of the house, opening into the garden, while the  third faced the river, and looked straight into the farmyard. There was very  little attempt at refinement in the arrangements of this great, dreary,  rambling farmhouse; a litter of noisy pigs ran about close under the  dining-room window, and three or four huge draught-horses stood pastern deep in  wet straw a few paces from where the gentlemen sat at dinner.</p>
<p>According to the usual custom when there was  company at the Grey Farm, Ralph the bailiff made his appearance, wearing an old  dress-coat of his master&rsquo;s, and carrying a napkin over his arm. This apparent  attempt at style was so entirely foreign to the ordinary habits of the  Carleons, who had always lived in the most unpretending manner, that everybody  wondered at and disliked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That awkward, dark-faced bailiff never came into  the house in Martin Carleon&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; the visitors at the Grey Farm would say,  &ldquo;and now he&rsquo;s always sneaking about the premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This evening of the 30th of September the bailiff&rsquo;s  presence seemed peculiarly disagreeable to Theodore Broughton, the lawyer. He  wished to talk of business, and he disliked doing so while Ralph stood with a  listening countenance at his master&rsquo;s elbow. He suggested to Dudley  that they should wait upon themselves, as no doubt the bailiff&rsquo;s presence was  needed about the farm; but neither Ralph&rsquo;s master nor Ralph himself would take  the hint. The young man was evidently embarrassed, and the bailiff held his  ground at his master&rsquo;s elbow with a dogged and determined look in his dark  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth of the matter is,&rdquo; said the lawyer,  &ldquo;that I want to have a few words with you, about that business &mdash; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, ah! to be sure. &mdash; You hear, Purvis, Mr.  Broughton wants a little private conversation with me. Leave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph the bailiff stood quite still, twisting the  dinner-napkin round and round upon his arm, and looking from his master to the  visitor, and from the visitor back to his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; repeated Dudley Carleon, turning very  pale, but with a vivid flash of anger in his large blue eyes; &ldquo;leave us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir;&rdquo; and with a stiff bow to his  master, Ralph the bailiff left the room. He shut the door after him rather  loudly as he went out; but two minutes afterwards Theodore Broughton, who sat  opposite to it, saw it reopened by a cautious hand and set a little ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have listeners in this house, Carleon,&rdquo; said  the lawyer, as he rose from the table, and going over to the door, shut it  securely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like speaking against another man&rsquo;s servants, but I really  can&rsquo;t help saying that I&rsquo;ve a great dislike to your bailiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Ralph Purvis? My dear Broughton, he&rsquo;s an  inestimable fellow. The best bailiff in the county, and faithful to a degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faithful to the degree of officiousness, I think,&rdquo;  muttered the lawyer, shrugging his shoulders; and then, changing the  conversation, he discussed with his client the business that had brought him to  the farm. After this had been satisfactorily settled, they spoke of indifferent  topics, and the lawyer by and by told Dudley  of the many speculations made by the feminine inhabitants of Olney as to the  causes of his determined bachelorhood. &ldquo;In short, my dear Carleon,&rdquo; he said,  laughing, &ldquo;you ought to make an excellent match; and that reminds me of an idea  that has often occurred to me, which idea is, that Agnes Marlow, the rector&rsquo;s  daughter, would be the very girl to make you a good wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon started as if he had been stung. A  cold perspiration broke out upon his forehead, which he wiped with a trembling  hand, as he said hesitatingly, &ldquo;O no, no. Agnes Marlow is the very last person  &mdash; the very last. Didn&rsquo;t you know of her engagement to my poor brother Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was perfectly aware they were to have been  married; that appears to me the very reason why she would be a suitable match  for you. It would seem as if you were fulfilling your poor brother&rsquo;s wish in  making her mistress of the Grey Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes Marlow&rsquo;s heart is buried in Martin Carleon&rsquo;s  grave. Do you know, Broughton, I have a very strong suspicion that her grief  for my brother&rsquo;s death had a fatal effect upon her intellect, and that she &mdash;  that she has not &mdash; been &mdash; quite right &mdash; in her mind since &mdash; that &mdash; occurrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon said these words slowly, and as if  with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in mercy&rsquo;s name has given you this idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she has evinced such an evident dislike to  me ever since I have been owner of the property. As if &mdash; as if &mdash; really &mdash; she  hated me for being master of the Grey Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, my dear Carleon; pure fancy on your part, I  am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it how it may, Agnes Marlow is the last person  I should ever dream of marrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will. I can&rsquo;t attempt to choose a wife for  you; but what I say, and what everybody else says, is, that you decidedly ought  to marry. What a dreary life you must lead in this dismal old house, with not a  soul to speak to but that sleek black bailiff of yours, and his equally sleek  and black sister, your housekeeper! Only think, man, how the cheerful face of a  pretty young wife would brighten the head of this long dining-table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well; I&rsquo;ll see about it,&rdquo; said Dudley, as he  and his friend rose from the table. As they were about to leave the room, Mr.  Carleon poured out a glass of brandy from a bottle on the sideboard, and  drained it at a draught. While he was doing this, Theodore Broughton&rsquo;s eyes  wandered carelessly round the walls of the room, looking at the old pictures.  In doing this, his glance happened to rest for a moment on the window opening  into the farmyard. It was quite dark, but in the gray obscurity he distinctly  saw a pair of gleaming eyes staring in through a pane of glass, and he saw also  a coarse red hand, which had lifted the window-sash about three inches from the  sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, Carleon, that you had listeners about  the place,&rdquo; he said, raising his voice so as to be heard by the person without;  &ldquo;look at that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the lawyer and Dudley Carleon reached the  window in question, there was nothing to be seen, only in the half-darkness of  the farmyard a figure was visible, leading the draught-horses to the stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Theodore Broughton; &ldquo;the  listener was your bailiff, Ralph Purvis. I thought I could not be mistaken in  the glitter of those eyes. Dudley Carleon, my profession is one which throws me  into contact with strange people; it may have made me suspicious; it may have  made me only cautious. All I say to you, as your friend and legal adviser, is  this &mdash; beware of that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, I have every respect for your  legal acumen, but you are quite wrong. I would trust Ralph Purvis with untold  gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust him with all the mines of California if you like; but do not trust him  with your secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s face, pale before, suddenly  flushed scarlet. &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;do you know that I consider  the fellow such a listener and a sneak, that did I not see him yonder, out of  reach of hearing, leading in those horses, I should expect to turn round and  find him at my elbow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha has taken coffee into the drawing-room,  sir,&rdquo; said a voice a few paces behind the two gentlemen.</p>
<p>Dudley and the lawyer turned sharply round. Ralph  the bailiff was standing a little way within the open door at the other end of  the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was leading the horses in, sir, when I saw you  two gentlemen at the window; so I gave them to William to hold, and ran round  here to tell you coffee was waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dudley and his visitor went into the  drawing-room they found Martha Purvis busy with the cups and saucers on a  little table near the fire. Prim and demure, dressed in sombre gray, and with  straight black hair banded tightly under her white cap, she moved about in the  fire-lit room as softly as if she had been the ghostly reproduction of one of  the dark pictures on the wainscoted wall. Wherever she moved in the flickering  light, she threw a shadow on the floor or the walls; and grim and distorted as  this shadow always looked wherever it fell, it seemed to Dudley Carleon to have  a deeper blackness when it was cast upon him, the master of the Grey Farm.</p>
<p>The lawyer&rsquo;s horse was brought round to the  front-door as the timepiece in the drawing-room struck eight. Dudley  followed his friend out into the garden; Ralph Purvis stood holding the bridle  in his hand.</p>
<p>Theodore Broughton shrugged his shoulders at the  sight of the farm-bailiff, but sprang into the saddle without saying a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will walk a little way with you, Broughton,&rdquo;  said Dudley, as the lawyer bade him  good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I come with you to open the gate, sir?&rdquo;  asked the bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite dark, and a thick mist rose from the  river by which the two men went, the lawyer walking his horse, and Dudley  Carleon holding the rein as he guided the animal along the narrow bank.</p>
<p>When they had reached the gate which marked the  boundary of the farm on the Olney side, the young man bade his friend  good-night, and walked slowly homewards.</p>
<p>A dark figure rose from the shelving river-bank,  and stood by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have a word with thee, muster?&rdquo; asked Ralph  the bailiff.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>You can speak, I suppose?&rdquo;  said Dudley without looking up or evincing the  least surprise at his servant&rsquo;s sudden appearance on the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will &rsquo;ee listen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered his master, walking slowly on, his  head bent down, and his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will &rsquo;ee answer what I ask thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d better not speak here; one of the men  might be in yon fields, and listen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, that might spoil your market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I speak, then, Muster Carleon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your own room, at the top of the back-stairs.  But what can you have to say to me to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Never thee mind what it be,  Muster Carleon. Will &rsquo;ee hear it? Yes or no; or shall I go into Olney and say  it to yon young lady, that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to throw you into that river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afeard, sir,&rdquo; said Ralph Purvis, with a  grin; &ldquo;it&rsquo;d make too much noise in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon was silent for the rest of the way  back to the house. He walked slowly, with his hat slouched over his eyes,  looking neither to the right nor the left; the bailiff, keeping a few paces in  advance of him, opened the gates as he approached, and fell back respectfully  for him to pass. As the owner of the Grey Farm crossed the hall and opened the  drawing-room door, he turned round and said to his bailiff, in a voice loud  enough to be heard by the domestic servants about the place:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you go to bed, Purvis, get your accounts  ready for me; I&rsquo;ll come to your room and look them over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The autumn winds swept with dismal voices, and  strange, inarticulate, complaining cries, over the long flat stubbled fields of  the Grey Farm. The autumn mists rose in these bare fields and the low meadows,  and spread a ghostly veil over the land, under which the slow river crawled  onwards to the distant sea. There seemed to be, in the nature of this deep and  quiet river, something akin to that of Ralph Purvis the bailiff. Like him it  was dark and silent; like him, stealthy of foot and changeless in purpose, it  dogged your heels when you were unaware, and crept stealthily after you through  the obscurity of the night. Winding and tortuous in its ways, like him, you  came upon it as you often came upon him, where you least expected to meet it;  and the aspect of it, as the aspect of the dark-faced bailiff, filled you with  an instinctive and unreasonable distrust. Wretched countrywomen had stolen down  to the dismal bank and drowned themselves quietly in reedy inlets where the  water was deepest; twenty miles from the Grey Farm a son had stabbed his father  to the heart, and thrown the body, under the thick darkness, into the  treacherous tide, that rolled back the corpse and left it in the morning light  lying stark and ghastly upon the river bank. Horrible things were associated  with this dismal water, and as it wound and twisted close under the walls of  the gaunt stone mansion, it seemed to give a gloomier aspect even to the dark  pile of buildings that composed the dwelling-house of the Grey Farm.</p>
<p>In the dead of the night, a light was visible to  the bargemen drifting with the tide down the winding river, a light burning in  a small window at the back of Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>That lighted window belonged to the sitting-room of  Ralph Purvis the bailiff.</p>
<p>On the floor of this room lay a man with his pale  face splashed and smeared with the blood oozing from a cut on his forehead.  Another man, with a white face and angry blue eyes, bent over him, with his  knee upon his chest, and one hand twisted in the folds of his coarse woollen  neckerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may kill me, and welcome, Muster Carleon,&rdquo;  gasped Ralph the bailiff; &ldquo;but so sure as I live that&rsquo;s the price of my holding  my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy, sneak, listener! get up and wash your face.  Tomorrow you and your sister shall start for London. I&rsquo;ll follow you in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll give us our price, Muster Carleon?&rdquo;  asked Ralph Purvis, picking himself up, and deliberately wiping the blood from  his face with a red cotton handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the uttermost farthing, extortioner,&rdquo; said  Dudley Carleon, as he opened the door of the little sitting-room with a  cautious hand, and stole down the flight of stairs leading to his own side of  the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheVisitorAtTheRectory"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Visitor At The Rectory</h2>
<p>The June sunshine gilded the dingy bosom of the  river, and the grass grew long and luxuriant in the meadows of the Grey Farm,  when Dudley Carleon returned from a long visit to the metropolis, and resumed his  quiet and monotonous life of gentleman farmer. He had been away from home for  the best part of the winter and of the spring, only coming down to Lincolnshire now and then for a few days, or sometimes for  a week at a time, and then returning to London.  The bailiff&rsquo;s sister had left the farm for a situation, in York, of a lighter character, as her brother  said she had overworked herself in that great house; and an old woman from  Olney had been elevated into the post of housekeeper at the Grey Farm.</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon appeared if possible more gloomy  when he returned than before he went away, and he certainly seemed more than  ever under the thrall of his inseparable retainer, Ralph the bailiff.</p>
<p>Side by side the master and man walked slowly along  the river&rsquo;s bank, or round the great corn-fields, or paused at a gate leading  into a meadow shut up against the hay harvest, to calculate the value of the  crops. Side by side they loitered of an evening, watching the cattle grazing by  the water-side, and whoever happened to hear their conversation would generally  hear Ralph the bailiff telling his master what a valuable property he could  make of the farm if he had only money enough for improvements.</p>
<p>A few days after Dudley&rsquo;s  return Ralph was for once in a way absent from the premises. His master had  sent him to the market-town, ten miles distant, to transact some business  relating to the farm, and he was not likely to get back till nightfall.</p>
<p>There was a public right of way through some green  lanes, and across some corn-fields and meadows on the farm. This led from a  village at a little distance into Olney. In one of these green lanes, in which  some of the draught-horses on the farm were tethered, Dudley Carleon sauntered,  book in hand, as the clocks of the distant village churches struck three.</p>
<p>The master of the Grey Farm, always looking  downwards as he walked, took no notice whatever of the wild roses in the  hedges, nor of the cowslips upon the grassy banks; but he was suddenly startled  into looking up by the sound of the barking of a dog a few hundred yards from  him.</p>
<p>Following with his eyes the direction of this  sound, he saw perched upon a green mound, under the hawthorn bushes near him,  something so bright in colour, so radiant in appearance, so airy and fluttering  in motion, that he might almost have mistaken the something for a new and  luxuriant sister of the gay wild-flowers in the hedge. But coming a little  nearer to the strange blossom, he found himself face to face with a young lady,  dressed in pink muslin and a gipsy hat.</p>
<p>She was almost childlike in appearance, and  excessively pretty. She was brilliantly fair, and her pink cheeks were set in a  framework of showery golden curls, which trembled and glistened in the summer  breezes and the bright June sunshine. Her eyes were of a tender blue, large and  soft, and expressive of the most innocent candour. She was very small, and all  she wore, from the lace which fell about her tiny straw hat to the flowers of  her soft and airy muslin dress, floated about her with a peculiar grace. A  fairy dressed by a Parisian milliner could not surpass this exquisite, fragile  creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be so good,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as to tell me  the way to Olney? I insisted on rambling out to-day by myself, and have been  sufficiently punished for my obstinacy in having lost my way. I have been  sitting here very patiently for the last hour, hoping to see someone pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was music itself, and her smile when she  spoke made her as bewitching as she was lovely.</p>
<p>Dudley told her that he was going  towards Olney, and begged to be allowed to escort her part of the way there.  There was something so unmistakably gentlemanly in his address, that after one  brief moment of hesitation the young lady accepted his offer; and they strolled  on side by side, the dog running backwards and forwards before them, barking  merrily.</p>
<p>She told him, in the course of their walk, that she  was visiting at the rectory, that her name was Jenny Trevor, that she was an  orphan, that Mr. Marlow was her guardian, and Agnes Marlow her dearest friend.</p>
<p>They had to pass through a field close to Dudley  Carleon&rsquo;s house, and then out to the river-bank which led to Olney.</p>
<p>As they came to the first gate, by the waterside, a  man on horseback came slowly towards them, and on approaching them, proved to  be Ralph the bailiff.</p>
<p>He slid off his horse on seeing his master, and  leading the animal by the bridle, came up to the gate, which he opened for  Dudley and Miss Trevor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are home early, Purvis,&rdquo; said Dudley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; matters were managed quicker than I  thought for, and I wouldn&rsquo;t loiter. I&rsquo;ve settled with the haymakers for next  week, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph the bailiff still lingered, bridle in hand,  by the open gate; and from under his black lashes the gray eyes looked  furtively, but searchingly, at Jenny Trevor.</p>
<p>Dudley seemed strangely  embarrassed. He glanced from the bailiff to the young girl, as if hesitating  what to do; and then said, with considerable confusion of manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Miss Trevor, I need scarcely bore you  with my society any longer. The next gate but one opens into the high-road, and  then you are in a straight line with Olney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hat, and, with a glance of surprise,  she bowed, wished him good-day, and walked onwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he said to Ralph the bailiff as soon as  Miss Trevor was out of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Muster Carleon,&rdquo; echoed Ralph: &ldquo;what a  pretty young lass yon is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His master made no reply to this observation, but  leaned listlessly with his elbows on the top bar of the gate and his chin in  his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thee and her seemed mighty friendly, too,&rdquo; said  Ralph presently, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe nothing &mdash; maybe something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a young lady staying at the rectory,&rdquo; said Dudley sulkily, and as if every word were being wrung  from him perforce; &ldquo;and I never saw her in my life till this afternoon. She  asked me to show her the way to Olney, and I did so. Will that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty near. She must be rather a forward lass,  though, to be so uncommon friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week after this Ralph Purvis left the Grey Farm,  and Dudley Carleon became a constant visitor at Olney Rectory. It was strange  that in his visits to the rectory he rarely met with Agnes Marlow. If by any  chance he happened to find her at home, she would sit staring vacantly out at  the window, never addressing him, and only answering by monosyllables when he  spoke to her, and she always took the earliest opportunity of leaving the room  on some pretext or other. Jenny Trevor at first complained to her friend of  this; but Agnes was so reserved upon this subject, that Jenny &mdash; who was always  a little overawed by the rector&rsquo;s daughter, with her cold serious black eyes  and her careworn face &mdash; dared not press it further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not accountable for our prejudices, Jenny,&rdquo;  she would say; &ldquo;I do not like Dudley Carleon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have no reason to dislike him, have you,  Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None &mdash; that I can reconcile with my duty as a  Christian. I am the daughter of a minister of the Gospel of Christ; I go to  church three times on a Sunday; I visit the sick, and I give my money to the  poor; but for all that I may not be a Christian; perhaps I am not, when Dudley  Carleon is concerned. Do not talk to me &mdash; do not question me, Jenny. I hate  him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her dark eyes shone with a feverish lustre, and she  clenched her slender wasted hand as she repeated, &ldquo;God have mercy upon me, and  upon his soul! I hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheWeddingDay"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  The Wedding-Day</h2>
<p>The Olney people were surprised to miss the dark  face of Ralph Purvis from among the haymakers in Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s meadows; but  the young man told his acquaintance that he had been induced to purchase a  small farm in Buckinghamshire, and that he had intrusted his bailiff with the  management of it.</p>
<p>Ralph had been a hard and a churlish taskmaster; he  was regretted by no one, unless indeed by his employer, who received about once  a week a letter, directed in a small cramped hand, bearing the postmark of a  village in Buckinghamshire. Every week, too, Dudley Carleon rode into Olney for  a post-office order, payable to Ralph Purvis; and those who watched the young  man&rsquo;s movements began to say that his new farm was costing him more money than  it would ever bring him back. But before the harvest there was a talk of his  marrying a young lady with a fortune, or at least what was called a fortune in  Olney. Jenny Trevor had six thousand pounds.</p>
<p>She would be of age in September, and she was,  people said, engaged to be married to Dudley Carleon.</p>
<p>Was she engaged to him? No. She suffered him to  follow her about as some sulky but faithful dog follows a beloved master. She allowed  herself to fall into a sort of tacit compact with him; she neither repelled his  silent attentions, nor withdrew herself from his society, however often he came  to the rectory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; she said one day to Agnes; &ldquo;he  is in the drawing-room at this moment; I know it, though I have neither seen  nor heard him come in; and I must go to him, though I do not wish to go. What  am I to do, Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me to Scarborough;  you know that I am going to-morrow, and shall not return here for two or three  months. Choose, Jenny, whether you will come with me or stay here with papa to  become the wife of that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes, I will go with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls set to work immediately to pack their  trunks, and made all their arrangements for starting by the next morning&rsquo;s  express for Scarborough; but that evening, seated in the dusky twilight in the  deep bow-window of the rectory drawing-room, Dudley Carleon made Jenny Trevor  promise that she would be his wife the very day on which she came of age.</p>
<p>After he had left the house, Agnes Marlow found her  friend sobbing hysterically, with her head upon the sill of the open window,  and the scented blossoms of a clematis trailing over her curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must stay here, Agnes; I cannot go with you  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are your own mistress, Jenny, and must choose  for yourself. God help you, if you forget what I have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s loud sobs were her only answer to these  ominous words.</p>
<p>Before a sheaf of golden corn had fallen under the  sickle, Mr. Marlow had married Dudley Carleon and Jenny Trevor in Olney Church.</p>
<p>Her wedding-day was that on which she came of age,  as she had promised her lover. Everything was arranged very quietly, not to say  secretly, and by Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s wish no intimation of the event had been sent  to Agnes Marlow.</p>
<p>It was one of the glorious and burning summer days  so often seen at the beginning of autumn. The lazy cattle slept in the flat  meadows, and the narrow river dragged its slow course under a hot yellow haze.  The corn-fields were gaudy with vivid patches of purple and scarlet, and the  golden grain scarcely stirred in the still air. The bride looked lovely, with  her simple robes of lace and muslin fluttering round her, and with her golden  ringlets shining in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A handsome couple!&rdquo; said the villagers grouped  about the church-porch. Everyone seemed in high spirits. Even the bridegroom  had thrown off his habitual moodiness, and pride and triumph shone in his  sombre blue eyes. One sinister event, however, threw a cloud over the  conclusion of the ceremony. As Dudley Carleon turned from the altar to lead his  young bride into the vestry, he found himself face to face with a glistening  tablet of white marble &mdash; a tablet so newly put up upon the wall that the mortar  at the edges was still damp, and the workman&rsquo;s tools lay in the pew beneath:</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;Sacred to the Memory of MARTIN CARLEON<br>
Obiit September 24, 1849, &aelig;tat. 23<br>
This monument is erected by his affectionate and  sorrowful brother<br>
Dudley Carleon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The village stonemason, an idle and dilatory man,  had received the order for this tablet nearly a year before, and had only  completed his work upon the eve of Mr. Carleon&rsquo;s wedding-day.</p>
<p>When the wedding-party returned to the rectory,  they found a fly from the station standing at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can Agnes have returned?&rdquo; said Mr. Marlow.</p>
<p>Dudley&rsquo;s face had paled at the  sight of the tablet upon the church wall, but it grew still whiter now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; he said, clutching the little gloved hand  that lay upon his strong arm, &ldquo;Agnes Marlow is a madwoman; whatever she says to  you, remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley, what do  you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! How do I know what she may not say?  Do you suppose that I have not perceived her prejudice against me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pale and careworn, with her dress dusty and  disordered from her hasty journey, and her long dark hair falling loosely about  her thin face, Agnes Marlow met the bridal party in the sunlit hall.</p>
<p>She did not speak either to her father or to Dudley, but grasping the bride&rsquo;s slender wrist with a  convulsive strength, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I too late &mdash; am I too late, after all? Are you  married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dudley  firmly, looking at her with an impatient frown.</p>
<p>She seemed neither to hear nor to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;are you married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the terror-stricken girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that I should be too late; that I should not be  told of this in time! But come, come with me, Jenny, to my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, Mrs. Carleon, I forbid you to do so!&rdquo; cried  her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forbid her!&rdquo; echoed Agnes, with a harsh,  discordant laugh, turning her large lustrous eyes for the first time towards  Dudley Carleon. &ldquo;Shall I tell her here, at the foot of these stairs, before the  servants &mdash; those people round the door &mdash; before my father &mdash; before <i>you?</i> Shall I tell her that which I have  to tell her before a crowd of witnesses, Dudley Carleon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away from the wan and burning eyes, and  taking her father aside, whispered to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Jenny, come!&rdquo; cried Agnes.</p>
<p>She dragged rather than led the wretched girl up  the stairs into her own room, locked the door, and then sank exhausted into a  chair by the bed. The windows were open, the birds singing loudly among the  honeysuckle and jasmine clustering round the house; and through the open  windows a flood of sunshine streamed upon the pale faces of the two girls.</p>
<p>Jenny fell on her knees sobbing, and clinging to  the rector&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Agnes, have pity upon me! remember it is my  wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot pity you, Jenny. I can remember nothing.  I tell you my heart is not wide enough to hold anything but hatred &mdash; hatred of  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I crush out your heart as my heart has been  crushed &mdash; if I am to blight your life as mine has been blighted &mdash; if he is as  dear to you as his dead brother was to me, still I must speak. Do you know what  he is &mdash; this man &mdash; whom you have sworn to love and cherish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny Carleon &mdash; O, misery, that I should have to  call you by that name! &mdash; when I received my father&rsquo;s letter this morning,  telling me of your purposed marriage, I thought I should go mad; but do not  judge me by my disordered looks or by my bewildered manner. Listen to me, you  most ill-advised, unhappy girl. I cannot tell you what I <i>know,</i> I can only tell you what I believe so  firmly, that if my words were to lay you dead at my feet, I would say them  rather than see you pass over the threshold of that man&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Agnes! my wedding-day &mdash; my wedding-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her entreating hands as if she would  have warded off the cruel words as she would ward a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley Carleon poisoned his brother Martin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One long piteous wail escaped from the white lips  of the bride, as she fell prostrate at the feet of Agnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no proof of this, or I would have made that  proof ring through the length and breadth of the land. I have no proof, but I  have<i> &mdash; conviction!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny lifted her white face from the floor, and  dragging herself on to her knees, once more looked up at the speaker. &ldquo;No  proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. But I know it &mdash; I know it! I was at the Grey  Farm on the night of Martin Carleon&rsquo;s death. I saw that man&rsquo;s ghastly face and  shaking hand as he stood by his brother&rsquo;s bedside meddling with the  medicine-bottles. It was from his hand the draught was taken which was to  allay, but which only increased, the mortal sickness, and tormenting thirst,  and burning fever. His dark shadow was never lifted from that weary bed.  Fidelity! Devotion! Yes, the fidelity of a murderer to his deadly purpose; the  devotion of the executioner to his unconscious victim. I tell you, child, our  eyes met only once upon that awful night, and in that one glance I saw and knew  his guilt. I know it: and he knows that I know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes, Agnes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin Carleon died from the effects of slow  poison administered by his brother. Now go back to your husband. I have done  with you, Mrs. Carleon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Agnes! how cruel, how heartless, how pitiless  and unchristian! And is it by a vague suspicion &mdash; an idea as unfounded as it is  hideous &mdash; that you would brand an innocent man? I pity you, Agnes, for being  the victim to so horrible a delusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her knees, and going to the  toilet-table, wiped away her blinding tears, and rearranged her hair with a  hand that scarcely trembled. As she did this, she watched the reflection of  Agnes Marlow&rsquo;s haggard face in the glass before which she stood. She began to  think that Dudley Carleon must indeed be right, and that grief had driven the  Rector&rsquo;s daughter mad. Agnes sat on the little white-curtained bed, with hollow  eyes, following Jenny&rsquo;s rapid movements at the dressing-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help us both!&rdquo; she murmured, clasping her  attenuated hands; &ldquo;God help us, and lend us His light to guide ns in this  blind, dark world. Something stronger than myself possessed me, and I could not  keep silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ACheerlessHearth"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  A Cheerless Hearth</h2>
<p>Agnes Marlow returned to Scarborough.  Her health was broken, her spirits gone, and there were people in Olney who  shared Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s opinion, and believed that her reason had been in some  degree unsettled by her lover&rsquo;s untimely death.</p>
<p>The first four months of Jenny Carleon&rsquo;s married  life passed peacefully away. Dudley was a kind  and an attentive husband, and there was no fault whatever to be found with him  in his new position. The Grey Farm was certainly rather a dull abode for Jenny,  whose life had been chiefly spent at a boarding-school at the West-end of  London; but she had her piano, her books and drawing-materials, a pet dog, and  an old gray pony, on which she rode about her husband&rsquo;s fields while he  superintended the men; for since Ralph&rsquo;s departure Dudley Carleon had devoted  himself entirely to the management of his farm.</p>
<p>Not a word had ever been uttered by Mrs. Carleon on  the subject of that stormy interview between herself and Agnes Marlow. Often in  the dead of the night she awoke suddenly by the side of her sleeping husband,  with the echo of those terrible words ringing in her ears, as if someone had  just spoken them at her pillow. She had never for one moment thought of them  except as of the hallucination of an enfeebled mind; but she could no more  forget them than she could forget her own name.</p>
<p>Sometimes seated alone in the twilight, by the fire  in the low oak parlour, surrounded by the distorted shadows of the furniture  upon the dark panelled walls, thinking of things as far away from the scene of  her bridal morning as it is possible for one thing to be from another &mdash; in a  moment, in a breath, a hissing whisper at her ear would shape with supernatural  distinctness these two horrible sentences:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley Carleon poisoned his brother Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Martin Carleon died from  the effects of slow poison administered by his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this was not the worst; for she could find that  by degrees she grew to be perpetually repeating these words to herself  involuntarily, as one repeats a line of verse from mere absence of mind. At her  needlework, busy with her pencils and colours &mdash; even at the piano &mdash; she caught  herself silently reiterating these hateful phrases. They would fit themselves  to the notes of her favourite pieces of music, and she trembled to think that  one day she might unconsciously utter them aloud.</p>
<p>The new year came, cold and rainy. The weather kept  Jenny a prisoner to the house. Dudley was  often out. She had few visitors, for her Olney acquaintances dreaded the wet  walk on the muddy bank of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why had she married Dudley Carleon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sometimes asked herself this question, as if  she had suddenly awoke from a long sleep to find herself in a strange country.</p>
<p>She did not love him, she did not even admire him,  but she had allowed him to gain so strong an influence over her, that it was  only now and then she remembered this, &mdash; only now and then she asked herself  wonderingly, &ldquo;Why did I marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not unhappy, &mdash; only sometimes lonely and  dreary in the gaunt stone house, with its great comfortless rooms and low oaken  ceilings, that always seemed to her as if they would some day slowly descend  and crush her to death.</p>
<p>The light-hearted girl grew grave and quiet amongst  the shadows of the solemn farmhouse. Dudley,  kind as he was, was silent and reserved, and had fits of such strange  abstraction, of preoccupation so intense and gloomy, that his wife shrank from  addressing him. She would sit at her drawing-board with the pencil in her hand,  and the colours drying on her palette, watching his rigid face as he sat by the  hearth with an unread book open in his hand.</p>
<p>There were times when his silence would exercise so  oppressive an influence upon her, that she was fain to steal quietly from the  room, and remain away for hours; only to find him, perhaps, on her return, in  the same attitude, with unchanged countenance, sitting brooding over a heap of  black cinders.</p>
<p>He would apologise for these long reveries by  saying he was tired, that he overworked himself, that the farm gave him a great  deal of trouble, or that he was anxious about his Buckinghamshire property.</p>
<p>One morning, towards the end of January, he found a  letter lying on the breakfast-table in the stiff handwriting of his bailiff. It  was a much longer letter than usual, and Jenny saw by her husband&rsquo;s face that  its contents were not agreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, I shall have to go to Buckinghamshire,&rdquo;  said Dudley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Buckinghamshire! Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph&rsquo;s letter tells me he is in a difficulty  about the farm, and must have my advice before he stirs a step; I must go this  very morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could answer him he had crumpled the  letter in his hand, flung it into the fire, and left the room. She heard him  ordering his horse to be brought round immediately. He came in hurriedly to  wish her good-bye, promised to return to Lincolnshire  in a day or two, and galloped off to catch the London express.</p>
<p>Reserved and silent as her husband was, Jenny felt  unhappy in this his first absence. The servants, and the great rough  farming-men about the place, were strange to her, &mdash; their very dialect almost  unintelligible. She was lonely and uncomfortable among them, and she wandered  in and out of the solitary rooms in which the great bare windows opened upon  the chill winter sky, longing for Dudley&rsquo;s  return.</p>
<p>Two days and two nights, and the best part of the  third day dragged themselves out, and he had not returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come to-night,&rdquo; she said; and she ordered  huge fires to be piled in the grates, till the flames went roaring up the wide  chimneys, and a red reflection shone in every panel of the dark wainscot.</p>
<p>It was a bitter evening; but at five o&rsquo;clock, the  hour at which a London  train came in, she went out with a shawl thrown loosely over her head, and  stood for a long time, looking anxiously down the dim pathway by the river  bank. She did not return to the house until the Olney clocks chimed the  three-quarters after five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here by the nine-o&rsquo;clock train,&rdquo; she  said; but seven, eight, nine, ten o&rsquo;clock struck; the fire burned low, and her  heart sank with a weary feeling of loneliness, for still he did not come.</p>
<p>The old housekeeper, and the parlour-maid who  waited upon Mrs. Carleon, recommended her to go to bed, for ten o&rsquo;clock was  considered a late hour at the Grey Farm; but there was a mail-train that came  into Olney at half-past one in the morning, and Jenny insisted on sitting up in  case her husband should come by that. She sent the servants to bed after having  made one of them instruct her in the mysteries of the bolts, bars, and chains  of the hall-door; and, the fires having been once more replenished, she sat  down in her low chair by the hearth to wear out the three hours which must  elapse before her husband&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>She drew closer and closer to the blazing fire, she  wrapped herself in a thick shawl, but in spite of all she shivered violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have caught Martin Carleon&rsquo;s ague,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;on the bank of that dismal river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words seemed to strike a chill to her heart,  for they brought back the scene of her wedding-day, and Agnes Marlow&rsquo;s horrible  accusation.</p>
<p>A portrait of the last owner of the farm hung in  the shadow at the end of the room &mdash; a frank, genial face, with waving chestnut  hair and bright blue eyes. The thought of the dead man haunted her in the  dreary silence. She tried not to look at his picture; she turned her back to  the panel where it hung. What if his likeness should descend from the shadowy  panel, and, stealing noiselessly behind her, lay an impalpable hand upon her  shoulder? She was not superstitious, but her monotonous life had weakened her  nerves, and she felt as if she were alone with the dead. What if this painted  image should shape itself into a phantom, and approach her? What if on rushing  to the door to escape the phantom, she should find it locked, and herself a  prisoner with this ghastly companion? What if those painted lips were to be miraculously  unsealed, and an unearthly voice were to tell her that the words uttered by  Agnes Marlow were an awful truth?</p>
<p>The cold perspiration broke out in great beads upon  her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go mad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I am long alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once she rose from her seat, determined to call up  one of the servants, but she had not the courage to traverse the dark hall and  the back-staircase leading to their rooms &mdash; scarcely courage to pass the  picture hanging between the fireplace and the door.</p>
<p>What, she thought, if she had indeed caught the  ague or the fever that had killed her husband&rsquo;s brother? What if she lay for  weeks upon a weary bed, tended and watched by Dudley Carleon? Every syllable  spoken by Agnes came back to her, and she seemed to see her husband, with a  quiet step and a white, tremulous hand, jingling the thin glass of the  medicine-bottles. The slow hands of the clock above the chimney-piece went  silently round. She heard the distant chimes of Olney church, each several  quarter seeming an hour to her impatience.</p>
<p>One &mdash; a quarter-past &mdash; half-past &mdash; three-quarters:  two &mdash; a quarter-past two. The last white ashes dropped through the lowest bars  of the grate. Three loud blows resounded upon the stout panel of the hall-door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, thank Heaven, thank Heaven!&rdquo; she said,  springing from her seat; &ldquo;how stupid have I been, and how I can afford to laugh  at myself now that he has come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught up a candle from the table, flew into  the hall, and began to unfasten the door, holding the candle still in one hand,  and fumbling with the bolts, in her nervous but joyful agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Dudley,  I won&rsquo;t be long; be patient, I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo; But the heavy blows were  repeated upon the door, and a gruff voice, muffled by the thick oak, uttered  some impatient words.</p>
<p>A sudden terror seized her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he have been drinking?&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;his  voice sounds so thick and strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley &mdash; now, now  I have managed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned the key with a great effort, and,  letting down the chain, opened the door to its utmost width.</p>
<p>She felt for the first time in her life as if she  really loved Dudley Carleon. She wanted to throw herself into his arms, to  cling to him for protection and shelter.</p>
<p>A man in a slouched felt hat, a dark smock-frock,  leathern gaiters, and great hob-nailed boots, strode across the threshold.</p>
<p>The lower part of his face was muffled in a coarse  woollen handkerchief, but two sinister gray eyes looked out from under the  shade of his hat.</p>
<p>Jenny did not remember having seen this man before,  but the shock she experienced in meeting a stranger instead of her husband gave  her an unwonted courage. She caught hold of a rope hanging near the doorway, a  rope communicating with a great bell on the roof of the house, which was used  to summon the men to their meals and to wake them in the morning. &ldquo;Who are  you?&rdquo; she said, as the man flung down a knotted stick and a bundle in a red  cotton handkerchief, and was about to pass her in the direction of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muster Carleon&rsquo;s bailiff, and maybe with as good a  right to come into this house as Muster Carleon himself&rdquo; said the man  insolently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you are Purvis the bailiff, are you? Has your  master sent you home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Purvis; but my master ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sent me  home. And pray, my pretty curly-haired Miss, who may you be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your master&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Jenny haughtily.</p>
<p>The man stared at her rudely for two or three  moments before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My master&rsquo;s <i>what?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife &mdash; Mrs. Carleon,&rdquo; she said, looking him  fall in the face, terrified, but not daunted, by his insolence.</p>
<p>The bailiff burst into a loud hoarse laugh. &ldquo;Mr.  Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s wife! His right-down lawful wife! O, you&rsquo;re that, are you?  Give me the light,&rdquo; he said, snatching the silver candlestick from her hand;  &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a look at you, then, for you&rsquo;re a bit of a curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s hand had never left the rope; she pulled it  violently, and the bell upon the roof clamoured and shook through the winter  night.</p>
<p>Three or four half-dressed men came tumbling down  the back staircase before the bell had ceased ringing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man says he is my husband&rsquo;s bailiff,&rdquo; said  Jenny, as they crowded round her; &ldquo;take him to his room and look after him. He  has insulted me; but as he is evidently tipsy, I shall ask no explanation until  Mr. Carleon&rsquo;s return. Send Sarah to my room, James,&rdquo; she added to one of the  farm-servants, whose face she knew; &ldquo;I will not sleep in the house alone while  that man is under this roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, indeed, my lass; do you think I&rsquo;d murder you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are a bad man,&rdquo; said Jenny, looking  back at the bailiff as she slowly ascended the broad staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stay here at all, if you&rsquo;re so timid,  Miss,&rdquo; said Ralph, with a sneering laugh; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s others besides me, perhaps,  to be afraid of at the Grey Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="InTheDeadOfTheNight"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  In The Dead Of The Night</h2>
<p>Dudley Carleon came home early the next day, and  found his wife confined to her room by a violent cold, while Ralph Purvis sat  smoking his pipe over the kitchen-fire.</p>
<p>The young man was evidently unprepared for his  bailiff&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought you down here?&rdquo; he asked angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My business, and yours,&rdquo; muttered Ralph, without  taking his pipe from his mouth.</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon did not answer, but led the way into  the dining-room, where he and Purvis were closeted together for nearly two  hours.</p>
<p>In the course of this long interview the servants  heard their master&rsquo;s voice raised several times as if in anger, but the  bailiff&rsquo;s not once.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carleon came downstairs in the evening to her  favourite seat by the fireplace in the oak-parlour. She had told her husband of  Ralph&rsquo;s conduct on his arrival; she had told him, indeed, that she could not  live happily while the bailiff was in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Jenny, the man is unfortunately so useful  to me that I cannot afford to get rid of him,&rdquo; said Dudley;  &ldquo;but I shall send him back to Buckinghamshire in a week, at the latest; in the  mean time he must apologise to you.&rdquo; He rang the bell, and the bailiff came in,  turning his hat round in his two great hands; sleek, humble, and respectful;  utterly different from what he had been at half-past two o&rsquo;clock that morning.</p>
<p>He made an elaborate and rambling apology, with a  cringing politeness of manner, but with a sulky face and an ominous glitter in  his deep-set gray eyes. He seemed as if he had been tutored in what he was to  say; or almost as if he had been repeating something learned from a book. But  the ground of his excuse was, that he had been drinking on the previous night,  and was a little off his head, as he called it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carleon bowed gravely when he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will look over it, Jenny?&rdquo; asked her  husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, certainly,&rdquo; she replied coldly, turning away  her head, for she hated to feel the glittering eyes of the bailiff fixed upon  her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Agnes had told me <i>that</i> man was a poisoner, I could almost have believed her,&rdquo; she  thought, as Ralph left the room.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s cold lasted for some days, and at her  husband&rsquo;s request the surgeon from Olney rode over one morning to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slight attack of influenza,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nothing  more; Mrs. Carleon is a little debilitated; I will send her some strengthening  medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not ague, is it?&rdquo; asked Jenny anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ague! O dear no, nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor fever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you are not in the least feverish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jenny, what are you thinking of?&rdquo; asked her  husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of your brother Martin&rsquo;s death, and  wondering whether any of my symptoms resembled his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon started half out of his chair, and  looked earnestly at his wife&rsquo;s face; then, sighing deeply, he said, as he  reseated himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid, Jenny! One such death as poor  Martin&rsquo;s is enough in a family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carleon was seated opposite to one of the  windows; and looking up at this moment, she saw the dark face of the bailiff  between herself and the winter sky.</p>
<p>He was standing on a short ladder, busy, pruning a  creeping plant that grew over the house; and she saw that he had opened the  window a couple of inches at the top, in order to extricate a branch that had  been shut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would send that man back to your other  farm, Dudley,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he is always hanging  about the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medicines did not come till rather late in the  evening. In spite of herself, Jenny could not forget what Agnes Marlow had  said, and she wondered whether her husband would offer to administer them to her.</p>
<p>He was seated at his desk, writing, when the  maid-servant brought in the bottles; and he did not even look up as Jenny took  them from their paper coverings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to take my medicine, Dudley,&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jenny,&rdquo; he answered, without raising  his head.</p>
<p>She felt an intense relief at finding him so  indifferent; she had never confessed to herself that she could possibly be  brought to suspect him; but a load seemed lifted from her mind by this most  simple circumstance.</p>
<p>The next day, and the next, she continued to take  her medicines without the slightest notice from her husband. He was kind and  attentive, asked often after her health, but said nothing about the medical  treatment; he evidently attached very little importance to this slight attack  of influenza.</p>
<p>On the third day the surgeon called again at the  Grey Farm. He found Jenny in her old place by the fire, Dudley  reading the newspaper opposite to her, and Ralph Purvis mending the lock of the  door.</p>
<p>The bailiff was very handy as a smith, carpenter,  or painter, and there always seemed something for him to do about the house  now.</p>
<p>This time the surgeon looked grave, as he felt his  patient&rsquo;s pulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not been taking my medicines, Mrs.  Carleon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I have taken them very regularly;  have I not, Dudley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, I haven&rsquo;t watched you  closely enough to be able to vouch for your integrity, Jenny,&rdquo; said her  husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is more debility than I thought, Mrs.  Carleon. We must try and set you up again, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s eyes wandered involuntarily to the portrait  of Martin Carleon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any fever?&rdquo; she asked, looking up  anxiously at the surgeon&rsquo;s face, as he stood before her, with his fingers on  her wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why &mdash; yes, you are rather more feverish than you  were a day or two ago,&rdquo; he said with some hesitation.</p>
<p>Her face grew suddenly white; but she said nothing.  When the surgeon had taken his departure, she rose from her chair, and seemed  as if she was going to run out of the room. Ralph the bailiff, on his knees at  the threshold of the half-open door, rattled away at the lock he was mending.  Kneeling where he did, he seemed to present an impassable barrier between the  mistress of the Grey Farm and the world without.</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon dropped the newspaper, as he started  to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny! Jenny! what is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get out of the house,&rdquo; she said, looking  about her wildly; &ldquo;I want to run away. I know that if I stay here I shall die  as <i>he</i> did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to Martin&rsquo;s picture on the wall before  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, forgive me! forgive me, Dudley!&rdquo;  she said, throwing herself into her husband&rsquo;s arms, and sobbing hysterically:  &ldquo;I do not doubt you &mdash; I esteem, respect, and love you. I know how foolish I am,  and hate myself for my folly; but I am frightened! &mdash; I am frightened!&rdquo;</p>

  Master And Slave</h2>
<p>In spite of the doctor&rsquo;s attention, in spite of her  own care, Jenny Carleon did not regain her health. She felt herself gradually  growing weaker; she felt that, by such slow degrees as were almost  imperceptible, her strength was ebbing away from her. It was only by looking  back at the end of a week, and remembering that seven days before she had been  able to do this or that, which she was utterly powerless to do now, that she  discovered how much she had changed. She struggled hard against this daily  diminution of her strength, for she seemed to have an unreasonable horror of  being confined to her room; but she succumbed at last, and kept her bed day  after day. A good-tempered maid-servant waited upon her, and brought her  medicines, which she poured out herself.</p>
<p>Her husband came into her room several times a day  to ask after her health. He brought her piles of novels obtained for her from a  circulating-library in the market-town; but he still appeared to make light of  her illness, and was so much occupied about the farm that he could seldom stay  with her for any length of time.</p>
<p>She used to ask every morning whether Ralph the  bailiff was going away that day, always to be told that he was not, but that he  would leave in a day or two at the latest. Once, after having received this  answer, she turned her head round impatiently upon her pillow, and, with her  face to the wall, burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; asked her  husband.</p>
<p>She did not answer; but he could see that her  slight frame was shaken by her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, I insist upon knowing the meaning of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her head from the pillow, supported  herself upon her elbow, and, putting her hair away from her tear-stained face,  said to him solemnly, &ldquo;Dudley Carleon, the presence of that man is killing me,  day by day, and hour by hour. Shut up in this room, I cannot see him; but I can  feel and know that an unseen influence is sapping my very life, and that  influence is his. If you are not his slave, if you are not bound to him by some  tie too fearful to be broken, send him from this house; or, if I have strength  to crawl out of it, I will go myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, Jenny, this is an invalid&rsquo;s fancy. Don&rsquo;t  give me reason to think you are as mad as Agnes Marlow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley Carleon, will you send that man away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you are so silly, yes. He shall go  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her wasted little hand to him with a  smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do this, Dudley,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;and I shall think that you love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the tone of her voice, in the sad but  gentle expression of her face, touched his reserved and undemonstrative nature.  Dudley Carleon clasped her suddenly to his breast, and hiding his face upon her  shoulder sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my poor little wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is to  become of us &mdash; what is to become of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley, Dudley,  don&rsquo;t cry. You terrify &mdash; you grieve me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose from his seat by the bedside, and brushed  the tears from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a fool, Jenny; for I distress you and myself.  But make your mind easy, Ralph shall go to-night. As there is a heaven above  us, he shall go to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned out of the room as he finished speaking.  It was now late in February; there had been continued wet weather for upwards  of a week, and on this day the rain beat incessantly against the windows of  Jenny&rsquo;s room. The sky without was dull and leaden, and the wind whistled in the  long corridor outside the door. Jenny found her novels very uninteresting. The  volumes were too heavy for her to hold, and they dropped out of her weak hands  and slid off the counterpane on to the floor. She lay, hour after hour,  listening to every sound in the house &mdash; to the servants passing now and then  across the hall below, to the occasional opening and shutting of a door, to the  striking of the clocks, and to the barking of the sheep-dog in the back  premises. The day was long and dreary, and the invalid welcomed the winter  twilight and the maid-servant who brought her tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who makes my tea, Mary?&rdquo; Jenny asked, as the girl  arranged the things on a table by the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody ever touches it but yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody as I knows of, ma&rsquo;am. I leave the teapot on  the oven-top when I&rsquo;ve mashed the tea, for it to draw. I&rsquo;m sometimes out of the  kitchen; but I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone would touch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Ralph Purvis often in the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is, ma&rsquo;am, pretty well always about  there. The weather&rsquo;s too bad for him to be much about the farm now, and he&rsquo;s  very handy indoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards, when the girl came to take  the tray, she found the tea untouched; and her mistress told her to remove the  tea-things, as she had no inclination either to eat or drink.</p>
<p>The ceaseless and monotonous rain seemed to Jenny  as if it were bent on flooding the Grey Farm that evening. The cold wind crept  under the door of her room till the stiff folds of the heavy damask  bed-curtains rustled. The sashes of the windows rattled every now and then, as  if an angry hand had been beating at them from without.</p>
<p>The shaded lamp by the bedside left the corners of  the room in obscurity, and Jenny&rsquo;s disordered fancy conjured up the glittering  eyes of the bailiff leering at her out of the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, this dreary, dismal place!&rdquo; she said, over and  over again. &ldquo;Why does Dudley leave me here to  die alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could see her face in an oval mirror hanging  upon the wall opposite to her bed. The dim reflection in the depths of this  glass showed her a wan, pale, wasted face, and hollow, fever-bright eyes. It  seemed strange to her; and she shuddered to know it was her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall look like that in my coffin,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;except that my eyes will be closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleven o&rsquo;clock struck before her husband came to  his room. He had slept in an adjoining apartment during Jenny&rsquo;s illness.</p>
<p>She had in the course of the evening fallen several  times into a feverish slumber, and could hardly help fancying she had slept for  hours, and that the night must be far advanced. As the clock struck eleven, she  fell asleep once more; but her rest was broken by troubled dreams.</p>
<p>She dreamt that she was out upon the river-bank,  with the rain falling upon her uncovered head, and drenching her thin  nightdress. She was watching for Dudley, as  she had watched for him upon the night of the bailiff&rsquo;s return. Suddenly she  found that she had a child in her arms &mdash; a miserable, puny baby, that clung to  her convulsively, and twisted its tiny hands in the lace about her throat, as  if it were trying to strangle her. She strove to release herself, but it hung  about her with a heavy leaden weight that almost dragged her to the ground.</p>
<p>The rain beating in her face blinded her; her naked  feet slipped upon the river-bank; the low wail of the child rose to a shrill  scream of terror, and she awoke, with the cold perspiration streaming down her  forehead, to hear the Olney clock chime the quarter, and to hear, in the  direction of the servants&rsquo; rooms, the same pitiful wail she had heard from the  child in her dream.</p>
<p>What did it mean? There were no children at the  Grey Farm; and there never had been since her marriage.</p>
<p>The house was said to be haunted. She had heard of  more than one ghost-story attached to the dismal pile of building; but she had  laughed at them as absurd. What if one of them were true?</p>
<p>A strange, mad desire to encounter the supernatural  terror &mdash; if terror there were &mdash; took possession of her. She crept out of her  bed, wrapped herself in a shawl, and stole into the corridor. She was so weak  that she could scarcely stand, but she supported herself by clinging to the  wall, and contrived to reach the landing of the principal staircase, on the  other side of which was a door communicating with the servants&rsquo; rooms.</p>
<p>This door was ajar, and she could hear that the  child&rsquo;s cries proceeded from the other side.</p>
<p>She passed into the servants&rsquo; corridor, and traced  the sound to the little sitting-room that had once been occupied by Ralph and  his sister. A light shone through the crevice under the door of this room, and  through a keyhole which had been roughly cut in the wood.</p>
<p>There had never been a lock to the door, which was  only fastened by a latch and an iron bolt.</p>
<p>She could hear the low pitiful wail of the child,  and the voice of a woman trying to hush it to sleep. She fell on her knees at  the top of the little flight of steps leading to the door, and looked through  the keyhole into the room. Her husband was seated writing, at a small table, by  the light of one candle. Behind his chair, and looking over him as he wrote,  stood Ralph Purvis the bailiff. A woman dressed in a black gown and a thick  gray shawl sat by the little fireplace with a child in her arms &mdash; a pale-faced,  puny baby, that kept up an incessant wail. The woman had taken off her bonnet,  and had fastened it by the strings to the back of her chair.</p>
<p>Jenny knew this woman, by her likeness to the  bailiff, to be his sister Martha, Dudley&rsquo;s old  housekeeper.</p>
<p>Neither of the three uttered a word, and the  silence was only broken by the scratching of Dudley&rsquo;s  pen over the paper, and the smothered crying of the child, muffled in the  woman&rsquo;s shawl. When Dudley&rsquo;s pen had reached  the bottom of the page he stopped, glanced over what he had written, and then  signed his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, your signature as witness,&rdquo; he said, handing  the pen to Ralph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sign!&rdquo; answered the bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, I tell you again, it won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You settle this place on your lawful son and  heir, Dudley Carleon junior, crying there in the lap of his mother, your lawful  wife, Martha Carleon. You settle this property on my sister&rsquo;s child, provided  we renounce all claim upon you and keep your secret, and you go off to Australia  with that curly-haired Miss who calls herself your wife! I tell you it won&rsquo;t  do. It&rsquo;s not enough. I want the farm: but I want money to improve the farm &mdash; I  want that six thousand pounds; and I&rsquo;ll have that, or nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six thousand pounds!&rdquo; Jenny mechanically repeated  the words with a shudder. It was her fortune, no doubt, that this man wanted.  Her fortune, which, should she die childless, would go to Dudley Carleon; such  had been the condition in the marriage-settlement to which she had consented.</p>
<p>The woman sitting over the fire never once looked  up during this brief dialogue. Dudley buried  his face in his hands, with a loud groan, and let his head fall upon the  writing before him.</p>
<p>Ralph Purvis struck his clenched fist upon the  table, and said, &ldquo;Look ye here, Muster Carleon. Go back a bit; go back to four,  or nigh upon five years ago, when you was a stripling just come home from  college, and Muster Martin was alive, and well and strong, and promising to  make older bones than you, any day. Do you remember moping about the place;  looking miserable; or making believe to be happy, and looking more miserable  still for making believe? Do you remember one afternoon, when they was making  hay in one of the river-side meadows, and you was lying upon the ground  pretending to read your book &mdash; do you remember my coming up behind you sudden,  and hearing you groan? I asks you what&rsquo;s the matter, and what it is that&rsquo;s on  your mind; and after a deal of talk, you tells me it&rsquo;s college debts; debts as  you dare not mention to Muster Martin, because he&rsquo;s been so kind to you  already; and you&rsquo;re afraid of an exposure, and of being expelled, perhaps, and  all sorts of things; and you&rsquo;re very proud, you say, and you&rsquo;ll cut your throat  sooner than you&rsquo;ll live to be disgraced. I told you I was very sorry for you,  and said that if you&rsquo;d only been the eldest son instead of the youngest, things  would have been easy enough, for then you could have raised the money upon a  mortgage. We spoke about it again the next day, and the next, and the next  after that, till we came, somehow, to be always talking of it, and we grew  quite friendly &mdash; a&rsquo;most like equals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; groaned Dudley,  with his face still hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of a month, Muster Carleon, I was awoke  one moonlight night by you standing by my bedside. If I&rsquo;d ever believed in  ghosts, I should have thought you was one. If a ghost&rsquo;s horrid to look at, it  can&rsquo;t be more horrid to look at than you was that night. You had a slip of paper  in your hand, with something wrote upon it &mdash; wrote small and backwards, and not  like your own handwriting. &lsquo;Ralph,&rsquo; you said, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re going to the market-town  to-morrow; get me some of the stuff that&rsquo;s written down here, at a chemist&rsquo;s,  and don&rsquo;t tell anybody who you&rsquo;re getting it for!&rsquo; That was every word as  passed between us. I got the stuff the next day; but I told the chemist&rsquo;s lad  to give me double the quantity that was written on the paper, and to give it me  in two packets, labelled alike and sealed alike, and to sign his name and write  the date upon one of &rsquo;em. The shop was crowded, being market-day, and the  master of it took no notice of me, or what I was buying. I kept the packet that  was signed and dated, and I gave you the other. This was early in August.  Muster Carleon died on the 24th of September. Well; things went smooth enough  for a time; you got out of your debts by means of a mortgage, which was kept  pretty dark until the farm improved under my care, and you paid it off. Now,  all this time I hadn&rsquo;t asked you a favour, not so much as for a sixpence over  my wages; but it isn&rsquo;t strange that I expected to gain something by having  served you faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Served me! Yes, as the devil serves his bonded  slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I served you faithful, anyhow: and I said to you  at last, <i>&lsquo;</i>Come, Muster Carleon,  you&rsquo;re beholden to me for many things, but most of all you&rsquo;re beholden to me  for having kept a still tongue. Marry my sister, and make her mistress of the  Grey Farm.&rsquo; You laughed in my face, and refused me what I asked. I could afford  to bide my time. Three years after your brother&rsquo;s death I had an explanation  with you in this very room. You knocked me down and split my head open; but you  came to terms, and, a month after, you married my sister by bans at the Borough Church,  London. You  were ashamed of your wife, and you were ashamed of what you had done. So you  buried her down in a country village, and as soon as you set eyes upon that  fine curly-haired Miss of yours, you packed me off to keep company with my  sister. But I wasn&rsquo;t quite such a fool as you took me for, Muster Carleon. I  had my spies in Olney, and I heard all about you from them. I heard of your  marriage, and I heard of your wife&rsquo;s fortune; but I determined to bide my time,  and to make things work round to my own advantage. I waited three or four  months after your marriage, and then, having sent for you to throw you off your  guard, I stole a march upon you, and came down here to look about me. I found  poor Miss slightly ailing. Since then she&rsquo;s got worse; and yesterday I wrote to  my sister, telling her to come down here, as I thought it likely she might have  her rights before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley Carleon lifted his ghastly face from his  hands, staggered out of his chair, and fell on his knees at the bailiff&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he said in a thick choking voice;  &ldquo;look at me; I am so degraded and lost a wretch that I kneel to <i>you,</i> and ask <i>you</i> to pity me! No, not to pity me, to pity <i>her &mdash; </i>the helpless woman I have deceived. Save her, and I will  surrender this place, and every farthing I have in the world. Save her, and I  will go out of this house, penniless and shelterless, to beg my bread or to die  of starvation. Save her, and there is nothing I am not prepared to endure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you endure the gallows?&rdquo; asked Ralph with a  sneer. Dudley groaned aloud, but did not  answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thought not,&rdquo; said the bailiff. &ldquo;Now, listen  to me. Let me alone, and I&rsquo;ll keep your secret to the day of my death.  Interfere with me, or try to thwart my plans, or pry into my business, and I&rsquo;ll  let people know what you are, and how you poisoned your brother Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny Carleon, crouching at the threshold of the  door, had heard every word spoken by Ralph Parvis. But at this hideous climax  her senses left her, and she fell down the steps leading from the corridor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheLastChance"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  The Last Chance</h2>
<p>When Jenny recovered her senses, she found herself  lying in her own room, with a bandage round her forehead. It was broad  daylight, and her husband was seated at the bedside.</p>
<p>She put her hand to her head, looked round  helplessly, and asked, &ldquo;What have I been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found you in the corridor leading to the  servants&rsquo; rooms. What, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, had taken you there, Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene of the night before flashed upon her. She  felt that her only chance of escape was to affect ignorance of what she had  discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a child cry, and I went to  ascertain; but I was so weak that I could scarcely reach the stairs. I suppose  I fainted in trying to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband looked at her with a searching glance,  and then said, &ldquo;Foolish girl, the child you heard was Martha&rsquo;s. My old  housekeeper has been married a year and a half, and she has come down here to  see if her brother can get her a place. Try and go to sleep, Jenny; you did  yourself harm by getting up last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened to the sound of her husband&rsquo;s receding  footsteps as he left the room. She heard him go along the corridor, down the  stairs, across the hall, and into the back premises. As the doors closed behind  him, she crept from her bed, and began hurriedly to dress herself in the  warmest garments she could find. She was dizzy from the cut on her forehead,  and so weak that she was compelled to support herself by holding on to the  furniture as she dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God, grant me strength to crawl from this  horrible place,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or I shall never leave it till I am carried out in  my coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put on her bonnet, and muffled herself in a  great woollen shawl, then crept along the corridor, and slowly descended the  stairs. To her unspeakable relief she found the hall deserted. She stole out of  the front door and closed it behind her. The cold winter air blew upon her face  and revived her. She looked up at the long rows of windows and the dreary  stone-frontage of the house, as some wretched criminal might look back at a  prison from which he had just escaped.</p>
<p>She had tied a thick veil over her plain straw  bonnet. &ldquo;If any of the men are about they will take me for one of the  servants,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>She hurried across the garden, through the gate,  and on to the river-bank, without meeting anyone in her way. The tide was high,  the river swollen by the rains, the meadows by the bank half-hidden by the  standing water. She seemed to have a superhuman strength as she walked rapidly  along the narrow pathway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I can but reach the  highroad I may get a lift in some market-cart going into Olney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when she came to the first gate she stopped  suddenly. On the other side of it two men were hard at work with spades and  pickaxes. They had just finished cutting a drain straight across the bank &mdash; a  channel through which the water off the meadows was pouring down into the  river.</p>
<p>This open drain presented an impassable barrier  between the Grey Farm and the outer world. To reach the high-road by any other  way Jenny must traverse half-a-dozen fields, and walk a distance of two miles.</p>
<p>Her heart seemed to stop beating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must stay here to be murdered,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;for  escape is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what if she were to appeal to one of the men?  Wide as the drain was, they might lift her over it if they pleased. She crawled  on until she came up to the spot where they were at work. One of them had his  back towards her as she approached, but at the sound of her footsteps he turned  round. That man was Ralph the bailiff.</p>
<p>The fact of his presence revealed to her the  terrible truth. This barrier between herself and Olney was a part of the  hideous plot, the end of which was her death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go into Olney,&rdquo; she said resolutely;  &ldquo;put a board over that drain, that I may cross it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered Ralph indifferently,  &ldquo;that it can&rsquo;t be done. First and foremost, there isn&rsquo;t a board to be had; and  as to going into Olney, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re acting against the doctor&rsquo;s orders in  coming out at all, ma&rsquo;am &mdash; and I&rsquo;m sure Muster Carleon would break his heart to  see you run the risk of catching cold. Here he comes, though, so he can settle  the question himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband rode up to them as the man spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You out of doors this bitter  morning! Are you mad? For Heaven&rsquo;s sake come back to the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley Carleon,&rdquo; Jenny said, looking her husband  full in the face, &ldquo;I want to escape from this place. I want to go into Olney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, you are not in a fit state to be out  at all. Why, you can scarcely stand! &mdash; Lift your mistress up to me, Ralph,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>The bailiff lifted Jenny in his arms, and her  husband seated her before him upon his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jenny, you tremble like a leaf; you will  catch your death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked round at him with grave sorrowful eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Dudley, Dudley,  when I came to this place, I came to meet my death. I was warned, but I would  not listen.&rdquo; Ralph the bailiff looked significantly at his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This work must be finished to-night,&rdquo; he said,  taking up his spade. &ldquo;If you want to go into Olney to-morrow, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he added,  &ldquo;you can go and welcome. We shall have laid down the pipes and filled in this  dyke before ten o&rsquo;clock to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dudley rode slowly back to the  house and carried his wife into the hall. He was about to take her upstairs,  but she stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me lie on the sofa in the parlour,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;I hate those dreary upstairs rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her into the parlour, drew the sofa close  to the fire, covered her with a thick railway-rug, and left her. She lay, hour  after hour, repeating to herself again and again, &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should she appeal to the servants for protection  from Ralph Purvis and his accomplice &mdash; her guilty husband? They would not  believe her. Very likely Ralph had taught them to think her mad &mdash; had prepared  them to set down every word she could say to the raving of a disordered mind.  They would no doubt refuse to credit her accusations, as she had refused to  credit those of Agnes Marlow. In that case they might betray her, and she would  be only hastening her doom.</p>
<p>All communication between Olney and the farm had  been purposely cut off. The doctor could not pay his accustomed visit. She was  utterly friendless and alone. She knew that she had been taking slow poison for  weeks &mdash; that her murderer was lying in wait to give her the final dose, and,  that failing, that he would not scruple to have recourse to more violent means.  He might force the deadly draught down her throat. How could she resist? A  strong hand over her mouth, and her cries would be stifled until they grew  still in death. They would bury her, as they had buried Martin Carleon, without  a shadow of suspicion arising in the mind of the doctor, and no one outside  that lonely house would ever know the truth. To-day the hours were but too  swift. This day flew by with terrible rapidity. It grew dark; the hour  approached at which the men were accustomed to go to bed. This was the hour she  dreaded above all others, for she felt she would then be left alone with Dudley  Carleon and his bailiff.</p>
<p>She watched the clock intently, listening as she  did so for the first clang of the bell which rang at the servants&rsquo; bedtime. It  rang every night with unvarying punctuality as the clock struck nine. It was  five-and-twenty minutes past eight. There were five-and-thirty minutes left,  and during those five-and-thirty minutes she must think of some means of  escape. Five-and-thirty minutes! She counted the seconds by the tumultuous  beating of her heart. The hand of the clock had just reached the half-hour,  when, to her horror, the bell rang violently. She started up from her sofa. She  heard a hurried trampling of feet in the hall, and the men rushing out at the  front door. Ralph Purvis was shouting to them to be quick &mdash; to look alive &mdash;  look alive! or they would be too late.</p>
<p>What could it mean? She ran to one of the windows,  drew up the blind, and looked out. A hayrick in a field at some distance had  taken fire. It was one of several standing near together, and the men were  hurrying to extinguish it, so as to save the others.</p>
<p>Her brain reeled, as the thought flashed upon her  that this unlooked-for accident had taken Ralph from the house. She was free &mdash;  free to attempt once more to escape. But how?</p>
<p>The hall-door had been left open by the men hurrying  out. A sudden inspiration made the hot blood rush from her heart into her face.  The river! There was the river &mdash; the river, which crept close behind the house,  and down which the barges were often passing to Olney. Too desperate to  remember her weakness, she stole round to the back premises, across the  farmyard, and on to the bank. It was pitch dark. She looked about her wildly. <i>&ldquo;</i>A dozen barges might pass me,&rdquo; she  thought, &ldquo;and I should not see one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could hear the voices of the men trying to  extinguish the hayrick in the field in front of the house. She waited about ten  minutes &mdash; ten interminable minutes &mdash; and at the end of that time she saw a  feeble light creeping along the river. As it approached her, she perceived that  it came from a lantern tied to the mast of a coal-barge.</p>
<p>She called to the men on board this barge. Her  voice was feeble from the effects of her long illness, but her repeated cries  at last attracted their attention. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter there?&rdquo; asked the man who  was steering the barge.</p>
<p>At that moment the flames of the burning hayrick,  which had before been hidden by the house, shot above the roof, and cast a  lurid glare upon the river bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the house must be on fire?&rdquo; the man said to  his comrade. &ldquo;Get ashore, Bill, and see what&rsquo;s amiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men jumped into a boat at the stern of  the barge, and pushed it to the bank on which Jenny was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;is the house  a-fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, take me to Olney,&rdquo; she cried imploringly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you ten pounds if you&rsquo;ll take me to Olney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man thought she was one of the servants  belonging to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it, lass?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;has your master  been ill-using you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered eagerly, &ldquo;take me to Olney, for  pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my lass; give us your hand, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man lifted her into the boat, and from the boat  into the barge; his companion wrapped her in a great-coat, and seated her  against the chimney of the little cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s warm there, my lass,&rdquo;, he said; &ldquo;we shall be  nigh upon an hour getting into Olney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never took her eyes from the red light in the  sky, which revealed the sharp outline of the roof-tops and chimneys of the Grey  Farm, till a curve of the river hid the gaunt building from her view. Then she  lifted her voice to heaven, and thanked God for her deliverance from peril and  death.</p>
<p>One of the men from the barge carried her to the  Rectory, and placed her in Mr. Marlow&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>The worthy Rector was bewildered and amazed by her  appearance; but she only told him that her husband had treated her unkindly,  and that she had come to throw herself upon her old guardian for shelter and  protection.</p>
<p>The terrors of the awful night and day through  which she had passed had been too much for a constitution undermined as hers had  been. She had an attack of brain-fever, in which she lay for weeks upon a sick  bed; in her delirium perpetually reacting the scenes through which she had  passed. Agnes Marlow came from Scarborough on  hearing of her friend&rsquo;s illness, and nursed her with a sister&rsquo;s devotion.</p>
<p>As soon as Jenny was strong enough to be moved,  they carried her to Burlington  for change of air.</p>
<p>They had never asked her any questions about her  husband&rsquo;s conduct to her, and she had made no inquiries as to what had taken  place during her illness. She felt a strange serenity of mind in the society of  these dear and devoted friends, and she had scarcely sufficient courage to  allude to the past. She had noticed, however, that on the first occasion of her  rising from her bed, Agnes, and the servant who helped to nurse her, had  dressed her in mourning, and that they still continued to bring her this black  dress every day. It was simply made, but trimmed with a deep border of crape.  On the third day after her arrival at Burlington,  as she sat alone with Agnes, she said very quietly, &ldquo;Agnes, why am I in  mourning? Who is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you bear to hear, Jenny? Are you strong enough  to hear something that may perhaps shock you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell me the worst. Who is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudley Carleon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s cheeks grew white, but she did not utter  one exclamation of either surprise or sorrow. &ldquo;May a merciful God forgive him  his sins!&rdquo; she said solemnly.</p>
<p>It was not until she had quite recovered that she  was told the entire truth &mdash; Dudley Carleon had drowned himself in the river  behind his house on the night of Jenny&rsquo;s escape; and Ralph Purvis the bailiff  had proved a will of Dudley&rsquo;s which left the Grey Farm estate to himself and  his sister conjointly.</p>
<p>As soon as Ralph and Martha were placed in  possession of the estate, they sold the Grey Farm and all appertaining to it,  and the brother and sister, with Dudley&rsquo;s infant son, sailed for Australia.</p>
<p>To none but these two people and Jenny Trevor was  the real cause of Dudley&rsquo;s suicide ever known.  It was supposed by most people to have been caused by financial difficulties,  and that the burning of several valuable hayricks had gone some way to drive  the young farmer to this terrible deed. It was some time afterwards discovered  that the ricks had been fired by a young man who had been dismissed from the  farm a few days before, under circumstances of peculiar cruelty, by Ralph  Purvis.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>Far away in the Bush there is a rich sheep-farm,  stretching over many miles of fair and luxuriant country. The master counts his  cattle by hundreds, and bids fair to become a wealthy and a respected citizen  of that distant world. Grim, sleek, dark, and silent, he stalks about amongst  his farm-servants, always near them when they least expect to see him &mdash; always  watching them when they fancy themselves most unobserved.</p>
<p>Dark and silent as himself, his sister, dressed in  widow&rsquo;s weeds, sits nursing her sickly child at the door of their  roughly-built, but comfortable, dwelling. They are neither of them liked by  their dependents; but they are feared, and are better served than a better  master and mistress might be.</p>
<p>Jenny Trevor has kept Dudley Carleon&rsquo;s secret, and  has lived to marry happily, but not to forget either her terrible sufferings,  or her merciful deliverance out of the murderous hands of Ralph the bailiff.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="CaptainThomas"></a>Captain Thomas</h1>
<p>I hold it as a rule, that nine men out of ten are  unfortunate in their first attachments; and I hold it as another rule, that  it&rsquo;s a very good thing for them that they are. If fortune had smiled upon my  first wooing, I should have united myself to a young lady of thirty-five,  assistant at a pastrycook&rsquo;s in the neighbourhood of the academy where I was  educated, with whom I became enamoured at the age of nine and three-quarters.  Naturally, the lady repulsed my advances on account of my tender years; though  I had two Latin Grammars; a book of French Exercises; a penknife; Telemachus,  with the verbs in <i>Italics;</i> and a new  pair of boots; with which I offered to endow her upon my marriage. I wept when  she refused me; whereupon, out of the tenderness of her heart, she gave me a  stale Bath bun,  which had the effect of choking rather than of consoling me. I believe she was  a fat woman with red hair; but I saw her then with the glamour of first love  about her, and I thought she was a happy combination of Mary Queen of Scots (I  was familiar with that ill-used potentate through an itinerant exhibition of  waxwork) and a young lady I had seen at Richardson&rsquo;s, dancing the Highland  Fling.</p>
<p>So I, being one of the nine men out of the ten  above alluded to, was unlucky in my first attachment.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I was any more fortunate in my  second, which flame was illumined by the bright eyes of a cousin three years  older than myself, who boxed my ears on my declaring myself in the back-parlour  on a wet Sunday. I knew to what cause to attribute <i>this</i> repulse: I was not yet out of jackets, and I glanced behind me  in the direction where my coat-tails ought to have been, and felt that my enemy  was <i>there.</i></p>
<p>My third passion was equally luckless; my fourth no  more successful; and I really think I had had the honour of having my hand in  marriage refused seventeen times, counting from the pastrycook, when my happy  stars (I said happy stars <i>then</i>, I  know <i>now</i> that the hand of a malignant  genius was in the business) threw me across the path of Rosa Matilda. I met her  at a tea-party at Somers   Town, whither my sisters  had taken me in a cab &mdash; for which I had to pay &mdash; tight boots, and a white  waistcoat. Now, I have always considered that the end and aim of that snare and  delusion which is popularly called a friendly cup of tea is to sit in an  uncomfortable position in an uncomfortable chair; drink hot weak tea, which  afflicts you with temporary dropsy; eat spongy preparations of the genus Lunn  or Muffin, admirally adapted to impair your digestive organs; and utter  articulate inanities. I am not a brilliant man, I believe, at the very best of  times. I never remember throwing an assembly into convulsions of laughter with  my wit, or electrifying it with my eloquence. I may have done so often, but my  modesty has prevented my being conscious of the fact. But O, let me be so  luckless as to be invited to join &ldquo;a few friends&rdquo; to tea between seven and  eight, and the veriest phantasm of a &ldquo;phantasm captain&rdquo; is a Chamier, Marryat, or  Basil Hall, in powers of amusing conversation, compared to me. O, how I hate  the simpering hostess in her best gown! But I know that she is fidgety about  that eighteenpenn&rsquo;orth of cream, that won&rsquo;t go all round with the third cup,  and that her heart sinketh at the sight of a three-cornered bit of muffin  dropped, greasiest side downwards, on the new Brussels; yes, I know she is  wretched, and I could almost pity her. But O, my hatred for the &ldquo;few friends&rdquo;!  I hope that young man from the War-office has tight boots on too; there is a  look about the corners of his mouth that can come from nothing but corns. Yes;  I am neither physiognomist nor physiologist if that nervous twitch of the  facial muscles doesn&rsquo;t denote the presence of corns, and the patent leather is  drawing them. He and I, in all that heartless throng, are friends and brothers.</p>
<p>But for the rest &mdash; who seem to have not a care on  earth; whose proper element seems hot weak tea with too much sugar in it; and  to whom semi-baked batter in a spongy condition appears to be wholesome and  invigorating food &mdash; for them my hatred is unsoftened by any touch of sympathy.  We are foes &mdash; foes to the death, or rather to the door-mat; for once out of the  abominable Castle of Despair &mdash; when once their cabs have driven them off to the  &ldquo;Supreme Silences,&rdquo; and mine has driven me to my lodgings &mdash; I think of them no  more.</p>
<p>I digress. <i>Revenons  &agrave; nos moutons:</i> that is to say, Rosa Matilda. I met her at a tea-party. O,  that so lovely an Aphrodite could rise out of the mud-ocean of &ldquo;a few friends&rdquo;!  I think I was more than usually brilliant that evening. I asked her if she&rsquo;d  seen Millais&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yale of Rest,&rdquo; and if she didn&rsquo;t think the nuns were ugly. I  knew I was safe in saying this; I&rsquo;d heard the remark made so often. I asked her  if she liked muffins, and if she didn&rsquo;t consider them indigestible; and if she  didn&rsquo;t think they were always administered to people at a tea-party to  incapacitate them for eating any supper. She said I was a quiz, she was sure. I  was glad she was sure, because I was myself by no means so convinced of the  fact. I asked her if she&rsquo;d read the <i>Tale  of Two Cities</i>, and if she didn&rsquo;t think it more affecting than <i>Pickwick.</i> I asked her which she liked  best, <i>Frederick the Second</i>, or the <i>Virginians</i>, and which of the heroines of  the Idyls she thought would have made the best housekeeper for a young man who  married on two hundred a-year. Enid,  no doubt, because she didn&rsquo;t mind wearing faded silk. She told me she thought  Geraint a perfect brute of a husband, and that Lancelot was the only man in the  book worth anything; and that Guinevere was very silly in throwing away the  diamonds, even if she threw off the lover. She thought Elaine a very forward  young person, who couldn&rsquo;t leave off running after the men, even when she was dead.  This, and much more, she said, which I to hear, of course, did seriously  incline; in fact, so seriously, that I ran some risk of sliding off my  hostess&rsquo;s slippery embroidered chair in bending over the scented tresses of the  lovely being who was seated on a low <i>prie-dieu</i> by my side. Rapturous moments! I remarked on the opposite side of the room the  female parent of my charmer, who from time to time cast uneasy glances in the  direction of her daughter and myself. Presently she addressed some few whispered  words to our hostess, and either my eyes deceived me, or that lady&rsquo;s lips  shaped the syllables, &ldquo;five hundred a-year, and expectations from an uncle.&rdquo; At  any rate, the effect of the communication was pleasing, and the mamma of my  loveliest smiled upon her child. After tea this divine being sang, and I turned  over the leaves of her music &mdash; delightful task! I believe I always turned them  over in the wrong place. Who could keep his eyes upon inanimate crotchets and  quavers while <i>she</i> was singing? In  short, my time was come! I beheld my first love, all but seventeen. The evening  was a dream; she sang &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t know what she sang; she played &mdash; it may have  been a sonata by Sebastian Bach, or it might be variations on a  Christy-Minstrel melody; but it was to me the music of the spheres, and would  have been had it been the merest domestic request to &ldquo;Polly&rdquo; to make the  ordinary preparations for the evening meal. I took her in to supper. I sat next  her at supper, and we were crowded. I procured her chicken, and I carved a  tongue for her. I sent a lot of particoloured jujubes, which adorned that  comestible, into her lap in my enthusiasm; but <i>Amare et sapere</i> &mdash; the proverb is somewhat musty, &mdash; but nobody ever  did, you know.</p>
<p>O, the nectar that those dismal liquids, the two-shilling  Cape and the two-and-sixpenny Marsala,  to say nothing of the African sherry, became, when you quaffed them by <i>her</i> side! I introduced her to my  sisters. They said afterwards in the cab, going home, that she was an affected  thing, and that her crinoline set vilely. What did I care for her crinoline?  And if <i>that</i> silk, as they said, had  been evidently turned from the top to the bottom, what did I care? My Enid was  lovelier than all the world; and as to her faded silk &mdash; why, I&rsquo;d buy her a new  one &mdash; or she should have it dyed &mdash; and so and so. Mamma<i> &mdash; her</i> mamma &mdash; she wore a front; but she was <i>her </i>mamma; and it was a mighty effort, but I always looked as if I  believed in it &mdash; her mamma asked me to call; and I said I knew most of the  managers of the West-end theatres (I hope those gentlemen will forgive me; and  I believe they will, for they most have been in love themselves at some remote  period of their existences), and that I could get &ldquo;orders,&rdquo; and might I bring  them to the Pocklintons? [Pocklinton was my Rosa Matilda&rsquo;s surname. <i>Feu</i> Pocklinton (Mrs. P. was a widow) had  been in the Post-office &mdash; I never asked what; he might have been a &ldquo;twopenny,&rdquo;  or a &ldquo;general,&rdquo; for aught I cared.] I might bring the orders. I did. I got them  from my old friend Scrauncher, who does the theatricals for the <i>Daily Scarifier;</i> and I treated him to  uncountable &ldquo;bitters&rdquo; at the hostelry where he broke covert. So Rosa Matilda,  Mrs. P., and myself went in a cab; I with my back to the horses, of course; but  cabs are narrow, and <i>she</i> was  opposite; I didn&rsquo;t think the fare from Mornington-place to the Olympic too  much.</p>
<p>O, my Rosa, &ldquo;hollow-hearted&rdquo;! where, where are the  half-crowns I used to spend on those dear deluding hansoms, that were always  beckoning to me in the Strand, and that <i>would </i>draw me up to the Hampstead-road,  in spite of myself?</p>
<p>Well, my eighteenth venture seemed to be a  fortunate one; Rosa Matilda and I were engaged. Yes; I had said one day in the  drawing-room (mamma had a call to make, and would I excuse her?), &mdash; we were  alone, &mdash; I had said that &ldquo;the happiness &mdash; future life &mdash; depended &mdash; one word &mdash;  render &mdash; happy or miserable.&rdquo; And Rosa Matilda had said, &ldquo;Lor, Mr. Strothers!&rdquo;  (I forgot to mention, by-the-bye, that my name is Strothers &mdash; Christian name,  Benjamin &mdash; and <i>that</i> has told against  me on some occasions)&mdash; &ldquo;Lor, Mr. Strothers, what can I say to make you happy or  miserable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you say &mdash; ?&rdquo; and then, and <i>then</i> &mdash; there followed the old, old,  pitiful, hackneyed, worn-out, new and original, eminently-successful farce! &mdash;  the blushes, the smiles, the tears, the little trembling hand, the surprise,  and all the shabby old properties thereunto belonging; and I found myself  accepted. Seventeen performances had, perhaps, taken a little of the freshness  out of the said cosmopolitan farce. Seventeen wakings from the same dream made  it, perhaps, rather hard to forget that the dream was a dream.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was an <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i> even in that gush of rapture, and I may have thought  that I was only playing at being happy after all. But, <i>carpe diem</i>, and here is Mrs. Pocklinton come home; and &ldquo;Well, she  never! &mdash; and of all the surprising things &mdash; and Rosey, naughty girl, to be so  sly &mdash; and how strange that she should never have had the least idea!&rdquo; And I  have not the slightest doubt that this woman and her daughter had talked over  me and my prospects, and the advantages of a marriage with me, and the  conflicting advantages of that offer of Brown&rsquo;s, and that possible offer of  Jones&rsquo;s, with the strong probability that before long Robinson himself might  &ldquo;pop,&rdquo; these hundred times by their bedroom fires during our brief  acquaintance. But better, as the poet says, &ldquo;to have loved and lost&rdquo; &mdash; better  to be the weakest of fools than to lose the capability of being made a fool of  &mdash; better the maddest dream earth can give than that sober waking which tells us  we can dream no more. So I was, upon the whole, glad that Rosa Matilda accepted  me; and I bought her a diamond ring at Hancock and Burbrook&rsquo;s that afternoon,  and I put it upon her finger after tea.</p>
<p>So we were engaged. Time passed. I had taken a  house and furnished it, guided by my future mother-in-law. The day was fixed  for our marriage. It was to take place in December. We were now in November;  yes, we were in that dreary and suicidal month, when I for the first time heard <i>his </i>name &mdash; the name of my unknown and  mysterious rival &mdash; the name of the being on whom, for some months of my life, I  poured the inarticulate anathema, the concentrated hate, of a hitherto-peaceful  mind. It was in this wise: we had been to the theatre; we had seen a farce, &mdash; I  forget the title, but I know Mr. Buckstone had his coat split up the back, and  that everybody took everybody for somebody else; so, as I daresay these  incidents only occur in one piece, my readers will recognise the dramatic  production of which I have forgotten the name; &mdash; we had been to the theatre,  and I had returned to the Pocklintons&rsquo; to supper. We had scalloped oysters; I  was helped twice: the bottled ale was peculiarly delicious. Life seemed that  night one bright and golden dream. I little knew the Damoclesian sword which  was at that very moment dangling from the whitewashed medallion in the centre  of the ceiling. I little knew that the Thunderer had his bolt in his hand, and  was only waiting the most convenient moment for launching that instrument at  the devoted head of Benjamin Strothers, of the Inner Temple.  I had my fork midway between my plate and my mouth; the moderator-lamp was  burning brightly; that nightmare of a young woman in a rustic dress was asking  that eternal &ldquo;Momentous Question&rdquo; of that Frankenstein of a young man in  chains, on the wall opposite me; the fire was fierce and glowing, &mdash; a cinder  fell out into the fender; I remember (so, in the great epochs of our lives, do  the most trivial things impress us!) I wondered whether the housemaid would use  that cinder in the morning to light the fire, or whether she would throw it on  the ash-heap in the back-garden, when Mrs. Pocklinton remarked, &ldquo;You are fond  of fish, Mr. Strothers?&rdquo; I thought this was a hit at me for having been helped  twice; if it was, it was mean: for were not those very oysters part of a barrel  of Colchesters of my own presenting?&mdash; &ldquo;You are fond of fish? Ah, Rosey, wasn&rsquo;t  Captain Thomas fond of fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sword had dropped &mdash; the bolt was launched; the  Thunderer put his hands in his pockets, and I daresay resumed that little  skirmish with the Ox-eyed about his predilection for late hours and fancy  dress. The blow was struck! Captain Thomas!</p>
<p>The reader will naturally observe, &ldquo;Well, what  then? What then? There is nothing in the mere mention of the name of Captain  Thomas; there is nothing even in Captain Thomas being fond of fish.&rdquo; But I  think there is a great deal in Rosa Matilda&rsquo;s starting from her seat at the  mention of that name, putting her handkerchief to her eyes, and darting  hurriedly from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sensitive child!&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklinton. &ldquo;It is  very odd; but we actually daren&rsquo;t mention his name before her. It was a most  extraordinary infatuation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Extraordinary infatuation! Now this was pleasant  for me, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray, madam,&rdquo; I said, not without some degree  of severity, &ldquo;may I be <i>allowed</i>!&rdquo; (I  laid a sarcastic stress upon &ldquo;allowed&rdquo;) &ldquo;to inquire <i>who&rdquo;</i> (another sarcastic stress upon &ldquo;who,&rdquo; and then I was done up in  the way of breath) &ldquo;Captain Thomas may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Mrs. P., &ldquo;the dearest creature! He was&mdash;&rdquo;  And she didn&rsquo;t say what he was, for at this very moment re&euml;nter Rosa Matilda  with red eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, dear Benjamin, for being so silly,&rdquo;  she murmured; &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s very, very weak and childish; but he loved me so,  poor dear &mdash; and I &mdash; I&mdash;&rdquo; (symptoms of more tears)&mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d had him so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d had him so long! He couldn&rsquo;t have been &mdash; No;  that was too horrible! And, besides, he was a captain &mdash; a warrior &mdash; a man of  mature years &mdash; an accepted lover, of course &mdash; my predecessor in the affections  of this false girl and Mrs. P.&rsquo;s scalloped oysters.</p>
<p>Well, what was to be done? Discard Rosa Matilda,  and get the upholsterer to take back the furniture at a reduction, like that  dear, volatile hero of M. de Kock&rsquo;s romance, <i>Ce Monsieur,</i> who was always furnishing apartments, and always  selling his movables and garnitures? No; prudence whispered that I should lose  by the transaction; and I loved Rosa Matilda. This Captain Thomas, this  military or naval commander, as the case might be, was a being of the past. I, <i>I </i>was the conqueror; and I registered an  inward vow, that once married to Rosa Matilda, it should be my care to provide  her with more substantial causes for red eyes than phantasm Captain Thomases.</p>
<p>So I let it pass; and I had hot brandy-and-water  after supper, and Rosa Matilda had spoonfuls out of my glass, and she burnt my  hand with the bowl of the spoon in fascinating playfulness, and we behaved with  the infantine simplicity of a pair of turtle-doves, to whom sorrow and sighing  and Captain Thomases were unknown.</p>
<p>The first time, I have said before, it was in this  wise; the second time it was in another wise.</p>
<p>Our house was furnished, and we went one afternoon  to look at it. The Brussels  was down in the dining-room, the tapestry in the drawing-room. It was Mrs. P.&rsquo;s  taste. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t believe in sky-blue  roses on a primrose ground; but I daresay she did, and she would have the  carpet. The Kidderminsters upstairs were the most innocent, gushing,  simple-minded patterns you ever saw; verdant as meadows in spring, and an  admirable <i>fond</i> for the white  curtains, and the white-and-gold china, and the maple wardrobe with  looking-glass doors and china knobs to the drawers. Mrs. P. said the house was  a <i>bijou,</i> and that if the two  treasures she had recommended to us as cook and housemaid only kept it in  order, as she would see that they did (I said, &ldquo;Thank you:&rdquo; I made a mental  resolve to have no interference from <i>her;</i> but I committed myself to nothing by saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;), we should have the  most perfect establishment at the West-end. It was Haverstock-hill, but she  called it the West-end. Well, we were in the drawing-room; we had admired  everything &mdash; and Rosa Matilda would make me open all the cabinet-drawers and  all the chiffonier doors; they were stiff, and I hurt myself; but we weren&rsquo;t  married yet, so of course I couldn&rsquo;t be rude enough to refuse &mdash; and we were  just going away, when all of a sudden Mrs. P. was struck by the hearthrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so beautifully soft; and those lovely  forget-me-nots!&rdquo; (The blue roses were forget-me-nots.) &ldquo;Such an exquisite, such  a&rdquo; &mdash; she might say&mdash; &ldquo;poetical idea. It was really like walking on the <i>Idyls of the King</i>. It seemed the  heaven,&rdquo; if she might be so bold as to make such a paraphrase, &ldquo;up-breaking  through the hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;O, ah; yes, to be sure.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t quite  know what she was driving at, when Rosa Matilda said, in her most gushing  manner &mdash; that was the worst of Rosa Matilda, she <i>would</i> gush &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;O mamma, mamma! wouldn&rsquo;t Captain Thomas have been  happy here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, upon my word, I was close to a spring sofa, and  I sank down on it aghast. I &mdash; <i>I</i> had  furnished this house! I had submitted to, perhaps, such extortion from the most  respectable of tradesmen as no man ever before endured.</p>
<p>Mrs. P. paid the bills for me; and there was a new  sofa, value 12<i>l</i>. 12<i>s</i>. if a halfpenny, in her drawing-room in Mornington-place,  that I never quite made out. I had done all this, and now I was told how happy  Captain Thomas would have been in this house of my providing. O! I am not a man  prone to use unconstitutional language, but I said, &ldquo;O!&rdquo; But, bless you, this  was nothing; the Thunderer hadn&rsquo;t done with me yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said that elderly serpent of a  mother-in-law, that was to have been, of mine. &ldquo;This hearthrug, how he would  have loved it! He would have appreciated it more than you do, Mr. Strothers, I  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, would he?&rdquo; This, of course, was a hit at my  want of taste. Captain Thomas would have understood the aesthetics of those  blue anomalies; they were as big as breakfast-cups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma; for I should have brought him here,  you know, poor darling, if we hadn&rsquo;t lost him,&rdquo; said Rosa Matilda. &ldquo;You  shouldn&rsquo;t have kept him all to yourself, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, now! talk of &mdash; well, a rivalry between mother  and daughter! Why, in the Roman Empire at its very worst stage of corruption,  when Vitellius set the Tiber on fire, and played the violin while it was  blazing, when Julius C&aelig;sar lighted Athens  with burning Calvinists, could there have been anything worse than this?</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; I was quite beyond words, so I  said, &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear,&rdquo; she continued &mdash; my wife, that was to  be, continued (why, Desdemona bothering Othello about that pocket-handkerchief  she wanted him to give to Cassio, was nothing to this!),&mdash; &ldquo;you would have grown  so fond of him, Benjamin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should I, Benjamin? O, I daresay. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said,  &ldquo;no, madam; I will have no Captain Thomases here. I &mdash; I &mdash; since it&rsquo;s gone so  far, and since the house is furnished, and my new coat come home, we will say  no more; but no Thomases here; no, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like them?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;how very odd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, <i>odd</i> was it? Well! I had seen a book, with a yellow paper-cover, at  Mornington-place; a book in a foreign language; and I attributed the evident  absence of moral region in the cerebral development of the woman I adored to a  gradual eating away of that department of the brain, from the perusal of books  in a foreign language; and I registered another vow, that when married to me, Rosa  Matilda should only read those sterling English works of fiction which elevate  the moral sense while they develop the intellectual organs. She should have her  Pierian draught from the pure fountains of Fielding and Smollett, the pious  inculcations of Jonathan Sterne (connected with the Church, I know, and I  believe an Irish bishop). Not for her lips those exciting and poisonous  beverages whose spring is in Soho-square and the Burlington Arcade, to say  nothing of obliging Mr. Jeffs at Brighton, and that handy little shop in  Holborn at which I myself deal.</p>
<p>Well, this was the second time of my hearing that  hateful name. Let me now describe the third. It was the night before our  wedding &mdash; I mean, it was to have been the night before our wedding &mdash; I went to  drink tea with my charmer; the cup which cheers, &amp;c., and the lightest of  suppers, were the only refreshments I ever obtained from Mrs. Pocklinton, whose  widowed circumstances forbade dinner-giving. In the hall I trod into a raised  pie; the confectioner&rsquo;s youth had left it on the door-mat while he handed the  maid other cates. They were for the wedding-breakfast &mdash; I mean, they were to  have been for the wedding-breakfast. It is hard that the conventionalities of  this world condemn one to indigestion on the happiest day of one&rsquo;s life. One&rsquo;s  mother-in-law has to pay for the sacrificial feast, that&rsquo;s one comfort.</p>
<p>It was rather a dismal evening than otherwise; the  house was suffering from an eruption of sharp-edged trunks and bonnet-boxes,  and the effect on one&rsquo;s shins was disagreeable. Rosa Matilda was low-spirited,  and burst out crying at the sight of the Britannia-metal teapot, saying it was  the last time she should ever have tea out of that dear old teapot. But, as I  said before, that was the worst of Rosa Matilda; there was too much of the  &ldquo;gushing thing&rdquo; about this Hampstead-road child of nature. I directed the  luggage-labels for her boxes. We were going to Paris &mdash; and I couldn&rsquo;t spell Meurice&rsquo;s Hotel;  it was aggravating, and Rosa Matilda&rsquo;s spirits improved so much as to enable  her to laugh at me. Altogether, I was not sorry when the time arrived for my  departure. Mrs. Pocklinton squeezed my hand as we parted, and told me there was  not another man in England  (how did she know? she didn&rsquo;t know all the other men in England) to whom she could have so  confidently trusted the happiness of her beloved child. She would have said the  same words to either Brown, Jones, or Robinson, I knew; but I did my best to  look grateful, &mdash; and so we parted.</p>
<p>The Thunderer was at it again!</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t gone three hundred yards before I suddenly  remembered that I didn&rsquo;t remember what time I was to meet them at St. Paneras  Church on the following day. It might be at seven in the morning; it might be  at four in the afternoon. I must go back and inquire. That housemaid of theirs  was, <i>as usual</i>, flirting with the  policeman at the garden-gate, consequently the hall-door was open. I passed her  and went in; the parlour-door was ajar &mdash; and I heard &mdash; yes, I heard from the  lips of the woman I was going to marry &mdash; these passionate exclamations:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling Tom, my own precious Thomas! <i>Ums </i>Thomas!&rdquo; In the whole course of our  loves she had never called me <i>Ums</i> Benjamin. <i>Ums</i> was evidently a  mysterious expression of endearment, especially consecrate to this military or  naval deceiver, &ldquo;<i>Ums</i> Thomas has come  back to ums; ums naughty boy, then! There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the &ldquo;There!&rdquo; there was that indescribable and  unmistakable sound &mdash; something between the whistling of birds in wet weather  and the drawing of corks &mdash; which one is in the habit of hearing under the  mistletoe. She &mdash; my &ldquo;future&rdquo; &mdash; was kissing Captain Thomas, or Captain Thomas  was kissing her! What mattered it which? Ruin either way!</p>
<p>There was an umbrella-stand in the hall. I  retreated into the shadow thereof as Rosa Matilda rushed out of the room.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Mamma!&rdquo; she called at the  foot of the stairs; &ldquo;Mamma, would you believe it? he&rsquo;s come back! The Captain!  He came in at the back-bedroom window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back-bedroom window! Pretty goings-on! I saw it in  perspective in the Sunday papers, headed &ldquo;Frightful Depravity in the  Hampstead-road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so thin, mamma! O, so thin; quite wasted  away! I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s been shut up somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The profligate! In prison for debt, I daresay. The  Bench, or Whitecross-street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his whiskers, mamma, his dear whiskers are  grown at least an inch longer!&rdquo; and then she bounded into the parlour again;  and the bird-whistling and the cork-drawing began again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And um darling Thomas will never, never, never  leave his Rosey Posey again &mdash; will he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And really now, what made the conduct of this young  woman seem more than ordinarily culpable was, that all the affection appeared  to be on her side; for not <i>one</i> word  had this apathetic naval or military commander uttered during the whole time.</p>
<p>Well, I think I&rsquo;d heard enough. Now, wouldn&rsquo;t any  reasonable person suppose I&rsquo;d heard enough? So I went quietly out of the house,  and home to my chambers, where I packed a carpet-bag, took a cab, and left London by the mail-train for Dover,  thence to Paris,  whence I was recalled by a letter from Mrs. Pocklinton&rsquo;s solicitor.</p>
<p>I am not a raving maniac, or a jibbering idiot; and  my hair did not turn white in a single night, as it might have done.</p>
<p>There was an action for Breach of Promise of  Marriage, and I had to pay one thousand pounds damages. Captain Thomas was a  very handsome BLACK CAT, which Rosa Matilda had been attached to from his  kittenhood, and the temporary loss of which had lacerated her tender heart.</p>
<p>I offered &mdash; I offered! &mdash; nay, I implored her to  marry me, and forget the past; but she wouldn&rsquo;t; and she has since married  Robinson; and my thousand pounds no doubt has furnished that elegant little  house of theirs in the Regent&rsquo;s Park, at the drawing-room window of which I  saw, on passing the other day, basking in the sun, my old and bitterest enemy,  Captain Thomas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><a name="TheColdEmbrace"></a>The Cold Embrace</h1>
<p>He was an artist &mdash; such things as happened to him  happen sometimes to artists.</p>
<p>He was a German &mdash; such things as happened to him  happen sometimes to Germans.</p>
<p>He was young, handsome, studious, enthusiastic,  metaphysical, reckless, unbelieving, heartless.</p>
<p>And being young, handsome, and eloquent, he was  beloved.</p>
<p>He was an orphan, under the guardianship of his  dead father&rsquo;s brother, his uncle Wilhelm, in whose house he had been brought up  from a little child; and she who loved him was his cousin &mdash; his cousin  Gertrude, whom he swore he loved in return.</p>
<p>Did he love her? Yes, when he first swore it. It  soon wore out, this passionate love; how threadbare and wretched a sentiment it  became at last in the selfish heart of the student! But in its first golden  dawn, when he was only nineteen, and had just returned from his apprenticeship  to a great painter at Antwerp, and they wandered together in the most romantic  outskirts of the city at rosy sunset, by holy moonlight, or bright and joyous  morning, how beautiful a dream!</p>
<p>They keep it a secret from Wilhelm, as he has the  father&rsquo;s ambition of a wealthy suitor for his only child &mdash; a cold and dreary  vision beside the lover&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>So they are betrothed; and standing side by side  when the dying sun and the pale rising moon divide the heavens, he puts the  betrothal ring upon her finger, the white and taper finger whose slender shape  he knows so well. This ring is a peculiar one, a massive golden serpent, its  tail in its mouth, the symbol of eternity; it had been his mother&rsquo;s, and he  would know it amongst a thousand. If he were to become blind tomorrow, he could  select it from amongst a thousand by the touch alone.</p>
<p>He places it on her finger, and they swear to be  true to each other for ever and ever &mdash; through trouble and danger &mdash; in sorrow  and change &mdash; in wealth or poverty. Her father must needs be won to consent to  their union by and by, for they were now betrothed, and death alone could part  them.</p>
<p>But the young student, the scoffer at revelation,  yet the enthusiastic adorer of the mystical, asks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can death part us? I would return to you from the  grave, Gertrude. My soul would come back to be near my love. And you &mdash; you, if  you died before me &mdash; the cold earth would not hold you from me; if you loved  me, you would return, and again these fair arms would be clasped round my neck  as they are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she told him, with a holier light in her  deep-blue eyes than had ever shone in his &mdash; she told him that the dead who die  at peace with God are happy in heaven, and cannot return to the troubled earth;  and that it is only the suicide &mdash; the lost wretch on whom sorrowful angels shut  the door of Paradise &mdash; whose unholy spirit haunts the footsteps of the living.</p>
<p>The first year of their betrothal is passed, and  she is alone, for he has gone to Italy,  on a commission for some rich man, to copy Raphaels, Titians, Guidos, in a  gallery at Florence.  He has gone to win fame, perhaps; but it is not the less bitter &mdash; he is gone!</p>
<p>Of course her father misses his young nephew, who  has been as a son to him; and he thinks his daughter&rsquo;s sadness no more than a  cousin should feel for a cousin&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the weeks and months pass. The  lover writes &mdash; often at first, then seldom &mdash; at last, not at all.</p>
<p>How many excuses she invents for him! How many  times she goes to the distant little post-office, to which he is to address his  letters! How many times she hopes, only to be disappointed! How many times she  despairs, only to hope again!</p>
<p>But real despair comes at last, and will not be put  off any more. The rich suitor appears on the scene, and her father is  determined. She is to marry at once. The wedding-day is fixed &mdash; the fifteenth  of June.</p>
<p>The date seems burnt into her brain.</p>
<p>The date, written in fire, dances for ever before  her eyes.</p>
<p>The date, shrieked by the Furies, sounds  continually in her ears.</p>
<p>But there is time yet &mdash; it is the middle of May &mdash;  there is time for a letter to reach him at Florence;  there is time for him to come to Brunswick,  to take her away and marry her, in spite of her father &mdash; in spite of the whole  world.</p>
<p>But the days and weeks fly by, and he does not  write &mdash; he does not come. This is indeed despair which usurps her heart, and  will not be put away.</p>
<p>It is the fourteenth of June. For the last time she  goes to the little post-office; for the last time she asks the old question,  and they give her for the last time the dreary answer, &ldquo;No; no letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the last time &mdash; for to-morrow is the day  appointed for her bridal. Her father will hear no entreaties; her rich suitor  will not listen to her prayers. They will not be put off a day &mdash; an hour;  to-night alone is hers &mdash; this night, which she may employ as she will.</p>
<p>She takes another path than that which leads home;  she hurries through some by-streets of the city, out on to a lonely bridge,  where he and she had stood so often in the sunset, watching the rose-coloured  light glow, fade, and die upon the river.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>He returns from Florence. He had received her letter. That  letter, blotted with tears, entreating, despairing &mdash; he had received it, but he  loved her no longer. A young Florentine, who had sat to him for a model, had  bewitched his fancy &mdash; that fancy which with him stood in place of a heart &mdash; and  Gertrude had been half forgotten. If she had a richer suitor, good; let her  marry him; better for her, better far for himself. He had no wish to fetter  himself with a wife. Had he not his art always? &mdash; his eternal bride, his  unchanging mistress.</p>
<p>Thus he thought it wiser to delay his journey to Brunswick, so that he  should arrive when the wedding was over &mdash; arrive in time to salute the bride.</p>
<p>And the vows &mdash; the mystical fancies &mdash; the belief in  his return, even after death, to the embrace of his beloved? O, gone out of his  life; melted away for ever, those foolish dreams of his boyhood.</p>
<p>So on the fifteenth of June he enters Brunswick, by  that very bridge on which she stood, the stars looking down on her, the night  before. He strolls across the bridge and down by the water&rsquo;s edge, a great  rough dog at his heels, and the smoke from his short meerschaum-pipe curling in  blue wreaths fantastically in the pure morning air. He has his sketchbook under  his arm, and, attracted now and then by some object that catches his artist&rsquo;s  eye, stops to draw: a few weeds and pebbles on the river&rsquo;s brink &mdash; a crag on  the opposite shore &mdash; a group of pollard willows in the distance. When he has  done, he admires his drawing, shuts his sketchbook, empties the ashes from his  pipe, refills from his tobacco-pouch, sings the refrain of a gay drinking-song,  calls to his dog, smokes again, and walks on. Suddenly he opens his sketch-book  again; this time that which attracts him is a group of figures: but what is it?</p>
<p>It is not a funeral, for there are no mourners.</p>
<p>It is not a funeral, but it is a corpse lying on a  rude bier, covered with an old sail, carried between two bearers.</p>
<p>It is not a funeral, for the bearers are fishermen  &mdash; fishermen in their every-day garb.</p>
<p>About a hundred yards from him they rest their  burden on a bank &mdash; one stands at the head of the bier, the other throws himself  down at the foot of it.</p>
<p>And thus they form a perfect group; he walks back  two or three paces, selects his point of sight, and begins to sketch a hurried  outline. He has finished it before they move; he hears their voices, though he  cannot hear their words, and wonders what they can be talking of. Presently he  walks on and joins them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a corpse there, my friends?&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a corpse washed ashore an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, drowned; &mdash; a young girl, very handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicides are always handsome,&rdquo; says the painter;  and then he stands for a little while idly smoking and meditating, looking at  the sharp outline of the corpse and the stiff folds of the rough  canvas-covering.</p>
<p>Life is such a golden holiday for him &mdash; young,  ambitious, clever &mdash; that it seems as though sorrow and death could have no part  in his destiny.</p>
<p>At last he says that, as this poor suicide is so  handsome, he should like to make a sketch of her.</p>
<p>He gives the fishermen some money, and they offer  to remove the sailcloth that covers her features.</p>
<p>No; he will do it himself. He lifts the rough,  coarse, wet canvas from her face. What face?</p>
<p>The face that shone on the dreams of his foolish  boyhood; the face which once was the light of his uncle&rsquo;s home. His cousin  Gertrude &mdash; his betrothed!</p>
<p>He sees, as in one glance, while he draws one  breath, the rigid features &mdash; the marble arms &mdash; the hands crossed on the cold  bosom; and, on the third finger of the left hand, the ring which had been his  mother&rsquo;s &mdash; the golden serpent; the ring which, if he were to become blind, he  could select from a thousand others by the touch alone.</p>
<p>But he is a genius and a metaphysician &mdash; grief,  true grief, is not for such as he. His first thought is flight &mdash; flight  anywhere out of that accursed city &mdash; anywhere far from the brink of that  hideous river &mdash; anywhere away from memory, away from remorse &mdash; anywhere to  forget.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>He is miles on the road that leads away from Brunswick before he knows  that he has walked a step.</p>
<p>It is only when his dog lies down panting at his  feet that he feels how exhausted he is himself, and sits down upon a bank to  rest. How the landscape spins round and round before his dazzled eyes, while  his morning&rsquo;s sketch of the two fishermen and the canvas-covered bier glares  redly at him out of the twilight!</p>
<p>At last, after sitting a long time by the roadside,  idly playing with his dog, idly smoking, idly lounging, looking as any idle,  light-hearted travelling student might look, yet all the while acting over that  morning&rsquo;s scene in his burning brain a hundred times a minute; at last he grows  a little more composed, and tries presently to think of himself as he is, apart  from his cousin&rsquo;s suicide. Apart from that, he was no worse off than he was  yesterday. His genius was not gone; the money he had earned at Florence still lined his  pocket-book; he was his own master, free to go whither he would.</p>
<p>And while he sits on the roadside, trying to  separate himself from the scene of that morning &mdash; trying to put away the image  of the corpse covered with the damp canvas sail &mdash; trying to think of what he  should do next, where he should go, to be farthest away from Brunswick and  remorse, the old diligence comes rumbling and jingling along. He remembers it;  it goes from Brunswick to Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
<p>He whistles to his dog, shouts to the postillion to  stop, and springs into the <i>coup&eacute;.</i></p>
<p>During the whole evening, through the long night,  though he does not once close his eyes, he never speaks a word; but when  morning dawns, and the other passengers awake and begin to talk to each other,  he joins in the conversation. He tells them that he is an artist, that he is  going to Cologne and to Antwerp to copy the Rubenses, and the great  picture by Quentin Matsys, in the museum. He remembered afterwards that he  talked and laughed boisterously, and that when he was talking and laughing  loudest, a passenger, older and graver than the rest, opened the window near  him, and told him to put his head out. He remembered the fresh air blowing in  his face, the singing of the birds in his ears, and the flat fields and  roadside reeling before his eyes. He remembered this, and then falling in a  lifeless heap on the floor of the diligence.</p>
<p>It is a fever that keeps him for six long weeks  laid on a bed at a hotel in Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
<p>He gets well, and, accompanied by his dog, starts  on foot for Cologne.  By this time he is his former self once more. Again the blue smoke from his  short meerschaum curls upwards in the morning air &mdash; again he sings some old  university drinking-song &mdash; again stops here and there, meditating and  sketching.</p>
<p>He is happy, and has forgotten his cousin &mdash; and so,  on to Cologne.</p>
<p>It is by the great cathedral he is standing, with  his dog at his side. It is night, the bells have just chimed the hour, and the  clocks are striking eleven; the moonlight shines full upon the magnificent  pile, over which the artist&rsquo;s eye wanders, absorbed in the beauty of form.</p>
<p>He is not thinking of his drowned cousin, for he  has forgotten her and is happy.</p>
<p>Suddenly someone, something from behind him, puts  two cold arms round his neck, and clasps its hands on his breast.</p>
<p>And yet there is no one behind him, for on the  flags bathed in the broad moonlight there are only two shadows, his own and his  dog&rsquo;s. He turns quickly round &mdash; there is no one &mdash; nothing to be seen in the  broad square but himself and his dog; and though he feels, he cannot see the  cold arms clasped round his neck.</p>
<p>It is not ghostly, this embrace, for it is palpable  to the touch &mdash; it cannot be real, for it is invisible.</p>
<p>He tries to throw off the cold caress. He clasps  the hands in his own to tear them asunder, and to cast them off his neck. He  can feel the long delicate fingers cold and wet beneath his touch, and on the  third, finger of the left hand he can feel the ring which was his mother&rsquo;s &mdash;  the golden serpent &mdash; the ring which he has always said he would know among a  thousand by the touch alone. He knows it now!</p>
<p>His dead cousin&rsquo;s cold arms are round his neck &mdash;  his dead cousin&rsquo;s wet hands are clasped upon his breast. He asks himself if he  is mad. &ldquo;Up, Leo!&rdquo; he shouts. &ldquo;Up, up, boy!&rdquo; and the Newfoundland leaps to his shoulders &mdash; the  dog&rsquo;s paws are on the dead hands, and the animal utters a terrific howl, and  springs away from his master.</p>
<p>The student stands in the moonlight, the dead arms  round his neck, and the dog at a little distance moaning piteously.</p>
<p>Presently a watchman, alarmed by the howling of the  dog, comes into the square to see what is wrong.</p>
<p>In a breath the cold arms are gone.</p>
<p>He takes the watchman home to the hotel with him  and gives him money; in his gratitude he could have given that man half his  little fortune.</p>
<p>Will it ever come to him again, this embrace of the  dead?</p>
<p>He tries never to be alone; he makes a hundred acquaintances,  and shares the chamber of another student. He starts up if he is left by  himself in the public room at the inn where he is staying, and runs into the  street. People notice his strange actions, and begin to think that he is mad.</p>
<p>But, in spite of all, he is alone once more; for  one night the public room being empty for a moment, when on some idle pretence  he strolls into the street, the street is empty too, and for the second time he  feels the cold arms round his neck, and for the second time, when he calls his  dog, the animal slinks away from him with a piteous howl.</p>
<p>After this he leaves Cologne, still travelling on foot &mdash; of  necessity now, for his money is getting low. He joins travelling hawkers, he  walks side by side with labourers, he talks to every foot-passenger he falls in  with, and tries from morning till night to get company on the road.</p>
<p>At night he sleeps by the fire in the kitchen of  the inn at which he stops; but do what he will, he is often alone, and it is  now a common thing for him to feel the cold arms around his neck.</p>
<p>Many months have passed since his cousin&rsquo;s death &mdash;  autumn, winter, early spring. His money is nearly gone, his health is utterly  broken, he is the shadow of his former self, and he is getting near Paris. He will reach that  city at the time of the Carnival. To this he looks forward. In Paris, in Carnival time,  he need never, surely, be alone, never feel that deadly caress; he may even  recover his lost gaiety, his lost health, once more resume his profession, once  more earn fame and money by his art.</p>
<p>How hard he tries to get over the distance that  divides him from Paris,  while day by day he grows weaker, and his step slower and more heavy!</p>
<p>But there is an end at last; the long dreary roads  are passed. This is Paris, which he enters for the first time &mdash; Paris, of which  he has dreamed so much &mdash; Paris, whose million voices are to exorcise his  phantom.</p>
<p>To him to-night Paris seems one vast chaos of  lights, music, and confusion &mdash; lights which dance before his eyes and will not  be still &mdash; music that rings in his ears and deafens him &mdash; confusion which makes  his head whirl round and round.</p>
<p>But, in spite of all, he finds the opera-house,  where there is a masked ball. He has enough money left to buy a ticket of  admission, and to hire a domino to throw over his shabby dress. It seems only a  moment after his entering the gates of Paris  that he is in the very midst of the wild gaiety of the opera-house ball.</p>
<p>No more darkness, no more loneliness, but a mad  crowd, shouting and dancing, and a lovely D&eacute;bardeuse hanging on his arm.</p>
<p>The boisterous gaiety he feels surely is his old  light-heartedness come back. He hears the people round him talking of the  outrageous conduct of some drunken student, and it is to him they point when  they say this &mdash; to him, who has not moistened his lips since yesterday at noon,  for even now he will not drink; though his lips are parched, and his throat  burning, he cannot drink. His voice is thick and hoarse, and his utterance  indistinct; but still this must be his old lightheartedness come back that  makes him so wildly gay.</p>
<p>The little D&eacute;bardeuse is wearied out &mdash; her arm  rests on his shoulder heavier than lead &mdash; the other dancers one by one drop  off.</p>
<p>The lights, in the chandeliers one by one die out.</p>
<p>The decorations look pale and shadowy in that dim  light which is neither night nor day.</p>
<p>A faint glimmer from the dying lamps, a pale streak  of cold gray light from the new-born day, creeping in through half-opened  shutters.</p>
<p>And by this light the bright-eyed D&eacute;bardeuse fades  sadly. He looks her in the face. How the brightness of her eyes dies out! Again  he looks her in the face. How white that face has grown! Again &mdash; and now it is  the shadow of a face alone that looks in his.</p>
<p>Again &mdash; and they are gone &mdash; the bright eyes, the  face, the shadow of the face. He is alone; alone in that vast saloon.</p>
<p>Alone, and, in the terrible silence, he hears the  echoes of his own footsteps in that dismal dance which has no music.</p>
<p>No music but the beating of his heart against his  breast. For the cold arms are round his neck &mdash; they whirl him round, they will  not be flung off, or cast away; he can no more escape from their icy grasp than  he can escape from death. He looks behind him &mdash; there is nothing but himself in  the great empty <i>salle;</i> but he can feel  &mdash; cold, deathlike, but O, how palpable! &mdash; the long slender fingers, and the  ring which was his mother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He tries to shout, but he has no power in his  burning throat. The silence of the place is only broken by the echoes of his  own footsteps in the dance from which he cannot extricate himself. Who says he  has no partner? The cold hands are clasped on his breast, and now he does not  shun their caress. No! One more polka, if he drops down dead.</p>
<p>The lights are all out, and half an hour after, the <i>gendarmes </i>come in with a lantern to  see that the house is empty; they are followed by a great dog that they have  found seated howling on the steps of the theatre. Near the principal entrance  they stumble over &mdash; </p>
<p>The body of a student, who has died from want of  food, exhaustion, and the breaking of a blood-vessel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><a name="MyDaughters"></a>My Daughters</h1>
<p>I have grown-up daughters. Perhaps after having  written that sentence there is not, in reality, the least occasion for me to  write any more. To the initiated (<i>i.e. </i>parties  having grown-up daughters themselves) I am sure there is not. They can guess  what I have suffered; for the very simple reason that they have most likely  suffered the same themselves. But to the uninitiated, this brief record of  misery may prove a warning.</p>
<p>I repeat, I have grown-up daughters, and I suffer.  Mind, I lay a peculiar emphasis on the compound adjective &ldquo;grownup.&rdquo; My  daughters, while in the nursery, were merely associated with such minor evils  as measles, juvenile parties, dancing-lessons, red sashes half-a-yard wide, and  refractory governesses. They came down to dessert, and made themselves ill with  unripe fruits, or smeared their infantine faces with preserved ginger, and were  sticky and unpleasant to the touch; beyond this, they were harmless; and when I  saw them encircling the shining mahogany after dinner, with round faces and  white frocks, after the manner of that Titan among the caricaturists, the late  John Leech, I used to think it, on the whole, rather a nice thing to have  daughters. Ah, I little knew! They are now grown up. They are of a sentimental  and poetical temperament. I don&rsquo;t find that fact to make any difference  whatever in my butcher&rsquo;s bill. My baker&rsquo;s account is not to be sneezed at  (indeed, I wish the bread purveyor would accept such a mode of remuneration).  If I am so weak-minded as to allow myself to be led by Juliana, Augustina, and  Frederica (their mamma chose their names) into a pastrycook&rsquo;s shop, I emerge  therefrom a wiser and a poorer man; but, for all this, they are romantic &mdash; very  romantic. They would like to break blood-vessels; or to go mad, and let their  back-hair down. They would deny this, but I know better. Now I am a plain man,  morally a very plain man; there is a fine oil-painting of me by Tomkins over my  diningroom mantelpiece; &mdash; personally, perhaps, I am not plain; there is a  double-chin in that picture that I never had, which I attribute to personal  enmity on the part of Tomkins.</p>
<p>I am not romantic; I am not sentimental. If I saw a  dead ass I should not cry; on the contrary, I should think it rather a good  job. Nobody will cry when I die, I daresay. Mrs. Blankstars will get the &pound;3,000  for which I am insured, and will be glad. The girls have fair complexions, and  will look well in mourning. I do not expect to be regretted.</p>
<p>I am, I repeat, not sentimental; if I met a young  person with a goat, I should do my best to avoid her, lest she should ask me  for alms. I cannot see why &ldquo;a primose on a river&rsquo;s brim&rdquo; should be of any more  value than a primrose anywhere else &mdash; less valuable, I should think, if  anything, as being in an inconvenient position. I am a practical man, and I  look at things in a practical light; if I put half-a-sovereign on the  drawing-room table, or if I take the same coin to Italy  and place it on the banks of the Lake   of Como, it would only be  ten shillings. Why, then, should a mere difference of position alter the value  of a primrose? And what is the value of a primrose? You can buy them in Covent Garden for twopence a bunch, and if you happen to  live at Brompton, as I do, you will find them apt to grow warm and collapse  unpleasantly before you have conveyed them to your abode. I was once persuaded  to walk half through one of the Ridings of Yorkshire with a great bundle of  hyacinths in my arms; of course they were flabby and faded when I got home.  Hyacinths are very well in the abstract, &ldquo;the heavens upbreaking through the  earth,&rdquo; and all that sort of thing; but in the concrete, especially if you have  to carry them, they&rsquo;re a decided nuisance. But my three girls, Juliana, Augustina,  and Frederica, are so many embodied and perambulatory Sentimental Journeys.</p>
<p>O, what I suffer! There was <i>Adam Bede.</i> Talk of the cholera, or the measles, or any of the  prevailing epidemics a family man is subject to; what are they to a new novel  breaking out in his household, and every member of that household taking it  successively! Then there was the &ldquo;Idyls of the King.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve not got over that  yet. I really think, if that respected individual the Laureate could only form  any conception of the terrors he inflicts on the respectable fathers of  families, he wouldn&rsquo;t do it; I repeat, he wouldn&rsquo;t do it. Good gracious me!  what I have suffered through that man ever since my daughters entered their  teens, or even before, would draw tears from the eyes of a Board of Works. O,  the anguish I have endured! Let me only refuse those horrid girls a new silk  gown, or a box at the opera, or a flower-show at Chiswick, and that moment I am  assailed with the information that their lives are &ldquo;weary,&rdquo; and that, on the  whole, they&rsquo;d find it agreeable to be dead. That &ldquo;he&rdquo; (name unknown) &ldquo;does not  come,&rdquo; ultimately <i>&ldquo;will not</i> come,&rdquo; &ldquo;she&rdquo; (name also unknown) &ldquo;said.&rdquo; This is a nice  thing to have thrown in one&rsquo;s face. Anything to avoid this! So I purchase the  dress, or the box, or the tickets for the horticultural f&ecirc;te, and fondly hope  for relief. Am I any better off? Not a bit of it. They dance round me, call me  the best of papas, and immediately begin to request Mrs. Blankstars to &ldquo;call&rdquo;  them &ldquo;early,&rdquo; for they&rsquo;re &ldquo;to be Queen of the May, mother dear,&rdquo; and  &ldquo;to-morrow&rdquo; (Chiswick F&ecirc;te) &ldquo;is the happiest day in all the livelong year.&rdquo; Do  I venture &mdash; as, being the head of the family, I have a right to do &mdash; to repel  the attentions of my junior clerk, with a salary of fifty pounds per annum, who  has presumed to fall in love with my youngest, I am informed immediately that  &ldquo;high hearts are more than coronets,&rdquo; and am insulted at my own table under  cover of &ldquo;Lady Clara Vere de Vere,&rdquo; and have rude remarks made to me about the  &ldquo;gardener Adam and his wife.&rdquo; It is foreign to the purpose of this paper to  state that I am pursued by the works of this dreadful man even at my office,  where my clerks write quotations from &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo; on my desk, thereby  injuring those articles of furniture; where my articled clerk recites the  &ldquo;Charge of the Six Hundred,&rdquo; while I am out of the room, and whittles the  office-stools with a penknife in his excitement; or twists the sealing-wax into  hot lumps with indignant perspiration, on the subject of &ldquo;Lady Clara;&rdquo; where my  junior partner reads the &ldquo;Idyls&rdquo; under cover of a lease which he pretends to be  perusing; and where I am sometimes greeted by parchments indorsed &ldquo;<i>In re </i>Stubbs and Guinivere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, we were scarcely out of <i>Adam Bede</i>, when the girls sickened for the &ldquo;Idyls.&rdquo; They had a  great struggle, so tremendous was the demand, to get it from Mudie&rsquo;s; and I&rsquo;m  sure for a week, our man-servant, Higgs, aged fourteen, almost lived upon the  road between Brompton and Bloomsbury. At last, the modest green-covered volume  arrived. O, little did I think what a viper that innocent-seeming book would  prove! The girls had high words that very evening about the perusal thereof;  they all wanted it at once, and their mamma only restored peace by persuading  Egbert, my only son, to read the poems aloud. He is not a good reader, my son  Egbert; at a very early age, when his &ldquo;name was Norval,&rdquo; I foresaw that oratory  would not be his strong point. Indeed, I took an entirely erroneous idea of  several Shakespearian characters from that child&rsquo;s recitations; and can  scarcely now dispossess myself of the conviction that the cholera was raging in  Denmark  during the reign of Hamlet&rsquo;s uncle, and that the afflicted prince was the chief  sufferer. There were great effects in &ldquo;To be or not to be,&rdquo; as rendered by my  son, which no physiologist could attribute to any cause but that exhausting  complaint. It was my firm opinion, too, that Othello was a victim to aggravated  toothache; Iago owns to having been troubled with it, and I&rsquo;m sure my son hit  off that phase of the Machiavellian Italian&rsquo;s character to a nicety. There was  a very interesting will-case in the Times of that day, and I had made up my  mind for a pleasant evening, and there was that awful boy droning out the  adventures of a young woman, who had, apparently, a very unpleasant husband,  whose conduct would have come under 3 George, IV, cap. 17, and Victoria, 3 &amp; 4 Vict  cap. 30. Oh, what I endured! I assure you that during the first week of the  &ldquo;Idyll&rdquo; attack I was positively afraid to bring home any gentleman of my  acquaintance to dinner, for I felt convinced that should he inadvertently, on  his taking leave, have said, &ldquo;By the bye, Miss Blankstars, can I do anything  for you in town to-morrow?&rdquo; my daughter Frederica would have taken off her  chenille net and pulled the hair-pins and the frizzy things out of her hair,  and would have marched straight up to him, and said, &ldquo;I have gone mad, I love  you, let me die!&rdquo; &mdash; and there&rsquo;d have been a situation for the father of a  family! I dined at the Crown and Sceptre, Greenwich, during this awful period,  with Bangstaff, late of the late East India Company, and I had scarcely the  courage to look out of the window of that hostelry, for fear I should behold my  youngest floating down the river on a Chelsea coal-barge, steered by a young  man from the Deaf and Dumb Asylum. They were always repeating passages from  this fearful work. One in particular I remember, because I thought it was a  conundrum; it ran thus:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;His honour rooted in dishonour stood, <br>
And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hazarded a guess, and said, &ldquo;Because he was the  Bishop of London.&rdquo; My unnatural children laughed at me. This is a feeble  description of my sufferings; we have not got over the &ldquo;Idyls&rdquo; yet, nor will  anything eradicate the disease but a new poem by the same author.</p>
<p>Then, again, <i>Friedrich  the Second;</i> what have I not gone through in the cause of that potentate, to  say nothing of three hundred and sixty-two pages of his ancestors!  What&rsquo;s-his-name with the arrow, and Thingemabob the Bear, and spectre-hunting  Kaisers, with fathers in red stockings, fighting duels with Termagants, and  apparently getting the worst of it. O, the abusive names I have been called, on  venturing to remonstrate on the subject of milliners&rsquo; bills! Dryasdusts, phosphorescent  blockheads, putrefied specialities, and all sorts of insulting epithets have  rained down on this devoted head, Talk of rehabilitation, too; what have I not  endured in that way! My opinions are positively not worth a day&rsquo;s purchase.  To-day they have been reading that dear Mr. Froude, and tell me, when I come  home to dinner, that Henry the Eighth was an exemplary husband, and cut off his  wives&rsquo; heads for the good of the country. Yesterday they had been perusing that  delightful Monsieur Capefigue, and I was informed that Louis the Fifteenth was  an excellent family man, and Madame du Barry a most respectable young person. I  am quite prepared to hear, in the course of next week, that Dr. Johnson was  distinguished for his polished and conciliating manners, and that Lord  Chesterfield was a warm-hearted bear. Let them come on!</p>
<p>Then my daughters are perpetually taking up popular  ideas. A twelvemonth ago they took up the Italian question; not that they knew  anything about it, but they associated it with the opera, cheap ices, Mr.  Turner&rsquo;s pictures, <i>Jerusalem</i><i> delivered,</i> Savoy biscuits, &ldquo;<i>I promessi sposi&rdquo;</i> and organ-boys; and they took it up, and for the  period of three weeks were so many Miss Whites.</p>
<p>Of course it is only natural that, being blest with  three marriageable daughters, their settlement in life is a question of some  importance to Mrs. Blankstars and myself. But, good gracious me! what are you  to do with girls who form their idea of a husband from the last book they read,  and whose standard of perfection alters every time John Thomas brings a fresh  cargo from Mudie&rsquo;s? When the &ldquo;Idyl&rdquo; fever was at its maximum, they would hear  of nothing in the way of a husband but a stern, cold, impassible, and dignified  person, whose voice was &ldquo;hollow and monotonous like a ghost&rsquo;s;&rdquo; and I set my  wits to work to find someone amongst my acquaintance answering to the  description. I found the very thing &mdash; Stiggins, an Essex oyster-merchant, with  two thousand a-year, and a splendid place outside Colchester;  a solemn, elderly fogy, but a warm man. I invited him to dinner for the  following Sunday. He would have been an excellent match for my daughter  Juliana; Juliana is getting on, and has taken lately to geology; I heard her  make some remarks the other day about the old red sandstone that made me rather  anxious to see her settled. It&rsquo;s a bad sign, old red sandstone, and always  sounds like the wrong side of thirty. So I invited Stiggins to dinner. I might,  have saved myself the trouble; before Sunday came they were attacked by the <i>Tale of Two Cities,</i> and wouldn&rsquo;t have  anything but a dissipated barrister, who tied wet towels round his head, and  made himself supremely wretched about nothing particular. Now I was not going  to indulge them in this, or else there is Montague Bluffers of Fig-tree-court,  Temple, who never had a brief in his life, and whom I actually caught once, at  ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, with his towel dripping wet rolled round his head  like a turban, sitting up in bed drinking soda-water and strong green tea, and reading  French novels. But this wasn&rsquo;t the sort of thing for me, so I left them to get  over Sidney Carton as best they might, and the following week nothing would do  for them but <i>John Halifax, Gentleman.</i> I thought this sounded like the manufacturing towns, and I brought them home a Manchester man of my  acquaintance; but he hadn&rsquo;t read Tennyson, and he ate fish with his knife, so  he didn&rsquo;t meet their views.</p>
<p>One blessing, however, is that a very little  satisfies them in the fleshly representatives of their ideal heroes, and I am  often surprised by being told that young FitzGigfiz of the Blues, who parts his  hair down the middle, and who never had an idea in his life, is the very image  of Lancelot of the Lake, or that Hokus (of Pokus, Hokus, and Sons, bankers, Lombard-street)  is the living representative of Augustine Caxton. Hokus buys black-letter books  and rare editions, and will give fifteen guineas for a single volume, if it is  only dirty enough. I am sure, during the <i>Adam-Bede</i> fever, I was quite fidgety whilst our carpenter Humphries, a most respectable  person and by no means bad-looking, was in the house, putting down the  stair-carpets, for I daily expected that Augustina would express a desire to  marry him, and turn methodist preacher.</p>
<p>There is another source of suffering too: my girls  sing. The Signor Caterwaulini is an expensive man; but I don&rsquo;t so much mind  that, for he teaches them Italian songs, and I don&rsquo;t object to Italian songs.  One doesn&rsquo;t understand the words; one can go to sleep. What does it matter to  me if &ldquo;<i>Una voce poco fa&rdquo;?</i> I&rsquo;m sure &ldquo;<i>Una voce&rdquo;</i> was quite at liberty to do  anything of the sort, if it was agreeable to him. But O, the agony of those  English songs! That dreadful Annie, who is left in sorrow; that abominable  phantasmal fantasticality (P. F. is a specimen of the bad language those girls  have taught me), that decomposed inanity, &ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; the young person who is  always missed. I really was put to the blush the other day, on bringing William  Williams, of Lloyd&rsquo;s, home to dinner, to find Juliana seated at the piano,  singing, &ldquo;O, Willie, we have missed you; welcome, <i>welcome</i> home!&rdquo; Mrs. Blankstars told quite another story, for there  was only cold meat for dinner, and she looked like thunder. As to that young  woman who has been requested to go into the garden without intermission for  these last four years and upwards, and who has apparently never gone, I will  refrain from stating my feelings with regard to <i>her</i>, for there is a degree of bitterness in those feelings  untranslateable in these pages. If I do not fully appreciate the amount of  hardship involved in the necessity of bestowing &ldquo;the hand&rdquo; where it is utterly  impossible &ldquo;the heart&rdquo; can, either at the present time or any remoter period,  be its accompaniment, it is not for want of having heard enough about it. In  short, so much have I suffered from Stephen Glover, Balfe, and the Christy  Minstrels, that on my daughters yesterday stating in chorus that they were &ldquo;off  to Charlestown early in the morning,&rdquo; I really felt inclined to take them at their  word, and give them a cheque for their outfit and travelling expenses. There  are no limits to the recitals I could give of my acute sufferings of some eight  years; but as there are limits to the patience of my readers, and, as wise  Herbert has said, it is no more good manners &ldquo;to talk all than to eat all at a  feast,&rdquo; I will say no more; but with a solemn warning &mdash; warning not to be  disregarded, however short falling of dismal truth, or inarticulately rendered,  said warning may be &mdash; close my dreary record.</p>
<p>Let the fathers of families see that their  daughters, from a very early age, are taught that life has something better to  demand of them than novel-reading, or even worship of sublime and  unapproachable Alfred; that these, good in themselves, are a means, not an end;  and that if their books do not teach them better things than to lie on the sofa  all day reading them, and to spend all the rest of the day talking of them,  they do not read those books aright. What better &mdash; or what in a hundredth  degree so good &mdash; can I say than this? Let them be taught to follow the precept  of their own prophet:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;If time be heavy on your hands, <br>
Are there no beggars at your gates,<br>
Nor any poor about your lands?<br>
O, teach the orphan boy to read,<br>
Or teach the orphan girl to sew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><a name="TheMysteryAtFernwood"></a>The Mystery At Fernwood</h1>
<p>&ldquo;No, Isabel, I do <i>not</i> consider that Lady Adela seconded her son&rsquo;s invitation at all  warmly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the third time within the last hour that  my aunt had made the above remark. We were seated opposite each other in a  first-class carriage of the York  express, and the flat fields of ripening wheat were flitting by as like yellow  shadows under the afternoon sunshine. We were going on a visit to Fernwood, a  country mansion ten miles from York,  in order that I might become acquainted with the family of Mr. Lewis Wendale,  to whose only son Laurence I was engaged to be married.</p>
<p>Laurence Wendale and I had only been acquainted  during the brief May and June of my first London season, which I &mdash; orphan  heiress of a wealthy Calcutta merchant &mdash; had passed under the roof of my aunt,  Mrs. Maddison Trevor, the dashing widow of a major in the Life Guards, and my  father&rsquo;s only sister. Mrs. Trevor had made many objections to this brief six  weeks&rsquo; engagement between Laurence and me; but the impetuous young Yorkshireman  had overruled everything. What objection could there be? he asked. He was to  have two thousand a-year and Fernwood at his father&rsquo;s death; forty thousand  pounds from a maiden aunt the day he came of age &mdash; for he was not yet one-and-twenty,  my impetuous young lover. As for his family, let Mrs. Trevor look into Burke&rsquo;s <i>County Families</i> for the Wendales of  Fernwood. His mother was Lady Adela, youngest daughter of Lord Kingwood, of  Castle Kingwood, county   Kildare. What objection  could my aunt have, then? His family did not know me, and might not approve of  the match, urged my aunt. Laurence laughed aloud; a long ringing peal of that  merry, musical laughter I loved so well to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not approve!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;not love my little Bella!  That is too good a joke!&rdquo; On which immediately followed an invitation to  Fernwood, seconded by a note from Lady Adela Wendale.</p>
<p>To this note my aunt was never tired of taking  objection. It was cold, it was constrained; it had been only written to please  Laurence. How little I thought of the letter! and yet it was the first faint  and shadowy indication of that terrible rock ahead upon which my life was to be  wrecked; the first feeble link in the chain of the one great mystery in which  the fate of so many was involved.</p>
<p>The letter was cold, certainly. Lady Adela started  by declaring she should be most happy to see us; she was all anxiety to be  introduced to her charming daughter-in-law. And then my lady ran off to tell us  how dull Fernwood was, and how she feared we should regret our long journey  into the heart of Yorkshire to a lonely country-house, where we should find no  one but a captious invalid, a couple of nervous women, and a young man devoted  to farming and field-sports.</p>
<p>But I was not afraid of being dull where my light-hearted  Laurence was; and I overruled all my aunt&rsquo;s objections, ordered half a dozen  new dresses, and carried Mrs. Maddison Trevor off to the Great Northern Station  before she had time to remonstrate.</p>
<p>Laurence had gone on before to see that all was prepared  for us; and had promised to meet us at York,  and drive us over to Fernwood in his mail-phaeton. He was standing on the  platform as the train entered the station, radiant with life and happiness.</p>
<p>Laurence Wendale was very handsome; but perhaps his  greatest charm consisted in that wonderful vitality, that untiring energy and  indomitable spirit, which made him so different from all other young men whom I  had met. So great was this vitality, that, by some magnetic influence, it  seemed to communicate itself to others. I was never tired when Laurence was  with me. I could waltz longer with him for my partner; ride longer in the Row  with him for my cavalier; sit out an opera or examine an exhibition of pictures  with less fatigue when he was near. His presence pervaded a whole house; his  joyous laugh ran through every room. It seemed as if where he was sorrow could  not come.</p>
<p>I felt this more than ever as we drew nearer  Fernwood. The country was bleak and bare; wide wastes of moorland stretched  away on either side of the by-road down which we drove. The afternoon sunshine  had faded out, leaving a cold gray sky, with low masses of leaden cloud  brooding close over the landscape, and shutting in the dim horizon. But no  influence of scenery or atmosphere could affect Laurence. His spirits were even  higher than usual this afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have fitted up the oak-rooms for you,  ladies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Such solemn and stately chambers, with high-canopied beds  crowned with funeral plumes; black-oak paneling; portraits of dead-and-gone  Wendales: Mistress Aurora, with pannier-hoops and a shepherdess&rsquo;s crook;  Mistress Lydia, with ringlets <i>&agrave; la  Sevign&egrave;</i> and a pearl necklace; Mortimer Wendale, in a Ramilies wig;  Theodore, with love-locks, velvet doublet, and Spanish-leather boots. Such a  collection of them! You may expect to see them all descend from their frames in  the witching time of night to warm their icy fingers at your sea-coal fires.  Your expected arrival has made quite a sensation in our dull old abode. My  mother has looked up from the last new novel half a dozen times this day, I  verily believe, to ask if all due preparations were being made; while my dear,  active, patient, indefatigable sister Lucy has been running about  superintending the arrangements ever since breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister Lucy!&rdquo; I said, catching at his last  words; &ldquo;I shall so love her, Laurence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will, darling,&rdquo; he answered, almost  gravely, &ldquo;for she has been the best and dearest sister to me. And yet I&rsquo;m half  afraid; Lucy is ten years older than you &mdash; grave, reserved, sometimes almost  melancholy; but if ever there was a banished angel treading this earth in human  form, my sister Lucy surely is that guardian spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she like you, Laurence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like me! O, no, not in the least. She is only my  half-sister, you know. She resembles her mother, who died young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were at the gates of Fernwood when he said this,  &mdash; high wooden gates, with stone pillars moss-grown and dilapidated; a  tumble-down-looking lodge, kept by a slatternly woman, whose children were at  play in a square patch of ground planted with cabbages and currant-bushes,  fenced in with a rotten paling, and ambitiously called a garden. From this  lodge entrance a long avenue stretched away for about half a mile, at the end  of which a great red-brick mansion, built in the Tudor style, frowned at us,  rather as if in defiance than in welcome. The park was entirely uncultivated;  the trunks of the trees were choked with the tangled underwood; the fern grew  deep in the long vistas, broken here and there by solitary pools of black  water, on whose quiet borders we heard the flap of the heron&rsquo;s wing, and the  dull croaking of an army of frogs.</p>
<p>Lady Adela was right. Fernwood <i>was</i> a dull place. I could scarcely repress a shudder as we drove  along the dark avenue, while my poor aunt&rsquo;s teeth chattered audibly. Accustomed  to spend three parts of the year in Onslow-square, and the autumn months at  Brighton or Ryde, this dreary Yorkshire  mansion was a terrible trial to her rather oversensitive nerves.</p>
<p>Laurence seemed to divine the reason of our  silence. &ldquo;The place is frightfully neglected, Mrs. Trevor,&rdquo; he said  apologetically; &ldquo;but I do not mean this sort of thing to last, I assure you.  Before I bring my delicate little Bella to reign at Fernwood, I shall have landscape-gardeners  and upholsterers down by the score, and do my best to convert this dreary  wilderness into a terrestrial paradise. I cannot tell you why the place has  been suffered to fall into decay; certainly not for want of money, still less  for want of opportunity, for my father is an idle man, to whom one would  imagine restoring and rebuilding would afford a delightful hobby. No, there is  no reason why the place should have been so neglected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this more to himself than to us, as if the  words were spoken in answer to some long train of thought of his own. I watched  his face earnestly, for I had seldom seen him look so thoughtful. Presently he  said, with more of his usual manner, &ldquo;As you are close upon the threshold of  Fernwood now ladies, I ought perhaps to tell you that you will find ours a most  low-spirited family. With everything in life to make us happy, we seem for ever  under a cloud. Ever since I can remember my poor father, he has been sinking  slowly into decay, almost in the same way as this neglected place, till now he  is a confirmed invalid, without any positive illness. My mother reads novels  all day, and seems to exist upon sal-volatile and spirits of lavender. My  sister, the only active person in the house, is always thoughtful, and very often  melancholy. Mind, I merely tell you this to prepare you for anything you may  see; not to depress you, for you may depend upon my exertions towards reforming  this dreary household, which has sunk into habitual despondency from sheer easy  fortune and want of vexation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phaeton drew up before a broad flight of stone  steps as Laurence ceased speaking, and in five minutes more he had assisted my  aunt and myself to alight, and had ushered us into the presence of Lady Adela  and Miss Lucy Wendale.</p>
<p>We found Lady Adela, as her son&rsquo;s description had  given us reason to expect, absorbed in a novel. She threw down her book as we  entered, and advanced to meet us with considerable cordiality; rather, indeed,  as if she really were grateful to us for breaking in upon her solitary life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so good of you to come,&rdquo; she said, folding  me in her slender arms with an almost motherly embrace, &ldquo;and so kind of you,  too, my dear Mrs. Trevor, to abandon all your town pleasures for the sake of  bringing this dear girl to me. Believe me, we will do all in our power to make  you comfortable, if you can put up with very limited society; for we have  received no company whatever since my son&rsquo;s childhood, and I do not think my  visiting-list could muster half-a-dozen names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Adela was an elegant-looking woman, in the  very prime of life; but her handsome face was thin and careworn, and premature  wrinkles gathered about her melancholy blue eyes and thoughtful mouth. While  she was talking to my aunt, Lucy Wendale and I drew nearer to each other.</p>
<p>Laurence&rsquo;s half-sister was by no means handsome;  pale and sallow, with dark hair and rather dull gray eyes, she looked as if  some hidden sorrow had quenched out the light of her life long ago, in her  earliest youth; some sorrow that had neither been forgotten, nor lessened by  time, but that had rather grown with her growth, and strengthened with her  strength, until it had become a part of her very self, &mdash; some disappointed  attachment, I thought, some cruel blow that had shattered a girl&rsquo;s first dream,  and left a broken-hearted woman to mourn the fatal delusion. In my utter  ignorance of life, I thought these were the only griefs which ever left a  woman&rsquo;s life desolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will try and be happy at Fernwood, Isabel,&rdquo;  Miss Wendale said gently, as she drew me into a seat by her side, while  Laurence bent fondly over us both. I do not believe, dear as we were to each  other, that my Laurence ever loved me as he loved this pale-faced half-sister.  &ldquo;You will try and be happy, will you not, dear Isabel? Laurence has been  breaking-in the prettiest chestnut mare in all Yorkshire,  I think, that you may explore the country with us. I have heard what a daring  horsewoman you are. The pianos have been put in tune for you, and the  billiard-table re-covered, that you may have exercise on rainy days; and if we  cannot give you much society, we will do all else to prevent your feeling  dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very happy here with you, dear Lucy,&rdquo; I  said; &ldquo;but you tell me so much of the dulness of Fernwood, while, I daresay, you  yourself have a hundred associations that make the old place very dear to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down as I spoke, and a very faint flush  broke through the sallow paleness of her complexion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not very fond of Fernwood,&rdquo; she said gravely.</p>
<p>It was at Fernwood, then, that the great sorrow of  her life came upon her, I thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lucy,&rdquo; said Laurence almost impatiently,  &ldquo;everybody knows this dull place is killing you by inches, and yet nothing on  earth can induce you to quit it. When we all go to Scarborough or Burlington,  when mamma goes to Harrogate, when I run up to town to rub off my provincial  rust, and see what the world is made of outside these dreary gates, &mdash; you  obstinately persist in staying at home; and the only reason you can urge for  doing so is, that you must remain here to take care of that unfortunate invalid  of yours, Mr. William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was holding Lucy&rsquo;s hand in mine, and I felt the  poor wasted little fingers tremble as her brother spoke. My curiosity was  strongly aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. William!&rdquo; I exclaimed half involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure, Bella, I forgot to tell you of  that member of our household, but as I have never seen him, I may be forgiven  the omission. This Mr. William is a poor relative of my father&rsquo;s; a hopeless  invalid, bedridden, I believe &mdash; is he not, Lucy? &mdash; who requires a strong man  and an experienced nurse to look after him, and who occupies the entire upper  story of one wing of the house. Poor Mr. William, invalid as he is, must  certainly be a most fascinating person. My mother goes to see him every day,  but as stealthily as if she were paying a secret visit to some condemned  criminal. I have often met my father coming away from his rooms, pale and  melancholy; and, as for my sister Lucy, she is so attached to this sick  dependent of ours, that, as I have just said, nothing will induce her to leave  the house, for fear his nurse or his valet should fail in their care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I still held Lucy&rsquo;s hand, but it was perfectly  steady now. Could this poor relative, this invalid dependent, have any part in  the sorrowful mystery that had overshadowed her life? And yet, no; I thought  that could scarcely be, for she looked up with such perfect self-possession as  she answered her brother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My whole life has gradually fallen into the duty  of attendance upon this poor young man, Laurence; and I will never leave  Fernwood while he lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man! Mr. William was a young man, then.</p>
<p>Lucy herself led us to the handsome suite of  apartments prepared for my aunt and me. My aunt&rsquo;s room was separated from mine  by a corridor, out of which opened two dressing-rooms and a pretty little  boudoir, all looking on to the park. My room was at the extreme angle of the  building; it had two doors, one leading to the corridor communicating with my  aunt&rsquo;s apartments, the other opening into a gallery running the entire length  of the house. Looking out into this gallery, I saw that the opposite wing was  shut in by a baize door. I looked with some curiosity at this heavy baize door.  It was most likely the barrier which closed the outer world upon Laurence  Wendale&rsquo;s invalid relation.</p>
<p>Lucy left us as soon as we were installed in our  apartments. While I was dressing for dinner, the housekeeper, a stout, elderly  woman, came to ask me if I found everything I required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you haven&rsquo;t brought your own servant with you,  miss,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Miss Lucy told me to place her maid Sarah entirely at your  service. Miss gives very little work to a maid herself, so Sarah has plenty of  leisure time on her hands, and you&rsquo;ll find her a very respectable young woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her that I could do all I wanted for myself;  but before she left me I could not resist asking her one question about the  mysterious invalid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are Mr. William&rsquo;s rooms at this end of the house?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>
<p>The woman looked at me with an almost scared  expression, and was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Laurence been saying anything to you about  Mr. William?&rdquo; she said, rather anxiously as I thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Laurence and his sister Miss Lucy were both  talking of him just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, indeed, miss,&rdquo; answered the woman with an air  of relief; &ldquo;the poor gentleman&rsquo;s rooms are at the other end of the gallery,  miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he lived here long?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigh upon twenty years, miss &mdash; above twenty years,  I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he is distantly related to the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quite dependent on Mr. Wendale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of your master to have supported  him for so many years, and to keep him in such comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My master is a very good man, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman seemed determined to give me as little  information as possible; but I could not resist one more question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that in all these years Mr. Laurence has  never seen this invalid relation?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>It seemed that this question, of all others, was  the most embarrassing to the housekeeper. She turned first red and then pale,  and said, in a very confused manner, &ldquo;The poor gentleman never leaves his room,  miss; and Mr. Laurence has such high spirits, bless his dear heart, and has  such a noisy, rackety way with him, that he&rsquo;s no fit company for an invalid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evidently useless trying for further  information, so I abandoned the attempt, and bidding the housekeeper good  afternoon, began to dress my hair before the massive oakframed looking-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth of the matter is,&rdquo; I said to myself,  &ldquo;that after all there is nothing more to be said about it. I have tried to  create a mystery out of the simplest possible family arrangement. Mr. Wendale  has a bedridden relative, too poor and too helpless to support himself. What  more natural than that he should give him house-room in this dreary old  mansion, where there seems space enough to lodge a regiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found the family assembled in the drawing-room.  Mr. Wendale was the wreck of a very handsome man. He must in early life have  resembled Laurence; but, as my lover had said, it seemed indeed as if he and  the house and grounds of Fernwood had fallen into decay together. But  notwithstanding his weak state of health, he gave us a warm welcome, and did  the honours of his hospitable dinner-table with the easy grace of a gentleman.</p>
<p>After dinner, my aunt and Lady Adela sat at one of  the windows talking; while Laurence, Lucy, and I loitered upon a long stone  terrace outside the drawing-room, watching the last low crimson streak of the  August sunset fade behind the black trunks of the trees, and melt away into  faint red splashes upon the water-pools amongst the brushwood. We were very  happy together; Laurence and I talking of a hundred different subjects &mdash;  telling Lucy our London adventures, describing our fashionable friends, our  drives and rides, <i>fetes,</i> balls, and  dinners; she, with a grave smile upon her lips, listening to us with almost  maternal patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take you over the old house to-morrow,  Isabel,&rdquo; Laurence said in the course of the evening. &ldquo;I suppose Lucy did not  tell you that she had put you into the haunted room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not listen to this silly boy, my dear  Isabel,&rdquo; said Miss Wendale. &ldquo;Of course, like all other old houses, Fernwood can  boast its ghost-story; but since no one in my father&rsquo;s lifetime has ever seen  the phantom, you may imagine that it is not a very formidable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you own there <i>is</i> a ghost!&rdquo; I exclaimed eagerly. &ldquo;Pray tell me the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Bella,&rdquo; answered Laurence, &ldquo;and  then you&rsquo;ll know what sort of a visitor to expect when the bells of Fernwood  church, hidden away behind the elms yonder, tremble on the stroke of midnight.  A certain Sir Humphrey Wendale, who lived in the time of Henry the Eighth, was  wronged by his wife, a very beautiful woman. Had he acted according to the  ordinary fashion of the time, he would have murdered the lady and his rival;  but our ancestor was of a more original turn of mind, and he hit upon an  original plan of vengeance. He turned every servant out of Fernwood House; and  one morning, when the unhappy lady was sleeping, he locked every door of the  mansion, secured every outlet and inlet, and rode away merrily in the summer  sunshine, leaving his wife to die of hunger. Fernwood is lonely enough even  now, Heaven knows! but it was lonelier in those distant days. A passing  traveller may now and then have glanced upward at the smokeless chimneys, dimly  visible across the trees, as he rode under the park-palings; but none ever  dreamed that the deserted mansion had one luckless tenant. Fifteen months  afterwards, when Sir Humphrey rode home from foreign travel, he had some  difficulty in forcing the door of the chamber in which you are to sleep: the  withered and skeleton form of his dead wife had fallen across the threshold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrible story!&rdquo; I exclaimed with a shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a legend, dear Isabel,&rdquo; said Lucy;  &ldquo;like all tradition, exaggerated and distorted into due proportions of poetic  horror. Pray do not suffer your mind to dwell upon such a fable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I hope it is not true,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;How  fond people are of linking mysteries and horrors such as this with the history  of an old family! And yet we never fall across any such family mystery in our  own days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I slept soundly that night at Fernwood, undisturbed  by the attenuated shadow of Sibyl Wendale, Sir Humphrey&rsquo;s unhappy wife. The  bright sunshine was reflected in the oak-panels of my room, and the larks were  singing aloft in a cloudless blue sky, when I awoke. I found my aunt quite  reconciled to her visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Adela is a very agreeable woman,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;quiet, perhaps, to a fault, but with that high-bred tone which is always  charming. Lucy Wendale seems a dear good girl, though evidently a confirmed old  maid. You will find her of inestimable use when you are married &mdash; that is to  say, if you ever have to manage this great rambling place, which will of course  fall to your lot in the event of poor Mr. Wendale&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for myself, I was as happy at Fernwood as the  August days were long. Lucy Wendale rode remarkably well. It was the only  amusement for which she cared; and she and her horses were on terms of the most  devoted attachment. Laurence, his sister, and I were therefore constantly out  together, riding amongst the hills about Fernwood, and exploring the country  for twenty miles round.</p>
<p>Indoors, Lucy left us very much to ourselves. She  was the ruling spirit of the house, and but for her everything must have fallen  utterly to decay. Lady Adela read novels, or made a feeble attempt at amusing  my aunt with her conversation.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendale kept his room until dinner; while  Laurence and I played, sang, sketched, and rattled the billiard-balls over the  green cloth whenever bad weather drove us to indoor amusements.</p>
<p>One day, while sketching the castellated fa&ccedil;ade of  the old mansion, I noticed a peculiar circumstance connected with the suite of  rooms occupied by the invalid, Mr. William. These rooms were at the extreme  left angle of the building, and were lighted by a range of six windows. I was  surprised by observing that every one of these windows was of ground glass. I  asked Laurence the reason of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe the glare of light was too much for  Mr. William,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;so my father, who is the kindest creature in  Christendom, had the windows made opaque, as you see them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the alteration been long made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was made when I was about six years old; I have  rather a vague recollection of the event, and I should not perhaps remember it  but for one circumstance. I was riding about down here one morning on my  Shetland pony, when my attention was attracted by a child who was looking  through one of those windows. I was not near enough to see his face, but I  fancy he must have been about my own age. He beckoned to me, and I was riding  across the grass to respond to his invitation, when my sister Lucy appeared at  the window and snatched the child away. I suppose he was someone belonging to  the female attendant upon Mr. William, and had strayed unnoticed into the  invalid&rsquo;s rooms. I never saw him again; and the next day a glazier came over  from York, and  made the alteration in the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. William must have air; I suppose the  windows are sometimes opened,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never; they are each ventilated by a single pane,  which, if you observe, is open now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help pitying this poor man,&rdquo; I said,  after a pause, &ldquo;shut out almost from the light of heaven by his infirmities,  and deprived of all society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely so,&rdquo; answered Laurence. &ldquo;No one knows  how many stolen hours my sister Lucy devotes to her poor invalid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is a very studious man, and finds his  consolation in literary or scientific pursuits,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;does he read very  much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. I never heard of his having any books  got for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one thing has puzzled me, Laurence,&rdquo; I  continued. &ldquo;Lucy spoke of him the other day as a young man, and yet Mrs.  Porson, your housekeeper, told me he had lived at Fernwood for upwards of  twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; answered Laurence carelessly, <i>&ldquo;</i>Lucy no doubt remembers him as a young  man upon his first arrival here, and continues to call him so from mere force  of habit. But, pray, my little inquisitive Bella, do not rack your brains about  this poor relation of ours. To tell the truth, I have become so used to his  unseen presence in the house, that I have ceased to think of him at all. I meet  a grim wotnan, dressed in black merino, coming out of the green-baize door, and  I know that she is Mr. William&rsquo;s nurse; or I see a solemnfaced man, and I am  equally assured that he is Mr. William&rsquo;s servant, James Beck, who has grown  gray in his office; I encounter the doctor riding away from Fernwood on his  brown cob, and I feel convinced that he has just looked in to see how Mr.  William is going on; if I miss my sister for an hour in the twilight, I know  that she is in the west wing talking to Mr. William; but as nobody ever calls  upon me to do anything for the poor man, I think no more of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt these words almost a reproof to what might  have appeared idle, or even impertinent, curiosity on my part. And yet the  careless indifference of Laurence&rsquo;s manner seemed to jar upon my senses. Could  it be that this glad and highhearted being, whom I so tenderly loved, was  selfish &mdash; heedless of the sufferings of others? No, it was surely not this that  prompted his thoughtless words. It is a positive impossibility for one whose  whole nature is life and motion, animation and vigour, to comprehend for one  brief moment the horror of the invalid&rsquo;s darkened rooms and solitary days.</p>
<p>I had been nearly a month at Fernwood, when, for  the first time daring our visit, Laurence left us. One of his old  schoolfellows, a lieutenant in the army, was quartered with his regiment at York, and Laurence had  promised to dine with the mess. Though I had been most earnest in requesting  him to accept this invitation, I could not help feeling dull and dispirited as  I watched him drive away down the avenue, and felt that for the first time we  were to spend the long autumn evening without him. Do what I would, the time  hung heavily on my hands. The September sunset was beautiful, and Lucy and I  walked up and down the terrace after dinner, while Mr. Wendale slept in his  easy-chair, and my aunt and Lady Adela exchanged drowsy monosyllabic sentences  on a couch near the fire, which was always lighted in the evening.</p>
<p>It was in vain that I tried to listen to Lucy&rsquo;s  conversation. My thoughts wandered in spite of myself, &mdash; sometimes to Laurence  in the brilliantly-lighted mess-room, enlivening a circle of <i>blas&eacute;</i> officers with his boisterous  gaiety; sometimes, as if in contrast to this, to the dark west rooms in which  the invalid counted the long hours; sometimes to that dim future in whose  shadowy years death was to claim our weary host, and Laurence and I were to be  master and mistress at Fernwood. I had often tried to picture the place as it  would be when it fell into Laurence&rsquo;s hands, and architects and  landscape-gardeners came to work their wondrous transformations; but, do what I  would, I could never imagine it otherwise than as it was, &mdash; with straggling ivy  hanging forlornly about the moss-stained walls, and solitary pools of stagnant  water hiding amongst the tangled brushwood.</p>
<p>Laurence and I were to be married in the following  spring. He would come of age in February, and I should be twenty in March, &mdash;  only a year and a month between our ages, and both a great deal too young to  marry, my aunt said. After tea Lucy and I sang and played. Dreary music it  seemed to me that night. I thought my voice and the piano were both out of  tune, and I left Lucy very rudely in the middle of our favourite duet. I took  up twenty books from the crowded drawing-room table, only to throw them wearily  down again. Never had Lady Adela&rsquo;s novels seemed so stupid as when I looked  into them that night; never had my aunt&rsquo;s conversation sounded so tiresome. I  looked from my watch to the old-fashioned timepiece upon the chimney half a  dozen times, to find at last that it was scarcely ten o&rsquo;clock. Laurence had  promised to be home by eleven, and had begged Lucy and me to sit up for him.</p>
<p>Eleven struck at last, but Laurence had not kept  his promise. My aunt and Lady Adela rose to light their candles. Mr. Wendale  always retired a little after nine. I pleaded for half an hour longer, and Lucy  was too kind not to comply readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabel is right,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Laurence is a spoilt  boy, you know, mamma, and will feel himself very much ill-used if he finds no  one up to hear his description of the mess-dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only half an hour, then, mind, young ladies,&rdquo; said  my aunt. &ldquo;I cannot allow you to spoil your complexions on account of dissipated  people who drive ten miles to a military dinner. One half hour; not a moment  more, or I shall come down again to scold you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We promised obedience, and my aunt left us. Lucy  and I seated ourselves on each side of the low fire, which had burned dull and  hollow. I was too much dispirited to talk, and I sat listening to the ticking  of the clock, and the occasional falling of a cinder in the bright steel  fender. Then that thought came to me which comes to all watchers: What if  anything had happened to Laurence? I went to one of the windows, and pulled  back the heavy shutters. It was a lovely night; clear, though not moonlight,  and myriads of stars gleamed in the cloudless sky. I stood at the window for  some time, listening for the wheels and watching for the lamps of the phaeton.</p>
<p>I too was a spoilt child; life had for me been  bright and smooth, and the least thought of grief or danger to those I loved  filled me with a wild panic. I turned suddenly round to Lucy, and cried out,  &ldquo;Lucy, Lucy, I am getting frightened! Suppose anything should have happened to  Laurence; those horses are wild and unmanageable sometimes. If he had taken a  few glasses of wine &mdash; if he trusted the groom to drive &mdash; if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came over to me, and took me in her arms as if  I had been indeed a little child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my darling Isabel, you  must not distress yourself by such fancies as these. He is only half an hour  later than he said; and as for danger, dearest, he is beneath the shelter of  Providence, without whose safeguard those we love are never secure even for a  moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her quiet manner calmed my agitation. I left the  window, and returned shivering to the expiring fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nearly three-quarters of an hour now, Bella  dear,&rdquo; she said presently; &ldquo;we must keep our promise; and as for Laurence, you  will hear the phaeton drive in before you go to sleep, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not go to sleep until I do hear it,&rdquo; I  answered, as I took my candle and bade her good-night.</p>
<p>I could not help listening for the welcome sound of  the carriage-wheels as I crossed the hall and went upstairs. I stopped in the  corridor to look into my aunt&rsquo;s room; but she was fast asleep, and I closed the  door as softly as I had opened it. It was as I left this room that, glancing  down the corridor, I was surprised to see that there was a light in my own  bed-chamber. I was prepared to find a fire there, but the light shining through  the half-open door was something brighter than the red glow of a fire. I had  joined Laurence in laughing at the ghost-story; but my first thought on seeing  this light was of the shadow of the wretched Lady Sibyl. What if I found her  crouching over my hearth!</p>
<p>I was half inclined to go back to my aunt&rsquo;s room,  awaken her, and tell her my fears; but one moment&rsquo;s reflection made me ashamed  of my cowardice. I went on, and pushed open the door of my room: there was no  pale phantom shivering over the open hearth. There was an old-fashioned silver  candlestick upon the table, and Laurence, my lover, was seated by the blazing  fire; not dressed in the evening costume he had worn for the dinner-party, but  wrapped in a loose gray woollen dressing-gown, and wearing a black-velvet  smoking cap upon his chestnut hair.</p>
<p>Without stopping to think of the strangeness of his  appearance in my room; without wondering at the fact of his having entered the  house unknown either to Lucy or myself; without one thought but joy and relief  of mind in seeing him once more, &mdash; I ran forward to him, crying out, &ldquo;Laurence,  Laurence, I am so glad you have come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He &mdash; Laurence, my lover, as I thought &mdash; the man,  the horrible shadow &mdash; rose from his chair, snatched up some papers that lay  loosely on the table by his side, crumpled them into a ball with one fierce gesture  of his strong hand, and flung them at my feet; then, with a harsh dissonant  laugh that seemed a mocking echo of the joyous music I loved so well, he  stalked out of the door opening on the gallery. I tried to scream, but my dry  lips and throat could form no sound. The oak-panelling of the room spun round,  the walls and ceiling contracted, as if they had been crushing in upon me to  destroy me. I fell heavily to the floor; but as I fell I heard the  phaeton-wheels upon the carriage-drive below, and Laurence Wendale&rsquo;s voice  calling to the servants.</p>
<p>I can remember little more that happened upon that  horrible night. I have a vague recollection of opening my eyes upon a million  dazzling lights, which slowly resolved themselves into the one candle held in  Lucy Wendale&rsquo;s hand, as she stood beside the bed upon which I was lying. My  aunt, wrapped in her dressing-gown, sat by my pillow. My face and hair were  dripping with the vinegar-and-water they had thrown over me, and I could hear  Laurence, in the corridor outside my bedroom door, asking again and again, &ldquo;Is  she better? Is she quite herself again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of all this I was only dimly conscious; a load  of iron seemed pressing upon my forehead, and icy hands seemed riveted upon the  back of my head, holding it tightly to the pillow on which it lay. I could no  more have lifted it than I could have lifted a ton weight. I could only lie  staring with stupid dull eyes at Lucy&rsquo;s pale face, silently wishing that she  and my aunt would go, and leave me to myself.</p>
<p>I suppose I was feverish and a little light-headed  all that night, acting over and over again the brief scene of my meeting with  the weird shadow of my lover. All the stories I had laughed at might be true,  then. I had seen the phantom of the man I loved, the horrible duplicate image  of that familiar figure, shaped perhaps out of impalpable air, but as terribly  distinct to the eye as if it had been a form of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Lucy was sitting by my bedside when I awoke from a  short sleep which had succeeded the long night of fever. How intensely  refreshing that brief but deep slumber was to me! How delicious the gradual  fading-out of the sense of horror and bewilderment, with all the hideous  confusions of delirium, into the blank tranquillity of dreamless sleep! When I  awoke my head was still painful, and my frame as feeble as if I had lain for a  week on a sick bed; but my brain was cleared, and I was able to think quietly  of what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you do not know what frightened  me, or why I fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dearest, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can know nothing of it, Lucy. You were not  with me when I came into this room last night. You did not see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paused, unable to finish my sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not see whom &mdash; or what, dear Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shadow of your brother Laurence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My whole frame trembled with the recollection of my  terror of the night before, as I said this; yet I was able to observe Lucy&rsquo;s  face, and I saw that its natural hue had faded to an ashen pallor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shadow, Isabel!&rdquo; she faltered; not as if in  any surprise at my words, but rather as if she merely spoke because she felt  obliged to make some reply to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lucy,&rdquo; I said, raising myself upon the  pillow, and grasping her wrist, &ldquo;the shadow of your brother Laurence. The  living, breathing, moving image of your brother, with every lineament and every  shade of colouring reflected in the phantom face as they would be reflected in  a mirror. Not shadowy, transparent, or vanishing, but as distinct as you are to  me at this very moment. Good heavens! Lucy, I give you my solemn word that I  heard the phantom footsteps along that gallery as distinctly as I have ever  heard the steps of Laurence himself; the firm heavy tread of a strong man.&rdquo;  Lucy Wendale sat for some time perfectly silent, looking straight before her, &mdash;  not at me, but out at the half-open window, round which the ivy-leaves were  fluttering, to the dim moorland melting into purple distance above the  tree-tops in the park. Her profile was turned towards me; but I could see by  her firmly-compressed lips and fixed eyes that she was thinking deeply.</p>
<p>Presently she said, slowly and deliberately,  without once looking at me as she spoke, &ldquo;You must be fully aware, my dearest  Isabel, that these delusions are of common occurrence with people of an  extremely sensitive temperament. You may be one of these delicately-organised  persons; you had thrown yourself last night into a very nervous and hysterical  state in your morbid anxiety about Laurence. With your whole mind full of his  image, and tormented by all kinds of shadowy terrors about danger to him, what  more likely than that you should conjure up an object such as that which you  fancy you saw last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>But so palpable, Lucy, so  distinct!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be as easy for the brain to shape a  distinct as an indistinct form. Grant the possibility of optical delusion, a  fact established by a host of witnesses, &mdash; and you cannot limit the character  of the delusion. But I must get our doctor, Mr. Arden, to talk to you about  this. He is something of a metaphysician as well as a medical man, and will be  able to cure your mental ills and regulate this feverish pulse of yours at the  same time. Laurence has ridden over to York  to fetch him, and I daresay they will both be here directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy, remember you must never tell Laurence the  cause of my last night&rsquo;s fainting-fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never shall, dear. I was about to make the very  same request to you. It is much better that he should not know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better; for O, Lucy, do you remember that in  all ghost-stories the appearance of the shadow, or double, of a living person  is a presage of death to that person? The thought of this brings back all my  terror. My Laurence, my darling, if anything should happen to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Bella, Mr. Arden must talk to you. In the  mean time, here comes Mrs. Porson with your breakfast. While you are taking it,  I will go to the library, and look for Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i>Demonology.</i> You will find several instances in that book of the  optical delusions I have spoken of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper came bustling into the room with a  breakfast-tray, which she placed on a table by the bed. When she had arranged  everything for my comfort, and propped me up with a luxurious pile of pillows,  she turned round to speak to Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Miss Lucy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;poor Beck is so awfully  cut up. If you&rsquo;d only just see him, and tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy silenced her with one look; a brief but  all-expressive glance of warning and reproval. I could not help wondering what  possible reason there could be for making a mystery of some little trouble of  James Beck&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mr. Arden, the York surgeon, was the most delightful of men.  He came with Lucy into my room, and laughed and chatted me out of my low  spirits before he had been with me a quarter of an hour. He talked so much of  hysteria, optical delusions, false impressions of outward objects, abnormal  conditions of the organ of sight, and other semi-mental, semiphysical  infirmities, that he fairly bewildered me into agreeing with and believing all  he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you are a most accomplished horsewoman,&rdquo;  Miss Morley,&rdquo; he said, as he rose to leave us; &ldquo;and as the day promises to be  fine I most strongly recommend a canter across the moors, with Mr. Wendale as  your cavalier. Go to sleep between this and luncheon; rise in time to eat a  mutton-chop and drink a glass of bitter ale; ride for two hours in the sunniest  part of the afternoon; take a light dinner, and go to bed early; and I will  answer for your seeing no more of the ghost. You have no idea how much  indigestion has to do with these things. I daresay if I were to see your bill  of fare for yesterday I should discover that Lady Adela&rsquo;s cook is responsible  for the phantom, and that he made his first appearance among the <i>entr&eacute;es. </i>Who can wonder that the Germans  are a ghost-seeing people, when it is remembered that they eat raspberry-jam  with roast veal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed the doctor&rsquo;s advice to the letter; and  at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Laurence and I were galloping across the  moorland, tinged with a yellow hazy light in the September sunshine. Like most  impressionable people, I soon recovered from my nervous shock; and by the time  I sprang from the saddle before the wide stone portico at Fernwood I had almost  forgotten my terrors of the previous night.</p>
<p>A fortnight after this my aunt and I left Yorkshire  for Brighton, whither Laurence speedily  followed us. Before leaving I did all in my power to induce Lucy to accompany  us, but in vain. She thanked my aunt for her cordial invitation, but declared  that she could not leave Fernwood. We departed, therefore, without having won her,  as I had hoped to have done, from the monotony of her solitary life; and  without having seen Mr. Wendale&rsquo;s invalid dependent, the mysterious occupant  of the west wing.</p>
<p>Early in November Laurence was summoned from Brighton by the arrival of a black-bordered letter,  written by Lucy, and telling him of his father&rsquo;s death. Mr. Wendale had been  found by his servant, seated in an easy-chair in his study, with his head lying  back upon the cushions, and an open book on the carpet at his feet, dead. He  had long suffered from disease of the heart.</p>
<p>My lover wrote me long letters from Yorkshire, telling me how his mother and sister bore the  blow which had fallen upon them so suddenly. It was a quiet and subdued sorrow  rather than any tempestuous grief, which reigned in the narrow circle at  Fernwood. Mr. Wendale had been an invalid for many years, giving very little of  his society to his wife and daughter. His death, therefore, though sudden, had  not been unexpected, nor did his loss leave any great blank in that quiet home.  Laurence spent Christmas at Fernwood, but returned to us for the new year; and  it was then settled that we should go down to Yorkshire  early in February, in order to superintend the restoration and alteration of  the old place.</p>
<p>All was arranged for our journey, when, on the very  day on which we were to start, Laurence came to Onslow-square with a letter  from his mother, which he had only just received. Lady Adela wrote a few  hurried lines to beg us to delay our visit for some days, as they had decided  on removing Mr. William, before the alterations were commenced, to a cottage  which was being prepared for him near York.  His patron&rsquo;s death did not leave the invalid dependent on the bounty of  Laurence or Lady Adela. Mr. Wendale had bequeathed a small estate, worth three  hundred a-year, in trust for the sole use and benefit of this Mr. William  Wendale.</p>
<p>Neither Laurence nor I understood why the money  should have been left in trust rather than unconditionally to the man himself.  But neither he nor I felt deeply interested in the subject; and Laurence was  far too careless of business matters to pry into the details of his succession.  He knew himself to be the owner of Fernwood and of a handsome income, and that  was all he cared to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not hear of this visit being delayed an  hour,&rdquo; Laurence said impatiently, as he thrust Lady Adela&rsquo;s crumpled letter  into his pocket. &ldquo;My poor foolish mother and sister are really too absurd about  this first or fifth cousin of ours, William Wendale. Let him leave Fernwood,  or let him stay at Fernwood, just as he or his nurse or his medical man may  please; but I certainly shall not allow his arrangements to interfere with  ours. So, ladies, I shall be perfectly ready to escort you by the  eleven-o&rsquo;clock express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trevor remonstrated, declaring that she would  rather delay our visit according to Lady Adela&rsquo;s wish; but my impetuous  Laurence would not hear a word, and under a black and moonless February sky we  drove up the avenue at Fernwood.</p>
<p>We met Mr. Arden in the hall as we entered. There  seemed something ominous in receiving our first greeting from the family  doctor; and Laurence was for a moment alarmed by his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother &mdash; Lucy!&rdquo; he said anxiously; &ldquo;they are  well, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly well. I have not been attending them; I  have just come from Mr. William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear he is rather worse than usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our welcome was scarcely a cordial one, for both  Lucy and Lady Adela were evidently embarrassed by our unexpected arrival. Their  black dresses half-covered with crape, the mourning liveries of the servants,  the vacant seat of the master, the dismal winter weather, and ceaseless beating  of the rain upon the window-panes, gave a more than usually dreary aspect to  the place, and seemed to chill us to the very soul.</p>
<p>Those who at any period of their lives have  suffered some terrible and crushing affliction, some never-to-be-forgotten  trouble, for which even the hand of Time has no lessening influence, which  increases rather than diminishes as the slow course of a hopeless life carries  us farther from it, so that as we look back we do not ask ourselves why the  trial seemed so bitter, but wonder rather how we endured even as we did, &mdash;  those only who have sunk under such a grief as this can know how difficult it is  to dissociate the period preceding the anguish from the hour in which it came.  I say this lest I should be influenced by after-feelings when I describe the  dismal shadows that seemed to brood over the hearth round which Lady Adela, my  aunt, Laurence, and myself gathered upon the night of our return to Fernwood.</p>
<p>Lucy had left us; and when her brother inquired  about her, Lady Adela said she was with Mr. William.</p>
<p>As usual, Laurence chafed at the answer. It was  hard, he said, that his sister should have to act as sick-nurse to this man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Beck has gone to York to prepare for William,&rdquo; answered Lady  Adela, &ldquo;and the poor boy has no one with him but his nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor boy! I wondered why it was that Lady Adela  and her stepdaughter always alluded to Mr. William as a young man.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Laurence insisted upon our  accompanying him on a circuit of the house, to discuss the intended  alterations. I have already described the gallery, running the whole length of  the building, at one end of which was situated the suite of rooms occupied by  Mr. William, and at the other extremity those devoted to Aunt Trevor and  myself. Lady Adela&rsquo;s apartments were nearest to those of the invalid, Lucy&rsquo;s  next, then the billiard-room, and opening out of that the bed-and dressing-room  occupied by Laurence. On the other side of the gallery were servants&rsquo; and  visitors&rsquo; rooms, and a pretty boudoir sacred to Lady Adela.</p>
<p>Laurence was in very high spirits, planning  alterations here and renovations there &mdash; bay-windows to be thrown out in one  direction, and folding-doors knocked through in another &mdash; till we laughed  heartily at him on finding that the pencil-memorandum he was preparing for the  architect resolved itself into an order for knocking down the old house and  building a new one. We had explored every nook and corner in the place, with  the one exception of those mysterious apartments in the left wing. Laurence  Wendale paused before the green-baize door, but after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation  tapped for admittance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen Mr. William, and it is rather  awkward to have to ask to look at his rooms while he is in them; but the  necessity of the case will be my excuse for intruding on him. The architect  will be here to-morrow, and I want to have all my plans ready to submit to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baize-door was opened by Lucy Wendale; she  started at seeing us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Laurence?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see Mr. William&rsquo;s rooms. I shall not disturb  him, if he will kindly allow me to glance round the apartments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see that there was an inner half-glass door  behind that at which Lucy was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot possibly see the rooms to-day,  Laurence,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;Mr. William leaves early to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came out into the gallery, closing the  baize-door behind her; but as the shutting of the door reverberated through the  gallery, I heard another sound that turned my blood to ice, and made me cling  convulsively to Laurence&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>The laugh, the same dissonant laugh that I had  heard from the spectral lips of my lover&rsquo;s shadow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The laugh, the laugh I heard the night that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence had thrown his arm round me, alarmed by my  terror. His sister was standing a little way behind him; she put her finger to  her lips, looking at me significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken, Isabel,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>There was some mystery, then, connected with this  Mr. William &mdash; a mystery which for some especial reason was to be concealed from  Laurence.</p>
<p>Half an hour after this, Lucy Wendale came to me as  I was searching for a book in the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I wish to say a few words to  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to be my sister, and I have perhaps done  wrong in concealing from you the one unhappy secret which has clouded the lives  of my poor father, my stepmother, and myself. But long ago, when Laurence was a  child, it was deemed expedient that the grief which was so heavy a load for us  should, if possible, be spared to him. My father was so passionately devoted to  his handsome light-hearted boy that he shrank day by day from the thought of  revealing to him the afflicting secret which was such a source of grief to  himself. We found that, by constant care and watchfulness, it was possible to  conceal all from Laurence, and up to this hour we have done so. But it is  perhaps better that you should know all; for you will be able to aid us in  keeping the knowledge from Lawrence;  or, if absolutely necessary, you may by and by break it to him gently, and  reconcile him to an irremediable affliction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this secret &mdash; this affliction &mdash; it concerns  your invalid relation, Mr. William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does, Isabel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that the words which were to reveal all were  trembling upon her lips, &mdash; that in one brief moment she would have spoken, and  I should have known all. I should have known &mdash; in time; but before she could  utter a syllable the door was opened by one of the women-servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O miss, if you please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mrs. Peters  says would you step upstairs this minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Peters was the nurse who attended on Mr. William.  Lucy pressed my hand. &ldquo;To-morrow, dearest, to-morrow I will tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried from the room, and I sank into a chair  by the fire, with my book lying open in my lap, unable to read a line, unable  to think, except upon one subject &mdash; the secret which I was so soon to learn. If  she had but spoken then! A few words more, and what unutterable misery might  have been averted!</p>
<p>I was aroused from my reverie by Laurence, who came  to challenge me to a game at billiards. On my pleading fatigue as an excuse for  refusing, he seated himself on a stool at my feet, offering to read aloud to  me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall it be, Bella?<i> &mdash; Paradise Lost</i>, De Quincey&rsquo;s Essays, Byron, Shelley, Tennyson&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tennyson by all means! The dreary rain-blotted sky  outside those windows, and the bleak moorland in the distance, are perfectly  Tennysonian. Read <i>Locksley Hall.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>His deep melodious voice rolled out the swelling  verses; but I heard the sound without its meaning. I could only think of the  mystery which had been kept so long a secret from my lover. When he had  finished the poem he threw aside his book, and sat looking earnestly at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My solemn Bella,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what on earth are you  thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The broad glare of the blaze from an enormous  sea-coal fire was full upon his handsome face. I tried to rouse myself, and,  laying my hands upon his forehead, pushed back his curling chestnut hair. As I  did so I for the first time perceived a cicatrice across his left temple &mdash; a  deep gash, as if from the cut of a knife, but a wound of remote date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Laurence,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you tell me you were  never thrown, and yet you have a scar here that looks like the evidence of some  desperate fall. Did you get it in hunting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my inquisitive Bella! No horse is to blame for  that personal embellishment. I believe it was done when I was a child of two or  three years old; but I have no positive recollection of the event, though I  have a vague remembrance of wearing a sticking-plaster bandage across my  forehead, and being unconscionably petted by Lucy and my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it looks like a scar from a cut &mdash; from the cut  of a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have fallen upon some sharp instrument, &mdash;  the edge of one of the stone steps, perhaps, or a metal scraper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor Laurence, the blow might have killed you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Bella,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how difficult it is  to dissociate the vague recollections of the actual events of our childhood  from childish dreams that are scarcely more vague? Sometimes I have a strange  fancy that I can remember getting this cut, and that it was caused by a knife  thrown at me by another child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another child! what child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy of my own age and size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he your playfellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell; I can remember nothing but the  circumstance of his throwing the knife at me, and the sensation of the hot  blood streaming into my eyes and blinding me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you remember where it occurred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the gallery upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We lunched at two. After luncheon Laurence went to  his own room to write some letters; Lady Adela and my aunt read and worked in  the drawing-room, while I sat at the piano, rambling through some sonatas of  Beethoven.</p>
<p>We were occupied in this manner when Lucy came into  the room, dressed for walking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have ordered the carriage, mamma,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I  am going over to York  to see that Beck has everything prepared. I shall be back to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Adela seemed to grow more helpless every day,  &mdash; every day to rely more and more on her stepdaughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure to do all for the best, Lucy,&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;Take plenty of wraps, for it is bitterly cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go with you, Lucy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! O, on no account, dear Isabel. What would  Laurence say to me if I carried you off for a whole afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried from the room, and in two minutes the  lumbering close carriage drove away from the portico. My motive in asking to  accompany her was a selfish one: I thought it possible she might resume the  morning&rsquo;s interrupted conversation during our drive.</p>
<p>If I had but gone with her!</p>
<p>It is so difficult to reconcile oneself to the  irrevocable decrees of Providence;  it is so difficult to bow the head in meek submission to the awful fiat; so  difficult not to look back to the careless hours which preceded the falling of  the blow, and calculate how it might have been averted.</p>
<p>The February twilight was closing in. My aunt and  Lady Adela had fallen asleep by the fire. I stole softly out of the room to  fetch a book which I had left upstairs. There was more light in the hall and on  the staircase than in the drawing-room; but the long gallery was growing dark,  the dusky shadows gathering about the faded portraits of my lover&rsquo;s ancestry. I  stopped at the top of the staircase, and looked for a moment towards the  billiard-room. The door was open, and I could see a light streaming from  Laurence&rsquo;s little study. I went to my own room, contrived to find the book I  wanted, and returned to the gallery. As I left my room I saw that the  green-baize door at the extreme end of the gallery was wide open.</p>
<p>An irresistible curiosity attracted me towards  those mysterious apartments. As I drew nearer to the staircase I could plainly  perceive the figure of a man standing at the half-glass door within. The light  of a fire shining in the room behind him threw the outline of his head and  figure into sharp relief. There was no possibility of mistaking that well-known  form &mdash; the broad shoulders, the massive head, and clusters of curling hair. It  was Laurence Wendale looking through the glass door of the invalid&rsquo;s  apartments. He had penetrated those forbidden chambers, then. I thought  immediately of the mystery connected with the invalid, and of Lucy&rsquo;s anxiety  that it should be kept from her brother, and I hurried forward towards the  baize-door. As I advanced, he saw me, and rattled impatiently at the lock of  the inner door. It was locked, but the key was on the outside. He did not  speak, but rattled the lock incessantly, signifying by a gesture of his head  that I was to open the door. I turned the key, the door opened outwards, and I  was nearly knocked down by the force with which he flung it back and dashed  past me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laurence!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Laurence! what have you been  doing here, and who locked you in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer me, but strode along the gallery,  looking at each of the doors till he came to the only open one, that of the billiard-room,  which he entered.</p>
<p>I was wounded by his rude manner; but I scarcely  thought of that, for I was on the threshold of the apartments occupied by the  mysterious invalid, and I could not resist one hurried peep into the room  behind the half-glass door.</p>
<p>It was a roomy apartment, very plainly furnished: a  large fire burned in the grate, which was closely guarded by a very high brass  fender, the highest I had ever seen. There was an easy-chair close to this  fender, and on the floor beside it a heap of old childish books, with glaring  coloured prints, some of them torn to shreds. On the mantelpiece there was a  painted wooden figure, held together by strings, such as children play with;  Exactly opposite to where I stood there was another door, which was half open,  and through which I saw a bedroom, furnished with two iron bedsteads, placed  side by side. There were no hangings either to these bedsteads or to the  windows in the sitting-room, and the latter were protected by iron bars. A  horrible fear came over me. Mr. William was perhaps a madman. The seclusion,  the locked doors, the guarded fireplace and windows, the dreary curtainless  beds, the watchfulness of Lucy, James Beck, and the nurse, &mdash; all pointed to  this conclusion.</p>
<p>Tenantless as the rooms looked, the maniac might be  lurking in the shadow. I turned to hurry back to the gallery, and found myself  face to face with Mrs. Peters, the nurse, with a small tea-tray in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word, miss,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how you did startle me,  to be sure! What are you doing here? and why have you unlocked this door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To let out Mr. Laurence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Laurence I&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a terrified  voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he was inside this door. Someone had locked  him in, I suppose; and he told me to open it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O miss, what have you done! what have you done!  Today, above all things, when we&rsquo;ve had such an awful time with him! What have  you done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What had I done? I thought the woman must herself  be half distraught, so unaccountable was the agitation of her manner. O  merciful Heaven, the laugh! the harsh, mocking, exulting, idiotic laugh! This  time it rang in loud and discordant peals to the very rafters of the old house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, for pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I cried, clinging to the  nurse, &ldquo;what is it, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw me off, and rushing to the balustrades at  the head of the staircase, called loudly, &ldquo;Andrew, Henry, bring lights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came, the two men-servants, &mdash; old men, who had  served in that house for thirty or forty years, &mdash; they came with candles, and  followed the nurse to the billiard-room.</p>
<p>The door of communication between that and Laurence  Wendale&rsquo;s study was wide open, and on the threshold, with the light shining  upon him from within the room, stood the double of my lover; the living,  breathing image of my Laurence, the creature I had seen at the half-glass door,  and had mistaken for Laurence himself. His face was distorted by a ghastly  grin, and he was uttering some strange unintelligible sounds as we approached  him, &mdash; guttural and unearthly murmurs horrible to hear. Even in that moment of  bewilderment and terror I could see that the cambric about his right wrist was  splashed with blood.</p>
<p>The nurse looked at him severely; he slunk away  like a frightened child, and crept into a corner of the billiard-room, where he  stood grinning and mouthing at the blood-stains upon his wrist.</p>
<p>We rushed into the little study. O horror of  horrors! the writing-table was overturned; ink, papers, pens, all scattered and  trampled on the floor; and in the midst of the confusion lay Laurence Wendale,  the blood slowly ebbing away, with a dull gurgling sound, from a hideous gash  in his throat.</p>
<p>A penknife, which belonged to Laurence&rsquo;s open desk,  lay amongst the trampled papers, crimsoned to the hilt.</p>
<p>Laurence Wendale had been murdered by his idiot  twin-brother.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>There was an inquest. I can recall at any hour, or  at any moment, the whole agony of the scene. The dreary room, adjoining that in  which the body lay; the dull February sky; the monotonous voice of the coroner  and the medical men; and myself, or some wretched, shuddering, white-lipped  creature that I could scarcely believe to be myself, giving evidence. Lady  Adela was reproved for having kept her idiot son at Fernwood without the  knowledge of the murdered man; but every effort was made to hush-up the terrible  story. William Wendale was tried at York,  and transferred to the county lunatic asylum, there to be detained during her  Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure. His unhappy brother was quietly buried in the Wendale  vault, the chief mausoleum in a damp moss-grown church close to the gates of  Fernwood.</p>
<p>It is upwards of ten years since all this happened;  but the horror of that February twilight is as fresh in my mind to-day as it  was when I lay stricken &mdash; not senseless, but stupefied with anguish &mdash; on a sofa  in the drawing-room at Fernwood, listening to the wailing of the wretched  mother and sister.</p>
<p>The misery of that time changed me at once from a  young woman to an old one; not by any sudden blanching of my dark hair, but by  the blotting-out of every girlish feeling and of every womanly hope. This  change in my own nature has drawn Lucy Wendale and me together with a link far  stronger than any common sisterhood. Lady Adela died two years after the murder  of her son. The Fernwood property has passed into the hands of the heir-at-law.</p>
<p>Lucy lives with me at the Isle   of Wight. She is my protectress, my elder sister, without whom I  should be lost; for I am but a poor helpless creature.</p>
<p>It was months after the quiet funeral in Fernwood  church before Lucy spoke to me of the wretched being who had been the author of  so much misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idiotcy of my unhappy brother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was  caused by a fall from his nurse&rsquo;s arms, which resulted in a fatal injury to the  brain. The two children were infants at the time of the accident, and so much  alike that we could only distinguish Laurence from William by the different  colour of the ribbons with which the nurse tied the sleeves of the children&rsquo;s  white frocks. My poor father suffered bitterly from his son&rsquo;s affliction;  sometimes cherishing hope even in the face of the verdict which medical science  pronounced upon the poor child&rsquo;s case, sometimes succumbing to utter despair.  It was the intense misery which he himself endured that made him resolve on the  course which ultimately led to so fatal a catastrophe. He determined on  concealing William&rsquo;s affliction from his twin-brother. At a very early age the  idiot child was removed to the apartments in which he lived until the day of  his brother&rsquo;s murder. James Beck and the nurse, both experienced in the treatment  of mental affliction, were engaged to attend him; and indeed the strictest  precaution seemed necessary, as, on the only occasion of the two children  meeting, William evinced a determined animosity to his brother, and inflicted a  blow with a knife the traces of which Laurence carried to his grave. The  doctors attributed this violent hatred to some morbid feeling respecting the  likeness between the two boys. William flew at his brother as some wild animal  springs upon its reflection in a glass. With me, in his most violent fit, he  was comparatively tractable; but the strictest surveillance was always  necessary; and the fatal deed which the wretched, but irresponsible creature at  last committed might never have been done but for the imprudent absence of  James Beck and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><a name="SamuelLowgoodsRevenge"></a>Samuel Lowgood&rsquo;s Revenge</h1>
<p>From the first to the last we were rivals and  enemies. Perhaps it was on my part that the hatred, which eventually became so  terrible a passion between us, first arose. Perhaps it was, perhaps it was! At any  rate, he always said that it was so. I am an old man, and many memories of the  past have lost their vivid colouring; but that portion of my life which relates  to him is as fresh in my mind to-night as ever it was fifty years ago, when his  gracious Majesty George the Second was king, and Christopher Weldon and I were  junior clerks together in the great house of Tyndale and Tyndale, shipowners,  Dockside, Willborough.</p>
<p>He was very handsome. It was hard for a pale-faced,  sallow-complexioned, hollow-eyed, insignificant lad as I was to sit at the same  desk with Christopher Weldon, and guess the comparisons that every stranger  entering the counting-house must involuntarily make as he looked at us &mdash; if he  looked at us, that is to say; and it was difficult not to look at Christopher.  Good heavens! I can see him now, seated at the worn, old, battered, ink-stained  desk, with the July sunlight streaming down through the dingy office-windows  upon his pale golden curls; his bright blue eyes looking out through the smoky  panes at the forests of masts, dangling ropes, and grimy sails in the dock  outside; one girlish white hand carelessly thrown upon the desk before him, and  the delicate fingers of the other twisted in his flowing curls. He was scarcely  one-and-twenty, the spoiled pet of a widowed mother, the orphan son of a naval  officer, and the idol of half the women in the seaport of Willborough. It was  not so much to be wondered at, then, that he was a fop and a maccaroni, and  that the pale golden curls which he brushed off his white forehead were tied on  his coat-collar with a fine purple ribbon on Sundays and holidays. His cravat  and ruffles were always of delicate lace, worked by his loving mother&rsquo;s hands;  his coats were made by a London  tailor, who had once worked for Mr. George Selwyn and Lord March, and he wore  small diamond shoe-buckles and a slender court-sword sometimes out of  office-hours.</p>
<p>I, too, was an orphan; but I was doubly an orphan.  My father and mother had both died in my infancy. I had been reared in a workhouse,  had picked up chance waifs and strays of education from the hardest masters,  and had been drafted, at the age of ten, into the offices of Tyndale and  Tyndale. Errand boy, light porter, office drudge, junior clerk &mdash; one by one I  had mounted the rounds in this troublesome ladder, which for me could only be  begun from the very bottom; and at the age of twenty-one I found myself &mdash;  where? In a business character, I was on a level with Christopher Weldon, the  son of a gentleman. How often I, the pauper orphan of a bankrupt corn chandler,  had to hear this phrase, &mdash; the son of a gentleman! In a business character, I  say, I, Samuel Lowgood, who had worked and slaved and drudged, and been  snubbed, throughout eleven long weary years &mdash; and in spite of all had become a  clever accountant and a thorough arithmetician &mdash; was in the same rank as  Christopher Weldon, who had been in the office exactly four weeks, just to see,  as his mother said, whether it would suit him.</p>
<p>He was about as much good in the counting-house as  a wax doll would have been, and, like a wax doll, he looked very pretty; but  Messrs. Tyndale and Tyndale had known his father; and Tyndale senior knew his  uncle, and Tyndale junior was acquainted with his first cousin, who lived at  the court-end of London; so he was taken at once into the office as junior  clerk, with every chance, as one of the seniors told me confidentially, of  rising much higher, if he took care of himself.</p>
<p>He knew about as much arithmetic as a baby; but he  was very clever with his pen in sketching pretty girls with powdered heads,  flowing sacques, and pannier hoops; so he found plenty of amusement in doing  this and reading Mr. Henry Fielding&rsquo;s novels behind the ledger; and the head  clerks left him to himself, and snubbed me for not doing his work as well as my  own.</p>
<p>I hated him. I hated his foppish ways and his  haughty manners; I hated his handsome boyish face, with its frame of golden  hair, and its blue, beaming, hopeful eyes; I hated him for the sword which  swung across the stiff skirts of his brocaded coat, for the money which he  jingled in his waistcoat-pockets, for the two watches which he wore on high  days and holidays, for his merry laugh, for his melodious voice, for his  graceful walk, for his tall, slender figure, for his jovial, winning ways,  which won everybody else&rsquo;s friendship, &mdash; I hated him for all these; but, most  of all, I hated him for his influence over Lucy Malden.</p>
<p>Lucy was a humble dependent upon the bounty of the  house of Tyndale and Tyndale, and she had the care of the town residence  belonging to the firm, a roomy old house which communicated with the offices.</p>
<p>People knew very little about her, except that she  was the daughter of a superannuated old clerk, who had gone stone blind over  the ledgers of Tyndale and Tyndale, and that she lived with her father in this  dreary, old, deserted town house. Once or twice in the year the brothers would  take it into their heads to give a dinner-party in this disused dwelling; and  then the great oak furniture was polished, and clusters of wax-candles were  lighted in the twisted silver sconces, and the dim pictures of the Tyndales  dead and gone, shipowners and merchants in the days of William and Mary, were  uncovered: but at other times Lucy Malden and her blind old father had the great  place, with its long dark corridors and its lofty chambers, into which the  light rarely penetrated, all to themselves. The house joined the offices, and  the offices and the house formed three sides of a square, the dock-side forming  the fourth. The counting-house in which Christopher Weldon and I sat was  exactly opposite the house.</p>
<p>I watched him upon the morning when he first saw  her &mdash; watched him without his being aware of it. It was a blazing July day; and  when she had arranged her father&rsquo;s room and her own, and the little  sitting-room which they shared together, which formed part of a range of  apartments on the second story, she came to her window, and, opening it to its  widest extent, sat down to her needlework. She eked out the slender income  which the firm allowed her father by the sale of her needlework, which was very  beautiful. A screen of flowers in great stone jars shaded the window, and  behind these she placed herself.</p>
<p>He saw her in a moment, and his pen fell from his  listless hand.</p>
<p>She was not beautiful; I know that she was not  beautiful. I think that many would have scarcely called her even a pretty girl;  but to me, from the first to the last, she was the fairest, the dearest, and  the loveliest of women, and it is so difficult to me to dispossess myself of  her image, as that image shone upon me, that I doubt if I can describe her as  she really was.</p>
<p>She was very pale. The dreary, joyless life she led  in that dark old house, in the heart of a dingy seaport town, had perhaps  blanched the roses in her cheeks, and dimmed the sunlight in her thoughtful  brown eyes. She had very light hair &mdash; hair of the palest flaxen, perfectly  straight and smooth, which she wore turned back over a roll, and fastened in  one thick mass at the back of her head. Her eyes, in utter contrast to this  light hair, were of the darkest brown, &mdash; so dark and deep, that the stranger  always thought them black. Her features were small and delicate, her lips thin,  her figure slender, and below the average height. Her dress, a dimity petticoat,  with a gray stuff gown, and a white apron.</p>
<p>Christopher&rsquo;s pen fell out of his hand, and he  looked up at her window, and began to hum the air of a favourite song in the  new opera about thieves and ragamuffins, which had got Mr. Gay, the poet, and a  beautiful duchess, into such disgrace up in London.</p>
<p>He was such a conceited beau and lady-killer, that  he could not rest till she had looked at the office-window by which he sat.</p>
<p>The song attracted her, and she lifted her eyes  from her work, and looked down at him.</p>
<p>She started, and blushed &mdash; blushed a beautiful,  rosy red, that lighted up her pale face like the reflection of a fire; and  then, seeing me at my desk, nodded and smiled to me. She and I had been friends  for years, and I only waited till I should rise one step higher in the office  to tell her how much I loved her.</p>
<p>From that day, on some excuse or other, Christopher  Weldon was always dangling about the house. He scraped acquaintance with her  blind old father. He was a pretty musician, and he would put his flute in his  pocket, after office-hours, and stroll over to the house, and sit there in the  twilight playing to the father and daughter for the hour together, while I hid  myself in the shadow of the counting-house doorway, and stood watching them. O,  how I hated him, as I saw across the screen of plants the two fair heads side  by side, and the blind old father nodding and smiling, and applauding the  music! How I hated that melodious opera of Mr. Gay&rsquo;s! How I hated Christopher  Weldon, as he and Lucy stood on the step of the hall-door, between the tall  iron extinguishers under the disused oil-lamp, wishing each other good-night! I  thought that I could see the little white hand tremble when it fluttered a  gentle farewell to him, as he strode away through the dusky evening.</p>
<p>Should I dog his steps, and when he got to a lonely  place upon the narrow quay, dart suddenly upon him, and push him into the  water? &mdash; push him in where the barges lay thickly clustered together, and where  he must sink under their keels down into the black stream? The God of sinners  knows I have asked myself this question!</p>
<p>For months I watched them. O, what bitter pain,  what silent torture, what a long fever of anguish and despair!</p>
<p>How could I do him some dire injury, which should  redress one atom of this mighty sum of wrong that he had done me? &mdash; fancied  wrong, perhaps; for if he had not won her love, I might never have won it. But  I prayed &mdash; I believe I was wicked and mad enough even to pray &mdash; for some means  of doing him as deadly an injury as I thought he had done me.</p>
<p>He looked up at me one day, in his gay, reckless  fashion, and said, suddenly pushing the ledger away from him, with a weary  sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samuel Lowgood, do you know what a tailor&rsquo;s bill  is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cursed him in my heart for his insolence in  asking me the question; but I looked down at my greasy white coat-sleeve, and  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have worn this for five years, and I bought it  second-hand of a dealer on the quay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy devil!&rdquo; he said, with a laugh; &ldquo;if you want  to see a tailor&rsquo;s bill, then look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed me over a long slip of paper, and I  looked at the sum-total.</p>
<p>It seemed to me something so prodigious, that I had  to look at it ever so many times before I could believe my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-seven pounds thirteen and fourpence-halfpenny.  I like the fourpence-halfpenny,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it looks honest. Samuel Lowgood, my  mother&rsquo;s heart would break if she saw that bill. I must pay it in a fortnight  from to-day, or it will come to her ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much have you got towards paying it?&rdquo; I asked.  My heart beat faster at the thought of his trouble, and my face flushed  crimson; but he sat with his forehead leaning on his clasped hands, and he  never looked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much have I got towards it?&rdquo; he said bitterly.  &ldquo;This.&rdquo; He turned his waistcoat-pockets inside out, one after the other. &ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; he added, in his old reckless tone, &ldquo;I may be a rich man before the  fortnight&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening he was dangling over at the house as  usual, and I heard &ldquo;Cease your funning&rdquo; on the flute, and saw the two fair  heads across the dark foliage of Lucy Malden&rsquo;s little flower-garden.</p>
<p>I was glad of his trouble &mdash; I was glad of his  trouble! It was small, indeed, compared to the sorrow and despair which I  wished him; but it <i>was</i> trouble, and  the bright, fair-haired, blue-eyed boy knew what it was to suffer.</p>
<p>The days passed, and the fortnight was nearly gone,  but my fellow-clerk said no more about the tailor&rsquo;s bill. So one day as we sat  as usual at the desk &mdash; I working hard at a difficult row of figures, he chewing  the end of his pen, and looking rather moodily across the courtyard, I asked  him, &ldquo;Well, have you got rid of your difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difficulty?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tailor&rsquo;s bill; the thirty-seven thirteen and  fourpence-halfpenny. He looked at me very much as if he would have liked to have  knocked me off my high stool; but he said presently, &ldquo;O yes; that&rsquo;s been  settled ever so long!&rdquo; and he began to whistle one of his favourite songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever so long!&rdquo; His trouble lasted a very short  time, I thought.</p>
<p>But in spite of this he was by no means himself. He  sat at his desk with his head buried in his hands; he was sharp and short in  his answers when anybody spoke to him, and we heard a great deal less of the <i>Beggars</i>&rsquo; <i>Opera</i> and &ldquo;Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, too, he grew very industrious, and  took to writing a great deal; but he contrived to sit in such a manner that I  could never find out what he was writing.</p>
<p>It was some private matter of his own, I felt sure.  What could it be?</p>
<p>Love-letters, perhaps; letters to her!</p>
<p>A fiendish curiosity took possession of me, and I  determined to fathom his secret.</p>
<p>I left the counting-house on some pretence; and  after a short absence returned so softly that he could not hear me; and  stealing behind him, lifted myself upon tiptoe, and looked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>He was writing over and over again, across and  across, upon half a sheet of letter-paper, the signature of the firm, &ldquo;Tyndale  and Tyndale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could it mean? Was it preoccupation? mere  absence of mind? idle trifling with his pen? The fop had a little pocket mirror  hanging over his desk. I looked into it, and saw his face.</p>
<p>I knew then what it meant. My hatred of him gave me  such a hideous joy in the thought of what I had discovered that I laughed  aloud. He turned round, and asked me savagely what I was doing; and as he  turned he crumpled the paper in his hand, inking his pretty white fingers with  the wet page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy, sneak, sycophant!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what are you  crawling about here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only trying to startle you, Mister Weldon,&rdquo;  I answered. &ldquo;What are you writing, that you&rsquo;re so frightened of my seeing?  love-letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business and look to your own work,  you pitiful spy,&rdquo; he roared out, &ldquo;and leave me to do mine my own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, if I were you. It seems such a nice way,&rdquo;  I answered meekly.</p>
<p>Two days after this, at half-past three o&rsquo;clock in  the afternoon, Christopher Weldon asked one of the senior clerks for a quarter  of an hour&rsquo;s leave of absence. He wanted to see a fellow round in the  High-street, he said, and he couldn&rsquo;t see him after four o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>I felt my sallow face flame up into a scarlet flush  as my fellow-clerk made this request. Could it be as I thought?</p>
<p>He had been four months in the office, and it was  the end of November. The end of November, and almost dark at halfpast three  o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>They granted his request without the slightest  hesitation. He left his desk, took his hat up, and walked slowly to the door;  at the door he stopped, turned back to his desk, and throwing his hat down,  leaned moodily upon his folded arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I care much about seeing the  fellow now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Chris.,&rdquo; cried one of the clerks, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the  matter with you, man? Are you in love or in debt, that you&rsquo;re so unlike  yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; he said, with a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, not in love, Chris.? How about the pretty  little fair-haired girl over the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about her?&rdquo; he said savagely. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a  cold-hearted little coquette, and she may go to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I slapped the ledger on which I was at work  violently on to the desk, and looked up at him.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Christopher Weldon!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Your humble servant,&rdquo; he  said mockingly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a face! Have I been poaching upon your manor, Samuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to see your friend before four o&rsquo;clock  you&rsquo;d better be off, Chris.,&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>
<p>He took his hat up once more, twirled it slowly  round for a few minutes, then put it on his head, and, without saying a word to  anyone, hurried out of the office and across the courtyard.</p>
<p>Lucy was standing at her window opposite, with her  forehead leaning against the dingy framework of the panes, and I watched her  start and tremble as she saw him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m to take these accounts into the  market-place I&rsquo;d better take them now, hadn&rsquo;t I, sir?&rdquo; I asked of the senior  clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a back way through some narrow courts and  squares which led from the dock-side to the High-street, in which the house  Tyndale and Tyndale banked with was situated. I was hurrying off this way when  I stopped, and changed my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go the back way,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut across  the market-place by the most public road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In five minutes I was in the High-street. Opposite  the bank there was a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop, at which our clerks were accustomed to  buy their pennyworths of snuff. I strolled in, and asked the girl to fill my  box. I was quite an old man in most of my ways, and snuff-taking was a  confirmed habit with me.</p>
<p>As she weighed the snuff, I stood looking through  the low window at the great doors of the bank opposite.</p>
<p>One of the doors swung back upon its hinges. An old  man, a stranger to me, came out.</p>
<p>Three minutes more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am waiting for a friend,&rdquo; I said to the girl at  the counter.</p>
<p>Two minutes more. The doors opened again. I was  right, and I was not surprised. Christopher Weldon came out of the bank, and  walked quickly down the street.</p>
<p>It was too dark for me to see his face; but I knew  the tall slim figure and the dashing walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised, I am only glad,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>During my long service in the house of Tyndale and  Tyndale, I had lived so hard as to have been able to save money from my scanty  earnings. I had scraped together, from year to year, the sum of forty-eight  pounds fifteen shillings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will save a hundred,&rdquo; I had said, &ldquo;and then I  will ask her to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the only dream of my life was broken, and my  little hoard was useless to me now.</p>
<p>Useless to purchase love, perhaps; but it might yet  bring me revenge.</p>
<p>I put every farthing I possessed into my pocket the  next morning, and the first time I could find an excuse for going out hurried  down to the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our clerks presented a cheque here  yesterday,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The man looked up with an expression of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly; there was a cheque cashed  yesterday. Your handsome, fair-haired junior brought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me look at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, upon my word, it&rsquo;s rather a strange&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Request. Perhaps. On the part of Messrs. Tyndale  and Tyndale I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you are commissioned by the firm  to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;whether I am or not. As you  think my request a strange one, I&rsquo;ll put it in another way. Will you be so good  as to look at the cheque yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly. Here it is,&rdquo; he added, selecting a  paper from a drawer; &ldquo;a cheque for forty. Payable to bearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the signature of the firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s right enough, I think. I ought to know  the signature pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the &lsquo;y&rsquo; in &lsquo;Tyndale.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scrutinised the signature more closely, and  lifted his eyebrows with a strange, perplexed expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather stiff, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Not quite  old Tyndale&rsquo;s flowing caligraphy. Very near it, you know, and a very creditable  imitation; but not quite the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a forgery!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Mr. Simmonds, have  you any sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One about the age of Christopher Weldon, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One pretty nearly his age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll help me to save this young man, won&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cancel the cheque, and replace the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good young man, who&rsquo;s to find the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew a little canvas-bag out of my pocket, and  turned out a heap of one-pound notes and spade-guineas upon the clerk&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the exact sum,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;forty pounds,  ready money, for the slip of paper Christopher Weldon presented here at ten  minutes to four yesterday evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who finds this money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Christopher Weldon and I have been  fellow-clerks for four months and upwards. I have seen his mother. I know how  much she loves her only son. I know a girl who loves him. I don&rsquo;t mind forty  pounds out of my savings to keep this matter a secret. Mr. Simmonds, for the  sake of your own sons, let me have that slip of paper, and cancel the cheque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man caught my hand in his, and shook it  heartily. &ldquo;Young Lowgood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not another lad in Willborough  capable of such a generous action. If I were not a poor old fellow, with a hard  fight of it to get a living, I&rsquo;d be twenty pounds in this transaction; but I  respect and honour you. I dare not give you back the cheque upon my own  responsibility; but the senior partner is in his office; I&rsquo;ll go and talk to  him. Perhaps, when he hears the real state of the case, he&rsquo;ll consent to hush  the matter up and do what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man left me and remained away about a  quarter of an hour, during which I sat in the quiet counting-house, with my  heart beating loud and fast. I daresay the junior clerks wondered what my  business could be as I sat waiting for their senior&rsquo;s return. He came back at  last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a good deal of trouble,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I  have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I burst out laughing as he gave me the forged  cheque in exchange for the forty pounds I counted out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh away, laugh away,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve  need to have a light heart, Samuel Lowgood, for you&rsquo;re a noble fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>In our back office there was a great chest which  had been disused for some years. The clerks let me have it for my own use, and  inside it I had a smaller iron-clamped strong-box of my own, which I had bought  of a broker on the quay. Into this strong-box I put the forged cheque.</p>
<p>Christopher Weldon&rsquo;s high spirits entirely deserted  him. It was such pleasure to me to watch him slyly as I sat beside him,  apparently occupied only by my work, that I was almost tempted to neglect my  business.</p>
<p>No more <i>Beggars&rsquo;  Opera</i>, no more <i>Polly</i>, no more  flute-playing in the dusk of the evening over at the gloomy old house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lad Weldon is leaving off his giddy ways and  growing industrious,&rdquo; said the clerks; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll get on in the world, depend upon  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him &mdash; let him &mdash; let him,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;let him  mount the ladder; and when he reaches the highest round &mdash; then &mdash; then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following March there were some changes made  in the office. Tyndale and Tyndale had a branch house of business in  Thames-street, London;  and into this house Christopher Weldon was drafted, with a salary nearly double  that which he had received in Willborougrh.</p>
<p>The change came about very suddenly. They wanted  someone of gentlemanly appearance and polished manners in the London office, and Weldon, they said, was the  very man.</p>
<p>I had not spoken to Lucy Malden for upwards of two  months; but I thought I would go and tell her this piece of news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall find out whether she really loves him,&rdquo; I  thought.</p>
<p>She sat at her old place at the window, in the cold  spring twilight, when I followed her father into the house and bade her good  evening.</p>
<p>She was not paler than usual, for she had always  been pale; nor graver, for she was always grave; but in spite of this, I saw  that she had suffered.</p>
<p>My presence had no more effect upon her than if I  had been nothing more sentient than the clumsy high-backed oak-chair upon which  I leaned as I stood talking to her.</p>
<p>She looked at me when I spoke, answered me sweetly  and gently, and then looked down again at her tedious work.</p>
<p>I knew that I had come, coward as I was, to stab  this tender innocent heart; but I could not resist the fiendish temptation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So our pretty fair-haired boy is going to leave  us,&rdquo; I said by and by.</p>
<p>She knew whom I meant, and I saw the stiff  embroidery shiver in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christopher?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Mr. Weldon,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Yes, the gentleman  clerk. He&rsquo;s going away, never to come back here, I daresay. He&rsquo;s going into the  London house to  make his fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made me no answer, nor did she ask me a single  question. She sat very quietly, going on with her work, sorting the  gay-coloured silks, straining her eyes in the dusky light over the difficult  pattern; but I saw &mdash; I saw how sharply I had struck this poor, pitiful, broken  heart, and I knew now how much she had loved him.</p>
<p>Ten years from that day, I stood in the same room &mdash;  she working at the same window &mdash; and asked her to be my wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not ask,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for the love which you  gave to another ten years ago. I do not ask for the beauty which those who  speak to me of you say is faded out of your mournful face. You will always be  to me the most beautiful of women, and your gentle tolerance will be dearer to  me than the most passionate love of another. Lucy Malden, will you many me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started up, letting her work fall out of her lap,  and turning her face towards the window, burst into a passion of tears.</p>
<p>I had never seen her cry before.</p>
<p>At last she turned to me, with her face drowned in  tears, and said, &ldquo;Samuel Lowgood, ten years ago, day after day, and night after  night, I waited for another to say the words which have just been said by you.  I had every right to expect he should say them. He never did &mdash; he never did.  Forgive me, forgive me, if it seems to break my heart afresh to hear them  spoken by another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a prosperous man in London,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Lucy Malden, will you be my  wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dried her tears, and, coming slowly to me, put  her little cold hand into mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean yes?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She only bent her head in answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you! and good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>A year and a half after our marriage, we heard  great news in the old Willborough house. Christopher Weldon had married a  nobleman&rsquo;s daughter, and was about to become a partner in the house of Tyndale  and Tyndale.</p>
<p>A night or two after we heard this news, there came  a great rattling knock at the grim dragon&rsquo;s-head knocker of the house-door. My  wife and I lived in her old apartments, by permission of the firm, and I had  advanced to be head clerk in the Willborough office.</p>
<p>I was sitting, going over some accounts that I had  not been able to finish in the day; so she looked up at the sound of the  knocking, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer the door, Samuel &mdash; you&rsquo;re tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a good and gentle wife to me, from the  first to the last.</p>
<p>Presently I started from my desk, and rushed down  the stairs. I had heard a voice that I knew in the hall below.</p>
<p>My wife was lying on the cold stone flags, and  Christopher Weldon bending over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she has fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This decides me, this decides me!&rdquo; I thought;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my forty pounds&rsquo;-worth before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christopher Weldon had come down to the house to  announce to us, its custodians, that he was about to occupy it, with his wife,  the Lady Belinda Weldon.</p>
<p>He brought a regiment of London upholsterers the next day, and set  them to work tearing the gloomy old rooms to pieces. My lady came too, in her  gilded chair, and gave orders for a chintz here and damask there, and could not  find words to express her contempt for the place and her despair of ever making  it habitable; but declared that whatever taste and upholstery could do for such  a gloomy dungeon of a place, was to be done. After her ladyship&rsquo;s departure, a  prim housekeeper came to inform my wife that we must be prepared to leave the  house in a month. In a month the place was transformed, and at the end of the  month Christopher Weldon was to give a great dinner-party, at which Messrs.  Tyndale and Tyndale were to be present, to inaugurate his partnership. As  senior clerk, I was honoured by an invitation.</p>
<p>My enemy had mounted to the highest round of the  ladder. Rich, beloved, honoured, the husband of a lovely and haughty lady,  partner in the great and wealthy house which he had entered as junior clerk &mdash;  what more could fortune bestow upon him?</p>
<p>My time had come &mdash; the time at which it was worth  my while to crush him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wait till the dinner is over, and the  toasts have been drunk, and all the fine speeches have been made; and when  Tyndale senior has proposed the health of the new partner, in a speech full of  eulogy, I will hand him the forged cheque across the dinner-table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night before the dinner-party, I was in such a  fever of excitement, that I tried in vain to sleep. I heard every hour strike  on the little clock in our bedroom. Tyndale and Tyndale had given us a couple  of empty offices on our being turned out of the great house, and enough of  their old-fashioned furniture to fit them up very comfortably.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, the shrill strokes of  the clock seemed to beat upon my brain. The hours seemed endless, and I  sometimes thought the clock in our room and all the church-clocks of  Willborough had stopped simultaneously.</p>
<p>At last, towards six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I  dropped off into a feverish troubled sleep, in which I dreamed of the forged  cheque, which I still kept locked in the strong box inside the great chest in  the back office.</p>
<p>I dreamed that it was lost, that I went to the  strong-box and found the cheque gone. The horror of the thought woke me  suddenly. The broad sunshine was streaming in at the window, and the  church-clocks were striking nine.</p>
<p>I had slept much later than usual. My wife had  risen, and was seated in our little sitting-room at her accustomed embroidery.  She was always very quiet and subdued, and sat at her work several hours every  day.</p>
<p>My first impulse, on waking, was to look under my  pillow for my watch, and a black ribbon, to which was attached the key of the  strong-box. The key of the chest hung on a nail in the office, as nothing of  any consequence was kept in that. My watch and the key were perfectly safe.</p>
<p>My mind was relieved, but I was in a fever of  excitement all day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not take the cheque out of its hiding-place  till the last moment,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;not till the moment before I put on my hat to  go to the dinner-party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife dressed me carefully in a grave  snuff-coloured suit, which I generally wore on Sundays; she plaited my ruffles,  and arranged my lawn-cravat with its lace ends. I looked an old man already,  though I was little more than thirty-three years of age; and Christopher Weldon  was handsomer than ever.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the courtyard was  all astir with sedan-chairs and powdered footmen. My wife stood in the window,  looking at the company alighting from their chairs at the great door opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go, I think, Samuel,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;the Tyndales have just arrived. Ah! there is my Lady Belinda at the window.  How handsome she is! How magnificent she is, in powder and diamonds, and an  amber-satin sacque!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a better right to wear amber satin and  diamonds than she,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Samuel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Because you&rsquo;re the wife of an honest man. She  is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought for love of him she would have fired up  and contradicted me; but she only turned her face away and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be late, Samuel,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to fetch out of the back office,  and then I shall be ready,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>The fiend himself must be in the work. It was gone  &mdash; gone, every trace of it. At first, in my blind, mad fury, I blasphemed aloud.  Afterwards, I fell on my knees over the open chest, and wept &mdash; wept bitter  tears of rage and anguish. It was gone!</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>I had a brain fever after this, which confined me  for nine weeks to my bed.</p>
<p>Christopher Weldon lived and thrived, a prosperous  and successful merchant &mdash; honoured, courted, admired, and beloved.</p>
<p>My wife and I, childless and poor, used to sit at  our windows in the dusk, and watch his children at play in the courtyard  beneath us, and hear the innocent voices echoing through the great house  opposite.</p>
<p>Thirteen years and five months after our  wedding-day, Lucy died in my arms; her last words to me were these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samuel, I have done my best to do my duty, but  life for me has never been very happy. Once only since our marriage have I  deceived you. I saved you, by that action, from doing a great wrong to a man  who had never knowingly wronged you. One night, Samuel, you talked in your  sleep, and I learned from your disjointed sentences the story of Christopher  Weldon&rsquo;s crime. I learned, too, your purpose in possessing yourself of the only  evidence of the forgery. I learned the place in which you kept that evidence;  and, while you slept, I took the key from under your pillow, and opened the  strong box. The cheque is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took it from a little black-silk bag which hung  by a ribbon round her neck, and put it into my hand,&mdash; &ldquo;Samuel, husband, we have  read the Gospel together every Sunday evening through thirteen years. Will you  use it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lucy, no &mdash; angel &mdash; darling &mdash; no. You have  saved him from disgrace &mdash; me from sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>Every clerk in the house of Tyndale and Tyndale  attended my wife&rsquo;s funeral. Not only were the clerks present; but, pale,  mournful, and handsome, in his long black cloak, Christopher Weldon stood  amidst the circle round the grave.</p>
<p>As we left the churchyard he came up to me, and  shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be better friends for the future, Samuel,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, when she died, bade me give you this,&rdquo; I  answered, as I put the forged cheque into his hand.</p>

  In A Lawyer&rsquo;s Office</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is the most provoking clause that was ever  invented to annul the advantages of a testament,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a condition which must be fulfilled, or you  lose the fortune,&rdquo; replied the gentleman.</p>
<p>Whereupon the gentleman began to drum a martial air  with the tips of his fingers upon the morocco-covered office-table; while the  lady beat time with the point of her foot.</p>
<p>The gentleman was out of temper, and the lady was  out of temper also. It is sad to have to state such a fact of the lady, for she  was very young and very handsome, and, though the angry light in her dark-gray  eyes had a certain vixenish beauty, it was a species of beauty rather alarming  to a man of a nervous temperament.</p>
<p>She was very handsome. Her hair was of the darkest brown,  her eyes gray &mdash; those large gray eyes, fringed with long black lashes, which  are more dangerous than all other eyes ever invented for the perdition of  honest men. They looked like deep pools of shining water, bordered by shadowy  rushes; they looked like stray stars  in a black midnight sky; but they were so beautiful, that like the signal-lamp  which announces the advent of an express upon the heels of a slow train, they  seemed to say, &ldquo;Danger!&rdquo; Her nose was aquiline; her mouth small, clearly cut,  and very determined in expression; her complexion brunette, and rather pale.  For the rest, she was tall, her head set with a haughty grace upon her sloping  shoulders, her hands perfect.</p>
<p>The gentleman was ten or fifteen years her senior.  He, too, was eminently handsome: but there was a languid indifference about his  manner, which communicated itself even to his face, and seemed to overshadow  the very beauty of that face.</p>
<p>That any one so gifted by nature as he seemed  gifted could be as weary of life as he appeared, was, in itself, so much a  mystery, that one learned to look at him as a man whose quiet outward bearing  concealed some gloomy secret.</p>
<p>He was dark and pale, with massive features, and  thoughtful brown eyes, which rarely looked fully at you from under the heavy  eyelids that half shrouded them. The mouth was spiritual in expression, the  lips thin; but the face was wanting in one quality, lacking which it lacked the  power which is the highest form of manly beauty; and that quality was firmness.</p>
<p>He sat drumming with his slim fingers upon the  table, and looking down, with a gloomy shade upon his forehead.</p>
<p>The scene was a lawyer&rsquo;s office in Gray&rsquo;s Inn. There was a third person present, an elderly lady,  rather a faded beauty in appearance, and somewhat over-dressed. She took no  part in the conversation, but sat in an easy-chair by the fire, turning over  the crisp sheets of the <i>Times</i> newspaper, which, every time she moved them, emitted a sharp, crackling sound,  unpleasant to the nervous temperaments of the younger lady and the gentleman.</p>
<p>The gentleman was a solicitor, Horace Margrave, the  guardian of the young lady, and executor to her uncle&rsquo;s will. Her name was  Ellinor Arden; she was sole heiress and residuary legatee to her uncle, John  Arden, of the park and village   of Arden, in  Northamptonshire; and she had this very day come of age. Mr. Margrave had been  the trusted and valued friend of her father, dead ten years before, and of her  uncle, only lately dead; and Ellinor Arden had been brought up to think, that  if there were truth, honesty, or friendship upon earth, those three attributes  were centred in the person of Horace Margrave, solicitor, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p>He is to-day endeavouring to explain and to  reconcile her to the conditions of her uncle&rsquo;s will, which are rather peculiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, my dear Ellinor,&rdquo; he says,  still drumming on the table, still looking at his desk, and not at her, &ldquo;you  had no particular right to expect to be your uncle John Arden of Arden&rsquo;s  heiress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was his nearest relation,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted; but that was no reason why you should be  dear to him. Your father and he, after the amiable fashion that frequently  obtains among brothers in this very Christian country, were almost strangers to  each other for the best part of their lives. You your uncle never saw, since  your father lived on his wife&rsquo;s small property in the North of Scotland, and  you were brought up in that remote region until your said father&rsquo;s death, which  took place ten years ago; after your father&rsquo;s death you were sent to Paris, to  be there educated under the surveillance of your aunt, and you therefore never  made the acquaintance of John Arden of Arden, your father&rsquo;s only brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father had such a horror of being  misinterpreted; had he sought to make his daughter known to his rich brother,  it might have been thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he wanted to get that rich brother&rsquo;s money.  It might have been thought? My dear girl, it would have been thought! Your  father acted with the pride of the Northamptonshire Ardens; he acted like a  high-minded English gentleman: and he acted, in the eyes of the world, like a  fool. You never, then, expected to inherit your uncle&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. Nor did I ever wish it. My mother&rsquo;s little  fortune would have been enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to heaven you had never had a penny beyond  it!&rdquo; As Horace Margrave said these few words, the listless expression of his  face was disturbed by a spasm of pain.</p>
<p>He so rarely spoke on any subject whatever in a  tone of real earnestness, that Ellinor Arden, startled by the change in his  manner, looked up at him suddenly and searchingly. But the veil of weariness  had fallen over his face once more, and he continued, with his old indifference  &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;To the surprise of everyone, your uncle bequeathed  to you, and to you alone, his entire fortune, stranger as you were to him. This  was an act, not of love for you, but of duty to his dead brother. The person  nearest his heart was unconnected with him by the ties of kindred, and he no  doubt considered that it would be an injustice to disinherit his only brother&rsquo;s  only child in favour of a stranger. This stranger, this proteg&eacute; of your  uncle&rsquo;s, is the son of a lady who once was beloved by him, but who loved  another, poorer and humbler than Squire Arden of Arden. She married this poorer suitor, George  Dalton, a young surgeon, in a small country town. She married him, and three  years after her marriage, she died, leaving an only child, a boy. This boy, on  the death of his father, which happened when he was only four years old, was  adopted by your uncle. He never married, but devoted himself to the education  of the son of the woman who had rejected him. He did not, however, bring up the  boy to look upon himself as his heir. He educated him as a man ought to be  educated who has his own path to make in life. He gave young Dalton a university education, and sent him  to the bar, where he pleaded his first cause a year before your uncle&rsquo;s death.  He did not leave the young barrister a shilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he left his entire fortune to you, on condition  that you should marry Henry Dalton within a year of your majority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I marry anyone else, or refuse to marry  this apothecary&rsquo;s son, I lose the fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every farthing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sweet smile brightened her face as she rose  hurriedly from her chair, and stood before the table at which the lawyer was  seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; she said resolutely. &ldquo;I will forfeit  the fortune. I have a hundred a-year from my poor mother&rsquo;s estate &mdash; enough for  any woman. I will forfeit the fortune, and&mdash;&rdquo; she paused for a moment, <i>&ldquo;</i>and marry the man I love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been said that Horace Margrave had a pale  complexion; but as Ellinor Arden said these words, his face changed from its  ordinary dark pallor to a deadly ashen hue, and his strongly-marked black  eyebrows contracted painfully over his half-closed eyes.</p>
<p>She stood with her small gloved hand resting  lightly on the table, and her dark lashes downcast upon the faint crimson of  her cheeks, so she did not see the change in Horace Margrave&rsquo;s face. She waited  a minute or two, to hear what he would say to her determination; and, on his  not speaking, she turned from him impatiently, and resumed her seat.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more indifferent than Mr.  Margrave&rsquo;s manner, as he looked lazily up at her, and said, &ldquo;My poor romantic child!  Throw away a fortune of three thousand a-year, to say nothing of Arden Hall,  and the broad lands thereto appertaining, and marry the man you love! My sweet,  poetical Ellinor, may I venture to ask who this fortunate man may be for whom  you are prepared to make such a sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed a very simple and straightforward  question, emanating as it did from a man of business, many years her senior,  her dead father&rsquo;s old friend, and her own guardian and trustee; but Ellinor  Arden appeared painfully embarrassed by it. A dark flush spread itself over her  face; and her lips trembled faintly as she tried to speak, and failed to utter  a word. She was silent for some minutes, during which Horace Margrave played  with a penknife, opening and shutting it absently, and not once looking at his  beautiful ward. The elderly lady by the fireplace turned the crackling sheets  of the <i>Times </i>more than once during  the short silence, which seemed so long.</p>
<p>Horace Margrave was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Ellinor, as your guardian, till this very  day possessed of full power to control your actions &mdash; after to-day, I trust,  still possessed of the right to advise them &mdash; I have surely some claim on your  confidence. Tell me, then, candidly &mdash; as you may tell a middle-aged solicitor  like myself &mdash; who is this most happy of mankind? who is it whom you would  rather marry than Henry Dalton, your uncle&rsquo;s adopted son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once he looked at her as he spoke, she looking  full at him; so it was that their eyes met. A long, earnest, reproachful, sad  look was in hers; in his a darkness of gloomy sorrow, beyond all power of  description.</p>
<p>His eyelids were the first to fall; he went on  playing with the handle of the penknife, and said, &ldquo;You are so long in giving  me a candid and straightforward answer, my dear girl, that I begin to think  this hero is rather a mythic individual, and that your heart is free. Tell me.  Ellinor, is it not so? You have met so few people &mdash; have passed so much of your  life in the utter seclusion of a Parisian convent &mdash; and when away from the  convent you have been so protected by the Argus-like guardianship of your  respected aunt &mdash; that I really cannot conceive how you can have lost that dear,  generous heart of yours. I suspect that you are only trying to mystify me. Once  for all, then, my dear ward, has anyone been so fortunate as to win your  affection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her as he asked this decisive question  with a shrinking upward glance under his dark eyelashes &mdash; something like the  glance of a man who looks up, expecting a blow, and knows that he must shiver  and close his eyes when that blow falls.</p>
<p>The crimson flush passed away from her face, and  left her deadly pale, as she said, with a firm voice, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace Margrave sighed a deep sigh of relief, and  proceeded in his former tone &mdash; the tone of a thorough man of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, my dear Ellinor, seeing that you  have formed no prior attachment, that it is your uncle&rsquo;s earnest request, nay,  solemn prayer, that this marriage should take place; seeing, also, that Henry  Dalton is a very good young man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate good young men!&rdquo; she said impatiently.  &ldquo;Dreadfully perfect beings, with light hair and fresh-coloured cheeks. Men who  sing in church, and wear double-soled boots. I detest them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>My dear Ellinor! &mdash; my dear  Ellinor! Life is neither a stage-play nor a three-volume novel; and, rely upon  it, the happiness of a wife depends very little on the colour of her husband&rsquo;s  hair, or the cut of his coat. If he neglects you, will you be happier, lonely  and deserted at home, in remembering the haughty grace of his head, at that  very moment, perhaps, bending over the green cloth of a club whist-table? If he  wrings your heart with the tortures of jealousy, will it console you to recall  the splendour of his hazel eyes, whose gaze no longer meets your own? No, no,  Ellinor; dispossess yourself of the schoolgirl&rsquo;s notion of Byronic heroes, with  turn-down collars, and deficient moral region. Marry Henry Dalton. He is so  good, honourable, and sensible, that you must ultimately learn to esteem him.  Out of that esteem will grow affection; and, believe me, paradoxical as it may  sound, you will love him better in the future from not loving him too much in  the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, my dear guardian,&rdquo; replied Miss  Arden. <i>&ldquo;</i>Henry Dalton by all means,  then, and the fortune. I should be very sorry not to follow your excellent,  sensible, and business-like advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said this with a simulation of his own  indifference; but, in spite of herself, betrayed considerable agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are to dine at six&mdash;&rdquo; interposed the faded  lady by the fireplace, who had been looking over the top of the newspaper every  three minutes, hopelessly awaiting a break in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go home directly,&rdquo; replied Ellinor. &ldquo;You  are right, my dear Mrs. Morrison. Pray forgive me. Remember the happiness of a  life,&rdquo; &mdash; she looked not at Mrs. Morrison, but at Mr. Margrave, who had risen  and stood leaning against the mantelpiece in an attitude expressive of supreme  listlessness,&mdash; &ldquo;the happiness of a life, perhaps, depended on the interview of  to-day. I have made my decision, at the advice of my guardian. A decision which  must, no doubt, result in the happiness of everyone concerned. I am quite at  your service, Mrs. Morrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace Margrave laid his hand on the bell by his  side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your carriage will be at the entrance to the Inn in three minutes, Ellinor. I will see you to the  gate. Believe me, you have acted wisely; how wisely, you may never know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He himself conducted them down the broad panelled  staircase, and, putting on his hat, led his ward through the quiet inn to her  carriage. She was grave and silent, and he did not speak to her till she was  seated with her elderly companion and chaperone in her roomy landau, when he  leaned his hand on the carriage-door, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall bring Henry Dalton to Hertford-street this  evening, to introduce him to his future wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Pray do so,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only till eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his hat, and stood watching the carriage  as it drove away, then walked slowly back to his chambers, flung himself into a  luxurious easy-chair, took a cigar from a small Venetian casket standing on a  table at his side, lit it, wheeled his chair close to the fire, planted the  heels of his boots against the polished steel of the low grate, and prepared  for a lazy half hour before dinner.</p>
<p>As he lit the cigar, he looked gloomily into the  blaze at his feet, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace Margrave, if you had only been an honest  man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="InWhichASecretIsRevealed"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  In Which A Secret Is Revealed</h2>
<p>The hands of the ormolu clock, in the little  drawing-room in Hertford-street occupied by Ellinor Arden and her companion,  chaperone, and dependent, Mrs. Morrison, pointed to a quarter-past eight, as  Mr. Margrave&rsquo;s quiet brougham rolled up to her door.</p>
<p>Horace Margrave&rsquo;s professional position was no  inconsiderable one. His practice was large and eminently respectable; lying  principally amongst railway companies, and involving transactions of a very  extensive kind. He was a man of excellent family, elegant, clever, and  accomplished; too good for a lawyer, as everybody said; but a very good lawyer  for all that, as his clients constantly repeated. At two-and-thirty he was  still unmarried; why, no one could guess; as more than one great heiress, and  many a pretty woman, would have been proud to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to a matrimonial  proposition from Horace Margrave, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, and the Fir Grove,  Stanleydale, Berkshire. But the handsome lawyer evidently preferred his free  bachelor life; for if his heart had been very susceptible to womanly graces, he  would most inevitably have lost it in the society of his lovely ward, Ellinor  Arden.</p>
<p>Ellinor had only been a few weeks resident in London; she had left the guardianship of a maternal aunt  in Paris, to  launch herself upon the whirlpool of English society, sheltered only by the  ample wing of an elderly lady, duly selected and chartered by her aunt and Mr.  Margrave. The world was new to her, and she came from the narrow circle of the  convent in which she had been educated, and the quiet coteries of the Faubourg  Saint Germains, in which her aunt delighted, to take her position at once in London, as the sole heiress of John Arden, of Arden.</p>
<p>It was then to Horace Margrave &mdash; to Horace  Margrave, whom she remembered in her happy youth among the Scottish mountains,  a young man on a shooting expedition, visiting at her father&rsquo;s house &mdash; Horace  Margrave, who had visited her aunt, from time to time, in Paris, and who had  exhibited towards her all the tender friendship of an elder brother &mdash; to him,  and to him alone, did she look for counsel and guidance; and she submitted as  entirely to his influence as if he had indeed been that guardian and father he  by law represented.</p>
<p>Her cheek flushed as the carriage-wheels stopped  below the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mrs. Morrison,&rdquo; she said with a sneer; &ldquo;now  for my incomparable <i>futur.</i> Now for  the light hair and the thick boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be very ill-bred if he comes in thick  boots,&rdquo; replied her matter-of-fact chaperone. &ldquo;Mr. Margrave says he is such an  excellent young person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, my dear Mrs. Morrison &mdash; a young person.  He is described in one word &mdash; a &lsquo;person.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my dream, my dream!&rdquo; she murmured under her  breath.</p>
<p>She had but this day passed wisdom&rsquo;s Rubicon, and  she was new to the hither bank. She was still very romantic, and perhaps very  foolish.</p>
<p>The servant announced &ldquo;Mr. Margrave and Mr.  Dalton,&rdquo; In spite of herself, Ellinor Arden looked up with some curiosity to  see this young man, for whom she entertained so profound a contempt and so  unmerited an aversion. He was about three years her senior; of average height.  His hair was, as she had prophesied, light; but it was by no means an ugly  colour, and it framed a broad and massive forehead. His features were  sufficiently regular; his eyes dark blue. The expression of his face was grave,  and it was only on rare occasions that a quiet smile played round his  firmly-moulded lips. Standing side by side with Horace Margrave, he appeared  anything but a handsome man; but to the physiognomist his face was superior in  the very qualities in which the countenance of the lawyer was deficient &mdash;  force, determination, self-reliance, perseverance; all those attributes, in  short, which go to make a great man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton has been anxiously awaiting the hour  that should bring him to your side, Miss Arden,&rdquo; said Horace Margrave. &ldquo;He has  been for a long time acquainted with those articles in your uncle&rsquo;s will which  you only learned to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry Miss Arden should have ever learned  them, if they have given her pain,&rdquo; said the young man quietly.</p>
<p>Ellinor looked up in his face, and saw that the  blue eyes, looking down into hers, had a peculiar earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not so bad, after all,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I have  been foolish in ridiculing him; but I can never love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Arden,&rdquo; he continued, dropping into a chair  by the sofa on which she was seated, while Horace Margrave leaned against the  opposite side of the fireplace&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Arden, we meet under such peculiar  circumstances, that it is best for the happiness of both that we should at once  understand each other. Your late uncle was the dearest friend I ever had; no  father could have been dearer to the most affectionate of sons than he was to  me. Any wish, then, of his must to me be for ever sacred. But I have been  brought up to rely upon myself alone, and can truly say I have no better wish  than to make my own career, unaided by interest or fortune. The loss, then, of  this money will be no loss to me. If it be your will to refuse my hand, and to  retain the fortune to which you alone have a claim, do so. You shall never be  disturbed in the possession of that to which you, of all others, have the best  right. Mr. Margrave, your solicitor and executor to your uncle&rsquo;s will, shall  to-morrow execute a deed abnegating, on my part, all claim to this fortune; and  I will, at one word from you, bid you adieu this night, before,&rdquo; he added  slowly, with an earnest glance at her beautiful face,&mdash; &ldquo;before my heart is too  far involved to allow of my being just to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton,&rdquo; said Horace Margrave, lazily watching  the two from under the shadows of his eyelashes, &ldquo;you bring Roman virtue into  May Fair. You will purify the atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go or stay, Miss Arden?&rdquo; asked the young  man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Mr. Dalton.&rdquo; She rose as she spoke, and laid  her hand, as if for support, upon the back of a chair that was standing near  her. &ldquo;Stay, Mr. Dalton. If your happiness can be made by the union, which was  my late uncle&rsquo;s wish, let it be so. I cannot hold this fortune, which is not  mine; but I may share it. I will confess to you, and I know your generous  nature will esteem me better for the confession, that I have ventured to  cherish a dream in which the image of another had a part. I have been foolish,  mistaken, absurd; as schoolgirls often are. The dream is over. If you can  accept my uncle&rsquo;s fortune and my own esteem; one is yours by right, the other  has been won by your conduct of this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her hand to him. He pressed it gently,  raised it to his lips, led her back to the sofa, and reseated himself in the  chair by her side.</p>
<p>Horace Margrave closed his eyes, as if the  long-expected blow had fallen.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening passed slowly. Mr. Margrave  talked, and talked brilliantly; but he had a very dull audience. Ellinor was  absent-minded, Henry Dalton thoughtful, and Mrs. Morrison eminently stupid. The  lawyer found it hard work to be brilliant in such dull company. When the clock,  on which an ormolu Pan reclined amidst a forest of bronze rushes, chimed the  half-hour after ten, he carried away Mr. Dalton; and Ellinor was left to ponder  upon the solemn engagement into which she had entered on the impulse of the  moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better take a cab to the Temple,&rdquo;  said young Dalton  as they left the house. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wish you good-night, Mr. Margrave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Dalton, I have something to say to you  that must be said, and which I think I&rsquo;d rather say by night than by day. If  you are not afraid of late hours, come home with me to my chambers, and smoke a  cigar. I must have an hour&rsquo;s conversation with you before you see Ellinor Arden  again. Shall it be to-night? I ask it as a favour; let it be to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Dalton looked considerably  astonished by the lawyer&rsquo;s words and manner; but he merely bowed, and said,  &ldquo;With great pleasure. I am entirely at your service. If I returned to my  chambers I should read for two or three hours, so pray do not be afraid of  keeping me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Dalton and Horace Margrave sat talking for  nearly three hours in the chambers of the latter; but no cigars were smoked by  either of them, and though a bottle of Madeira  stood on the table, it was untouched. It was to be observed, however, that a  cellaret had been opened, and a decanter of brandy taken out; the stopper lay  beside it, and one glass, which had been drained to the dregs.</p>
<p>The clocks were striking two as Horace Margrave  opened the outer door for his late visitor. On the threshold he paused, laid  his hand, with a strong grasp, on Dalton&rsquo;s  arm, and said in a whisper, &ldquo;I am safe, then! Your promise is sacred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Dalton turned and looked him full in the face  &mdash; looked full at the pale face and downcast eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Daltons of Lincolnshire are not an  aristocratic race, Mr. Margrave; but they keep their word. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not hold out his hand at parting, but merely  lifted his hat and bowed gravely.</p>
<p>Horace Margrave sighed as he locked the doors, and  returned to his warm study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am safe. But then I might  have been happy. Have I been wise to-night? I wonder whether I have been wise,&rdquo;  he muttered, as his eyes wandered to a space over the mantelpiece, on which  were arranged two pairs of magnificently-mounted pistols, and a small dagger in  a chased silver scabbard. &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, it was scarcely worth the  trouble of this explanation; perhaps, after all, so miserable a game is  scarcely worth the candle that lights it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AfterTheHoneymoon"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  After The Honeymoon</h2>
<p>Three months had elapsed since the midnight  interview in Horace Margrave&rsquo;s chambers &mdash; three months, and the Opera House was  opened for the season, and three new tenors, and two sopranos, and a basso-baritono  had appeared under the classic proscenium of her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre; the novel  of the season was in full circulation; Rotten Row was gay with Amazonian  equestrians and <i>blase</i> lifeguardsmen;  moss-roses were selling on the dusty pavements of the West-end streets; and  Covent Garden was all a-bloom with artistically-arranged bouquets, and all  a-glow with Algerian fruits; &mdash; London, in short, was in the full flood-tide of  the season, when Mr and Mrs. Henry Dalton returned from their honeymoon visit  to the Cumberland lake-district, and took up their abode in the small house in  Hertford-street furished by Ellinor before her marriage.</p>
<p>Hers has been a short courtship; all the sweet  uncertainties, the doubts, the dreams, the fears, the hopes which make up the poetical  prologue to a love-match, have been wanting in this marriage ordained by the  will of her late uncle &mdash; this marriage, which is founded on esteem and not on  affection? this marriage, into which she has entered on the generous impulse of  an impetuous nature, which has never submitted itself to the discipline of  reason.</p>
<p>Is she happy? Can this cold esteem, this calm  respect which she feels for the man chosen for her by another, satisfy the  ardent heart of the romantic girl?</p>
<p>She has been already married six weeks, and she has  not seen Horace Margrave, the only friend she has in England &mdash; except, of course, her  husband &mdash; since her wedding-day; not since that sunny morning on which he took  her icy hand in his and gave her, as her guardian and the representative of her  dead father, into her husband&rsquo;s arms. She remembered that on that day when his  hand touched hers it was as cold and nerveless as her own, and that his  listless face was even paler than usual under the spring sunshine streaming in  at the church-windows. But in spite of this he did the honours of the  breakfast-table, toasted the bride and bridegroom, complimented the  bridesmaids, and pleased everybody, with the finished grace and marvellous ease  of the all-accomplished Horace Margrave. And if Ellinor had ever thought that  she had a right, for auld lang syne, for her dead father&rsquo;s sake, or for her own  lovely face, to be anything more or dearer to Mr. Margrave than the most  indifferent of his clients, that thought was dispelled by the gentlemanly <i>sang-froid</i> of his adieu, as the four  prancing steeds started off on the first stage to Windermere.</p>
<p>It was the end of June, and Mrs. Dalton was seated  in the small drawing-room, awaiting the advent of morning visitors. Bridegroom  and bride had been a week in town, and Horace Margrave had not yet called upon  them. She had a weary air this morning, and sought in vain for something to  occupy her. Now she strolled to the open piano, and played a few chords of a  brilliant run, or softly touched the notes of some pensive air, and sang a few  soft Italian syllables; now she took up an uncut novel from the table, and read  a page or two-here and there, wherever the book opened. Anon she walked to an  embroidery-frame, and took a great deal of trouble in selecting wools and  threading needles; but when this was accomplished she did not work three  stitches. After this she loitered listlessly about the room, looking at the  pictures and proof engravings which adorned the pale silver-gray walls; but at  last she was so utterly weary, that she sank into an easy-chair by the open  window, and sat idly looking down across a liliputian forest of heliotrope and  geranium into the hot sunny street.</p>
<p>She was looking very lovely, but she was not  looking happy. Her dark-brown hair was brushed away from her broad low brow,  and secured in a coil of superb plaits at the back of her head; her white  morning-dress was only ornamented by large knots of violet ribbon, and she wore  no jewellery whatever, except a tiny, slender gold chain, which she twisted  perpetually between her slim white fingers.</p>
<p>She sat thus for about half an hour, always looking  across the plants in the balcony at the pavement opposite, when she suddenly  wrenched the thin chain off her fingers.</p>
<p>She had seen the person for whom she had been  waiting. A gentleman, who lounged along the other side of the street, crossed  the road beneath the window, and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she muttered to herself; &ldquo;now, perhaps,  this mystery will be explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant announced Mr. Margrave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she said again, rising as he entered the  room. &ldquo;O, Mr. Margrave, I have been so anxious to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked about on the crowded table to find  amongst its fashionable litter a place for his hat; failed in doing so, and put  it down on a chair; and then, for the first time, looked at his late ward:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anxious to see me, my dear Ellinor; why anxious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there are two or three questions which I  must ask, which you must answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That peculiar expression in Horace Margrave&rsquo;s eyes,  which was as it were a shiver of the eyelids, passed over them now; but it was  too brief to be perceived by Ellinor Dalton. He sank into a chair; near her  own, but not opposite to it. He paused to place this chair with its back to the  light, and then said, &ldquo;My dear Ellinor &mdash; my dear Mrs. Dalton &mdash; what questions  can you have to ask me but questions of a purely business character; and even  those I imagine your husband, who is quite as practical a man as myself, could  answer as well as I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton is the very last person to whom I can  apply for an answer to the questions which I have to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why the last person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because those questions relate to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I see! My dear Mrs. Dalton, is not this rather  a bad beginning? You appeal from your husband to your solicitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Margrave; I appeal to my guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, my dear Ellinor, there is no such  person. He is defunct; he is extinct. From the moment I placed your hand in  that of your husband before the altar of St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover-square, my duties,  my right to advise you, and your right to consult me, expired. Henceforth you  have but one guardian, one adviser, one friend, and his name is Henry Dalton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark shadow came over Ellinor Dalton&rsquo;s face, and  her eyes filled with tears as she said, &ldquo;Mr. Margrave, Heaven forbid that I  should say a word which could be construed into a reproach to you. Your duties  of guardianship, undertaken at the prayer of my dying father, have been as  truly and conscientiously discharged as such duties should be discharged by a  man of your high position and unblemished character. But I will own that  sometimes, with a woman&rsquo;s folly, I have wished that, for the memory of my dead  father, who loved and trusted you, for the memory of the old days in which we  were companions and friends, some feeling a little warmer, a little kinder, a  little more affectionate, something of the tenderness of an elder brother,  might have mingled with your punctilious fulfilment of the duties of guardian.  I would not for the world reproach you, still less reproach you for an act for  which I only am responsible; yet I cannot but remember that, if it had been so,  this marriage might never have taken place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a happy marriage, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most unhappy one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace Margrave was silent for a few moments, and  then begun, gravely, almost sadly, &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Henry Dalton,&rdquo; &mdash; he seemed  especially scrupulous in calling her Mrs. Dalton, as if he had been anxious to  remind her every moment how much their relations had changed,&mdash; &ldquo;when you accuse  me of a want of tenderness in my conduct towards yourself, of an absence of  regard for the memory of your father, my kind and excellent friend, you accuse  me of that for which I am no more responsible than for the colour of my hair,  or the outline of my face. You accuse me of that which is perhaps the bane of  my existence &mdash; a heart incapable of cherishing a strong affection, or a sincere  friendship, for any living being. Behold me, at five-and-thirty years of age,  unloved and unloving, without one tie which I cannot as easily break as I can  pay an hotel-bill or pack my portmanteau. My life, at its brightest, is a  dreary one &mdash; a dreary present, which can neither look back to a fairer past,  nor forward to a happier future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His deep musical voice fell into a sadder cadence  with these last words, and he looked down gloomily at the point of the cane  with which he absently traced vague hieroglyphics upon the carpet. After a  short silence, he looked up and said, &ldquo;But you wished to make some inquiries of  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did; I do. When I married Mr. Dalton, what  settlements were made? You told me nothing at the time, and I, so utterly  unused to business matters, asked you no questions. Besides, I had then reason  to think him the most honourable of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What settlements were made?&rdquo; asked the lawyer,  repeating Ellinor&rsquo;s question, as if it were the last of all others which he  expected to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what arrangements were made about my fortune?  How much of it was settled on myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one penny.&rdquo; Mrs. Dalton gave a start of  surprise, which Mr. Margrave answered in his most nonchalant manner. &ldquo;Not one  penny of it. There was no mention whatever of any such legal formality in your  uncle&rsquo;s will. He left his money to you, but he left it to you only on condition  that you shared it with his adopted son, Henry Dalton. This implied not only a  strong affection for, but an implicit faith in, the young man. To tie up your  money, or to settle it on yourself, would be to stultify your uncle&rsquo;s will. The  man that could be trusted by him could be trusted by you. This is why I  suggested no settlement. It is just possible that I acted in rather an  unlawyer-like manner; but I believe that I acted in the only manner consonant  with your late uncle&rsquo;s affectionate provisions for the two persons nearest and  dearest to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Henry Dalton is sole master of my &mdash; of the  fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As your husband, decidedly, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he may, if he pleases, sell the Arden estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Arden  estate is not entailed. Certainly he may sell it, if he wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Margrave, I must inform you that he does  wish to sell it, that he does intend to sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sell Arden Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An angry flush crimsoned her face as she looked  eagerly into the lawyer&rsquo;s eyes for one flash of surprise or indignation. She  looked in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear Mrs. Dalton, in my opinion your  husband shows himself a very sensible fellow by determining on such a  proceeding. Arden is one of the dreariest,  draughtiest, most dilapidated old piles of building in all England. It possesses all the  leading features of a country mansion; magnificent oak panelling, contemptible  servants&rsquo; offices; three secret staircases, and not one register-stove; six  tapestried chambers, and no bath-room; a dozen Leonardo da Vincis, and not one  door that does not let in assassination, in the shape of a north-east wind; a  deer-park, and no deer; three gamekeepers&rsquo; lodges, and not game enough to tempt  the most fatuitous of poachers!</p>
<p>Sell Arden Hall! Nothing could be more desirable.  But, alas, my dear Ellinor, your husband is not the man I take him for, if he  calculates upon finding a purchaser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dalton regarded the lawyer with not a little  contempt, as she said, &ldquo;But the want of feeling, the outrage upon the memory of  my poor uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your poor uncle will not be remembered a day the  longer through your retaining possession of a draughty and uncomfortable house.  When did Dalton  tell you this intention of his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our return from our tour. I suggested that we  should live there &mdash; that is, of course, out of the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Replied that it was out of the question our ever  residing there, as the place must be sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked him his reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. He told me that he was unable to reveal  those reasons to me, and might never be able to reveal them. He said, that if I  loved him, I could trust him and believe in him, and believe that the course he  took, however strange it might appear to me, was in reality the best and wisest  course he could take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, in spite of this, you doubt him?&rdquo; asked  Horace earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I do otherwise? He refuses me the  slightest freedom in my use of the fortune which I have brought to him. He, the  husband of a rich woman, enjoins economy &mdash; economy even in the smallest  details. I dare not order a jewel, a picture, an elegant piece of furniture, a  stand of hothouse flowers; for, if I do so, I am told that the expenditure is  beyond his present means, and that I must wait till we have more money at our  command. Then, again, his profession is a thousand times dearer to him than I. No  briefless, penniless barrister, with a mother and sister to support, ever  worked harder than he works, ever devoted himself more religiously than he  devotes himself to the drudging routine of the bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor Dalton, your husband is as high-minded and  conscientious a man as ever lived upon this earth. I seldom take the trouble of  making a vehement assertion; so believe me, if you can, now that I do. Believe  me, even if you cannot believe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too, against me?&rdquo; cried Ellinor mournfully.  &ldquo;O, believe me, it is not the money I want, it is not the possession of the  money which I grudge him; it is only that my heart sinks at the thought of  being united to a man I cannot respect or esteem. I did not ask to love him,&rdquo;  she added, half to herself; &ldquo;but I did pray that I might be able to esteem  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only say, Ellinor, that you are mistaken in  him.&rdquo; At this moment came the sound of a quick firm step on the stairs, and  Henry Dalton himself entered the room. His face was bright and cheerful, and he  advanced to his wife eagerly; but at the sight of Horace Margrave he fell back  with a frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Margrave, I thought it was part of our  agreement that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I should never darken this threshold. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor looked from one to the other with a pale,  frightened face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what, in Heaven&rsquo;s  name, does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that in the least can affect you, Ellinor.  A business disagreement between myself and Mr. Margrave; nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife turned from him scornfully, and  approaching Horace Margrave, rested her hand on the scroll-work at the back of  the chair on which he sat.</p>
<p>It was so small an action in itself, but it said,  as plainly as words could speak, &ldquo;This is the man I trust, in spite of you, in  spite of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not lost on Henry Dalton, who looked at his  wife with a grave, reproachful glance, and said, &ldquo;Under these circumstances,  then, Mr. Margrave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no right to come here. Granted; and I should  not have come, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment, and Ellinor interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote to my guardian, requesting him to call on  me. Mr. Dalton, what is the meaning of this? What mystery does all this  conceal? Am I to see my best and oldest friend insulted in my own house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A married woman has no friend but her husband: and  I may not choose to receive Mr. Margrave as a visitor in <i>our </i>house,&rdquo; Henry Dalton replied, coldly and gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not be troubled any longer with Horace  Margrave&rsquo;s society, Mr. Dalton<i>,&rdquo;</i> said the lawyer, rising, and walking slowly to the door. &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo; His  hand was upon the lock, when he turned, and with a tone of suppressed emotion  addressed Mrs. Dalton: &ldquo;Ellinor, shake hands with me,&rdquo; he said. That was all.  His sometime ward extended both her hands to him. He took them in his, bent his  dark head over them for a moment as he held them in his grasp, and murmured  hoarsely, &ldquo;Forgive me, Ellinor, and farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone. She hurried out on to the  landing-place, and called after him, &ldquo;Mr. Margrave, guardian, Horace, come  back! if only for one moment, come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband followed her, and led her back to the  drawingroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor Dalton, choose between that man and me.  Seek to renew your acquaintance with him, or hold any communication whatsoever  with him that does not pass through my hands; and we part for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young wife fell sobbing into her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My only friend!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;my only, only friend!  and to be parted from him thus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband stood at a little distance from her,  earnestly, sadly watching her, as she gave full sway to her emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wretchedness! what utter wretchedness!&rdquo; he  said aloud; <i>&ldquo;</i>and no hope of a  termination to it, no chance of an end to our misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AtBaldwinCourt"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  At Baldwin Court</h2>
<p>Henry Dalton prospered in his profession.  Gray-headed old judges talked over their after-dinner port of the wonderful  acumen displayed by the rising junior in the most important and difficult  cases. One, two, three years passed away, and the name of Dalton began to be one of mark upon the  Northern Circuit. The dawn often found him working in his chambers in  Paper-buildings, while his handsome wife was dancing at some brilliant  assembly, or listening to the vapid platitudes of one of her numerous admirers  and silent adorers. With Ellinor Dalton, to be unhappy was to be reckless. Hers  was that impulsive and emotional nature which cannot brood upon its griefs in  the quiet circle of a solitary home. She considered herself wronged by her  husband&rsquo;s parsimony, still more deeply wronged by his cold reserve; and she sought  in the gayest circles of fashionable London  for the peace which had never dwelt at her cold and deserted hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His profession is all in all to him,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;but there is at least the world left for me; and if I cannot be loved I will  prove to him that I can be admired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At many of the houses in which she was a constant  visitor Horace Margrave was also a familiar guest. The wealthy bachelor lawyer  was sure of a welcome wherever mamma had daughters to marry, and wherever papa  had money to invest or mortgages to effect. To her old guardian Ellinor&rsquo;s  manner never underwent the shadow of a change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may refuse to admit him here, you may forbid  my correspondence with him. I acknowledge the right you exercise so harshly,&rdquo;  she would say to her husband; &ldquo;but you cannot shake my faith in my dead  father&rsquo;s friend; you cannot control my sentiments towards the guardian of my  childhood.&rdquo; But by degrees she found that Horace Margrave was to be seen less  frequently every day at those houses in which she visited. It was growing a  rare thing now for her to see the dark handsome head overtopping the crowd in  which the lawyer mingled; and even when she did meet him, though his voice had  still its old gentleness, there was a tacit avoidance of her in his manner, which  effectually checked any confidence between them. This was for the first two  years after her marriage. In the third she heard accidentally that Horace  Margrave was travelling in Switzerland,  and had left the entire management of his very extensive business to a junior  partner.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the third year, Ellinor was  staying with her husband at the country house of his friend, Sir Lionel  Baldwin. Since that day on which the scene with Horace Margrave had taken place  in the little drawing-room in Hertford-street, Ellinor Dalton and her husband  had had no explanation whatever. On that day, the young man had fallen on his  knees at the feet of his sobbing wife, and had most earnestly implored her to  believe in his faith and honour, and to believe that, in everything he did, he  had a motive so strong and so disinterested as to justify his conduct. He  begged her to believe also that the marriage, on his part, had been wholly a  love-match; that he had been actuated by no mercenary considerations whatever;  and that if he now withheld the money to which, in all appearance, she had so  good a right, it was because it was not in his power to lavish it upon her. But  he implored in vain. Prejudiced against him from the very first, she had only  trusted him for a brief period, to doubt him more completely than ever at the  first suspicion that suggested itself. Wounded in her affection for another &mdash;  an affection whose strength, perhaps, she scarcely dared to confess to herself  &mdash; her feeling for Henry Dalton became one almost bordering on aversion. His  simple, practical good sense; his plain, unpolished manners; his persevering,  energetic, and untiring pursuit of a vocation with which she had no sympathy &mdash;  all these qualities jarred upon her enthusiastic temperament, and blinded her  to his actual merits. The world, which always contrives to know every thing,  very soon made itself completely acquainted with the eccentric conditions of  Mr. Arden&rsquo;s will, and the circumstances of Henry Dalton&rsquo;s marriage.</p>
<p>It was known to be a marriage of convenience, and  not of affection. He was a very lucky fellow, and she was very much to be  pitied. This was the general opinion, which Ellinor&rsquo;s palpable indifference to  her husband went strongly to confirm.</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs. Dalton had been staying for a week at Baldwin Court, when  the young barrister was compelled, by his professional pursuits, to leave his  wife for a few days under the protection of his old friends, Sir Lionel and  Lady Baldwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be very happy here, my dear Ellinor,&rdquo; he  said; &ldquo;the house is full of pleasant people, and you know what a favourite you  are with the Baldwins. You will not miss me,&rdquo;  he added, with a sigh, as he looked at her indifferent face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss you! O, pray do not alarm yourself, Mr.  Dalton! I am not so used to usurp your time or attention. I know, when your  professional duties are concerned, how small a consideration I am to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not work hard were I not compelled to do  so, Ellinor,&rdquo; he said, with a shade of reproach in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Dalton,&rdquo; she answered coldly, &ldquo;I have  no taste for mysteries. You are perfectly free to pursue your own course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they parted. She bade him adieu with as much  well-bred indifference as if he had been her jeweller or her haberdasher. As  the light little phaeton drove him off to the railway station, he looked up to  the chintz-curtained windows of his wife&rsquo;s apartments, and said to himself,  &ldquo;How long is this to endure, I wonder? &mdash; this unmerited wretchedness, this  cruel misconception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning after Henry Dalton&rsquo;s departure, as Sir  Lionel Baldwin, seated at breakfast, opened the letter-bag, he exclaimed, with  a tone of mingled surprise and pleasure, &ldquo;So the wanderer has returned! At the  very bottom of the bag I can see Horace Margrave&rsquo;s dashing superscription. He has  returned to England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed his visitors their letters, and then  opened his own, reserving the lawyer&rsquo;s epistle to the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is delightful! Horace will be down here  to-night.&rdquo; Ellinor Dalton&rsquo;s cheek grew pale at the announcement; for the mysterious  feud between her guardian and her husband flashed upon her mind. She would meet  him here, then, alone. Now, or never, might she learn this secret &mdash; this secret  which, no doubt, involved some meanness on the part of Henry Dalton, the  apothecary&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margrave will be an immense acquisition to our  party &mdash; will he not, gentlemen?&rdquo; asked Sir Lionel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An acquisition! Well, really now, I don&rsquo;t know  about that,&rdquo; drawled a young government clerk from Whitehall. &ldquo;Do you know, Sir Lionel, it&rsquo;s my  opinion that Horace Margrave is used up? I met him at &mdash; at what-you-may-call-it  &mdash; Rousseau and Gibbon, C<i>hilde Harold</i> and the <i>Nouvelle H&egrave;loise:</i> you know  the place,&rdquo; he said vaguely; &ldquo;somewhere in Switzerland, in short, &mdash; last July,  and I never saw a man so altered in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altered!&rdquo; exclaimed the Baronet.</p>
<p>Ellinor Dalton&rsquo;s face grew paler still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;pon my honour, very much altered indeed. You  don&rsquo;t think he ever committed a murder, or anything of that kind, do you?&rdquo; said  the young man reflectively, as he drew over a basin and deliberately dropped  four or five lumps of sugar into his coffee. &ldquo;Because, upon my honour, he  looked like that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Fred, don&rsquo;t be a fool. Looked like what  sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know; a guilty conscience &mdash; Lara, Manfred. You  understand. Upon my word,&rdquo; added the youthful official, looking round with a  languid laugh, &ldquo;he had such a Wandering-Jew-ish and ultra-Byronic appearance,  when I met him suddenly among some very uncomfortable kind of  chromolithographie mountain scenery, that I asked him if he had an appointment  with the Witch of the Alps, or any of that  sort of people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One or two country visitors laughed faintly, seeing  the young man meant to be jocose; and the guests from town only stared, as the  government official looked round the table. Ellinor Dalton never took her eyes  from his face, but seemed to wait anxiously for anything he might say next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Margrave has been ill,&rdquo; said the Baronet;  &ldquo;he told me, when he went to Switzerland,  that he was leaving England  for change of air and scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill!&rdquo; said the government clerk. &ldquo;Ah, to be sure;  I never thought of that. He might have been ill. It&rsquo;s difficult, sometimes, to  draw the line between a guilty conscience and the liver-complaint. Perhaps it  was only his liver, after all. But you don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he said appealingly,  returning to his original idea, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think that he has committed a  murder, and buried the body in Verulam-buildings &mdash; do you? That would account  for his going to Switzerland,  you know; for he couldn&rsquo;t possibly stop with the body &mdash; could he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask him the question yourself, Fred,&rdquo;  said Sir Lionel, laughing; &ldquo;if everybody had as good a conscience as Horace  Margrave, the world would be better stocked than it is with honest men. Horace  is a noble-hearted fellow; I&rsquo;ve known him from a boy. He&rsquo;s a glorious fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a crack shot,&rdquo; said a young military man with  his mouth full of buttered toast and anchovy paste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a first-rate billiard-player,&rdquo; added his next  neighbour, who was occupied in carving a ham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one of the longest-headed fellows in the <i>Law-List&rdquo; </i>said a grave old gentleman  sententiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extremely handsome,&rdquo; faltered one young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, how accomplished!&rdquo; ventured another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think, really now, that he has  committed a murder, and buried the body in his chambers?&rdquo; asked the Whitehall <i>employ&eacute;</i>, putting the question to the  company generally.</p>
<p>In the dusk of that autumnal evening, Ellinor  Dalton sat alone in a tiny drawing-room leading out of the great saloon, which  was a long room, with six windows and two fireplaces, and with a great many  indifferent pictures in handsome frames.</p>
<p>This tiny drawing-room was a favourite retreat of  Ellinor&rsquo;s. It was deliciously furnished, and it communicated, by a half-glass  door shrouded by cream-coloured damask curtains, with a large conservatory,  which opened on to the terrace-walk that ran along one side of the house. Here  she sat in the dusky light, pensive and thoughtful, on the evening after her  husband&rsquo;s departure. The gentlemen were all in the billiard-room, hard at work  with balls and cues, trying to settle some disputed wager before the half-hour  bell rang to summon them to their dressing-rooms. The ladies were already at  their toilettes; and Ellinor, who had dressed earlier than usual, was quite  alone. It was too dark for her to read or work, and she was too weary and  listless to ring for lamps; so she sat with her hands lying idly in her lap,  pondering upon the morning&rsquo;s conversation about Horace Margrave.</p>
<p>Suddenly a footstep behind her, falling softly on  the thick carpet, roused her from her reverie, and she looked up with a  startled glance at the glass over the low chimneypiece.</p>
<p>In the dim firelight she saw, reflected in the  shadowy depths of the mirror, the haggard and altered face of her sometime  guardian, Horace Margrave.</p>
<p>He wore a loose overcoat, and had his hat in his  hand. He had evidently only just arrived.</p>
<p>He drew back on seeing Ellinor, but as she turned  to speak to him, the firelight behind her left her face in the shadow, and he  did not recognise her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for disturbing you.  I have been looking everywhere for Sir Lionel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Margrave! Don&rsquo;t you know me? It is I &mdash;  Ellinor!&rdquo; The hat fell from Horace Margrave&rsquo;s slender hand, and he leaned  against a high-backed easy-chair for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor &mdash; Mrs. Dalton &mdash; you here! I &mdash; I &mdash; heard  you were in Paris,  or I should never &mdash; that is to say &mdash; I&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time in her life Ellinor Dalton saw  Horace Margrave so agitated that the stony mask of gentlemanly <i>sang-froid</i>, which he ordinarily wore,  dropped away, and revealed &mdash; himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Margrave,&rdquo; she said anxiously, &ldquo;you are  annoyed at seeing me here. O, how altered you are! They were right in what they  said this morning. You are indeed altered; you must have been very ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace Margrave was himself again. He picked up his  hat, and sinking lazily into the easy-chair upon which he had been leaning,  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have had rather a severe attack &mdash; fever &mdash;  exhaustion &mdash; the doctors, in fact, were so puzzled as to what they should call  my illness, that they actually tried to persuade me that I had nerves &mdash; like a  young lady who has been jilted by a life-guardsman, or forbidden by her parents  to marry a country curate with seventy pounds per annum, and three duties every  Sunday. A nervous lawyer! My dear Mrs. Dalton, can you imagine anything so  absurd? Sir James Clarke, however, insisted on my packing my portmanteau, and  setting off for Mont Blanc, or something of that kind; and I, being heartily tired  of the Courts of Probate and Chancery, and Verulam-buildings, Gray&rsquo;s-Inn, was  only too glad to follow his advice, and take my railway-ticket for Geneva.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Switzerland has restored you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a measure; but not entirely. You can see that I  am not yet very strong, when even the pleasing emotion of meeting unexpectedly  with my sometime ward is almost too much for my nerves. But you were saying  that they had been talking of me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the breakfast-table this morning. When  your visit was announced, one of the gentlemen said he had met you in Switzerland,  and that you were looking ill &mdash; unhappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy! Ah, my dear Mrs. Dalton, what a  misfortune it is for a man to have a constitutional pallor and a weak  digestion! The world will insist upon elevating him into a blighted being, with  a chronic wolf hard at work under his waistcoat. I knock myself up by working  too hard over a difficult will-case, in which some tiresome old man leaves his  youngest son forty thousand pounds upon half a sheet of note-paper; and the  world, meeting me in Switzerland, travelling to recruit myself, comes home and  writes me down &mdash; unhappy. Now, isn&rsquo;t it too bad? If I were blessed with a  florid complexion I might break my heart once in three months without any of my  sympathetic friends troubling themselves about the fracture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Margrave,&rdquo; said Ellinor &mdash; her voice,  in spite of herself, trembling a little&mdash; &ldquo;I am really now quite an old married  woman; and, presuming on that fact, may venture to speak to you with entire  candour &mdash; may I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With entire candour, certainly.&rdquo; There was the old  shiver in the dark eyelashes, and the old droop of the eyelids, as Horace  Margrave said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear guardian, for I will &mdash; I will call  you by that old name, which I can remember speaking for the very first time on  the day of my poor father&rsquo;s funeral. O!&rdquo; she added passionately, &ldquo;how well I  remember that dreary day! I can see you now, as I saw you then, standing in the  deep bay-window of the library, in the dear, dear Scottish home, looking down  at me so compassionately. I was such a child then. I can hear your low, deep  voice, as I heard it on that day, saying to me&mdash;&lsquo;Ellinor, your dead father has  placed a solemn trust in my hands. I am young. I may not be so good a man as, to  his confiding mind, I seemed to be; there may be something of constitutional  weakness and irresolution in my character which he never suspected; but so  deeply do I feel the trust implied in his dying words, that I swear, by my hope  in Heaven, by my memory of the dead, by my honour as a gentleman, to discharge  the responsibilities imposed upon me as an honest man should discharge them!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Ellinor, Ellinor, for  pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried the lawyer in a broken voice, clasping one wasted hand  convulsively over his averted face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wrong,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to recall that melancholy  day; but I wanted to prove to you how your words were impressed upon my mind.  You did, you did discharge every duty nobly, honestly, honourably; but now, now  you abandon me entirely to the husband not of my choice, but imposed upon me by  a cruel necessity, and you do all in your power to make us strangers. Yet,  guardian &mdash; Horace, you are not happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not happy!&rdquo; he echoed, with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;My  dear Mrs. Dalton, this is such childish talk about happiness and unhappiness &mdash;  two words which are only used in a lady&rsquo;s novel, in which the heroine is  unhappy through two volumes and three-quarters, and unutterably blest in the  last chapter. In the practical world we don&rsquo;t talk about happiness and unhappiness;  our phrases are failure and success. A man gets the woolsack, and he is  successful; or he tries to earn bread-and-cheese, and fails, and we shrug our  shoulders and say that he is unfortunate. But a happy man, my dear Ellinor &mdash;  did you ever see one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mystify me; but you do not answer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because to answer you I must first question  myself; and, believe me, a man must have considerable courage who can dare to  ask himself whether, in this troublesome journey of life, he has taken the  right or the wrong road. I confess myself a coward, and implore you not to  compel me to be brave.&rdquo; He rose, looked down at his dress, and exclaimed in his  usual society tone, &ldquo;The first dinner-bell rang a quarter of an hour ago, and  behold me still in travelling costume; the sin is yours, Mrs. Dalton. Till  dinner, adieu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was difficult to recognise the gloomy and bitter  Horace Margrave of the previous half-hour in the brilliant guest who sat on  Lady Baldwin&rsquo;s right hand, and whose incessant flow of witty <i>persiflage</i> kept the crowded dinner-table  in a roar of laughter. Ellinor, charmed in spite of herself, beguiled out of  herself by the fascination of his animated conversation, wondered at the  extraordinary power possessed by this man. <i>&ldquo;</i>So  brilliant, so accomplished!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;so admired and successful, and yet  so unhappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening&rsquo;s post brought Ellinor a letter which  had been sent to the house in Hertford - street, and forwarded thence to Sir  Lionel&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She started on seeing the direction, and, taking  her letter into the little inner drawing-room, which was still untenanted, she  read it by the light of the wax-candles on the chimney-piece. She returned to  the long saloon after refolding the letter, crossed over to a small table at  which Horace Margrave sat bending over a portfolio of engravings, seated  herself near him, and said, &ldquo;Mr. Margrave, I have just received a letter from Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Scotland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. From the dear old clergyman, James Stewart;  you remember him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a white-headed old man with a family of  daughters, the shortest of whom was taller than I. Do you correspond with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, no. It is so many years since I left Scotland,  that my old friends seem one by one to have dropped off. I should like so much  to have given them a new church at Achindore; but Mr, Dalton of course objected  to the outlay of money, and as that is a point I never dispute with him, I  abandoned the idea; but Mr. Stewart has written to me this time for a special  purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell me that my old nurse, Margaret Mackay, has  become blind and infirm, and has been obliged to leave her situation. Poor dear  old soul &mdash; she went into a service in Edinburgh,  after my poor father&rsquo;s death, and I entirely lost sight of her. I should have  provided for her long before this had I known where to find her; but now there  is no question about this appeal, and I shall immediately settle a hundred  a-year upon her, in spite of Mr. Dalton&rsquo;s rigid and praiseworthy economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy Dalton  will think a hundred a-year too much. Fifty pounds for an old woman in the  north of Aberdeenshire would be almost fabulous wealth. But you are so superb  in your notions, my dear Ellinor. Hard-headed business men, like Dalton and myself, can  scarcely stand against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not compare yourself with Mr. Dalton,&rdquo;  said Ellinor coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, indeed, I must not,&rdquo; he answered with  gravity; &ldquo;but you were saying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That in this matter I will take no refusal; I will  listen to no excuses or prevarications. I shall write to my husband by to-morrow&rsquo;s  post. I cannot have an answer till the next day. If that answer should be  either a refusal or an excuse, I know what course to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>I will tell you what it is  when I receive Mr. Dalton&rsquo;s reply. But I am unjust to him,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he  cannot refuse to comply with this request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days after this conversation, just as the  half-hour bell had rung, and as Sir Lionel&rsquo;s visitors were hurrying off to  their dressing-rooms, Ellinor laid her hand lightly on Horace Margrave&rsquo;s arm,  and said, <i>&ldquo;</i>Pray let me speak to you  for a few minutes. I have received Mr. Dalton&rsquo;s answer to my letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that answer?&rdquo; he asked as he followed her into  the little room communicating with the conservatory.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Is, as you suggested it  might be, a refusal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A refusal!&rdquo; Mr. Margrave elevated his eyebrows  slightly, but seemed by no means surprised at the intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a refusal. He dares not even attempt an  excuse, or invent a reason for his conduct. Forty pounds a-year, he says, will  be a competence for an old woman in the north of Scotland, where very few ministers  of the Presbyterian church have a larger income. That sum he will settle on her  immediately, and he sends me a cheque for the first half-year; but he will  settle no more, nor will he endeavour to explain motives which are always  misconstrued. What do you think of his conduct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the glass door which separated the  room from the conservatory swung backwards and forwards in the autumn breeze  which blew in through the outer door of the conservatory. The day had been  unusually warm for the time of year, and this outer door had been left open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Ellinor,&rdquo; said Horace Margrave, &ldquo;if anyone  should come into the conservatory, they might hear us talking of your husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is dressing,&rdquo; she answered carelessly.  &ldquo;Besides, if anyone were there, they would scarcely be surprised to hear me  declare my contempt for Henry Dalton. The world does not give us credit for  being a happy couple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will; but I am sure I heard someone stirring  in that conservatory. But no matter. You ask me what I think of your husband&rsquo;s  conduct in refusing to allow a superannuated nurse of yours more than forty  pounds a-year? Don&rsquo;t think me a heartless ruffian, if I tell you that I think  he is perfectly right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to withhold from me my own money! to fetter my  almsgiving! to control my very charities! I might forgive him if he refused me  a diamond necklace or a pair of ponies; but in this matter, in which my  affection is concerned, to let his economy step in to frustrate my  earnestly-expressed wishes &mdash; it is too cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>My dear Mrs. Dalton, like  all very impetuous and warmhearted people, you are rather given to jump at  conclusions. Mr. Dalton, you say, withholds your own money from you. Now, your  own money &mdash; with the exception of the Arden  estate, which he sold within a year of your marriage &mdash; happens to have been  entirely invested in the Three per Cents. Now, suppose &mdash; mind, I haven&rsquo;t the  least reason to suppose that such a thing has ever happened, but for the sake  of putting a case &mdash; suppose Henry Dalton, as a clever and enterprising man of  business, should have been tempted to speculate with some of your money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without consulting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without consulting you. Decidedly. What do women  know of speculation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Margrave, if Henry Dalton has done this, he is  no longer a miser, but he is &mdash; a cheat. The money bequeathed to me by my uncle  was mine: to be shared with him, it is true, but still mine. No sophistry, no  lawyer&rsquo;s quibble, could ever have made it his. If, then, he has, without my  consent or knowledge, speculated with that money, he is a dishonest man. Ah,  Horace Margrave, you, who have noble blood in your veins &mdash; you, who are a  gentleman, an honourable man &mdash; what would you think of Henry Dalton, if this  were possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor Dalton, have you ever heard of the madness  men have christened gambling? Do you know what a gambler is? Do you know what  the man feels who hazards his wife&rsquo;s fortune, his widowed mother&rsquo;s slender  pittance, his helpless children&rsquo;s inheritance, the money that should pay for  his son&rsquo;s education, his daughter&rsquo;s dowry, the hundreds due to his trusting  creditors, or the gold intrusted to him by a confiding employer, &mdash; on the green  cloth of a West-end gaming-table? Do you think that at that mad moment, when  the glaring lights above the table dazzle his eyes, and the piles of gold heave  up and down upon the green baize, and the croupier&rsquo;s voice crying, &lsquo;Make your  game!&rsquo; is multiplied by a million, and deafens his bewildered ear like the clamour  of all the fiends; do you think at that moment that he ever supposes he is  going to <i>lose</i> the money? No; he is  going to double, to treble, to quadruple it; to multiply every guinea by a  hundred, and to take it back to the starving wife or the anxious children, and  cry, &lsquo;Was I so much to blame, after all?&rsquo; Have you ever stood upon the Grand  Stand at Epsom, and seen the white faces of the betting-men, and heard the roar  of the eager voices at the last rush for the winning-post? Every man upon that  crowded stand, every creature upon that crowded course &mdash; from the great magnate  of the turf, who stands to win a quarter of a million, to the wretched  apprentice-lad, who has stolen half-a-crown from the till to put it upon the  favourite &mdash; believes that he has backed a winning horse. That is the great  madness of gaming; that is the terrible witchcraft of the gambling-house and  the ring; and that is the miserable hallucination of the man who speculates  with the fortune of another. Pity him, Ellinor. If the weak and wicked are ever  worthy of the pity of the good, that man deserves your pity.&rdquo; He had spoken  with an energy unusual to him, and he sank into a chair, half-exhausted by his  unwonted vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather think the man whom I am forced to  call my husband a miser than a cheat, Mr. Margrave,&rdquo; Ellinor said coldly; &ldquo;and  I am sorry to learn, that if he were indeed capable of such dishonour, his  crime would find an advocate in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are pitiless, Mrs. Dalton,&rdquo; said Horace  Margrave, after a pause. <i>&ldquo;</i>God help  the man who dares to wrong you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let us speak of Henry Dalton any longer,  Mr. Margrave. I told you that if he should refuse this favour, this &mdash; this  right, I had decided on my course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did; and now, may I ask what that course is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To leave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him!&rdquo; he exclaimed anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; leave him in the possession of the money  which is so dear to him. He can never have cared for me. He has refused my  every request, frustrated my every wish, devoted every hour of his life, not to  me, but to his profession. My aunt will receive me. I shall leave this place  to-night, and leave London for Paris to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the world say of such a step, Ellinor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Let the world judge between  us. What can the world say of me? I shall live with my aunt, as I did before my  luckless inheritance came to me. Mr. Margrave &mdash; guardian &mdash; you will accompany  me to Paris,  will you not? I am so inexperienced in all these sort of things, so little used  to help myself, that I dare not make this journey with my maid alone. You will  accompany me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Ellinor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; who so fit to protect me as you, to whom,  with his dying lips, my father committed my guardianship? For his sake you will  do me this service, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a service, Ellinor? Can I be doing you a  service in taking you away from your husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it, then,&rdquo; she said scornfully. &ldquo;You refuse  to help me; I will go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, alone; I go to-night, and alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crimson flush mounted to Horace Margrave&rsquo;s pale  face, and a vivid light shone in his handsome eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone, Ellinor? No, no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my poor child,  my ward, my helpless orphan girl, my little Scotch lassie of the good time  gone, I will protect you on this journey, place you safely in the arms of your  aunt, and answer to Henry Dalton for my conduct. In this, at least, Ellinor, I  will be worthy of your dear father&rsquo;s confidence. Make your arrangements for the  journey. You have your maid with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Ellis, a most excellent creature. Then  to-night, by the mail-train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be ready. You must make your excuses to  Lady Baldwin, and leave with as little explanation as possible.</p>
<p><i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ellinor Dalton and Horace Margrave left the  little boudoir, a gentleman in a greatcoat, with a railway-rug flung over his  shoulder, strode out on to the terrace through the door of the conservatory,  and lighting a cigar, paced for about half an hour up and down the shrubbery at  the side of the house, wrapped in thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="FromLondonToParis"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  From London To Paris</h2>
<p>While dressing, Ellinor gave her maid orders to set  about packing, immediately. Ellis, a very solemn and matter-of-fact person,  expressed no surprise, but went quietly to work, emptying the contents of  wardrobes into capacious trunks, and fitting silver-topped bottles into their  velvet-lined cases, as if there were no such thing as hurry or agitation in the  world.</p>
<p>To Ellinor Dalton that evening seemed very long.  Never had the county families appeared so stupid, or the London visitors so tiresome. The young man  from the War Office took her into dinner, and insisted on telling her some very  funny story about a young man in another government office, which brilliant  anecdote lasted, exclusive of interruptions, from the soup to the dessert,  without drawing any nearer the point of the witticism. After the dreary dinner,  the eldest daughter of the oldest of the county families fastened herself and a  very difficult piece of crochet upon her, and inflicted on her all the agonies  of a worsted-work rose, which, as the young lady perpetually declared, would  not come right. But however <i>distraite </i>Ellinor  might be, Horace Margrave was the Horace of the West-end world. He talked  politics with the heads of the county families; stock-exchange with the  city-men; sporting-magazine and Tattersall&rsquo;s with the county swells; discussed  the latest <i>d&eacute;buts</i> at her Majesty&rsquo;s  Theatre with the young Londoners; spoke of Sir John Herschel&rsquo;s last discovery  to a scientific country squire; and of the newest thing in farming-implements  to an agricultural ditto; talked compliments to the young country ladies, and  the freshest Mayfair scandal to the young London ladies; had, in short,  something to say on every subject to everybody, and contrived to please all.  And let any man who has tried to do this in the crowded drawing-room of a  country house, say whether or not Horace Margrave was a clever fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the bye, Horace,&rdquo; said Sir Lionel, as the  lawyer lounged against one corner of the mantelpiece, talking to a group of  young men and one rather fast young lady, who had edged herself into the  circle, under cover of a brother, much to the indignation of more timid  spirits, who sat modestly aloof, furtively regarding Admirable Crichton  Margrave, as his friends called him, from distant sofas; &ldquo;by the bye, my boy,  where did you hide yourself all this morning? We sadly wanted you to decide a  match at billiards, and I sent people all over the house and grounds in search  of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rode over to Horton after lunch,&rdquo; said Horace.  &ldquo;I wanted a few hours there on electioneering business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been to Horton?&rdquo; asked Sir Lionel, with  rather an anxious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear Sir Lionel, to Horton. But how  alarmed you look! I trust I haven&rsquo;t been doing anything wrong. A client of mine  is going to stand for the place. But surely you&rsquo;re not going to throw over the  county electors, and stand for the little borough of Horton yourself!&rdquo; he said,  laughing.</p>
<p>Sir Lionel looked a little confused, and the county  families grew suddenly very grave; indeed, one young lady in pink, who was  known by about seven fair <i>confidantes</i> to have a slight <i>tendre</i> for the  handsome lawyer, clutched convulsively at the wrist of a younger sister in  blue, and listened, with an alarmed face, to the conversation by the  chimneypiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how silent everyone has grown!&rdquo; said Horace,  still laughing. &ldquo;It seems as if I had launched a thunderbolt upon this  hospitable hearth, in announcing my visit to the little manufacturing town of Horton. What is it &mdash; why  is it &mdash; how is it?&rdquo; he asked, looking round with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Sir Lionel hesitatingly, &ldquo;the &mdash; the  truth of the matter &mdash; that is &mdash; not to mystify you &mdash; in short &mdash; you know &mdash;  they, they&rsquo;ve a fever at Horton. The &mdash; the working classes and factory people  have got it very badly, and &mdash; and &mdash; the place is in a manner <i>tabooed</i>. But of course,&rdquo; added the old  man, trying to look cheerful, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t go into any of the back streets, or  amongst the lower classes. You only rode through the town, I suppose; so you&rsquo;re  safe enough, my dear Horace.&rdquo; The county families simultaneously drew a long  breath, and the young lady in pink released her sister&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went, my dear Sir Lionel,&rdquo; said Horace, with  placid indifference, &ldquo;into about twenty narrow back streets in an  hour-and-a-half, and I talked to about forty different factory hands, for I  wanted to find which way the political current set in the good town of Horton.  They all appeared extremely dirty, and now, I remember, a good many of them  looked ill; but I&rsquo;m not afraid of having caught the fever, for all that,&rdquo; he  added, looking round at the grave faces of his hearers; &ldquo;half-a-dozen cigars,  and a sharp ten miles&rsquo; ride through a bleak, open country must be a thorough  disinfectant. If not,&rdquo; he continued bitterly, &ldquo;one must die sooner or later,  and why not of a fever caught at Horton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady in pink had recourse to her sister&rsquo;s  wrist again at this speech.</p>
<p>Horace soon laughed off the idea of danger from his  afternoon&rsquo;s rambles, and, in a few minutes, he was singing a German-student  song, and accompanying himself at the piano.</p>
<p>At last the long evening was over, and Ellinor, who  had heard nothing from her distant work-table of the conversation about the  fever, gladly welcomed the advent of a servant with a tray of glistening  candlesticks. As she lit her candle at the side-table, Horace Margrave came  over, and lit his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken to Sir Lionel,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a carriage  will be ready for us in an hour. The London mail  does not start till one o&rsquo;clock, and we shall reach town in time to catch the  day service for Paris.  But, Ellinor, it is not yet too late. Are you thoroughly determined on this  step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoroughly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall be ready in an  hour.&rdquo; Mrs. Dalton&rsquo;s apartments were at the end of a long corridor; the  dressing-room opened out of the bedroom, and the door of communication was ajar  as Ellinor entered her room. Her boxes stood ready packed. She looked at them  hurriedly, examined the addresses which her maid had pasted upon them, and was  about to pass into the dressing-room, when she stopped on the threshold with an  exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>Henry Dalton was seated at the table, with an open  portfolio spread before him, writing busily. On a chair by the fire lay his  greatcoat, railway-rug, and portmanteau.</p>
<p>He looked up for a moment, calmly and gravely, as  Ellinor entered; and then continued writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, still writing; &ldquo;I came down by the  5.30 train. I returned sooner than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the 5.30 train,&rdquo; she said anxiously; &ldquo;by the  train which leaves London  at half-past five, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the train which arrives here at half-past  five,&rdquo; answered her husband, without looking up; &ldquo;or should reach here by that  time, rather; for it&rsquo;s generally five minutes late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been here since six o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since ten minutes to six, my dear Ellinor. I gave  my valise to a porter, and walked over from the station in a quarter of an  hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been here since six, and have neither  told me of your arrival nor shown yourself in the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have shown myself to Sir Lionel. I had some very  important business to arrange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Important business?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to prepare for this journey to Paris, which you are so  bent upon taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said quietly, folding and sealing a  letter as he spoke, &ldquo;it is very contemptible, is it not? Coming unexpectedly  into the house by the conservatory entrance &mdash; which, as you know, to anyone  arriving from the station, saves about two hundred yards &mdash; I heard  involuntarily a part of a conversation, which had so great an effect upon me as  to induce me to remain where I was, and voluntarily hear the remainder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A listener?&rdquo; she said, with a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is on a par with all the rest, is it not?  An avaricious man, a money-grubbing miser; or, perhaps, even worse, a dishonest  speculator. O, Ellinor Dalton, if ever the day should come (God forbid that I  should wish to hasten it by an hour!) when I shall be free to speak one little  sentence, how bitterly you will regret your expressions of to-day! But I do not  wish to reproach you: it is our bad fortune &mdash; yours and mine &mdash; to be involved  in a very painful situation, from which, perhaps, nothing but an open rupture  could extricate us. You have taken the initiative. You wish to leave me, and  return to your aunt in Paris.  So be it. Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his manner, in spite of her  long-cherished prejudices against him, impressed and affected her, and she  stretched out her hand deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Ellinor! I, too, am weary of this long  struggle! this long conflict with appearances which, in spite of myself, condemn  me. I am sick to the very heart of these perpetual appeals to your generosity  and confidence &mdash; tired of trying to win the love of a woman who despises me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Henry, if &mdash; if &mdash; I have misconstrued&mdash;&rdquo; she  said, with a tenderness unusual to her in addressing her husband.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If</i> you have misconstrued&mdash;&rdquo; he  exclaimed passionately. &ldquo;No, Ellinor, no; it is too late now for explanations;  besides, I could give you none better than those you have already heard &mdash; too  late for reconciliation; the breach has been slowly widening for three long  years; and to-night I look at you across an impassable abyss, and wonder that I  could have ever dreamed, as I have dreamed, of ultimately winning your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a break in his voice as he said these  last words, and the emotion, so strange to the ordinary manner of the young  barrister, melted Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dalton! Henry!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>You wish to go to Paris,  Ellinor. You shall go. But the man who accompanies you thither must be Henry  Dalton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will take me there?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and will place you under your aunt&rsquo;s  protection. From that moment you are free of me for ever. You will have about  three hundred a-year to live upon. It is not much out of the three thousand, is  it?&rdquo; he said, laughing bitterly; <i>&ldquo;</i>but  I give you my honour it is all I can afford, as I shall want the rest for  myself.&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;A quarter-past twelve,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dress  yourself warmly, Ellinor; it will be a cold journey. I will ring for the people  to take your trunks down to the carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Henry,&rdquo; she took his hand in hers; &ldquo;Henry,  something in your manner to-night makes me think that I have wronged you. I  won&rsquo;t go to Paris.  I will remain with you; I will trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed the little hand lying in his very  gently, and said, looking at her gravely and sadly, with thoughtful blue eyes:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;You cannot</i>, Ellinor! No, no; it is  far better, believe me, as it is. I have borne the struggle for three years. I  do not think that I could endure it for another day. &mdash; Ellis?&rdquo; he said, as the  maid entered the room in answer to his summons, &ldquo;you will see that this letter  is taken to Mr. Margrave immediately, and then see that those trunks are  carried downstairs. &mdash; Now, Ellinor, if you are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had muffled herself hurriedly in a large velvet  cloak, while Ellis brought her bonnet and arranged the wraps, which she was too  agitated to arrange herself.</p>
<p>She stopped in the hall, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say good-bye to Mr. Margrave, and explain  this change in our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My letter has done that, Ellinor. You will not speak  one word to Horace Margrave while I am beneath this roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; she answered submissively.</p>
<p>She had suddenly learned to submit to, if not to  respect, her husband.</p>
<p>Henry Dalton was very silent during the short drive  to the railway-station; and when they alighted, he said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>You would like to have  Ellis with you, would you not?&rdquo; Ellinor assented, and her maid followed her  into the carriage. It seemed as if her husband had been anxious to avoid a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</i></p>
<p>Throughout the four hours&rsquo; journey Ellinor found  herself involuntarily watching the calm, grave face of her husband under the  dim carriage-lamp. It was impossible to read any emotion on that smooth brow,  or in those thoughtful eyes; but she remembered the agitation in his voice as  he spoke to her in her dressing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is capable of some emotion,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What  if after all I should really have wronged him? if there should be some other  key to this strange mystery than meanness and avarice? If he really love me,  and I have misconstrued him, what a wretch he must think me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next evening, after dark, they arrived in  Paris; and Ellinor found herself, after an interval of nearly four years, once  more in her aunt&rsquo;s little drawing-room in the Rue Saint Dominique. She was  received with open arms. Henry Dalton smoothed over the singularity of her  arrival, by saying that it was a visit of his own suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything will explain itself at a future time,  Ellinor; for the present, let ours be thought a temporary separation. I do not  wish to alarm your poor aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have your own old bedroom, Ellinor,&rdquo;  said her aunt. &ldquo;Nothing has been disturbed since you left us &mdash; look;&rdquo; and she  opened the door of a little apartment leading out of the drawing-room, in which  ormolu clocks, looking-glasses, and pink curtains very much preponderated over  more substantial furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are looking very ill, my dear child,&rdquo; she  said anxiously as Ellinor pushed away the untasted refreshment which her aunt  had ordered for her,&mdash; &ldquo;you are really looking very ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My journey has fatigued me a little. I think I&rsquo;ll  go to my room at once, if you will excuse me, aunt; it is nearly eleven  o&rsquo;clock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and rest will do you more good than anything.  Good-night, my darling child. Lisette is getting your room ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wearied out with a night and day of incessant  travelling, Ellinor slept soundly, and, waking the next morning, found her aunt  seated by her bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, you look a great deal better after  your night&rsquo;s rest. Your husband would not disturb you to say good-bye, but has  left this letter for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Dalton gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he said he had most important business &mdash;  something about his circuit,&rdquo; said her aunt vaguely; &ldquo;but his letter will no  doubt explain all. He has made every arrangement for your comfort during your  stay with me, dear. He seems a most devoted husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very good,&rdquo; said Ellinor with a sigh. Her  aunt left her, and she opened the letter &mdash; opened it with an anxiety she could  not repress. She hoped this letter might contain some explanation, some offer  of reconciliation.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MY DEAR ELLINOR, &mdash; When you receive these few  lines of farewell, I shall be on my way to London. In complying with your wish, and  restoring you to the home of your youth, I hope and believe that I have acted for  the best. How completely you have misunderstood me, how entirely you have  mistaken my motives, you may never know. How much I have suffered from this  wretched misunderstanding it would be impossible for me to tell you. But let  this bitter past be forgotten; our roads in life henceforth lie separate. Yet  if at any future hour you should need an adviser or an earnest and  disinterested friend, I entreat you to appeal to no one but &ldquo;HENRY DALTON.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter fell from her hand. &ldquo;Now, now I am  indeed alone,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Horace Margrave&rsquo;s Confession</h2>
<p>Life in the Faubourg St. Germain seemed very dreary  to Ellinor after the pleasant London  society to which she had been accustomed since her marriage. Her aunt&rsquo;s  visiting-list was very limited. Four or five ancient dowagers, who thought that  the glory of the world had departed with the Bourbons, and that France, in the  van of the great march of civilisation, was foremost in a demoniac species of  dance, leading only to destruction and the erection of a new guillotine upon  the Place de la R&eacute;volution; two or three elderly but creditably-preserved  aristocrats of the ancient <i>r&eacute;gime,</i> whose political principles had stood still ever since the Restoration, and who  resembled ormolu clocks of that period, very much ornamented and embellished,  but useless as indicators of the flight of time; three or four very young  ladies educated in convents, and uninterested in anything except their pet  priests and the manufacture of point-lace; and one terrifically bearded and moustachioed  gentleman, who had written a volume of poems entitled <i>Clouds and Mists</i>, but who had not yet been so fortunate as to meet  with a publisher, &mdash; this was about the extent of the visiting circle in the Rue  St. Dominique; and for this circle Ellinor&rsquo;s aunt set apart a particular day,  on which she was visible in conjunction with <i>eau sucr&eacute;e,</i> rather weak coffee, and wafer-biscuits.</p>
<p>The first day of Ellinor&rsquo;s visit happened to be the  day of her aunt&rsquo;s reception, and it seemed to her as if the tiresome hours would  never wear themselves out, or the equally tiresome guests take their departure.  She could not help remembering how different everything would have been had  Horace Margrave been present. How he would have fought the battle of the <i>tiers &eacute;tat</i> with the white-headed old  partisans of the departed noblesse; how he would have discussed and critically  analysed Lamartine&rsquo;s odes with the young ladies from the convent; how he would  have flattered the vanity of the bearded poet, and regretted the Bourbons with  the faded old dowagers. But he was away &mdash; gone out of her life, perhaps,  entirely. &ldquo;I shall never see him again,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that kind guardian in whose  care my father left me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day she went with her aunt to the Louvre  to see the improvements that had been made beneath the sway of that new ruler  who had already begun to change brick into marble, or at least into stucco. The  pictures only wearied her; the very colouring of the Rubenses seemed to have  lost half its glowing beauty since she had last seen them; and Marie De&rsquo;  Medici, florid and resplendent, bored her terribly. Many of the recent  acquisitions she thought overrated, and she hurried her aunt away from the  splendid exhibition before they had been there an hour. She made a few  purchases in the Rue de la Paix; and loitered for a little time at a milliner&rsquo;s  in the Rue de l&rsquo;Echelle, choosing a bonnet, and then declared herself  thoroughly tired out with the morning&rsquo;s exertions.</p>
<p>She threw herself back in the carriage, and was  very silent as they drove home; but suddenly, as they turned from the Rue de  Rivoli into the quadrangle of the Louvre, they passed close to a hackney-coach  in which a gentleman was seated, and Ellinor, starting up, cried out, &ldquo;It was  Mr. Margrave! Did you not see him, aunt? He has just this moment passed us in a  hackney-coach.&rdquo; She pulled the check-string violently as she spoke, and her  aunt&rsquo;s coachman stopped; but Horace Margrave was out of sight, and the vehicle  in which he was seated lost among the crowd of carriages of the same  description rattling up and down the bustling street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear,&rdquo; said Miss Beauchamp, as Ellinor  let down the carriage-window, and looked eagerly out; &ldquo;if you are not mistaken  in the face of the person who passed us, and it really is Horace Margrave, he  is sure to call upon us immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistaken in my guardian&rsquo;s face! No, indeed. But of  course he will call, as you say, aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he will call this evening, most likely. He  knows how seldom I go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that evening and all the next morning Mrs.  Dalton constantly expected to hear the lawyer&rsquo;s name announced; but he did not  come. &ldquo;He had important business to transact yesterday, perhaps,&rdquo; she thought;  &ldquo;and he may be employed this morning; but in the evening he is sure to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner she sat by the low wood fire in Miss  Beauchamp&rsquo;s drawing-room, turning over the leaves of a book which she had  vainly endeavoured to read, and looking every moment at the old buhl clock over  the chimney; but the evening slowly dragged itself through, and still no Horace  Margrave. She expected him on the following day, but again only to be  disappointed; and in this manner the week passed, without bringing any tidings  of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have left Paris!&rdquo;  she thought; &ldquo;left Paris,  without once calling here to see me. Nothing could better testify his  indifference,&rdquo; she added bitterly. &ldquo;It was no doubt only for my father&rsquo;s sake  that he ever pretended any interest in the friendless orphan girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following week, Ellinor went with her aunt once  or twice to the Opera, and to two or three <i>reunions</i> in the Faubourg, at which her handsome face and elegant manners made some  sensation; but still there were no tidings of Horace Margrave. &ldquo;If he had been  in Paris, we  should most likely have seen him at the Opera,&rdquo; thought Ellinor.</p>
<p>That week elapsed, and on the Sunday evening Mrs.  Dalton sat alone in her own room, writing letters to friends in England,  when she was interrupted by a summons from her aunt. Someone wanted her in the  drawing-room immediately.</p>
<p>Someone in the drawing-room who wanted to see her!  Could it be her guardian at last?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady or a gentleman?&rdquo; she asked of the servant  who brought her aunt&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady &mdash; a sister of charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried into the drawing-room, and found a  sister of charity in conversation with Miss Beauchamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Ellinor, this lady wishes you to accompany  her on a visit to a sick person; a person whom you know, but whose name she is  forbidden to reveal. What can this mystery mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sick person who wishes to see me?&rdquo; said Ellinor.  &ldquo;But I know so few people in Paris;  no one likely to send for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can trust me, madame,&rdquo; said the nun, &ldquo;and  if you will accompany me on my visit to this person, I believe your presence  will be of great service. The mind of the invalid is, <i>I</i> regret to say, in a very disturbed state, and you only, I  imagine, will be able, under Heaven and the Church, to give relief to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dalton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Ellinor&mdash;&rdquo; exclaimed her aunt anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can be of any service, my dear aunt, it would  be most cruel, most cowardly, to refuse to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear child, when you do not know the  person to whom you are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will trust this lady,&rdquo; answered Ellinor, &ldquo;and I  will go. &mdash; I will put on my bonnet and shawl, and join you, madame,&rdquo; she added  to the nun, as she hurried from the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When these girls once get married, there&rsquo;s no  managing them,&rdquo; murmured Miss Beauchamp, as she folded her thin white hands,  bedecked with old-fashioned rings, resignedly. &ldquo;Pray do not let them detain her  long,&rdquo; she continued aloud, to the sister of charity, who sat looking gravely  into the few embers in the little English grate. &ldquo;I shall suffer the most  excruciating anxiety till I see her safe home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be perfectly safe with me, madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, madame, I am quite at your service,&rdquo; said  Ellinor, re&euml;ntering the room.</p>
<p>In a few minutes they were seated in a  hackney-coach, and rattling through the quiet faubourg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going far?&rdquo; asked Ellinor of her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Meurice&rsquo;s Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Meurice&rsquo;s? Then the person I am going to see is  not a resident in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could it be? Not a resident in Paris. Someone from England,  no doubt. Her husband, or Horace Margrave?</p>
<p>These were the only two persons who presented  themselves to her mind; but in either case, why this mystery?</p>
<p>They reached the hotel, and the sister of charity  herself led the way upstairs into an enclosed hall on the third story, where  she stopped suddenly at the door of a small sitting-room, which she entered,  followed by Ellinor.</p>
<p>Two gentlemen, evidently medical men, stood talking  in whispers, in the embrasure of the window. One of them looked up as the two  women entered, and to him the nun said, &ldquo;Your patient, Monsieur Delville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is quieter, Sister Louise. The delirium has  subsided; he is now quite himself; but very much exhausted,&rdquo; replied the  physician. &ldquo;Is this the lady?&rdquo; he asked, looking at Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;will you favour me with  a few moments&rsquo; conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, monsieur. But first, let me implore  you, one word. This sick person, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, tell me his name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I cannot do, madame; his name is unknown to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the people in the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are also ignorant of it. His portmanteau has no  address. He came most probably on a flying visit; but he has been detained here  by a very alarming illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me see him, monsieur. I cannot endure  this suspense. I have reason to suppose that this gentleman is a friend who is  very dear to me. Let me see him, and then I shall know the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see him, madame, in ten minutes. &mdash;  Monsieur Vernot, will you prepare the patient for an interview with this lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second doctor bowed gravely, and withdrew into  an inner apartment, closing the door carefully behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Monsieur Delville, &ldquo;I was called in,  only three days ago, to see the person lying in the next room. My colleague had  been for some time attending him through a very difficult case of typhus fever.  A few days ago the case became still more complicated and difficult by an  affection of the brain which supervened, and Monsieur Vernot considered it his  duty to call in another physician. I was therefore summoned. I found the case,  as my colleague had found it, an exceptional one. There was not only physical  weakness to combat, but mental depression &mdash; mental depression of so marked a  character that both Monsieur Vernot and myself feared that, should we even  succeed in preserving the life of the patient, we might fail in saving his  reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful, how dreadful!&rdquo; murmured Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the three days and nights in which I have  attended him,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;we have not succeeded until this evening  in obtaining an interval of consciousness; but throughout the delirium our  patient has perpetually dwelt upon two or three subjects, which, though of a  different character, may be by some chain of circumstances connected into the  one source of his great mental wretchedness. Throughout his wanderings one name  has been incessantly upon his lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that name is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor Dalton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madame, your name, coupled with perpetual  entreaties for pardon; for forgiveness of a great wrong &mdash; a wrong done long  since, and artfully concealed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wrong done! If this gentleman is the person I  suspect him to be, he never was anything but the truest friend to me. But, for  pity&rsquo;s sake, let me see him. This suspense is unbearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, madame. I had some difficulty in  finding you; but mentioning everywhere the name of the lady of whom I was in  search, I fortunately happened to make the inquiry of a friend of Miss  Beauchamp. This good, devoted Sister Louise, here, was ready to set out  immediately on her errand of mercy, and I thought that you might feel, perhaps,  more confidence in her than in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the door of communication between  the two apartments was softly opened, and Monsieur Vernot returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have prepared the patient for your visit,  madame,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you must guard against a shock to your own feelings in  seeing him. He is very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In danger?&rdquo; asked Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappily, yes &mdash; in imminent danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the brief interview with the physician  Ellinor Dalton had said to herself,&mdash; &ldquo;Whatever it is that must be endured by me,  I will bear it bravely; for his sake I will bear it bravely.&rdquo; Her face was  white as death &mdash; the firm, thin lips rigidly locked over the closely-shut teeth  &mdash; the mournful gray eyes tearless and serene; but her heart beat so loudly,  that she seemed to hear its every pulsation in the stillness of the room.</p>
<p>Her worst presentiments were realised.</p>
<p>Horace Margrave lay with his head thrown back upon  the piled-up pillows, and his attenuated hand stretched listlessly upon the  dark silk counterpane. His head was bound with wet linen, over which his nurse  had tied a handkerchief of scarlet, whose vivid hue made his ashen face still  more ghastly. His dark eyes had lost the dreamy expression usual to them, and  had the feverish lustre of disease. They were fixed, with a wild haggard gaze,  upon the door through which Ellinor entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; he said, with an hysterical cry; &ldquo;at  last!&rdquo; Ellinor sank on her knees by his bedside, and said to him, very quietly,  &ldquo;Horace, what is this? Why do I find you thus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fixed his haggard eyes upon her, as he answered,  &ldquo;What is it, Ellinor! Shall I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; if you can tell me without unnerving  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unnerving myself!&rdquo; he cried, with a bitter laugh.  &ldquo;Unnerve myself &mdash; look at that!&rdquo; He stretched out one thin, semitransparent  hand, which trembled like an aspen-leaf, until he let it fall lifelessly upon  the quilt. &ldquo;For four years, Ellinor, I have been slowly burning out my life in  one long nervous fever. And you tell me not to unnerve myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a restless, impatient sigh, tossed his  weary head back upon the pillow, and turned his face to the wall.</p>
<p>Ellinor Dalton looked round the room in which this  all accomplished, admired, and prosperous Horace Margrave had lain for eleven  dreary days, eleven painful nights.</p>
<p>It was a small apartment, comfortably furnished,  and heated by a stove. On the table by the bedside a <i>Book of Hours</i> lay open, with a rosary thrown across the page where  the reader had left off. Near this was an English Testament, also lying open.  The nun who had been nursing Horace Margrave had procured this English Gospel,  in hopes that he would be induced to read it. But the sick man, when sensible,  spoke to her in French; and when she implored him to see a priest, refused,  with an impatient gesture, which he repeated when she spoke to him of a  Protestant clergyman, whom she knew, and could summon to him.</p>
<p>The dim lamp was shaded from the eyes of the  invalid by a white porcelain screen, which subdued the light, and cast great  shadows of the furniture upon the walls of the room.</p>
<p>He lay for some time quite still, with his face  averted; but by the incessant nervous motion of the hand lying upon the  counterpane, Mrs. Dalton knew that he was not asleep.</p>
<p>The doctor opened the door softly, and looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he says anything to you,&rdquo; he whispered to  Ellinor, &ldquo;hear it quietly; but do not ask him any questions; and, above all,  betray no agitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head in assent, and the physician  closed the door.</p>
<p>Suddenly Horace Margrave turned his face to her,  and, looking at her with earnest scrutinising eyes, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor Dalton, you ask me what this means. I will  tell you. The very day before you left England a strange chance led me  into the heart of a manufacturing town &mdash; a town which was being ravaged by  typhus fever; I was in a very weak state of health, and, as might be expected,  I caught this fever. I was warned, when it was perhaps not yet too late to have  taken precautions which might have saved me, but I would not take those  precautions. I was too great a coward to commit suicide. Some people say a man  is too brave to kill himself; I was not, but I was too much a coward. Life was  hateful, but I was afraid to die. Yet I would not avert a danger which had not  been my own seeking: let the fever kill me, if it would. Ellinor, my wish is  fast being accomplished. I am dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace, Horace!&rdquo; She took his wasted hand in hers,  and pressed it to her lips.</p>
<p>He drew it away as if he had been stung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Ellinor, no tenderness! That I  cannot bear. For four years you have never seen me without a mask. I am going  to let it fall. Henceforward you will only think of me with scorn and  detestation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scorn you, Horace &mdash; never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved his hand impatiently, as if to wave away  protestations that must soon be falsified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you do not know.&rdquo; Then, after a  brief pause, he continued, &ldquo;Ellinor, I have not been the kindest or the most  tender of guardians, have I, to my beautiful young ward? You reproached me with  my cold indifference one day soon after your marriage, in the little drawing-room  in Hertford-street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that. Yes, Ellinor. There are few words  spoken by your lips which I do not remember, together with the tone in which  they were spoken, and the place where I heard them. I say, I have not been a  kind or affectionate guardian &mdash; have I, Ellinor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were so once, Horace,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so once! When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before my uncle left me that wretched fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>That wretched fortune &mdash;  yes, <i>that</i> divided us at once and for  ever. Ellinor, there were two reasons for this pitiful comedy of coldness and  indifference. Can you guess one of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot? I affected an indifference I did not  feel, or pretended an apathy which was a lie from first to last, because I  loved you with the whole strength of my heart and soul, from the first to the  last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Horace, Horace, for pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; She stretched  out her hands imploringly, as if she would prevent the utterance of the words  which seemed to break her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor, when you were seventeen years of age, you  had no thought of succeeding to your uncle&rsquo;s property. It would have been, upon  the whole, a much more natural thing for him to have left it to his adopted  son, Henry Dalton. Your father fully expected that he would do so. I expected  the same. Your father intrusted me with the custody of your little income, and  I discharged my trust honestly. I was a great speculator; I dabbled with  thousands, and cast down heavy sums every day as a gambler throws down a card  upon the gaming-table; and to me your mother&rsquo;s little fortune was so  insignificant a trust that its management never gave me a moment&rsquo;s thought or  concern. At this time I was going on in a fair way to become a rich man &mdash; in  fact, was a rich man; and at this time I was an honourable man. I loved you &mdash;  loved you as I never believed I could love &mdash; my beautiful, innocent ward. How  could it well be otherwise? I am not a coxcomb, Ellinor, but I dared to say to  myself, &lsquo;I love, and am beloved again.&rsquo; Those dark-gray eyes had told me the  secret of a girl&rsquo;s confiding heart, and I thought myself more than happy, only  too deeply blest. O, my darling, my darling, if I had spoken then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dalton&rsquo;s face was buried in her hands as she  knelt by his pillow, and she was sobbing aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was time enough, I said. This, Ellinor, was  the happiest period of my life. Do you remember our quiet evenings in the Rue  St. Dominique, when I left business and business cares behind me in  Verulam-buildings, and ran over here to spend a week in my young ward&rsquo;s society?  Do you remember the books we read together? Good heavens, there is a page in  Lamartine&rsquo;s odes which I can see before me as I speak! I can see the lights and  shadows which I taught you to put under the cupola of a church in Munich which you once  painted in water-colours. I can recall every thought, every word, every  pleasure, and every emotion of that sweet and tranquil time in which I hoped  and believed that you, Ellinor, would be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her face, blotted by her tears, looked  at him for one brief instant, and then let her head fall again upon her clasped  hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle died, Ellinor, and this airy castle,  which I had reared with such confidence, was shattered to the ground. The  fortune was left to you on condition that you should marry Henry Dalton. Women  are ambitious. You would scarcely resign such a fortune. You would marry young Dalton. This was the  lawyer&rsquo;s answer to the all-important question. But those tender gray eyes,  looking up shyly from under their dark lashes, had told a sweet secret, and  perhaps your generous heart might count this fortune a small thing to cast away  for the sake of the man you loved. This was the lover&rsquo;s answer; and I hoped  still to win my darling. You were not to be made acquainted with the conditions  of your uncle&rsquo;s will until you attained your majority. You were, at the time of  his death, not quite twenty years of age; there was therefore an entire year in  which you would remain ignorant of the penalties attached to this unexpected  wealth. In the mean time I, as sole executor (your uncle, you see, trusted me  most entirely), had the custody of the funded property bequeathed to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you, Ellinor, that I was a speculator.  My profession threw me in the way of speculation. Confident in the power of my  own intellect, I staked my fortune on the wonderful hazards of the year &rsquo;46. I  doubled that fortune, trebled, quadrupled it, and, when it had grown to be four  times its original bulk, I staked it again. It was out of my hands, but it was  invested in, as I thought, so safe a speculation, that it was as secure as if  it had never been withdrawn from consols. The railway company of which I was a  director was one of the richest and most flourishing in England. My own fortune, as I have  told you, was entirely invested, and was doubling itself rapidly. As your  uncle&rsquo;s trustee, as your devoted friend, your interests were dearer to me than  my own.</p>
<p>Why should I not speculate with your fortune,  double it, and then say to you, &lsquo;See, Ellinor, here are two fortunes of which  you are the mistress; one you owe to Henry Dalton, under the conditions of your  uncle&rsquo;s will; the other is yours alone. You are rich. You are free, without any  sacrifice, to marry the man you love; and this is my work&rsquo;? This was what I  thought to have said to you at the close of the great year of speculation,  1846.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Horace, Horace, I see it all. Spare yourself,  spare me. Do not tell me any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare myself? No, Ellinor, not one pang; I deserve  to drain my bitter cup to the dregs. You were right in what you said in the  boudoir at Sir Lionel&rsquo;s. The money was not my own; no sophistry, no ingenious  twisting of facts and forcing of conclusions, could ever make it mine. How do I  know even now that your interest was really my only motive? How do I know that  it was not, indeed, the gambler&rsquo;s guilty madness which impelled me to my crime?  How do I know &mdash; how do I know? Enough, the crash came; my fortune and yours  were together ingulfed in that vast whirlpool; and I, the trusted friend of  your dead father, the conscientious lawyer, whose name had become a synonym for  honour and honesty &mdash; I, Horace Welmoden Margrave, only lineal descendant of the  royalist Captain Margrave, who perished at Worcester, fighting for his king and  the honour of his noble race &mdash; I knew myself to be a cheat and a swindler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Horace. You were only mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistaken, Ellinor! Yes, that is one of the words  invented by dishonest men to slur over their dishonesty. The fraudulent banker  whose ruin involves the ruin of thousands is, after all, his friends say, only  mistaken. The clerk who robs his employer in the insane hope of ultimately  restoring what he abstracts is, as his counsel pleads to soft-hearted jurymen  with sons of their own, only mistaken. The speculator who plays the great game  of commercial hazard with another man&rsquo;s money, he, too, dares to look at the  world with a piteous face, and cry, &lsquo;Alas, I was only mistaken!&rsquo; No, Ellinor, I  have never put in that plea. From the moment of that dreadful crash, which  changed hope to despair, and prosperity to desolation, I have at least tried to  look my fate in the face. But I have not borne all my own burdens, Ellinor. The  weight of my crime has fallen upon the shoulders of Henry Dalton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Dalton, my husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ellinor, your husband, Henry Dalton, the  truest and most generous of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You praise him so much,&rdquo; she said rather bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ellinor, I am weak enough and wicked enough  to feel a cruel pain in being compelled to do so; it is the one poor reparation  I can make him. God knows I have done him enough injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exertion of talking for so long a time had  completely exhausted the dying man, and he fell back, half fainting, upon the  pillows. The sister of charity, summoned from the next apartment by Ellinor,  gave him a restorative; and in low tremulous accents he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the moment of my ruin, Ellinor, I felt and  knew that you were lost to me. I could bear this; I did not think my life would  be a long one. <i>Vogue la gal&egrave;re!</i> Let  it go on its dark way to the end. I say I could bear this, but I could not bear  the thought of your contempt, your aversion; that punishment would have been  too bitter. I could not come to you, and say, &lsquo;I love you, I have always loved  you; I love you as I never before loved, as I never hoped to love again; but I  am a swindler and a cheat, and you can never be mine.&rsquo; No, Ellinor, I could not  do this; and the day of your majority was close at hand. Some step must be  taken, and the only thing that could save me from your contempt was the  generosity of Henry Dalton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had heard a great deal of your uncle&rsquo;s adopted  son, and I had met him very often at Arden;  I knew him to be as true-hearted a man as ever lived. I determined, therefore,  to throw myself upon his generosity, and to reveal all. &lsquo;He will despise me,  but I can bear his contempt better than the scorn of the woman I loved.&rsquo; I said  this to myself, and one night &mdash; the night after Henry Dalton had first seen  you, and had been already won by your grace and beauty &mdash; I took him to my chambers  in Verulam-buildings, and after binding him to secrecy, told him all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You now understand the cruel position in which  this young man was placed. The fortune, of which he was supposed to become  possessor on marrying you, was a thing of the past. You were penniless, except,  indeed, for the hundred a-year coming to you from your mother&rsquo;s property. His  solemn oath forbade him to reveal this to you; and for three years he endured  your contempt, and was silent. Judge now of the wrong I have done him. Judge  now the noble heart which you have tortured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Horace, Horace, what misery this money has  brought upon us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ellinor. What misery one deviation from the  straight road of honour has brought upon us! Ellinor, my dearest, my only  beloved, can you forgive the man who has so truly loved, yet so deeply injured  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her knees, and smoothing the ruffled  hair from his forehead with tender, pitying hands, looked him full in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when, long ago, you thought I  loved you, you read my heart aright; but the depth and truth of that love you  could never read. Now, now that I am the wife of another, another to whom I owe  so very much affection in reparation of the wrong I have done him, I dare tell  you without wrong to him, how much I loved you. And you ask me if I can  forgive! As freely as I would have resigned this money for your sake, can I  forgive you for the loss of it. This confession has set all right. I will be a  good wife to Henry Dalton, and you and he may be sincere friends yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Ellinor, do you think that, did I not know  myself to be dying, I could have made this confession? No, you see me now under  the influence of stimulants which give me a false strength; of excitement which  is strong enough to master even death. To-morrow night, Ellinor, the doctors  tell me, there will no longer be in this weary world a weak, vacillating,  dishonourable wretch called Horace Margrave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stretched out his attenuated hands, drew her  towards him, and imprinted one kiss upon her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first and the last, Ellinor,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; His face changed to a deadlier white, and he fell back, fainting.</p>
<p>The physician, peeping in at the half-open door,  beckoned to Ellinor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must leave him at once, my dear madame,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;Had I not seen the disturbed state of his mind, I should never have  permitted this interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O monsieur, tell me, can you save him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by a miracle, madame; a miracle far beyond  medical skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You yourself, then, have no hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no, madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head. The physician took her hand in  his and pressed it with a fatherly tenderness, looking at her earnestly and  mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for me to-morrow,&rdquo; she said imploringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send you tidings of his state. Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent her head once more, and, without another  word, hurried from the room.</p>
<p>The following morning, as she was seated in her own  apartment, she was once more summoned to the drawingroom.</p>
<p>The sister of charity was there, talking to her  aunt. They both looked grave and thoughtful, and glanced anxiously at Ellinor  as she entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is worse?&rdquo; said Ellinor to the sister, before a  word had been spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappily, yes. Madame, he is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, do not tell me any more! For pity&rsquo;s sake, for  pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>She walked to the window, and stood there, absent  and meditative, looking with tearless eyes into the street below, and out at  the cheerless gray of the autumn sky.</p>
<p>She was thinking how strange the world looked to  her now that Horace Margrave was dead.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>They buried Horace Margrave in the Cemetery of P&egrave;re la Chaise. There had been some  thoughts of conveying his ashes to his native country, that they might rest in  the parish church of Margrave, a little village in Westmoreland, the chancel of  which church was decorated with a recumbent statue of Algernon Margrave,  cavalier, who fell at Worcester fight; but as the deceased had no nearer  relations than a few second cousins in the army and the church, and a  superannuated admiral, his great-uncle, and as it was furthermore discovered  that the accomplished solicitor of Verulam-buildings, Gray&rsquo;s-Inn, had left not  a penny behind him, the idea was very quickly abandoned, and the last remains  of the admired Horace were left to decay in a foreign grave.</p>
<p>It was never fully known who caused the simple  monument which ultimately adorned his resting-place to be erected. It was a  plain block of marble; no pompous Latin epitaph, or long list of virtues, was  thereon engraved; but a half-burned torch, reversed, was sculptured at the  bottom of the tablet, and from the smoke of the expiring torch a butterfly  mounted upwards. Above this design were inscribed the name and age of the  deceased.</p>
<p>The night following the day of Horace Margrave&rsquo;s  funeral, Henry Dalton was seated, hard at work, at his chambers in the Temple.</p>
<p>The light of the office-lamp, falling upon his  quiet face, revealed a mournful and careworn expression not usual to him.</p>
<p>He looked ten years older since his marriage with  Ellinor.</p>
<p>He had fought the battle of life and lost, &mdash; lost  in that great battle which some hold so lightly, but which to others is an  earnest fight, &mdash; lost in the endeavour to win the wife he had so tenderly  loved.</p>
<p>He had now nothing left to him but his profession,  &mdash; no other ambition, no other hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will work hard,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that she, though  separated from me for ever, may still derive every joy of those poor joys which  money can buy, from my labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had heard nothing of Horace Margrave&rsquo;s journey  to Paris, his  illness, or his death. He had no hope of being released from the oath which  bound him to silence &mdash; to silence which he had sworn to preserve so long as  Horace Margrave lived.</p>
<p>Tired, but still persevering, and absorbed in a  difficult case which needed all his professional acumen, he read and wrote on,  until past eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Just as the clocks were chiming the half hour after  eleven, the bell of his outer door rang loudly, as if pulled by an agitated  hand.</p>
<p>His chambers were on the first floor; on the floor  below were those of a gentleman who always left at six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not expect anyone at such an hour; but it may  be for me,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>He heard his clerk open the door, and went on  writing without once lifting his head.</p>
<p>Three minutes afterwards, the door of his own  office opened, and a person entered unannounced. He looked up suddenly. A lady  dressed in mourning, with her face hidden by a thick veil, stood near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said with some surprise, &ldquo;may I ask&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The late visitor came hurriedly from the door by  which she stood, lifted her veil, and fell on her knees at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am in mourning for Horace Margrave, my  unhappy guardian. He died a week ago in Paris.  He told me all. Henry, my friend, my husband, my benefactor, can you forgive  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Dalton passed his hand rapidly across his  eyes, and turned his face away from her.</p>
<p>Presently he raised her in his arms, and drew her  to his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor,&rdquo; he cried in a broken voice, &ldquo;I have  suffered so long and so bitterly that I can scarcely bear this great emotion.  My dearest, my ever-beloved wife, are we indeed at last set free from the  miserable secret which has blighted our lives? Horace Margrave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is dead, Henry. I once loved him very dearly. I  freely forgave him the injury he did me. Tell me that you forgive him too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my inmost heart, Ellinor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><a name="MyFirstHappyChristmas"></a>My First Happy Christmas</h1>
<p>All the other boys at Dr. Martinet&rsquo;s, Market  Kagster, in the county of York, had friends and relations; all the other boys  went home for holidays; all the other boys had mothers, who came to see them,  and who cried when they had the measles, and brought them sponge-cakes and  oranges, and sent them great hampers, filled to bursting with plum-cakes,  almonds and raisins, pork-pies, hardbake, Stilton cheese, dry withered apples,  and lovely sleepy pears; all the other boys wrote ceremonious missives to their  &ldquo;honoured parents,&rdquo; on thick post-paper, documents which were called holiday  letters, but which looked like reprieves, or Chancery suits, or indictments for  high treason, or last wills and testaments, or something equally awful &mdash; all  the boys, except the two West-Indian pupils and myself. The two West-Indian  pupils never wrote to their parents, because their parents were in Demerara,  and I suppose the postage was too expensive; I never wrote to mine because they  were &mdash; </p>
<p>When I was a very, very little fellow, scarcely  able to remember anything, I remember being dressed in black. I remember being  taken into a churchyard, in some great city (a churchyard so choked with tombstones  that it seemed almost a wonder that they did not overflow the low walls, like a  stony spring-tide, and tumble into the street), by a lady, who was very young  and, I think, very pretty. I know I liked to look at her, because she was  bright and radiant, like some lovely picture, and always seemed as if she would  fade away. She, too, was dressed in black. I remember how she sat down by one  of the tombstones, and took me in her arms, and told me in a very low voice,  for she was crying all the while, that I could never have such friends in the  world as were lying buried here; that I could never know such love beneath  heaven as was hidden under this little spot of earth; and that if ever, when I  grew to be a man, I had any thought of doing a mean or a wicked action, I was  to come first to this spot, and read that which was written on this stone,  which I could not read now. This lady, I have learned since, was my aunt. Like  all the brightest things I have ever known in this world, she vanished from it  very soon after this, and I wore black clothes till I was seven years old; and  when I was seven years old, I was sent to Dr. Martinet&rsquo;s at Market Kagster, in  the East Riding of Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Looking back across the waste of many chequered  years, I have no fault to find with Dr. Martinet. We were, on the whole, very  happy at Market Kagster. We had a great deal of roast mutton; a great deal of  boiled mutton; a fair allowance of an innocuous beverage, which was supposed to  be milk-and-water; a great deal of <i>propria  qua, maribus</i>, &ldquo;Pinnock&rsquo;s Goldsmith,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enfield&rsquo;s  Speaker,&rdquo; haircutting, and church. Twice every Sunday did we march down the  centre aisle of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Market Kagster, and twice every Sunday did  we take notes of the vicar&rsquo;s or the curate&rsquo;s discourse, to be reproduced in our  own form, for our evening edification. It is my private opinion, that both the  vicar and the curate thoroughly detested us. Imagine four-and-thirty boys  glaring at you throughout your discourse, and four-and-thirty pencils scribbling  your words on scratchy paper, almost before they left your mouth. That&rsquo;s what  the vicar and the curate had to endure every Sunday from Dr. Martinet&rsquo;s pews.  On the whole, I say, I was not unhappy. During the half-year&rsquo;s lessons and the  half-year&rsquo;s exercises, the half-year&rsquo;s <i>propria  qua maribus</i> and &ldquo;Enfield&rsquo;s Speaker,&rdquo; bad marks and good marks, stolen  feasts in dimly-lighted dormitories, prisoner&rsquo;s base and fly-the-garter in the  great bare playground, I was tolerably happy. But Christmas, that Christmas to which  thirty-one out of four-and-thirty boys looked forward with such rapture &mdash; </p>
<p>Christmas, which, for those thirty-one young  persons, meant home, and love, and roast turkey, and unlimited wedges of rich  plum-pudding smothered with brandy-sauce, and inexhaustible brown-paper bags of  chestnuts, and piles of golden oranges, and bilious attacks, and kisses under  the mistletoe from pretty cousins, and blindman&rsquo;s buffs, and hunt the slippers,  and so many glorious things, which to myself and the two pupils from Demerara  were nothing but strange words &mdash; Christmas was for me a sad and a bitter time.  That genial and ancient allegorical person with rubicund face, snow-white,  holly-crowned head, and brave, good-natured smile, was to me an evil-minded  demon, who whispered, &ldquo;For you I am not what I am to other people; I never can  be the same to you that I am to other people; I come to you only to remind you  of the love that is for ever lost to you; of the home which you have never  known; of the dear little sisters and jovial young brothers you have, never  had; of the bright fireside by which you have never sat; the kind words you  have never heard; the motherly kisses that have never pressed your wretched  lips; the tender prayers that have never been whispered above your pillow.&rdquo; Is  it a wonder, then, that I hated Christmas? Is it a wonder that I hated the  dismal voices of the carol-singers, and the midnight music of the waits? Is it  a wonder that, when, at our breaking-up party, I intoxicated myself with sherry  negus, made of eighteenpenny Cape, I did not become joyous and good-humoured in  my cups, as the other boys, but was low-spirited and quarrelsome, and apt to  give offence to those young gentlemen who insisted upon telling me of the jolly  time they meant to have of it this Christmas? I noticed that they were always  going to have a jollier Christmas this Christmas than at any previous  Christmas; and that, when they returned to school, they used to have high words  as to which had most enjoyed himself during the vacation, and would even come  to blows on the subject of plum-pudding and mince-pies.</p>
<p>But away they went, away they went. Those who lived  in the town were fetched by elder sisters, or aunts or uncles, or fathers or  mothers; those who lived at a distance, had the best of it, perhaps, on this  occasion, for they went off by the mail-coach, Highflyer, that plied between  London and York, and departed from the academy with a flourish of the guard&rsquo;s  horn that went to the inmost hearts of the Demerara pupils and myself. Away they  went, and we three little shivering boys were left all alone in the long, bare  schoolroom; and we prowled about, told each other ghost-stories, till we dared  not let go of each other&rsquo;s jackets, in the snowy twilight; and scribbled on the  other boys&rsquo; books; and played dismal games, in which our footsteps echoed in  the empty room; and nibbled slate-pencil; and chewed the corners of copy-books;  and, above all, talked in whispers of what we would do when we grew to be men,  and to have wives and families of our own. We meant to keep a pretty tight hand  upon our wives and families, I assure you; and one of the pupils from Demerara  went so far as to hint that, if he found his future spouse at all contumacious,  he should have recourse to corporal punishment. But we didn&rsquo;t agree with him,  and he was obliged to withdraw his motion.</p>
<p>As a rule, our Christmas-days bore a dismal  likeness to each other, but there was one bright exception &mdash; one particular  Christmas-day I have a special reason for remembering. It was a fine, clear,  frosty day; such a Christmas-day as I don&rsquo;t remember of late years &mdash; a day  which seems to have gone out of fashion along with blue coats and brass  buttons, stagecoaches, watchmen, five-act comedies, and the agricultural  interest. A very cold day too, a not-to-be-trifled with, thoroughgoing December  day. The West-Indian pupils were as red about the tips of their noses as  West-Indian pickles of the Chili nature. We shivered all church-time in the  long, bare, empty pew, with the draught from the door cutting the figure of  eight between our poor little legs, and we alternately scratched and blew upon  the chilblains on our hands, except when the Doctor looked at us, when, by a  powerful effort of nature, we sat pretenaturally still, and tried to look as if  we defied the elements, and had never shivered in our lives. Now, opposite to  our pew was situated the pew of a retired naval officer called Bowster. I have  reason to believe that he was a half-pay lieutenant; but I know we all of ns  thought, at Dr. Martinet&rsquo;s, that he was an admiral at the very least, and we  considered even that title an insufficient reward for his distinguished  services. Drake, Nelson, and Bowster were all we knew of naval heroes; and  Bowster was our favourite of the three. If anybody had told us that he had not  been present at Trafalgar, or that Nelson could have won that victory without  him, or that every man could have done his duty and come up to the expectations  of England without him, I do not think that person&rsquo;s life would have been worth  much. We believed, I repeat, in Bowster; he was red, and stout, and jovial, and  had a wooden leg, and, except in church, never was seen without a telescope,  and displayed the Union Jack on a flagstaff at his country cottage three miles  out of Market Kagster. He swore considerably, and talked in a very loud, gruff  voice; and, moreover, had the reputation of being able to drink any man in the  East Biding under the table, and get up sober himself; so he entirely came up  to our ideal of the naval commander, and we worshipped him accordingly. Now, I  remarked that on this particular Christmas-day, Admiral (I shall take the  liberty of giving him the title which I then thought belonged to him) &mdash; Admiral  Bowster stared, during the best part of the service, his very hardest &mdash; and he  was by nature a hard starer &mdash; at myself and the West-Indian pupils; and once,  when the church was coldest, and the wind was cutting the figure of eight most  ferociously in and out between our legs, he (Bowster), in the very middle of  the vicar&rsquo;s sermon, winked deliberately at us three boys. Nobody but a man who  had fought hand-to-hand with six Frenchmen at a time, and who had seconded  Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar, could have done such a thing. My admiring  consternation put me into quite a glow of heat, and my chilblains were easier  for the rest of the sermon. But this was nothing. Picture my astonishment, and  the astonishment of the two pupils from Demerara, when, as we were leaving the  churchyard, the great Bowster, after exchanging the compliments of the season  with our respected preceptor, suddenly exclaimed, in his most stentorian voice,  &ldquo;Should you have any particular objection, Doctor, to my taking those three  young ones home with me?&rdquo; We were three young ones, but he could not mean us;  it was something too deliriously delightful to be believed at the first gasp.  We all three held our breaths. &ldquo;These boys?&rdquo; said the Doctor interrogatively.  &ldquo;These boys, sir,&rdquo; replied Bowster affirmatively, giving me such a slap upon  the shoulder that I can recall the tingle of it at this moment. &ldquo;These boys,  Doctor. My trap&rsquo;s waiting for me; I&rsquo;ll drive them over to my little box, give  them their Christmas dinner, and send Jack Longshore home with them before ten  to-night. Say yes, if the youngsters would like to go.&rdquo; <i>If the</i> youngsters would like to go? We were all three crimson with  suppressed delight and suspense. It couldn&rsquo;t be true, even now. Dine with  Bowster! Spend Christmas-day with Bowster! No, no; it was too wild a dream. The  Doctor said he had no objection. No objection, indeed! no objection to saving  three plates of beef, and three wedges of plum-pudding, and three half-pints of  the most diminutive beer, by the transaction! I should rather think not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in then, boys,&rdquo; said the noble Bowster, &ldquo;and  I&rsquo;ll drive you home at such a rate, that you won&rsquo;t know whether the wind&rsquo;s hot  or cold. Jump in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were at the gate of the churchyard, and  everybody was coming out of church, but we set up such a shout of delight as  our feeble lungs would allow us, as that most glorious of naval commanders  hoisted us into his old rumbling four-wheeled chaise, and with one smack of his  whip, and one jerk of the reins, started his fat brown waddling pony into a  rapid trot. It was as much as we could do to lift our caps to the Doctor,  standing at the churchyard gates, before we were far away on the white country  road, flying past the glittering, icicle-fringed hedges, and nodding to the  red-faced farmers and fat farmers&rsquo; wives driving past us in market-carts,  crowded with rosy children, going to spend Christmas-day in the town. Before we  were fully alive to the wild rapture of the ride, the ride was over, and we  were there. There, at the pretty cottage, with the old-fashioned bow-windows  and deep window-seats, the bright-red curtains, and curions cabinets, crowded  with South-Sea shells and ocean wonders, stuffed tropical birds and curious  seaweeds, Indian china and Chinese ivory boxes, which nobody ever opened, nor  which, anybody opening could ever shut. The dear pretty cottage, with the  stuffed crocodile in the hall, shot by the gallant Bowster ever so far beyond  the second cataract of the Nile; the oil-painting of Bowster and Mrs. Bowster &mdash;  dead and gone, poor thing, for many a year, as the noble commander told us;  the pretty drawing-room, and the snug dining-room, the table glistening with  diamond-cut glass and old-fashioned silver; and, above all, Bowster himself,  radiant and red, and loud and hearty, stumping here and there with his honoured  wooden leg, and telling his pretty niece how his heart had been moved by our  red noses and chilly looks in the parish church, and how it had suddenly  occurred to him in the middle of the sermon, to take us home with him to  dinner; &ldquo;And that was when I winked at you, boys; that was the reason I winked  at you,&rdquo; the jolly old seaman roared out, as he told his pretty niece and  housekeeper (she was very proud of being his housekeeper) to take care of us,  while he went to see about the wine.</p>
<p>The last time I was in Market Kagster, I went to  look for this dear old cottage, but, alas, it was no more; they were building a  great grim Elizabethan workhouse on the site of the old thatched-roofed,  gabled, rambling, tumble-down hospitable place; and all I could learn of  Admiral Bowster was from a certain stone record in the parish church, set up by  his grateful, affectionate, and sorrowful niece.</p>
<p>But, as I tell you of these things, they come back  to me, and I am a boy in a jacket again; and here is dear old Bowster coming  back to the dining-room, with a bottle in each hand, and another bottle under  each arm, and a corkscrew in his mouth. He took the corkscrew out of his mouth,  and set to work to use that instrument with a will. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, as he drew  cork number one, &ldquo;is Madeira, boys; and Madeira&rsquo;s a very good thing in its way,  especially when it has made the distance between England and Calcutta three  times, as this Madeira has, boys; and this, boys, is Port,&rdquo; he continued,  drawing cork number two; &ldquo;and Port is no such bad stuff, either, when it&rsquo;s  Comet Port of the year 18 &mdash; , and has been bought at the sale of a marquis&rsquo;s  cellar; and this, boys,&rdquo; he added, going on to number three, &ldquo;is French brandy,  as mild as milk, and as pale as East-Indian ale; and number four, boys, is  Schiedam; and that&rsquo;s all, boys, and you shall taste them everyone (to say  nothing of the rum-punch my little girl here shall help me to brew by and by)  before you go home to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We drew our breath again; we had heard of that  wonderful kingdom in which sucking-pigs run about ready roasted, with knives  and forks stuck into their cracklings, but we thought that Admiral Bowster&rsquo;s  cottage rather surpassed it, if anything. And O, the dinner, such a dinner, and  such a long dinner! Only the admiral and his pretty niece, with a very young  lieutenant, who sat next to her, and had so much to say to her that he didn&rsquo;t  care a bit, foolish fellow, for all the good things smoking before him; only, I  say, the admiral, his niece, the young lieutenant, an old navy surgeon, from Market  Kagster, and we three boys. Such a dinner! Boast beef &mdash; so big a sirloin, that  I could not see the admiral sitting behind it, but only heard his voice across  it, gruff and loud, making the very bunches of horse-radish shiver with its  manly thunder. Boast beef, and boiled turkey with oyster-sauce, and tongue, and  a monster plum-pudding all ablaze with burnt brandy, and a great dish of  mince-pies, ablaze with more brandy, so that the second course looked like the  opening scene in a pantomime, all blue fire and forked flame. And there sat the  dear old admiral piling up our plates with first beef, and then turkey,  plum-pudding on the top of mince-pies, and mince-pies on a stratum of  plum-pudding, and never desisting till we cried out that we had been helped  twice to everything, and had unfastened the last button of our waistcoats.</p>
<p>O, such a dinner! We drank Madeira as quite a  common beverage before we had done, and every time we drank the admiral&rsquo;s  health, we cried, &ldquo;Hip, hip, hurrah!&rdquo; till we made the plates and dishes rattle  again. I know the navy surgeon once ventured to suggest that Madeira was rather  a trying beverage for schoolboys; but dear old Bowster put him down by asking  him whether <i>he</i> disliked Madeira when <i>he</i> was a schoolboy, which retort we thought  the very highest order of wit, and applauded till we shook the table, while the  admiral went to get another bottle. Good gracious me! we were generally such  shy boys, that to say good-day to us was to inflict upon us the greatest moral  torture, if you expected us to bid you good-morning in return; but under the  influence of Bowster, and Bowster&rsquo;s Madeira, and Bowster&rsquo;s plum-pudding and  burnt brandy, we became three lions; and we told the company over dessert (as  well as we could, with our mouths alternately filled with chestnuts, figs,  almonds and raisins, macaroons and oranges) our opinion of Dr. Martinet, and  the Latin grammar, and the Martinet mutton, and the great quantity of fat we  had to eat, counterbalanced by a minimum of lean; and we expounded our views of  life in general, and how we meant to be sailors every one of us; and I know I  informed the admiral kindly, that when I had a ship &mdash; which of course I should  a year or so after entering the navy &mdash; I should call it the Bowster, or the  Gallant Bowster. And this simple, honest hero-worship, offered from a  schoolboy&rsquo;s happy heart, so gratified the hearty seaman, that he tapped a  special bottle of the dead-and-gone Marquis of Something&rsquo;s port, that we might  christen his majesty&rsquo;s ship, the Gallant Bowster, with all the honours. It was  at this stage of the entertainment I began to experience so peculiar a  sensation, that I find some little difficulty, at this distance of time, in  describing it correctly. In the first place, my ideas of time and space were  entirely overthrown, and I had great difficulty in making myself quite clear as  to whether to-day was yesterday or to-morrow. Then Bowster &mdash; goodness me! how  wavy and fluctuating Bowster became in his personal appearance! One moment  Bowster would recede from me and from his own mahogany at so rapid a rate, that  when I looked at him, I saw him glaring dimly at me from the farthest end of a  lane of decanters and black bottles half a mile long. This was rather  bewildering; but this was nothing to Bowster, when instead of receding he  advanced upon me with a frightful velocity, like a jovial red railway engine,  bearing down upon me at the rate of sixty miles an hour. And then the  West-Indian pupils! If they would have appeared the same number for two consecutive  minutes, I would have forgiven them; but they wouldn&rsquo;t. One minute there they  were, serene and smiling, rather pale, but very happy, and only their normal  number, two; the next time I looked their way there were four of them at the  least; and three minutes afterwards, these dreadful boys swelled, dilated, and  multiplied in such a manner, that I found myself face to face with a  closely-packed regiment of yellow-faced and frizzy-haired natives of the island  of Demerara, formed in square. I think we went into the drawing-room; and I  know that, in crossing the hall, somebody, whose name I forget, fell into a  scuttle of coals; and, strange to say, my shins were sore all the evening; and  then the admiral&rsquo;s niece sang us a song, such a sweet pretty song, about love,  and truth, and fidelity, which the young lieutenant said was the sweetest song  that was ever written; but as she sang, it all of a sudden changed into the  &ldquo;Bay of Biscay,&rdquo; and there was the dear old admiral leading the chorus, and we  singing at the top of our treble voices, how &ldquo;she lay, all the day, in the  bay-ee o-of Bi-iscay, O!&rdquo; O dear, happy, never-to-be-forgotten Christmas! How  many changes and chances have I experienced since that departed time! How many  a sad December, how many a bitter grief, to take the brightness out of the  glistening holly, and the sweetness out of the rich plum-pudding; to make  turkey an abomination, and all the genial, festive sounds so many strokes upon  a funeral bell! How many a cruel shock to change the face of that joyous time  into a pale and saddened mourning visage, awful to look upon, and far too  terrible to recall! But never, while I live, shall I forget that 25th of  December, and that glorious old Bowster roaring out the brave seafaring ditty,  in his great, honest, bass voice, never more to be heard beneath the stars.</p>
<p>But before he had done singing the &ldquo;Bay of Biscay,&rdquo; we were far away on the dark, starless,  snowy country road. How we came there I have never to this day discovered; but  there we were, huddled close together, and wrapped in one of the admiral&rsquo;s  greatcoats, and driven in the four-wheel chaise by the admiral&rsquo;s confidential  man, Jack Longshore. Mr. Longshore did not say a word to us; and though I sadly  wanted to talk to him, and tell him all about his majesty&rsquo;s ship the Gallant  Bowster, somehow the words dried up, as it were, and stuck to my lips, and I  couldn&rsquo;t tell him anything: and after riding for a space of time, which seemed  to me something between a century and a century and a half, Longshore pulled up  with a sudden jerk, and told me to get out.</p>
<p>He told me to get out. He told me distinctly, this  John Longshore, to get out. But, as I remonstrated with him, this was not Dr.  Martinet&rsquo;s, and not only was it not Dr. Martinet&rsquo;s, but it was the churchyard of  St. Mary&rsquo;s, Market Kagster, and, as I told Longshore, I did not live in the  churchyard, and I did not wish to live in the churchyard. Longshore only said  again, &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; and though I did not mean to comply with so absurd a request,  somehow, in utter despite of myself, I did get out, and stood shivering just  inside the gate of the churchyard, while Longshore and the two West-Indian  pupils drove off in a flame of fire, and I for the first time noticed that  instead of the fat brown pony, Longshore was driving the stuffed crocodile out  of Bowster&rsquo;s hall. They were all gone, and I was alone &mdash; alone among the oozy,  wet, green, moss-grown, slimy tombstones; not a star in the sky above my head,  not the twinkle of a light from the distant High-street of Market Kagster, not  the sound of a human voice or the echo of a human footfall to be heard in the  still winter&rsquo;s night. I heard nothing but my own breathing, and the crisp  crunch of my own feet on the new-fallen snow. I was only thirteen years of age,  I was of a nervous temperament, and knew more ghost-stories than any other boy  in the school, so I was rather frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re come back at last,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I turned round and looked at him. He was a goblin &mdash;  rather a good-tempered, easy-going-looking goblin, and he was sitting on the  top of a tombstone, with a spade in his hand, and his legs crossed one over the  other. I know I wondered how he balanced himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, sir?&rdquo; I said; for I didn&rsquo;t quite catch  his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back. Yes, to be sure. Do you think we&rsquo;re  going to put up with this sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew he was a goblin, because he was not opaque  like the general run of people; he was so transparent in fact, that I read  &ldquo;Sacred to the memory&rdquo; through the calf of his leg as he talked to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can afford to have our  boys&rdquo; &mdash; he said most distinctly <i>our</i> boys&mdash; &ldquo;gadding about in this sort of way, and over-eating themselves at old  Crowsters&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, Bowster&rsquo;s,&rdquo; I  remonstrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, very well,&rdquo; he said rather snappishly;  &ldquo;Bowsters or Crowsters is all one to me; but what I say is this: we can&rsquo;t have  our graves empty in this manner; and we can&rsquo;t have boys that have been buried  on our property gadding about like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried on your property!&rdquo; I ventured to exclaim. &ldquo;I  beg your pardon, sir, but I&rsquo;ve never been buried, because&rdquo; &mdash; I hesitated for a  good reason&mdash; &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goblin gravedigger burst into a goblin laugh,  such a tremendous laugh it was, though he was a little man, that all the urns  and funeral decorations in the churchyard danced and rattled to its thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dead! That is a good one. Not dead! Why, don&rsquo;t  you remember dying of the measles in &mdash; let me see, what year did you die &mdash; I  think it was 1803? Yes, it was 1803. Don&rsquo;t you remember dying of the measles,  and coming here to be buried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him that I couldn&rsquo;t say that I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a very short memory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and so have  many of our tenants. Why, I assure you, we&rsquo;d an old gentleman buried here a  month ago, who was always out, and we only enticed him back by showing him his  beautiful new tombstone with a Latin epitaph. But my time is precious,&rdquo; this  goblin gravedigger added, &ldquo;so tumble in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I looked down in the direction to which the  goblin gravedigger looked, and, looking so, looked straight into a deep grave,  so deep that I could no more see the bottom of it than I could see through to  the antipodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tumble in,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your number,  forty-seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think I remonstrated; at least, I know I wanted  to remonstrate &mdash; but I had a peculiar sensation, which I can only compare to  the Highflyer mail-coach, outside and inside passengers, coachman and guard,  and four horses &mdash; to say nothing of luggage &mdash; all lying on my chest, and the  outside passengers seemed to be rising in my throat, and I couldn&rsquo;t speak a  word. So I tumbled in, tumbled into forty-seven. Into forty-seven! Into  forty-seven millions of square miles of nothing. Into forty-seven trackless  realms of space did I, boarder and pupil at Dr. Martinet&rsquo;s, Market Kagster, fall,  on falling into number forty-seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little salts and senna, and he&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo;  said a voice at the bottom of number forty-seven. It was the voice of Martha  Morris, the young person who looked after our linen, mended our socks, and  washed our heads at Dr. Martinet&rsquo;s academy.</p>
<p>I was in bed, in the eight-bedded room, and it was  tomorrow morning; and I&rsquo;d never been to St. Mary&rsquo;s churchyard at all; and I had  been brought home by John Longshore, fast asleep, and safe and sound, but  rather the worse for Madeira, port, and  rum-punch. But a dose of salts and senna made me all right again, and the  admiral promised the Doctor that he would be more cautious another time. And as  long as I stayed at Market Kagster, which was for five more years, I spent my  Christmas-day at the dear old hospitable cottage, and ate my Christmas dinner  off Admiral Bowsters groaning mahogany.</p>

  Picture-dealing</h2>
<p>It was a broiling day in August. The sun, blazing  in his full summer splendour from early morning until three o&rsquo;clock in the  afternoon, had baked the flags of every street and alley, every square and  highway, of the great metropolis; until weary foot-passengers well-nigh  suffered the tortures of those martyrs of old who walked over red-hot  ploughshares, without any hope of the same crown of martyrdom.</p>
<p>Far away, along the English coast, white cliffs  glistened beneath the purple canopy of cloudless sky, and wavelets, bluer than  the heaven above them, broke into silver fringe upon the yellow sands. Behind  that natural rampart of white cliffs, great fields of waving corn grew riper in  the sunshine, till every heavy ear of feathery oats and bearded barley changed  to gold.</p>
<p>Who would have stayed in London at such a time as this, unless held  prisoner by the iron hand of circumstance? Who would have stayed in this great  prison-house of brick and stone, while far away, in sheltered bays, pleasant  cottages were waiting to be let to any traveller who cared to live in them &mdash;  and pay for them? Who would have been so mad as to linger in those stony  streets, in which stale wall-fruit, piled upon the stalls, and flavoured with  tobacco-smoke from the short clay pipes of Hibernian purveyors, was the only  evidence of summer; when the same fruit, in pleasant gardens far away, mingled  its luscious fragrance with the breath of myriad flowers, and waited till  someone should have time to gather it?</p>
<p>Who would stop in London, where all the glorious expanse of sky  was contracted to a narrow strip of blue, seen, by such passengers as looked  high enough, between two rows of dingy houses? Who would stop in London, where  the sweet air of summer-time, scented far away by a hundred perfumes, was  tainted by the odours of stale fish and fading vegetables, hot roasted meats  exposed in cook-shop windows, bone-burning factories, gas-works, soap-boiling,  and asphalte &mdash; where in close courts and alleys the demon Cholera was a  palpable presence, a hideous, vaporous shape, creeping to and fro in the  stifling atmosphere?</p>
<p>Who would stop in London, when every ripple of the purple sea  seemed a new note of music echoing in the balmy air &mdash; when the white sails of  distant boats, transformed to silver in the glory of the sun, invited roving  spirits to explore the trembling pathways traced by golden light upon the restless  bosom of the sea? Who would linger inland at a time like this, when drowsy  Londoners, released from toil, were dozing behind the shelter of their  newspapers upon the glistening beach of every watering-place in England &mdash; when  children were wading knee-deep in the plashing water, and merry-hearted girls,  sporting like children with the capricious waves, only less fickle and  inconstant than their sweet coquettish selves? Who would stop in London when express-trains  were starting from every terminus at every hour of the day, and rushing, like  winged demons, through the land, and making flight of distances that to our  grandfathers, cramped and stifled in the interior of a blundering stage-coach,  would have been the toil of half a week? Who would stop in London in this sunny  August season, when the cholera is rife, and dismal stories of sudden sickness  and death are heard at every street-corner by those who care to stop and listen  to the ghastly tidings; and grim placards on the walls warn hapless citizens  that the dreaded small-pox is a guest among them, rubbing shoulders with them  in every street? Who would stop in London  &mdash; <i>except the poor?</i> The poor who have  no money to pay express fares or expensive lodgings, luxuriously furnished, and  let for weekly rents that sound fabulous to those who find it hard work to pay  eighteenpence a-week for a garret in a blind alley. The poor, who, having drawn  blanks in the great lottery of life, must be content to huddle together and  hide themselves in narrow courts and squalid places, where the hideous aspects  of poverty are not likely to offend the gaze of well-bred citizens.</p>
<p>Who but the poor would care to stop in this vast  labyrinth of brick, amid this seething mass of struggling humanity, made almost  inhuman by the fury of the perpetual struggle &mdash; the eternal and unchanging  struggle for that which decent people&rsquo;s children hold it a punishment to be fed  upon &mdash; BREAD?</p>
<p>Amidst the many wrestlers for this pitiful prize,  amidst the many luckless wretches who fight for bread as richer men strive for  titles and lands, honour and renown, a king&rsquo;s favour or a nation&rsquo;s admiration &mdash;  amidst the numberless of earth&rsquo;s creatures disputing with each other for the  mere privilege of a joyless life &mdash; a young man, carrying something wrapped in  green baize under his arm, tramped through the streets of London upon this  sunny August afternoon.</p>
<p>He was handsome, nor could his shabby clothes &mdash; and  they were very shabby &mdash; entirely disguise the air of high blood and good  breeding which pervaded his appearance.</p>
<p>But there was something in that pale olive face,  there was something in the sombre depths of those dark-gray eyes, which was not  pleasant to see.</p>
<p>That something was despair.</p>
<p>Despair was stamped as plainly on the man&rsquo;s face as  if the letters that make up the word had been branded upon his forehead by a  red-hot iron.</p>
<p>Defiance and despair had struggled  for the mastery in this man&rsquo;s breast. He had tried to defy the world, but the  world had been too much for him. It had denied him bread. It had starved him,  but it had not humiliated him. He held his head high still. If he <i>could</i> have become a cheat, a thief, a  scoundrel, trading in some unholy merchandise for the sake of bread, the world  would have starved him into crime. But he had been stronger than the world so  far, and had not yet hearkened to the tempter; though Heaven knows he never  passed a jeweller&rsquo;s shop, he never saw the flash and scintillation of precious  gems glittering in the sunlight, without hearing a diabolical voice, louder  than the loudest traffic in the crowded street, crying in his ear, &ldquo;These would  buy bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that it was for himself  alone this strong man wanted to get bread. He was a great deal too reckless and  indifferent to have tramped hither and thither on the burning flagstones of the  City for <i>that!</i> For himself, he was  well-nigh tired of existence, and he would have been content to lie down in any  corner of the world in which he had been so badly treated, and die; or he would  have taken the Queen&rsquo;s shilling and gone away, anywhere, to be killed in her  Majesty&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>For himself he was utterly reckless; but there was  one at home, waiting for him: a little child of three years old, who for days  and weeks past had been living face to face with the gaunt shadow of want, the  horrible spectre of swiftly-approaching starvation.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s name, or the name by which he was known  to those amongst whom he had lived for the last few years, was Gervoise  Gilbert. He was an artist, and the something which he carried under his arm was  a picture, painted so lately that the varnish upon it was scarcely dry.</p>
<p>He had been wandering about since early morning,  trying to sell this picture, and he had walked more miles than he had cared to  count, going from shop to shop in hopes of finding a customer. He had applied  to furniture-brokers and picture-dealers, to merchants, who dealt in all manner  of old curiosities, and who had dingy, smoky-looking paintings in their  windows, for which they demanded fabulous sums; but nobody would have anything  to say to his picture, a simple careless sketch of a child sitting amongst the  long grass of a meadow, with its lap full of daisies.</p>
<p>The young man called his picture the &ldquo;Daisy-chain,&rdquo;  and the face of the child was a portrait of his own son; the little boy who was  waiting for the food his father hoped to carry him &mdash; the child who was  suffering the agony of hunger while the father was toiling backwards and  forwards in those cruel streets.</p>
<p>At last, when the man had walked so far that he  felt he must soon yield to sheer fatigue and crawl back to his wretched home  empty-handed, succour came.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert had wandered into a quiet street,  where the shops were small, but tolerably prosperous-looking. He walked slowly,  looking right and left as he went, but he saw no shop at which he could venture  to offer his picture for sale.</p>
<p>No, there were no brokers or picture-dealers in  that quiet street, and the young man was going to leave it, when the sight of  three golden balls, the sign by which poverty recognises its last friend, the  pawnbroker, attracted his weary glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last hope,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Some  pawnbrokers refuse to take pictures such as mine; but this man may be better  than the rest. I&rsquo;ll try him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shop was dark and dingy-looking, and the name  of J. Moulem was painted above the door.</p>
<p>Mr. Moulem made some faint pretence of being a  jeweller, and exhibited half a dozen fat silver watches, a child&rsquo;s coral, two  or three pairs of earrings, a set of shirt-studs, and a plated teapot in his window;  but the greater part of the same window was devoted to the display of  second-hand wearing apparel, sundry remnants of silk and velvet, a violin and  flageolet, a rickety old guitar, innocent of any pretence to strings, and a few  pictures.</p>
<p>The young painter looked rather hopefully at these  pictures; they were a great deal worse than that which he carried under his  arm; but then, on the other hand, they boasted gaudy, tarnished frames, and  were on that account more saleable.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert opened the door, and went into the  shop, which was a perfect grove of faded garments, hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Mr. Moulem emerged from his little den, or parlour,  behind the shop, with his mouth full of bread-and-butter, and a shrimp between  his fingers. It was half-past five o&rsquo;clock, and the pawnbroker had just seated  himself at the family tea-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if, take it when he may, or how he  can, a man never is to have his tea in peace,&rdquo; Mr. Moulem grumbled as he came  out of the parlour. &ldquo;Now then, young man, what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this with as injured a tone as if Gervoise  Gilbert had been worrying him throughout that day; whereas the artist had never  set eyes upon Mr. Moulem before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then?&rdquo; repeated the pawnbroker; &ldquo;what is it?  Is it flat-irons? It a&rsquo;most always <i>is</i> when I&rsquo;m fetched away from my cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert stated his business and uncovered  his picture, but the pawnbroker shook his head before the artist could remove  the baize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a bit of good showin&rsquo; it to me,&rdquo; he said  decisively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got too much of that sort of stuff a&rsquo;ready, my winder&rsquo;s  cluttered up with pictur&rsquo;s; you might have seen &rsquo;em if you&rsquo;d looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>I did see them,&rdquo; the young  man answered faintly &mdash; he was almost too much exhausted to speak above his  breath. &ldquo;I did see them, and I thought, as you seem to sell pictures, you  might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I seem to sell &rsquo;em?&rdquo; cried the pawnbroker  contemptuously; &ldquo;as I seem to <i>don&rsquo;t</i> sell &rsquo;em, you might say. If I could sell them pictur&rsquo;s should I have &rsquo;em in my  winder, I should like to know; and I <i>have</i> had &rsquo;em in my winder till they&rsquo;re that spoiled by the flies as you wouldn&rsquo;t  know the landscapes from the figures; and <i>still</i> nobody won&rsquo;t buy &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert was too tired to remonstrate; he  turned despondently away, with his unlucky picture under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could break stones upon the highway,&rdquo; he  muttered, &ldquo;I might earn sixpence a-day. But I&rsquo;m only an artist, and I can&rsquo;t  earn a halfpenny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was on the threshold of the shop-door, when a  cheerful sounding, pleasant voice behind him said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have a look at the picture, father. The  poor young man seems awful tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The artist turned quickly at this welcome sound &mdash;  it was the sound of a woman&rsquo;s voice pleading for him, the first token of pity  which he had received that day from any living creature.</p>
<p>The speaker was Mr. Moulem&rsquo;s eldest daughter, a  plump little woman nursing a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you women,&rdquo; said the pawnbroker;  &ldquo;you want me to take this here pictur&rsquo; because a man looks tired, and that  there gownd because a woman looks hungry, and to make a hunconscionable advance  upon a flat-iron if a child looks as if she&rsquo;d been cryin&rsquo;! A nice way <i>you&rsquo;d</i> carry on business if you was left  to yourself, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the picture, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Moulem didn&rsquo;t say he would; but then, on the  other hand, he didn&rsquo;t say he wouldn&rsquo;t; and Gervoise Gilbert had uncovered the  picture once more while the pawnbroker was hesitating.</p>
<p>The young woman with the baby was enraptured with  the simple sketch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;not a bit like  them nasty dingy things in the window, father. I don&rsquo;t wonder you can&rsquo;t sell <i>them;</i> but I&rsquo;m sure you could sell this,  and if you couldn&rsquo;t I should like it for our parlour, that I should, father.  What a dear, sweet little fellow!&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;I never see such a pretty child;  smilin&rsquo;, too, bless his little heart, just like life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d need to smile in the picture, poor child!&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>Something in his tone made the woman look up to  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t often smile out of it. He&rsquo;s  starving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starving! That sweet child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It isn&rsquo;t an uncommon fate. This is a great  city, and we are all too busy to think of our neighbours. So nobody takes much  notice of the women and children, ay, and the strong men too, who die of  starvation. I&rsquo;ve been from one end of London  to the other to-day to try and get five shillings for that picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, father,&rdquo; cried the young woman, &ldquo;you hear  that; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d give ten shillings for the picture &mdash; you&rsquo;ll get fifteen  for it any day, or five-and-twenty if you was to put it in a frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Moulem shrugged his shoulders, and looked at  his daughter with an expression of unmitigated contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you <i>are</i> a nice one for the business, Rachel,&rdquo; he said.&mdash; &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll  do with you, young man,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the pictur&rsquo;, and I don&rsquo;t  believe I shall sell it &mdash; for as to my daughter here, she&rsquo;s a good-hearted  young woman, but she knows no more about a pawnbroker&rsquo;s business, no, nor about  his losses, neither, than the baby at her breast; but I&rsquo;ll give you a crown for  it &mdash; yes or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, then,&rdquo; cried Gervoise Gilbert; &ldquo;the picture&rsquo;s  worth twenty times that money; but if it was my life&rsquo;s blood I think I should  sell it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up the crown which the pawnbroker had  selected from the till, and was hurrying from the shop, when he stopped  suddenly, took off his hat, and bowed to Mr. Moulem&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you and reward you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;for the first pitiful words I&rsquo;ve heard this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment he was gone, and the door had  closed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless us and save us!&rdquo; exclaimed the pawnbroker,  &ldquo;if that gentleman isn&rsquo;t cracked, there ain&rsquo;t no lunatics in Bedlam! He&rsquo;s mad  as a March hare, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>No, father,&rdquo; the young  woman answered gently; &ldquo;not mad &mdash; he&rsquo;s only very miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Gin"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  Gin</h2>
<p>The street in which Mr. Moulem the pawnbroker lived  was a shabby street, but when compared with the sordid alley to which Gervoise  Gilbert bent his steps, it was splendid as one of the noblest thoroughfares in Belgravia.</p>
<p>Here, in this dismal alley, poverty and crime, vice  and innocence, rubbed shoulders. The poor cannot choose their companions, and  destitution makes one common bond, which unites creatures so dissimilar in  every other respect that they might almost be the inhabitants of different  planets. The alley was in the heart of St. Giles&rsquo;s, and it was called  Purvis-court.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert had bought a couple of rolls and a  quarter of a pound of cooked meat, on his way to this wretched place. He pushed  open the door of one of the houses, passed by a group of children huddled  together on the step, and mounted the dark, dilapidated staircase leading to  the roof.</p>
<p>He opened the door of one of the garrets and went  in. There was very little furniture in the room, only a truckle bed, covered  with a patchwork counterpane, a couple of rush-bottomed chairs, a deal table,  and a great gaunt empty easel standing in the middle of the bare floor.</p>
<p>A woman was lying on the bed &mdash; a woman who was  young and who had once been pretty, but whose bloated face bore upon it the  most horrible evidence that a woman&rsquo;s face can bear, the fatal stamp which  brands the besotted countenance of a drunkard.</p>
<p>She was sleeping now, a heavy, drunken slumber, and  she never stirred at the sound of the opening door. This sleeping woman was  Gervoise Gilbert&rsquo;s wife, and it was she who had dragged the young man down into  that dark abyss of poverty and degradation from which he found it so impossible  to rise.</p>
<p>He had met her four years before, when his future  life seemed to smile upon him, lightening the burdens of the present, and  beckoning him onward along the road to greatness.</p>
<p>When he had married this woman he had been proud,  ambitious, hopeful. Now, he was only defiant and despairing.</p>
<p>The pretty, graceful girl whom he had loved and  wedded was transformed into a drunken fury dangerous to approach, or a besotted  wretch sleeping off the fumes of gin.</p>
<p>Yes, the gin fiend, the comforter and tempter of  the poor, had laid his fatal grasp upon Agatha Gilbert. She had not been able  to bear poverty, she had not been blest with that cheerful and contented spirit  which is woman&rsquo;s noblest dower. Tempted by the women about her, she had tried  to drown her sorrows in gin.</p>
<p>Perhaps the painter himself may have been a little  to blame for his wife&rsquo;s degradation. He had grown impatient of her complaints,  her tears, her murmurs. If she could have borne her fate bravely and nobly, his  love for her would never have diminished; but that love wore out under the  perpetual torments which a discontented woman can inflict upon her husband.</p>
<p>He had long ceased to love her. Now he hated her.  He hated her, for she was the burden which weighed him down to ruin and  degradation. How could he hope to rise? In what sphere of life could he hope to  hold up his head with this woman by his side, the sharer of his name, the  mother of his child &mdash; his wife; only to be separated from him by death?</p>
<p>He thought of this sometimes, as he sat looking at  her in gloomy silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she die young?&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;will she drink  herself to death, and leave me free? O, what a new life mine might be, released  from this horrible burden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gervoise Gilbert was not base enough to  encourage the fatal vice that threatened to kill the wife he hated. He tried all  in his power to rescue the wretched woman. He pleaded, he expostulated, he  threatened; but it was all in vain. She would not hear him; she would not let  him save her.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Heaven help us!&rdquo; he  muttered, as he glanced at the prostrate figure on the bed; &ldquo;she can get gin  even when I can&rsquo;t get food!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little boy &mdash; a golden-haired, blue-eyed child of  three years old &mdash; was kneeling upon the ledge of the window, clinging to the  bars which guarded the casement, and looking down at the children below; but he  turned at the sound of his father&rsquo;s footstep, and slipped to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;papa, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re come!  I&rsquo;ve been looking at the children playing in the street. But I wouldn&rsquo;t go  down, because you said I mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert lifted the child in his arms and  kissed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, Georgey!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re papa&rsquo;s own  treasure &mdash; his only treasure! What has your mother been doing, Georgey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been out; and then she came in, and she was  cross, and like &mdash; you know, papa &mdash; like she always is after she&rsquo;s been out a  long time; and she beat me because I spoke to her; and then she lay down on the  bed, and she&rsquo;s been asleep ever since. I tried to wake her, but she wouldn&rsquo;t  wake. Why is she so cross to me, papa, and so different from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked eagerly in his father&rsquo;s face as he  asked the question; then, in a low, anxious voice, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, have you brought anything to eat? I&rsquo;ve been  so hungry all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert looked at the child for a few  moments before he replied. The despair which had been visible in his  countenance all day intensified as he gazed at the childish face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; cried the boy, &ldquo;why do you look at me like  that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father did not answer, but walked slowly to the  empty easel.</p>
<p>Upon a shelf near the easel there were some brushes  and a palette, with some leaden tubes that had once held colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picture-trade won&rsquo;t last any longer,&rdquo; muttered  the painter, as he looked at these empty tubes; &ldquo;I have used all my colours,  and have no money to buy more. Mr. Moulem&rsquo;s prices won&rsquo;t pay for paint and  canvas. Great God, what an end! And I once dreamed of being a great artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He groaned aloud, in the bitterness of his soul;  and then, turning from the easel to the bed, looked darkly at the prostrate  figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>you</i> had been a better woman,&rdquo; he said below his breath, &ldquo;I might have been a  different man. The blight of my life has been <i>there</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the bread and meat from his pocket, and  placed it before the child. The little boy ate ravenously, and the father  watched him with a smile, the first that had lighted his face that day; but he  touched nothing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; the child exclaimed, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you hungry  too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise flung himself into a chair opposite the  low truckle bed, and sat with his elbows on his knees, and his chin resting on  his hands, watching the sleeping woman.</p>
<p>She never stirred; the weary eyelids were never  lifted from the dim eyes; the heavy head lay as it had fallen on the pillow.</p>
<p>She had been a pretty woman. The disordered hair,  streaming upon that wretched pillow, was dark and luxuriant; the features of  the face were regular; and long dark lashes fringed the closed eyelids.</p>
<p>The artist sat in the same position, never  speaking, never looking away from the figure on the bed. The child finished his  supper, and then, creeping softly to his father&rsquo;s side, sat down upon the  ground at the young man&rsquo;s feet. The sun went down in all his summer grandeur,  glorifying even the garret windows of a court like this with splashes of  crimson splendour, that turned the common glass to brighter hues than were ever  produced by mortal hands, even in the days when the art of staining glass was  in all its medi&aelig;val glory. The evening shadows deepened in the room and on the  artist&rsquo;s face; but before the light quite died away, Gervoise Gilbert changed  his attitude and drew the deal table towards him. There was a penny ink-bottle  and an old quill-pen upon the narrow ledge which served as an apology for a  chimney-piece. Gervoise took these and a sheet of crumpled note-paper, and  wrote, slowly and deliberately, the following lines:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;AGATHA GILBERT, &mdash; When I met you five years ago, I  was an ambitious man, with a bright future, as I thought, before me. I married  you, and from that hour to this a blight has clung to me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Have you ever considered that a wife&rsquo;s duty is to  be a help and comfort, not a hindrance and a burden, to the man whose name she  bears? Have you ever remembered this, and tried to aid me in the battle of  life? No; as I live, not once!</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I am weary of the struggle, Agatha. I am weary of  trying to save you from the hateful vice which is doomed to be the destruction  of your body and soul. If the law could part us, I would appeal to the law.  But, unhappily, justice has no remedy for wrongs such as mine. The law gives no  redress to the husband whose wife robs her child of bread in order that she may  have money to buy gin.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I depart, therefore, of my own will. Every link  that ever united us is broken &mdash; every hope of domestic happiness that I ever  cherished is shattered &mdash; every feeling of affection that ever warmed my heart  has died out, leaving only the bitter ashes of regret behind.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I go I know not where, and I take the boy with me.  It is for his sake I endure a miserable and broken life. If it were not for  him, I would go to the nearest river and drown my troubles in a deeper oblivion  than that which gin gives to you.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Good-bye. I try not to think bitterly of you; I  try to forgive you, as I pray you to forgive me for any wrong I may have done  you. I have been often impatient, harsh, violent; but I have suffered, and  suffered intensely. Once more, goodbye. Do not attempt to follow me, or to seek  me out. You will never see me, you will never hear of me again, nor of your  child.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You have chosen your road in life, and have been  reckless as to the misery it has brought upon me. I now choose my pathway, and  it leads me far away from you.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;GERVOISE GILBERT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man folded this letter, placed it on the  mantelpiece, where it was sure to meet his wife&rsquo;s eye; then he awoke the boy,  who had fallen asleep with his head upon his father&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a warmer frock than that, haven&rsquo;t you,  Georgey?&rdquo; said Gervoise, pointing to the little ragged cotton garment which  covered his son&rsquo;s slender frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had one; a woollen frock &mdash; very shabby, but  thick and warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but mamma took it, you know, papa, ever so  many days ago. She took it out with her, and never brought it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father muttered an execration. He had seen the  comfort of a decent home melt away little by little until it had come to this.  He had striven hard against the grim invader, poverty, but he had striven in  vain. Of what use were his struggles, when his wife spent every shilling she  could wring from him in gin?</p>
<p>She had robbed her husband and child of every  comfort, even of common necessaries, and lastly she had taken her child&rsquo;s  clothes to the pawnbroker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on your cap, Georgey,&rdquo; said Gervoise Gilbert;  &ldquo;you are going for a long journey with papa. Shall you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes, yes; I&rsquo;ll go anywhere with you, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then, my darling. But remember, Georgey, we  are not going by the railroad; we are not going to travel, as we once travelled  when you were a very little child; we are poor now, and we must go on foot. We  must walk, Georgey; but when you are tired, papa will carry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t be tired, papa,&rdquo; the boy answered  proudly.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert looked down upon him with a loving  smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave spirit!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Noble spirit! The  blood of all the Palgraves of Palgrave Chase spoke there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The artist had not many preparations to make before  leaving that wretched shelter; he had only one clean shirt, so ragged as to  have escaped from the clutches of the pawnbroker. He had no extra coat, no  carpet-bag, no railway-rug with which to burden himself.</p>
<p>He put the shirt in his pocket, put on his hat,  took an old silk handkerchief from his own throat, and tied it on the neck of  the child, then, leading the boy by the hand, he went out of the room and down  the stairs into the narrow court, where the children were still brawling and  quarrelling in their noisy play.</p>
<p>They had no inviting bedchambers to which to  retire, these poor children &mdash; no well-paid and experienced nurses, solicitous  about their health, to watch over their movements. They enjoyed liberty, at  least, if they knew no other joy, and were free to roll in the gutter till some  drunken mother, coming from the nearest public-house, swooped down upon them,  and bore them off to a stifling garret, crowded by a dozen tenants.</p>
<p>The shadows deepened in the narrow alley; the ruby  light that made cracked panes of common glass more beautiful to look upon than  all the precious gems glittering in the jewellers&rsquo; shops faded slowly away,  leaving the windows dark.</p>
<p>It was quite dark when Agatha Gilbert awoke from  her drunken sleep, and staggered to the fireplace. She groped, with her right  hand, along the ledge of wood until she found a box of lucifer-matches and a  scrap of tallow-candle, that was stuck in an old blacking-bottle. She lighted  this candle, and then looked slowly round her, winking and blinking stupidly in  the dim light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not come home yet,&rdquo; she muttered discontentedly;  &ldquo;not come home yet, though it&rsquo;s dark. But why should he come home? He hates me,  and he doesn&rsquo;t take the pains to hide his hatred. Where&rsquo;s the child, though? He  was here when I came in. Georgey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She repeated the boy&rsquo;s name, in a louder key, two  or three times.</p>
<p>But she was not alarmed at finding there was no  answer; the stupor of drunkenness had not yet passed away. She stood for some  moments motionless, with the light in her hand, staring straight before her.</p>
<p>Suddenly she perceived the letter on the chimney  piece &ldquo;Gilbert&rsquo;s hand!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he has been home, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She set down her candle, opened the letter, and  then taking up the light again in her left hand, read Gervoise Gilbert&rsquo;s  farewell.</p>
<p>She read the letter twice &mdash; hurriedly first, and  then slowly &mdash; till at last the fumes of the spirit she had drunk slowly  dispersed before the sense of a great calamity.</p>
<p>Then she uttered a loud cry &mdash; a long, ringing  shriek, that vibrated shrilly through the house &mdash; and fell prostrate upon the  ground.</p>
<p>There are strange contradictions, perplexing knots,  wonderful intricacies, in that tangled web which we call the human mind.</p>
<p>Agatha Gilbert passionately loved the man whose  life she had blighted, the child whose clothes she had pledged in order to buy  gin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheMarkUponGeorgeysArm"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Mark Upon Georgey&rsquo;s Arm</h2>
<p>The moon which rose late upon this August night  shone like an orb of molten gold low in the sky, as the man who called himself  Gervoise Gilbert emerged from a dusty road upon the pleasant expanse of  Putney-heath.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock, lights were twinkling here  and there in the town through which the traveller had just passed, and in a few  scattered houses looking towards the open ground, and on a waste patch of land  skirting the common, a gipsy fire, burning under an iron kettle, revealed the  outline of a travelling-van.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert stopped upon the edge of the road  a few yards from this van, and looked yearningly at a group of men standing  near the fire, and some women seated on the steps of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The boy had grown tired after the first mile, and  Gervoise had carried him ever since. Slender as the child was, he was tall for  his age, and no inconsiderable weight to be carried for a five-mile walk. He  had fallen asleep now, with his head upon his father&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>The artist had chosen this road with the intention  of joining any party of tramps he might fall in with, if they should prove willing  to accept him as one of their fraternity. He knew that it was worse than  useless to remain in London.</p>
<p><i>There</i> starvation and death  stared him in the face. But there might be some chance for him in tramping  hither and thither about the country. Surely now and then he would be able to  sell a picture, or to paint a portrait for some simple country tradesman. If he  could get nothing better than signboards to paint, he was ready to paint them.  He had done with pride. He was willing to do anything to win bread for his  child.</p>
<p>He had another motive too for wishing to join some  party of humble wanderers. He knew that his wife loved him, with a passionate,  jealous love, only known to violent natures. There was little doubt that she  would seek him, that she would use every effort in her power to trace his  footsteps.</p>
<p>There was less chance of her finding him if he had  no fixed abode, but was perpetually shifting from place to place.</p>
<p>This second motive was more powerful than the  first, and decided him.</p>
<p>The party encamped this night upon Putney-heath was  a larger one than he had expected to fall in with. The van was a ponderous  vehicle, and three powerful-looking horses cropped the grass upon a patch of  ground behind it.</p>
<p>One of the men sitting on the turf by the fire  looked up at Gervoise, after the artist had stood for some minutes gazing  thoughtfully at the group of wanderers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps when you pass this way next time,&rdquo; this  man said, taking a short clay-pipe from his mouth, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll know us again, my  friend. You&rsquo;ve stared long enough, and if you&rsquo;re anythink in the pottery line,  and wants a noo design for a fancy beer-jug, I should think you&rsquo;d got a c&rsquo;rect  pattern of our mugs by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert drew a little nearer to the gipsy  fire &mdash; so near that his handsome face and the child&rsquo;s golden hair were  illuminated by the ruddy blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no offence in my stare, my good fellow,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too low in the world to be insolent. I&rsquo;m an artist, and my  sympathies all go with such a life as yours. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m a destitute man,  and if I live at all, I must live something as I presume you do &mdash; from hand to  mouth, trusting to the chances of each day for a meal and a shelter at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s candid, anyhow,&rdquo; said the man, emptying the  ashes of his pipe upon the ground by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; Gervoise Gilbert answered  moodily.</p>
<p>One of the women had risen from her seat upon the  steps of the van, and approached the painter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your child?&rdquo; she asked, looking at the  golden head still nestling in the father&rsquo;s waistcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; answered Gervoise; &ldquo;and but for him I  might find a sound sleep at the bottom of one of the pools on this heath  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow!&rdquo; the woman murmured tenderly.  &ldquo;Is his mother dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gilbert answered firmly.</p>
<p>She was dead to him, he thought. His best hope was  that she would be dead to all the world before long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; the woman said gently; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very bad  for such a little chap as him to be without a mother. You seem fond of him,  though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond of him!&rdquo; cried Gervoise; &ldquo;my heart&rsquo;s blood is  not so precious to me as this child. I only live for his sake. Low as I have  sunk, the day may come when he will be rich and powerful. It is a far-away  chance, perhaps, but it may come. Wise men, who have never been made desperate  by poverty, might call me mad for even dreaming of it. But I do dream of it, by  day and by night too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this rather to himself than the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going far to-night?&rdquo; asked the man who had  spoken first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it. I want to get a shelter for  this little one if I can. I&rsquo;<i>m</i> not  afraid of sleeping under a haystack, or on the bare ground amongst the  furze-bushes yonder; but the boy has never slept in the open air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sleep in the open air to-night,  master,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll let him lie along with my two youngsters,  in the van yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would he let him? Gervoise Gilbert gratefully  accepted the offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there must be charity somewhere or other  in this wide world,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and, thank Heaven, I&rsquo;ve come the right way to  find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman laughed good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no such great charity to give a night&rsquo;s  shelter to a child,&rdquo; she said, taking the boy from Gilbert&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Georgey was completely worn out. He neither opened  his eyes nor stirred his slender limbs as the woman carried him into the van,  and laid him in a homely little bed, beside two sleeping lads of ten and twelve  years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the man with the clay-pipe, &ldquo;if you  are going to sleep out o&rsquo; doors, you&rsquo;d better sleep hereabouts, and I dessay  one of us can lend yer a rug; besides which, you can peck a bit o&rsquo; supper along  of us. Our French cook give us warning last Toosday week, &rsquo;cos that gentleman  there, who&rsquo;s werry partic&rsquo;lar in his eatin&rsquo;&rdquo; &mdash; he pointed to a man whose hair  was bound upon his forehead after the manner common to street-acrobats, and  whose sole outer garment seemed a long rough overcoat which enveloped him from  the chin to the heels&mdash; &ldquo;&rsquo;cos Mr. William Stokes, which his professional name is  Mountmorency, complained about the fricasseed frogs&rsquo; legs bein&rsquo; underdone. So  you must take pot-luck, which, I believe, is liver and bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise accepted the invitation so cordially  given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to stay with you to-night,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;and glad to go on with you into the bargain, if it&rsquo;s agreeable &mdash; that&rsquo;s  to say, if I can turn my hand to anything that&rsquo;ll enable me to get a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman with the long hair and the rough  greatcoat chimed in at this point of the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to yer gettin&rsquo; a livin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that  depends upon what yer able to do. You said you was a hartist jest now; you  don&rsquo;t mean a hartist in the ground and lofty, do yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground and lofty?&rdquo; asked Gervoise, puzzled.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>He means to ask if yer a  hacrobat,&rdquo; explained the man with the pipe; &ldquo;I never see such a cove as Bill;  he&rsquo;s that wrapped up in his purfession that he seems to think as there ain&rsquo;t no  other purfession goin&rsquo;. Lord bless you, sir, that chap &rsquo;ud have his breakfast  on the tight-rope if he could, and eat his dinner standin&rsquo; on his &rsquo;ed, if the  laws of gravitation and centrifugal what&rsquo;s-his-name, which was discovered by  Sir Walter Raleigh all along of seeing a potato fall off a tree, didn&rsquo;t purvent  his swallerin&rsquo; his food upside down. He&rsquo;s got one of them limited intellects,  which never sees any farther than his own family circle. &mdash; No, Bill, I&rsquo;ll lay  all the money as I&rsquo;ve got invested in the Three-per-cents &mdash; for the convenience  of Queen Victoria when she finds the washing-bills at Buckingham Palace too  heavy for the privy puss, and has to come upon the country before she can pay  the laundress &mdash; that this here gent ain&rsquo;t anythink in the acrobat line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Heaven help me, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered Gervoise  Gilbert. &ldquo;Perhaps if I could dance upon a tight-rope, I might be able to earn  bread for my boy; but I can&rsquo;t &mdash; I&rsquo;m only a painter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A portrait-painter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can paint portraits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker, who was an important personage, being,  in fact, no other than the proprietor of the van, gave a long whistle.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>If you&rsquo;re a good hand at  portraits,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think as I can give you a job. We&rsquo;re a hequestrian  company, you must understand, and we travels through England in the summer time,  sometimes performin&rsquo; at fairs, sometimes performin&rsquo; altogether on our own hook.  Now, what I should like you to do for us is three or four fancy portraits of  Mounseer Mountmorency, there &mdash; which he ain&rsquo;t much to look at now &mdash; but comes  out wonderful strong in his purfessional togs; and of Mademoiselle l&rsquo;Amour,  which is my wife, Nancy Cadgers, and of the two other ladies, as is Madame  Zepherine and Signora Floribella, and the two gents sittin&rsquo; beside Mr.  Mountmorency, which one of &rsquo;em is the Desert Whirlwind, as rides three wild  Arab steeds barebacked &mdash; the Arab steeds is them animals as you see a-grazin&rsquo;  yonder &mdash; and the other is Herr von Volterchoker, our German clown what was born  in Bermondsey. Now, do you think as you could knock off two or three pictur&rsquo;s  of &rsquo;em, in different costooms and attitoodes &mdash; eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly,&rdquo; answered Gervoise; &ldquo;the ladies  and gentlemen shall have their portraits taken in my very best style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we want, you see,&rdquo; continued Mr. Cadgers, &ldquo;is  something cheap and showy, warranted fast colours, as will stand the open air  and sunshine. We&rsquo;ll send a boy along with &rsquo;em the day before we go into a town  ourselves, and get &rsquo;em hung up in the shop-winders. They&rsquo;ll be about the best  advertisement as we can have. I don&rsquo;t suppose you and me&rsquo;ll quarrel about the  price, and you can live along of us, and rough it with us till they&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; exclaimed the painter; &ldquo;and the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you bother yourself about him. Nancy&rsquo;ll take care of him.  It was her as took him into the van jest now.&rdquo; So Gervoise Gilbert slept that  night more peacefully beneath the purple canopy of heaven than he had ever  slumbered in the fetid atmosphere of Purvis-court. He slept peacefully, for  there was hope, at least, of bread for the morrow, and for many morrows; and  the black shadow of despair vanished away before the light of hope.</p>
<p>At sunrise next morning Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s troupe left  Putney-heath. The women travelled in the van, which was pretty well loaded with  the fittings of the circus, the dresses and properties of the performers, and  the domestic requisites of the company. Mr. Cadgers drove. The rest of the men tramped  upon the dusty high-road, a few yards ahead of the van. They crossed to the  Middlesex side of the water, skirted London, and  bore towards the midland districts of England.</p>
<p>The pedestrian travellers were Gervoise Gilbert;  Mr. William Stokes, alias Mounseer Mountmorency; the Desert Whirlwind, whose  real name was Samuel Bolter; and Herr von Volterchoker, who declined to reveal  his genuine patronymic, and who was familiarly believed to have no name  whatever, saving always such cognomen as in the flight of fancy he might elect  to be known by for the time being.</p>
<p>He was an elderly man, grim and dark, with very  black eyes and grizzled hair; and it was difficult to imagine that he could  ever be funny himself, or the cause of fun in others. He was unlike his comrades,  who were lively and communicative; for he was rarely known to open his lips,  except when compelled to do so by the common business of life. He seemed like a  man who, at the very outset of his life, had taken upon him the heavy burden of  some gloomy secret, and had never been able to shake off the load, or to  recover from the sense of its responsibility.</p>
<p>Gervoise, Mr. Stokes, and Samuel Bolter walked  abreast along the dusty roads, talking cheerfully enough as they went. But the  clown stalked behind them, smoking perpetually, and as silent as the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he clever?&rdquo; Gervoise asked once of his  companions, after looking back for a moment at this man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncommon,&rdquo; Mr. Bolter answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s uncommon  clever with conjurin&rsquo; tricks, swallerin&rsquo; fire and carvin&rsquo;-knives, and chuckin&rsquo;  a dagger agen a mark on a wall, and all that sort of think. But he ain&rsquo;t any  great things at a joke, and it allus gives me the cold shivers to look at him  when he&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to be funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert stopped in one of the towns through  which they passed, and bought colours and canvas with some money Mr. Cadgers  advanced to him for that purpose.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock in the day they came upon a patch of  common land, upon the outskirts of a wood; and here, under the shadow of the  trees, the horses were taken from the van, and the wanderers sat down to eat  some bread and meat which Mr. Cadgers distributed amongst them, together with a  very liberal allowance of beer, brought in a great stone jar from the last  public-house they had passed.</p>
<p>The horses were to rest here for some hours; and  after sharing this simple meal, Gervoise took out his brushes and palette,  mixed his colours, prepared his canvas, and made everything ready for his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin with your portrait, Herr  Volterchoker,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve no objection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man made this selection because he had  been drawn by a species of fascination towards the silent clown.</p>
<p>The other men were good-natured fellows,  commonplace and uninteresting enough. But about this man there was an air of  mystery which interested Gilbert in spite of himself.</p>
<p>The clown made no objection to having his picture  taken before any of his comrades. He slipped away to change his dress, and  returned in about ten minutes in his grotesque professional costume.</p>
<p>This costume was loose about the body and sleeves,  and left his thin, muscular arms bare from the elbow.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert looked with surprise at these long  bare arms. They were covered from the wrist upwards with strange figures,  tattooed in indigo and vermilion &mdash; figures which no time could erase.</p>
<p>The painter commenced his task, and worked  industriously till sunset. By that time Herr von Volterchoker&rsquo;s portrait was  finished; carelessly painted, but painted with an artistic dash which reveals  the force and vigour of genius.</p>
<p>The men and women crowded round to look at the  portrait of their companion. Everyone of them had half a dozen remarks to make  &mdash; remarks of surprise, approbation, delight. But the clown said nothing. He  stood apart with his arms folded, looking moodily at the painter and the noisy  group around him.</p>
<p>Presently Gervoise Gilbert addressed him: &ldquo;Do you  think it&rsquo;s like?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the portrait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; the clown answered, glancing over  the painter&rsquo;s shoulder at the wet picture; &ldquo;like enough, I daresay. It isn&rsquo;t  the first time I&rsquo;ve had my picture painted, but I hope it may be the last. I&rsquo;m  not so very handsome that people should want to be reminded of me when I&rsquo;m dead  and gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert noticed that though this man spoke  in a sullen tone, his accent and manner of speaking were very superior to the  vulgar twang and cockney English of his companions.</p>
<p>The moon had risen when the horses were put to, and  the van started once more upon its wandering way. This time Gervoise left Mr.  Stokes and Mr. Bolter, and fell back by the side of the clown. Herr von  Volterchoker looked at him rather suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stick to your friends,&rdquo; he said  quietly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find them livelier than me, and I don&rsquo;t much care about  company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble you long,&rdquo; answered Gervoise;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to them presently, but I want to ask you a question first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask away, then,&rdquo; muttered the clown, without  taking the stem of his pipe from between his lips, &ldquo;and be quick about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you had those marks upon your arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you do them yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all of them. Some were done by a sailor on  board ship, more than a thousand miles from here. I did the rest myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do me a favour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends upon what it is. If it isn&rsquo;t much  trouble I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little boy travelling in yonder van is my only  child, dearer to me than anything else in the world. There is a person who  would be very glad to get him from me if she could, and all last night I was  haunted by the fear that he might be taken from me. If he were taken from me  now, in his early childhood, he might alter as he grew to manhood, and the  chances are that, after years of searching for him, I might meet him and not  recognise him. More than this, the day may come &mdash; I don&rsquo;t say it ever will, but  it may &mdash; in which that boy will be the heir to a great fortune. If this should  ever happen, it will be necessary to prove his identity. I want you to set such  a mark on him as will never fade or alter, though he should change so much that  the most loving eyes would fail to recognise him. Will you do this for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Herr von Volterchoker readily; <i>&ldquo;</i>I don&rsquo;t often do a good-natured thing,  but I&rsquo;ll do this. It&rsquo;ll be like most people&rsquo;s good-nature in this world &mdash; it  won&rsquo;t cost me anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early the next morning, while most of the party  were still fast asleep on the spot they had chosen at midnight for their  resting-place, Gervoise Gilbert peeped into the van and called to his son. The  children had been awake for some time, and Georgey came out at the sound of his  father&rsquo;s voice. The boy was very happy with his new friends. &ldquo;It is better than  being with mamma,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get beaten now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker was up and stirring ready to  fulfil his promise. The two men seated themselves side by side upon the grass  at the back of the van. Here they were completely secluded from the rest of the  party.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert took the child on his knees, and  bared the fair little arm, pushing the sleeve of the boy&rsquo;s threadbare frock  high above his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re going to do will hurt you a little,  Georgey,&rdquo; he said, <i>&ldquo;</i>but you&rsquo;ll try to  bear the pain, won&rsquo;t you &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be a brave little man, for papa&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; the boy answered firmly, lifting his  bright, innocent eyes to his father&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What marks do you want me to tattoo upon his arm?&rdquo;  the clown asked.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>An earl&rsquo;s coronet, and the  initials &lsquo;G. P.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  The Foster-Brothers</h2>
<p>Before the end of August, Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s company had  penetrated into the leafy depths of beautiful Warwickshire. There was to be a  fair held at Avondale, that pleasant, old-fashioned market-town, in the heart  of that picturesque region which is sacred to the memory of William  Shakespeare, and thither Mr. Cadgers conducted his <i>troupe,</i> with a view to astonishing the simple rustics with the  combined efforts of the Desert Whirlwind, Monsieur Montmorency, Herr von  Volterchoker, and the ladies.</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert and little Georgey wandered  happily together through the shady lanes and fair high-roads of beautiful England.</p>
<p>Mr. Cadgers knew all the short cuts and by-lanes in  the land, it seemed to Gervoise, for he led his band across heathery patches of  common, by purple moorland and wandering streams, under the shadow of grassy  hills, by wood and water, and through long, sheltered lanes, where there were  comfortable nooks in which to rest at night It was a pleasant journey  altogether, and Gervoise Gilbert was happier than he had been for years past.  He had put away ambition: that bright attribute of manhood, without which man  seems less than man, had been starved out of him. He had put away all thoughts  of future greatness, or even future wealth, and was resigned to cast in his lot  with these low-born associates, and to get his living amongst them as best he  might, for the sake of his child. He smiled when first he heard from Mr.  Cadgers that Avondale was the destination of the <i>troupe.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know Avondale, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed the  sagacious proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it once,&rdquo; Gervoise answered thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you knew it once, you know it always,&rdquo;  cried Mr. Cadgers, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m blessed if you&rsquo;ll find any alteration there.  Avondale is a town as stopped growin&rsquo; when it was very young &mdash; in the time of  Queen Elizabeth, or thereabouts &mdash; and it&rsquo;s never growed any more since. It  throw&rsquo;d out a sort of hexcrescience, in the shape of a terrace of red-brick  houses, two year ago; but the owdacious builder as put &rsquo;em up went mad, and  hung hisself in one of the attics, d&rsquo;reckly he see what he&rsquo;d done, and that  cast a shade of melancholy over the houses, which most of &rsquo;em have been to let  ever since. And so you know Avondale, do you?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Cadgers, slapping  his knee with one hand, and shifting his pipe to the other side of his mouth  with the other; &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s queer now, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is queer,&rdquo; Gervoise answered, with a strange  shadow npon his face; &ldquo;it is very queer that I should go into that town, as I  shall go into it with you, considering&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considerin&rsquo; what, Mr. Jarvis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise had called himself Jarvis in his dealings  with Mr. Cadgers and that gentleman&rsquo;s gifted company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what. Every man has a corner of his  mind that he likes to keep dark. That&rsquo;s my dark corner,&rdquo; the young man answered,  stooping to light his pipe with the burning tobacco in the bowl of Mr.  Cadgers&rsquo;s short, blackened meerschaum.</p>
<p>The faces of the two men were close together as  Gervoise said this. Mr. Cadgers looked at him scrutinisingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very close, Mr. Jarvis,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but as far  as that goes, you&rsquo;re welcome to be close. You mind your business, and I mind  mine; that&rsquo;s true Christianity, to my thinkin&rsquo;. But there&rsquo;s some things people  can&rsquo;t help guessin&rsquo; at, if you keep &rsquo;em never so close; and, of course, I know  well enough you&rsquo;re not one of our sort. You&rsquo;re a gentleman, you are; and a  gentleman as has it in him to hold his head pretty high, but as has been put  upon by the world somehow, I take it. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; Gervoise answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. Now, do you know, Mr. Jarvis, as you  was a-stoopin&rsquo; over me to light your pipe just this minute, a hidea came into  my &rsquo;ed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and that hidea was, that I&rsquo;d seen you before  the other day. Whether it&rsquo;s someone like you as I&rsquo;ve seen, or whether it&rsquo;s you  yourself, I can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have seen someone like me,&rdquo; said  Gervoise; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely you ever saw me until that night upon  Putney-heath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; said Mr. Cadgers, slapping his knee  so violently that he nearly jerked himself off the five-barred gate upon which  he was sitting. It was Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s habit to sit upon the shaft of his van,  the top-rail of a five-barred gate, the stump of a tree, or anything of the  like uncomfortable nature, in preference to those vulgar chairs and benches on  which the common run of mankind repose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, and it&rsquo;s talking of  Avondale that&rsquo;s put it into my mind. You&rsquo;re the livin&rsquo; image of the old Earl of  Haughton what died two year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert started, and turned very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the old Earl of Haughton dead?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flatter myself that he is,&rdquo; answered Mr.  Cadgers, &ldquo;and died uncommon hard, too, I&rsquo;ve heard say. Just as he&rsquo;d lived, the  old rapscallion; which I called upon him three years ago, askin&rsquo; him to give us  his name for a bespeak, and lend us one of his meadders to perform in, and he  told me he&rsquo;d see me all manner of uncivil things fust, and offered to have me  kicked out of doors by his butler. Yes, the old varmint has hooked it; and  don&rsquo;t my young lord go it, that&rsquo;s all; huntin&rsquo; and steeplechasin&rsquo;, and the  dooce knows what! He&rsquo;s a regular wild un, is Lord Haughton. He&rsquo;ll give us a  bespeak, I&rsquo;ll lay anything, and, as you&rsquo;ve got such a g&eacute;ntlemanly way with you,  you might do the good-natured thing by us, and go and ask for it &mdash; mightn&rsquo;t  you, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise looked at Mr. Cadgers with a strange  smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;of all the things that are to be  done upon this earth, the last I&rsquo;ll do is to ask a favour of Lord Haughton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I knew him once; when I was a lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And uncommon like the Haughton family you are,  too,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Cadgers; &ldquo;uncommon like &rsquo;em. You ain&rsquo;t a hillegit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>?&rdquo;  cried Gervoise, turning so suddenly upon Mr, Cadgers, that the latter gentleman  nearly tumbled backwards into the meadow behind him. <i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course you ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Mr. Cadgers very  hastily; <i>&ldquo;</i>who said you was? I should  like to know who said you was? You needn&rsquo;t fly at a feller as if you was  a-goin&rsquo; to choke him with his own front teeth, just because he asks you a civil  question. But you are uncommon like the Haughton family, for all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am. There have been accidental  likenesses before to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there has. I&rsquo;ve seen a many sich; and very  orkard accidents they&rsquo;ve been, too, some of &rsquo;em; so let&rsquo;s say no more about  it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cadgers, with quiet dignity.</p>
<p>No more was said, but this conversation had taken  place in the hearing of Herr von Volterchoker, who lay at full length upon the  grass at Gervoise Gilbert&rsquo;s feet, smoking quietly, and listening to everything  that was said.</p>
<p>The silent clown had a retentive memory, and was a  close observer into the bargain. He knew how to read a man&rsquo;s looks, as well as  his words. He knew the value of the tone in which a word was spoken, as well as  of the word itself.</p>
<p>The <i>troupe</i> arrived at a hilly patch of common land outside Avondale in the dusk of the  evening; and, while Mr. Cadgers and his associates were busy with their  preparations for the next day, Gervoise Gilbert, with his hat slouched over his  forehead, and the collar of his coat turned up so as to conceal the lower part  of his face, went out into the quiet little town.</p>
<p>It was a quaint, old-fashioned place, and seemed,  as Mr. Cadgers had said, very much as if no change had come to it since good  Queen Bess rode with her favourite by her side along the stony street, while  loyal voices gave her clamorous welcome, and loyal children strewed sweet  English flowers under her horse&rsquo;s feet. You went into the town by a grim stone  archway, and you went out of it by another archway, grimmer and stonier, if  possible, and half borne down by a lop-sided church-tower, in which poor  persecuted Charles I. once found a sorry lodging. The traveller who should fall  asleep in that old town, and on awakening find Leicester&rsquo;s varlets carousing in  the low tavern parlour, and William Shakespeare lounging in the market-place,  would scarcely be surprised. Beyond the grim stone gate, there was a winding  river and a buttressed bridge; and above the bridge there towered tall,  ivy-mantled castle-walls, within whose ponderous shelter a new sleeping beauty  might have slumbered, with her retainers round her, waiting for the coming of  the chosen prince foredoomed to awaken her.</p>
<p>In the dusky summer twilight, Gervoise Gilbert  strolled along the narrow High-street, into the market-place, where the  townspeople, grouped here and there, talked of the fair that was to be held  upon the morrow.</p>
<p>They had something more than the fair to talk  about. Avondale races also were to take place the next day, and the great event  was to be a steeplechase with gentleman riders; and the crack rider was the  young Earl of Haughton. Gervoise came upon a group of gossips who were  discussing this event with considerable animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do say as the young countess went down upon  her knees implorin&rsquo; of my lord not to ride,&rdquo; an old woman said; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s that  obstinate, there&rsquo;s no more turning him than you could bend the iron battle-axes  in the great hall at Palgrave Chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard, too, upon the countess,&rdquo; said another  woman; &ldquo;for she&rsquo;s a sweet young creature, and my lord expects an heir to the  estate very soon, I&rsquo;ve heard say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then there&rsquo;ll be fine doin&rsquo;s in Avondale,  I suppose; for whatever Lord Haughton&rsquo;s faults may be, his worst enemies can&rsquo;t  say that he doesn&rsquo;t do things handsomely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Gilbert stopped to read the programme of  the races, in the window of a low, gable-roofed public-house, near the corner  where these gossips stood. Yes, there it was sure enough:</p>
<p class="note"><i>&ldquo;At</i> 30 <i>minutes after</i> 3, <i>a  steeplechase: gentlemen riders</i>.<br>
    <i>Devilshoof b.  c.</i>... The  Earl of Haughton.<br>
    <i>Meg Merrilies</i>, <i>br. f.</i>.. Captain Clifford.<br>
<i>Pepper-box,  gr. f.</i>...  Stephen Constable, Esq.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were only three riders for this steeplechase;  and some boys standing near Gervoise were talking of the double ditches and  double fences that had been constructed on the course.</p>
<p>The young man was turning away from the lighted  tavern-window, when a hand was suddenly laid upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>He turned quickly round, and found himself face to  face with a man of about his own age &mdash; a daredevil-looking fellow, with a dark,  sunburnt face, and bright black eyes. He looked half-gipsy, half-brigand, and  was dressed in a velveteen coat with plated buttons, a gaudy cashmere  waistcoat, a wideawake hat, corduroy breeches, and leathern gaiters.</p>
<p>He was a reformed poacher who had turned  gamekeeper, and he was Gervoise Gilbert&rsquo;s foster-brother. His name was Humphrey  Melwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be mistaken in you, Mr. Gervoise,&rdquo; he  said, holding out his broad, muscular hand.</p>
<p>He was taller by half a foot than Gervoise Gilbert,  and he was big and broad-shouldered, a handsome young Hercules, with a fierce  sparkle in his black eyes that promised no good to anyone who provoked his  resentment.</p>
<p>Gervoise shook hands with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had gone abroad, Humphrey,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was going to Australia, Mr. Gervoise; but  mother took on dreadful at the notion of my going; and just about that time the  earl died, and the young lord said he&rsquo;d give me one more chance; so now I&rsquo;m  under-gamekeeper at the Chase; and I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable, sir, and so&rsquo;s  mother, now that I&rsquo;ve turned steady. And there&rsquo;s only one thing as I wish for  in this blessed world, and that&rsquo;s for you to be my master, instead of him that  now is Earl of Haughton. Not but what he&rsquo;s kind and generous, sir; but there&rsquo;s  that between you and me, Mr. Gervoise, that&rsquo;s more than blood, I sometimes  think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at him with a mournful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Humphrey,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we slept upon the same  breast when we were children together. Perhaps it would have been better for  one of us if he had died then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for you, Mr. Gervoise; don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; the  gamekeeper answered entreatingly. &ldquo;While there&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s hope, you know.  I&rsquo;m only a poor good-for-nothing scoundrel, that never did a good turn for  anybody in all my life; but I think you know, Mr. Gervoise, that I&rsquo;d lay down  my life for you, and welcome, if the loss of such a useless life as mine could  be any gain to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men walked away from the market-place, and  down under the gloomy archway, and out upon the gray stone bridge. They leaned  upon the moss-grown parapet as they talked. The rippling water shone  silver-bright in the moonlight, except where the great towers of the castle  cast their broad black shadows on the river.</p>
<p>In the good old times that are for ever gone,  lonely prisoners, rotting in damp cells level with the river-bed, had listened  to the plashing of that water, and the waving of the willows as they dipped  into the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d lay down my life for you, and think it naught,  Mr. Gervoise,&rdquo; said Humphrey Melwood; &ldquo;and mother and me have thought sometimes  that it would have been but kind of you if you&rsquo;d written to tell us what you  were doing in London.  I went up there once to look for you; but I&rsquo;m a rough, ignorant country fellow,  and the place seemed strange to me. I walked about the streets till my feet  ached, and I was always losin&rsquo; myself, and it seemed like lookin&rsquo; for a needle  in a haystack, so I gave it up; but you might have wrote to us, Mr. Gervoise.  If neither mother nor I could have read your letter, we would have found those  as could have read it for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was for that very reason I didn&rsquo;t write to  you, Humphrey,&rdquo; answered Gervoise; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want anybody about the Chas&ecirc; to  know how low I&rsquo;d sunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been unlucky, then, Mr. Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had all the ill-luck that could fall to a  man, I think. After my father&rsquo;s death I dropped the name of Palgrave, and  called myself Gervoise Gilbert. Gilbert was my mother&rsquo;s name, you know. From  that time to this I&rsquo;ve been trying to support myself by painting. Heaven help  me! I have failed in that, as I have failed in everything else. I am tramping  through the country now, Humphrey, with a troop of strollers. I am an outcast  and a reprobate, whom my cousin, Lord Haughton, would turn from his doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you hear of your uncle&rsquo;s death, Mr.  Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until the day before yesterday. How long has  he been dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years. The present earl married six months  after his father&rsquo;s death; and there&rsquo;s an heir or an heiress expected at the  Chase. Have you married, Mr. Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the young man, &ldquo;I have been  married, and I have a son, a boy of three years old; but for him I might have  been lying at the bottom of a river before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Mr. Gervoise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I say?&rdquo; cried the painter  fiercely; &ldquo;what hope is there for me in life, that I should wish to live?&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a dark look-out, certainly, sir,&rdquo; he  said; &ldquo;but you mustn&rsquo;t despair &mdash; you mustn&rsquo;t despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I do otherwise than despair?&rdquo; answered  Gervoise. &ldquo;My father reared me to look forward to the possession of my uncle&rsquo;s  title and fortune, though he must have known that I might be disappointed of  it. He taught me no profession, he gave me no useful knowledge. My own taste  made me a painter; but he did nothing to foster that taste.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your uncle&rsquo;s brat may die, boy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo; and  then you will be master of Palgrave Chase.&rsquo; After my father&rsquo;s death I went out  into the world, and faced it boldly; but it has been too strong for me; and  sometimes, when the day has been darkest, I have felt a strange wild hope that  my boy might live to inherit rank and fortune; but I know that hope is  madness.&rdquo; &mdash; </p>
<p>He stood with folded arms looking down at the  moonlit water. Humphrey Melwood, watching his profile, saw the settled  melancholy of his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to stay long at Avondale, Mr.  Gervoise?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To stay long? Heaven forbid! I shall only stay so  long as my companions remain here; and I shall take care to hide myself from  everyone while I do stay. I came out to-night after dark to see the old place,  for it seemed as if something that was stronger than myself drew me into the  familiar streets; but I didn&rsquo;t think I should be recognised &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t wish to be  recognised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re sorry that you met me, Mr.  Gervoise!&rdquo; cried Humphrey Melwood eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard that you should be sorry  to see one that was your foster-brother, and that loves you as well as ever a  brother was loved. The difference between our rank can&rsquo;t alter the feelings of  our hearts, you know, Mr. Gervoise. I&rsquo;ve been a bad fellow, a bad son, and a  bad servant; but I&rsquo;ve been true to you; I&rsquo;ve been true to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you have, Humphrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you only believe the truth, Mr. Gervoise. My  mother has saved a little money, sir, and I know she&rsquo;ll give it me and welcome;  I shall make bold to bring it to you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Humphrey, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Gervoise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sunk very low; do not insult me, Humphrey,&rdquo;  the young man said proudly. &ldquo;I am a man, and I can work. I will never take a  woman&rsquo;s savings. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked away as he spoke; Humphrey hurried after  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let me see you again before you leave  Avondale, Mr. Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like. You&rsquo;ll find me with an equestrian  company in the fair &mdash; Cadgers&rsquo;s company. You must ask for Mr. Jarvis; and  remember, Humphrey, not a word to anyone in Avondale about my being in the  town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men parted. Gervoise went slowly back to  the canvas booth, under whose shelter he was to sleep that night. Humphrey  Melwood went to a favourite public-house to finish the evening with a couple of  choice spirits, suspected of unholy dealings with wire traps for innocent young  hares, and cruel nets for the snaring of winged fowl.</p>
<p>As Gervoise left the bridge a dark figure emerged  from the sombre shadow of the castle towers, and followed him, always keeping  at a respectful distance.</p>
<p>That dark figure was Herr von Volterchoker, the  silent clown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheGentlemanJockeyWhoRodeDevilshoof"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Gentleman Jockey Who Rode Devilshoof</h2>
<p>The Avondale racecourse described a circle round  that very patch of common land on which Avondale fair was always held. Indeed,  the fair was only a part of the races. Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s equestrian <i>troupe</i> were in the habit of remaining  idle throughout the day, while serious business was being done upon the stunted  turf of the magic circle; but at night, when the races were over, when the  simple country-folk had stared wonderingly at the flying thoroughbreds, and had  lost their half-crowns and sixpences in friendly sweepstakes; when the  carriages of the county families had driven homewards in a cloud of dust; when  the betting-men had deserted that cow-shed-like edifice which was dignified by  the title of the grandstand; when the glory of the race was over &mdash; then the  fair began in good earnest. The gongs sounded, the drums beat, and opposition  pandean-pipes squeaked discordant clamour; flaring cressets of naphtha shone  out upon the blackness of the night; performing dogs yelped in their professional  ardour; learned pigs grunted hoarse impatience to distinguish themselves; eager  horses neighed and curveted amidst the sawdust of the ring; and the members of  Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s company appeared in all their splendour.</p>
<p>They were not quite idle in the daytime though; for  during the intervals between the races, Herr von Volterchoker swallowed swords,  spun washing-basins upon the tips of walking-sticks, and mystified the bovine  spectators by marvellous juggling with pocket-handkerchiefs, white mice, raw  eggs, and live pigeons. Mr. Samuel Bolter performed wonderful feats of strength  with unnatural-looking wooden chairs, and flung himself into attitudes utterly  opposed to the harmonious laws of nature, and made himself uncomfortable to  look at, for the gratification of an enraptured audience. Mrs. Cadgers, better  known as Mademoiselle L&rsquo;Amour, exhibited herself on these occasions in a Highland costume, and took the money at the doors with  the dignity of Mrs. Rob Roy Macgregor herself.</p>
<p>This lady was in the habit of appearing in short  petticoats on these festive occasions, and always seemed to be upon the point  of executing some Terpsichorean achievement; but never of late years had been  seen by mortal eye to carry out this intention.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cadgers was very good at promenading  arm-in-arm with a Spanish nobleman with corked eyebrows and impossible calves.  She was good, too, at taking the money, and had a sharp eye for spurious copper  coin; but beyond this her accomplishments were of a purely legendary character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When first I saw my girl Nance,&rdquo; Mr. Cadgers would  say, when the liver and bacon, or the sausages, or the pig&rsquo;s fry had been done  to a turn, and the Jupiter of the caravan was in a good humour with his Juno,  &ldquo;when first I set eyes upon Mrs. Cadgers, which it were at the Falcon Tavern,  Whitechapel, she were a dancin&rsquo; the &rsquo;ighland fling in such quick time as it  would have made your &rsquo;air a&rsquo;most stand on hend to look at her. But what with  the wear and tear of married life, and what with the price of purvisions, I  don&rsquo;t think as you could get that &rsquo;ighland fling out of Mrs. Cadgers now, not  if you was to lay down golden sovereigns for her to dance upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Dudley Palgrave, alias Gervoise Gilbert,  alias Mr. Jarvis, lay upon a truss of hay in a corner of the canvas booth,  which was curtained off from the circus, and which served as a living room for  Mr. Cadgers and his company. They were all busy except the painter, and he was  alone. He had allowed little Georgey to be dressed in some fantastic costume,  and to show himself upon the platform and in the ring with Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s two  olive branches, much to the boy&rsquo;s delight. Gervoise felt that he had worked  well enough to earn the right to be idle for once in a way, brooding over his  dismal fate in the dusky shelter of the curtained booth, while innocent  country-folks were laughing loud at hackneyed old jests upon the other side of  the curtain.</p>
<p>He lay stretched at full length upon the truss of  hay, with a short pipe in his mouth, thinking over his strange fortunes, while  Herr von Volterchoker, in a voice which would have scared mirthful thoughts  away from the mind of a sensitive person, demanded of his audience when it was  that a door was not a door, and entertained them with other conundrums of equal  freshness and originality. Gervoise Dudley Palgrave lay and brooded over his  lot in life.</p>
<p>He was the nephew of the late Lord Haughton; he was  the cousin of the present earl; and he was dependent upon the patronage of Mr.  Cadgers for a meal for himself and his only child. His father had been a  thoughtless, reckless spendthrift, who had quarrelled with the late earl, and  had, in vulgar parlance, gone to the dogs, leaving his son penniless to fight  the hard battle of life, with nothing but contumely to expect from his grand  relations.</p>
<p>The earl and his brother, George Augustus Davenant  Palgrave, had hated each other, as brothers do sometimes hate each other, even  in this enlightened age. George had married a farmer&rsquo;s daughter secretly, and  had been turned out of doors by his indignant father. Only one child was born  from this marriage, and that child was Gervoise Dudley Palgrave. The mother  died within a month of the boy&rsquo;s birth, and the reckless, dissipated young  father intrusted the infant to the care of Margery Melwood, the wife of one of  the gamekeepers at Palgrave Chase.</p>
<p>All this was done secretly, and when the old earl,  Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s grandfather, saw two babies in Margery Melwood&rsquo;s arms, as  she stood in the sunshine at the lodge-door, he did not know but that the  gamekeeper&rsquo;s wife was the mother of twins. He certainly never guessed that the  dark-eyed baby was the possible heir to Palgrave Chase.</p>
<p>The dissipated young father left his son in Margery  Melwood&rsquo;s care until the child was nearly ten years old. During all that time  the two boys, Humphrey Melwood and Gervoise Dudley Palgrave, had lived together  as brothers, sharing the same rustic pleasures, rifling birds&rsquo; nests in the  bright spring weather, blackberry-gathering in the sheltered country lanes,  hunting for hazel-nuts in the woods round the Chase, while my lord the young  Viscount Castleford, the earl&rsquo;s only son, played cricket with his aristocratic  companions in the meadows at Eton.</p>
<p>This boy, Viscount Castleford, only stood between  Humphrey Melwood&rsquo;s foster-brother and a fortune.</p>
<p>By and by George Augustus Palgrave took his son to London, and the boy grew  up in the West-end lodging-house, where his father lived a gay, bachelor life.  The lad picked up his education how he might; and that education was by no  means a good or a wise one, for George Augustus Davenant Palgrave&rsquo;s friends  were worthless, dissipated men, who had wasted their fortunes and taken to  living by their wits; and it was from these men that Gervoise picked up his  notions of right and wrong.</p>
<p>It may be imagined, therefore, that those notions  of good and evil were by no means the clearest or the best. Gervoise was  clever, brave, proud, sometimes generous; but he had the selfishness of the  Palgrave race &mdash; that one dark stain which had sullied the character of every  Palgrave since Aldroband, Baron of Haughton, had deserted the cause of Lancaster, and attached himself to the usurping house of York for his own  advancement. Gervoise was selfish. His own happiness, his own ease, were always  most dear to him. He married an ignorant, superficial girl for the love of her  pretty face; and was angry with her when he found her a dull companion, a  fretful, complaining fellow-traveller upon the dreary road of life.</p>
<p>It is possible that if Gervoise had been a better  man, Agatha might never have fallen to the depth of degradation to which she  had sunk when her husband lost patience with the miseries of his life, and  deserted the woman who had become a horrible and loathsome burden to him. He  lay now upon the truss of hay in Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s canvas habitation, thinking of  the past, thinking of those early days in which he had wandered in Palgrave  woods with Humphrey Melwood, unconscious of his aristocratic lineage, utterly  ignorant that the young viscount, who rode past the windows of the lodge upon  his well-groomed pony, was first cousin to the little ragamuffin who watched  him admiringly from behind the lattice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world has been a pleasant place for Sydney  Palgrave, Earl of Haughton,&rdquo; the strolling painter muttered to himself bitterly;  &ldquo;wealth and honour, a title, a noble estate, and a high-born bride. The child  who is to be born at Palgrave Chase will have a different fate from my poor  little one, whose best friend is Nancy Cadgers, the showman&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the bell ringing for the great event of  the day, the steeplechase, in which Lord Haughton was to ride, and he went out,  with his face half-hidden under his slouched felt hat.</p>
<p>The racecourse described an irregular circle upon  the hilly, uneven ground of the heath. Gervoise Palgrave went down to a spot  where there was a sharp curve in the course. A dangerous curve, people said,  for many a horse, going at flying speed, had locked his pastern joints in the  sudden turn.</p>
<p>At this spot, naturally dangerous, a double  six-foot fence had been constructed, and beyond the second fence a ditch had  been sunk. This was the worst bit of ground the gentlemen riders and their  horses would have to encounter, and a group of the knowing ones had clustered  down here, in preference to posting themselves upon the high ground near the  stand, whence a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the course was to be had.</p>
<p>Here Gervoise stationed himself, with his folded  arms resting upon the rough wooden barrier that bounded the race-course.</p>
<p>He had been standing there about five minutes,  listening to the talk of the knowing ones gathered round him, but by no means  interested in their discussion of the dangers of this particular spot, when he  heard a pair of horses reined up suddenly upon the smooth turf behind him.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s voice said gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place, Bolton.  This is the place which Lord Haughton says is the most dangerous. I will stop  here, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave looked round. A close carriage,  with a pair of splendid bays, had drawn up within a few paces of the wooden  barrier. The Haughton arms were emblazoned upon the panels, the Haughton crest  glistened upon the harness; and a woman, with a beautiful aristocratic face,  was looking out of the open window.</p>
<p>This woman was Rosalind Countess of Haughton.</p>
<p>A girl, a few years younger than the countess,  simply dressed, and looking like a humble companion, was seated opposite Lady  Haughton.</p>
<p>The countess looked with sad anxious eyes at the  double fence, the still water in the broad, yawning ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mary,&rdquo; she said in a low, tremulous voice, which  was audible to Gervoise, who stood close to the carriage, &ldquo;O Mary, what a  dangerous place, what a horrible place! I am convinced that something will  happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not think that, my lady,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The  earl declared, again and again, that there was no real danger with such a horse  as Devilshoof. But, indeed, my lady, it was very, very wrong of you to come. I  don&rsquo;t know what my lord would say if he knew that you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not stop away,&rdquo; the countess answered; &ldquo;I  could not endure the suspense, Mary. Think what agonies I must have suffered  had I stayed at the Chase hour after hour waiting for Sydney&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if his lordship should see you?&rdquo; remonstrated  the companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not see me. He will not think of me in the  excitement of the race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment another bell rang, and a shout from  the crowd upon the grand stand announced that the horses had started.</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave could not withdraw his eyes from  the face of the countess. The look of agony in that pale, anxious countenance  had a strange fascination for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They suffer, then, these prosperous people,&rdquo; he  said to himself; &ldquo;these favourites of fortune suffer, as well as the outcasts  who envy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the dull thud of the rushing hoofs upon  the turf. He turned, and the first two riders passed him almost abreast.</p>
<p>One of these foremost riders was Lord Haughton.</p>
<p>He was a handsome young man, not unlike Gervoise  Palgrave. He sat his horse magnificently, and his white-satin jacket, scarlet  sleeves and cap flashed brightly in the sunshine as he flew by.</p>
<p>The two riders flew triumphantly over the fences;  the horse&rsquo;s hoofs seemed scarcely to touch the ground in the space between the  first and second fence. The third rider was not quite so fortunate; he cleared  the two fences, but his horse plumped down in the water with a loud splash, and  the gentleman jockey was very nearly out of the saddle. He recovered himself  very cleverly, and flew after the foremost riders amid the cheers of the  bystanders.</p>
<p>The Countess of Haughton gave a faint, gasping cry  as her husband cleared the fences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;thank Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one of the lookers-on said to his companion,  &ldquo;They go round again, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re to ride twice round the course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. With straining eyes the eager  watchers of the race looked for the return of the riders. The interval was  brief enough, but it seemed long to many of those impatient witnesses who had  staked their money upon the issue of the race.</p>
<p>The dare-devil earl&rsquo;s horse, Devilshoof, was the  general favourite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Haughton&rsquo;s safe to win,&rdquo; muttered one of the  men near Gervoise; &ldquo;Devilshoof is a good name for his horse, for I think he&rsquo;s  got pluck enough to ride old Nick himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the rush of hoofs sounded upon the turf, and  the three riders came thundering down the hill.</p>
<p>This time Lord Haughton was half a quarter of a  mile ahead of his antagonists.</p>
<p>A great shout arose from all the lookers-on; a  hoarse, triumphant cry; the thunder of a thousand voices:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devilshoof &mdash; Devilshoof wins! Ten to one on  Devilshoof! Twenty to one on Devilshoof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earl rode his horse at the fence. He cleared  the first; his horse flew like a cat at the second, caught his hind hoofs in  the light brushwood at the top of the fence, went plunging down head foremost  into the water, and shot his rider off half-a-dozen yards ahead upon the turf.</p>
<p>The noble young rider in the white-satin jacket and  scarlet sleeves fell like a log, and lay like a log.</p>
<p>A long hideous shriek rang through the summer air.  There was a moment&rsquo;s breathless pause; and then a sturdy farmer broke from the  crowd, jumped across the barrier, and dragged the figure in the satin jacket  off the course as the two horses came tearing over the fences.</p>
<p>Devilshoof made a feeble effort to scramble up out  of the water, but fell again. The horse&rsquo;s head flew up as if he had been  stiffly reined-in &mdash; a sure symptom to the knowing ones that his back was  broken.</p>
<p>The man who dragged the earl off the course laid  him down on his back upon the grass; and the terrified crowd gathered round  that prostrate figure.</p>
<p>A couple of medical men came hurrying down from the  grand stand, whence they had seen the accident. One of them knelt down and laid  his hand upon the young man&rsquo;s breast. He turned very pale as he did so. Then he  hastily opened the satin jacket, put his hand under the earl&rsquo;s shirt, and  listened.</p>
<p>He listened with his head lowered almost to the  level of the prostrate man&rsquo;s breast. It seemed as if every creature in that  dense crowd waited with suspended breath to know the issue of the doctor&rsquo;s  examination.</p>
<p>Presently the medical man looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the countess away,&rdquo; he said to the other  doctor. &ldquo;I saw her carriage just now, on the other side of the course. Get her  away by any means. She must not know what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it &mdash; what is it? Is he dead?&rdquo; gasped the  foremost people in the crowd simultaneously.</p>
<p>The medical man did not answer them. He was talking  to his colleague in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death must have been instantaneous,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Concussion of the brain, no doubt. Get the countess away, my dear Morgan, and  directly. The news will spread like wildfire, and if you don&rsquo;t take care you&rsquo;ll  be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was too late. A frantic woman with a ghastly  face broke through the crowd as the medical man spoke. That woman was Rosalind  Countess of Haughton. People recognised her, and tried to stop her; they might  as well have endeavoured to stop a whirlwind.</p>
<p>She rushed into the open space round the dead man,  and flung herself upon her knees by his side.</p>
<p>She looked at the livid face, the wide-open eyes,  with such anguish in her own gaze as must have moved the hardest heart to pity.  Then she clasped her hands and looked up at the two medical men. One of them  was the doctor who attended all minor ailments in the household at Palgrave  Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;is he dead? It seems like  death to me; but it can&rsquo;t be &mdash; it can&rsquo;t be! Mr. Andrews, Mr. Morgan, why do you  stand there like that? Why don&rsquo;t you do something for my husband? Are you mad?  Why do you let him lie here? It&rsquo;s only a fainting-fit. O, for pity&rsquo;s sake, do  something for him! I tell you he has only fainted! Why don&rsquo;t you help him?  Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke into a wild, hysterical laugh, and fell  senseless upon that lifeless body. The medical men lifted her up, and carried  her across the course to her carriage, which had never moved; one of them got  into the carriage with the countess, and laid her on the seat. Mary Wood, the  companion, supported the unconscious woman in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; cried the doctor to the coachman; &ldquo;and as  fast as you can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The windows were drawn up, the carriage drove away.  There was no one to witness its departure. Everybody on that part of the course  was crowded around the spot where the young lord lay.</p>
<p>Gervoise had been one of the first to rush to that  spot. He stood foremost among the circle gathered round the motionless figure  in the satin jacket, staring blankly down at the dead man&rsquo;s face. His own face  was almost as colourless as the livid countenance of the dead. He was stupefied  by the suddenness of the catastrophe; and he could only stand there, silently  staring; powerless to move, almost unable to think.</p>
<p>Far away he heard the braying of brazen trumpets,  harsh and discordant, the clashing of cymbals, the beating of drums, the hoarse  voices of the showmen clamouring to the crowd. The news of the accident had not  yet circulated amongst the country people in the fair.</p>
<p>The stewards of the races consulted together, and  it was arranged by general consent that there should be no more races upon that  day; so much respect, at least, should be paid to the lord of Palgrave Chase.</p>
<p>Had it been a professional jockey who had been  killed, it would have been, of course, quite a different matter. The awkward  business would have been hushed up, and the day&rsquo;s sport would have proceeded  without interruption.</p>
<p>One of the doors belonging to the refreshment-rooms  below the grand stand was torn from its hinges, and upon this rough litter the  dead man was laid. They covered the lifeless figure with a carriage-rug, and  carried their dismal burden away towards a short cut that led through the  meadows to Avondale. The surgeon walked by the side of the litter.</p>
<p>The horse, Devilshoof, was shot through the head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheKingIsDeadLongLiveTheKing"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  The King Is Dead: Long Live The King!</h2>
<p>Even after that gloomy procession had moved away,  Gervoise Palgrave stood near the spot upon which his dead kinsman had been  lying. Bewildered and terror-stricken, he had not yet been able to shake off  the utter stupefaction of mingled surprise and horror, or to think calmly of  the event that had just happened.</p>
<p>His cousin was dead. The principal barrier that had  stood between himself and fortune was suddenly swept away; and what obstacle  remained? Only the unborn child, the heir that was expected at Palgrave Chase.</p>
<p>If that child should be a girl, Gervoise Palgrave  would be Earl of Haughton.</p>
<p>The young man passed his hand across his hot  forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, &ldquo;I think I  must be going mad! A wretch tramping about the streets of London in search of  bread only a few weeks ago; and perhaps the master of Palgrave Chase, and one  of the first men in Warwickshire, to-morrow. Bah!&rdquo; he cried suddenly, shrugging  his shoulders with a contemptuous gesture, &ldquo;am I a fool, that I stand here  dreaming of these things? Is it like my luck that this should happen? No, the  child will be a boy; and the joy-peal will ring for the birth of the new lord  before the funeral bell has tolled for his father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd had dispersed after the departure of the  men who carried the Earl of Haughton&rsquo;s body, and Gervoise was alone in the  little valley near the fatal double fence. He walked away from the racecourse  to the loneliest part of the common, scarcely knowing whither he went; but he  still heard the braying of brazen trumpets, the clashing of cymbals, the  beating of drums, and the hoarse voices of the showmen clamouring to the crowd.</p>
<p>The tidings of the young lord&rsquo;s death had  penetrated to the remotest part of the common by this time; but still the fair  went on. The country people had come a long way for their day&rsquo;s pleasure, and  were not to be cheated out of their enjoyment. The interruption and  postponement of the races was a very good thing for the merchants and showmen,  the circuses and merry-go-rounds, and the fair was doing splendidly.</p>
<p>Little Georgey Palgrave, kinsman to the dead man,  was dancing gaily on the platform before Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s booth, with coloured  ribbons round his boyish head.</p>
<p>It was twilight by the time Gervoise Palgrave  returned to the tent of his employer. The <i>troupe</i> had eaten their dinner, and kind-hearted Nancy Cadgers had put aside a plate of  cold ham and sausages, with half a loaf of bread, and some beer in a stone  bottle, for the scene-painter; but Gervoise could eat nothing. He took two or  three mouthfuls of bread, drank a brief draught of ale, and then lighted his  pipe, and flung himself once more upon the truss of hay.</p>
<p>The show was still going on. He could hear the  horses hoofs upon the sawdust, the slashing of whips, the tinkling of bells,  the merry laughter and loud applause of the audience, and the &ldquo;Houp l&agrave;, loupe!&rdquo;  of the ring-master. Then the horses rested, and the gloomy clown, Herr von  Volterchoker, amused the public.</p>
<p>The noise seemed deafening and bewildering to the  overheated brain of Gervoise Palgrave. He clasped his hands upon his forehead  and tried to think; but he could not collect his thoughts. A confusion of light  and colour danced before his dazzled eyes. It seemed to him as if the horses in  the ring were rushing round and round in his own distempered brain. He had lain  like this for about an hour, smoking his short, blackened pipe, and trying to  think, when the canvas that separated this corner of the booth from the ring  was divided, and a man&rsquo;s face looked through the division; a dark,  sinister-looking countenance, framed with grizzled hair. It was the face of  Herr von Volterchoker, the dismal clown. He watched Gervoise for some minutes  before he spoke; but the young man was quite unconscious of the watchful gaze  of those black, fierce-looking eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re uncommonly quiet in there,&rdquo; the clown said  at last.</p>
<p>Gervoise looked up with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said absently; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem so. Have you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the news that&rsquo;s just come to the fair.  There&rsquo;s a new master at Palgrave Chase; a master that isn&rsquo;t two hours old yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy!&rdquo; gasped Gervoise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, her ladyship&rsquo;s baby is a boy. The news of the  young vermin&rsquo;s birth is upon everybody&rsquo;s lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Merriman, Mr. Merriman!&rdquo; cried a voice from  the ring. &ldquo;Come here, Mr. Merriman, and tell these ladies and gentlemen what is  the difference between my wife&rsquo;s tin teakettle and the Hemperor of Roosia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clown closed the canvas division and went back  into the ring. Gervoise Palgrave covered his face with his hands and sobbed  aloud.</p>
<p>Then he knew, for the first time, that he had hoped  to succeed to his kinsman&rsquo;s title and fortune. After his first horror at the  earl&rsquo;s sudden death, hope had sprung up in his heart &mdash; a wild desperate hope,  that had almost maddened him. His manhood gave way before this horrible  disappointment.</p>
<p>He sat motionless, with his face buried in his  hands, for some time. Then he was aroused by little soft fingers, which twined  themselves about his own, and tried to pull his hands away from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, papa!&rdquo; cried a childish voice.</p>
<p>Gervoise uncovered his head and looked up. The boy  George stood before him in his fantastical dress, smiling at his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go to sleep, papa,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so  tired, and my new mammy told me I was to come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child called the friendly Nancy Cadgers his new  mammy. The showman&rsquo;s wife had been very good to George, who was not accustomed  to kindness &mdash; from a woman.</p>
<p>Gervoise took the boy up in his arms, wrapped him  in a shabby greatcoat, and laid him down upon the hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new-born earl lies in a cradle sheltered with  curtains of silk and lace, I daresay,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, as he watched  the child&rsquo;s face; &ldquo;but my boy is a beggar&rsquo;s brat, and is glad to sleep on such  a bed as a dog might lie upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He filled and lighted his pipe again, and sat down  upon an empty beer-cask. He watched the sleeping child with a gloomy face.  Dark, angry thoughts were busy in his breast. He hated the young countess and  her two-hours-old babe.</p>
<p>It was past ten o&rsquo;clock, but the uproar of the fair  was louder than ever. The horses were still cantering round amidst the sawdust  in the ring, the trumpets were braying, the drums sounding. Gervoise Palgrave  sat in the same attitude for nearly half an hour, smoking slowly, and watching  his sleeping child.</p>
<p>Suddenly the canvas which divided the booth from  the open common was lifted, and a young man, hot, breathless, and panting,  burst into the tent.</p>
<p>Gervoise sprang to his feet. The young man was  Humphrey Melwood, the under-gamekeeper of Palgrave Chase. His face was flushed,  his eyes were bright with excitement. He flung himself upon his knees on the  ground, and kissed Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;brother! I&rsquo;ve run here like a  madman. I can scarce get breath to speak. My wish has come, Lord Haughton &mdash;  Lord Haughton! There&rsquo;s nobody but me knows you&rsquo;re here, and I&rsquo;m first to tell  you &mdash; I&rsquo;m first to cry huzza for the new master of Palgrave Chase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey Mel wood raised his voice as he said this.  Once more the canvas was divided and the face of the clown appeared in the  narrow opening. But the eager face of the spy was unperceived by the two men;  Gervoise and his foster-brother stood with their backs towards Herr von  Volterchoker. For an instant Gervoise stood staring vacantly at his  foster-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mad, Humphrey,&rdquo; he cried half angrily;  &ldquo;you are mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not mad, Master Gervoise, but like to be,&rdquo;  answered the young man. &ldquo;You are Earl of Haughton! Last night you were walking  about Avondale afraid to show yourself in your shabby clothes, wild and  desperate, talking about ending your days in a river; to-night you are the  master of Palgrave Chase. The poor countess is dying; the child died within an  hour of its birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Master Gervoise. Ah, my lord &mdash; I mustn&rsquo;t call  you Master Gervoise any longer &mdash; the days are gone for ever when I might call  you brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Humphrey &mdash; no, no,&rdquo; answered Gervoise. &ldquo;If  this is all true &mdash; if it is not some distempered dream, as it seems to me it  must be &mdash; why then I will be more your brother than ever. Adversity is a hard  master, Humphrey; and those who suffer are apt to think very little of the  sufferings of others. But prosperity softens a man&rsquo;s heart. I&rsquo;ll be a true  friend to you, Humphrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand as he spoke, and grasped the  horny fingers of the gamekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you for those words, Master Gervoise! The  world will be all at your feet now, and money&rsquo;s very powerful; but for all it&rsquo;s  so powerful, there are <i>some</i> things it  can&rsquo;t do, and those are just the very things that a faithful friend <i>can</i> do. You see this arm, Master  Gervoise,&rdquo; cried the gamekeeper, stretching out his muscular right arm and  clenching his powerful fist; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s many about Avondale as could tell you  that it isn&rsquo;t a weak one. If there&rsquo;s anyone that wronged you, I&rsquo;d as lief  strike him down with that arm as I&rsquo;d crush a worm that came in my pathway. It&rsquo;s  not many people I care for, Master Gervoise, but there&rsquo;s something more than  common in the love I bear you; I must have sucked it in with my mother&rsquo;s milk,  I suppose, for it seems as if it was mixed with the blood that runs in my  veins, and I think every drop of that blood would turn to liquid fire if I knew  that anyone had injured you. Heaven help them that harmed you, that&rsquo;s all!  Heaven keep &rsquo;em safe out of <i>my</i> pathway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s eyes flamed as he spoke, but  Gervoise Palgrave scarcely heeded him. He was standing quite still, looking  down at the child asleep upon the hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his sake,&rdquo; he muttered&mdash; &ldquo;if I were not  thankful for my own sake, how glad I ought to be for him! &mdash; I will try and be a  good man, and deserve the fortune that has come to me.&rdquo; He said this to  himself; then he cried aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out into the air, Humphrey; I shall choke, I  shall faint, if I stay in this stifling place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted the canvas and went out, followed by the  gamekeeper. The naphtha lamps were flaming against the purple of the sky. The  thousand voices of the clamorous crowd mingled in one loud uproar.</p>
<p>As the two young men left the tent, Herr von  Volterchoker parted the canvas, and came through the opening into the place  where little Georgey lay asleep.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Lost"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Lost</h2>
<p>The new lord of Haughton and his foster-brother  walked away from the crowded avenues where the country people were clustered  about the stalls. They left the noise and confusion of the fair behind them,  and went down into the hollow in which Sydney Earl of Haughton met his untimely  death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me as if it couldn&rsquo;t be <i>true&rdquo;</i> Gervoise said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too sudden,  too strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true, Master Gervoise, for all that,&rdquo;  answered Humphrey. &ldquo;Mother went up to the great house when she heard that my  lord was killed, and my lady brought home in a dying state, as folks said. She  went up to the house, and she was in the servants&rsquo;-hall when the news of the  baby&rsquo;s birth was brought from my lady&rsquo;s room, and she was there when the news  of his death came, less than an hour afterwards. Poor little fellow, he was  born before his time, the doctors say, and the countess was said to be dying  when I came away. I&rsquo;m sorry for her, poor lady. She was proud, but she was kind  and charitable, for all that, and she loved the very ground my lord walked on.  If he&rsquo;d listened to her he wouldn&rsquo;t have ridden Devilshoof to-day, for they say  she went down upon her knees to him to prevent him; but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to  her. So it was his selfishness that caused his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selfishness, the one blemish upon the character of  almost every scion of the house of Palgrave; selfishness, which was now  paramount in the breast of Gervoise, now lord of Palgrave Chase, for he could  not think of the heart-broken wife&rsquo;s despair, the young mother&rsquo;s bitter agony;  he could only think of himself, his own unparalleled good fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody must know that I have been down here,  Humphrey,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nobody must ever know that I have fallen so low as to be  the companion of a wandering showman and his vulgar <i>troupe</i>. Messrs. Peck and Featherby, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn,  were the Earl of Haughton&rsquo;s lawyers. They knew my father well, and they have  known me from my boyhood. They have the certificate of my fathers marriage, my  own birth, and all documents necessary to my identification. I shall go up to London by the first train  to-morrow morning, and go straight to them. But I cannot take Georgey with me.  The child would be a hindrance to me at such a time as this. Will you take him  to your mother&rsquo;s cottage, Humphrey, and look after him until I come back to  Warwickshire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I, Master Gervoise?&rdquo; cried the gamekeeper.  &ldquo;Ay, that I will, and watch over him as I would over the crown-jewels if I was  trusted with the care of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Humphrey. I know I can trust you. You  talked about money last night, and I refused your offer; tonight I&rsquo;ll borrow a  couple of sovereigns of you, if you have got so much about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; answered the young man;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a steady chap now, though I have been such a precious wild one, and I&rsquo;ve  saved a pound or two out of my wages.&rdquo; The gamekeeper took a washleather purse  from his pocket, unrolled it, and produced three sovereigns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&rsquo;s better than two, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; he  said; you&rsquo;d better take the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Humphrey,&rdquo; answered Gervoise Palgrave,  &ldquo;for I can afford to pay you fifty-fold when I come back. This will take me up  to London; Peck  and Featherby will lend me plenty of money when I get there. You&rsquo;ll take care  of the boy, Humphrey. He&rsquo;s very dear to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he shall be dearer to me than if he was my  own, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; cried the gamekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well take him home to-night, then,&rdquo;  said his foster-brother; &ldquo;these people have been very good to him, and I shall  take care to reward them for their goodness, by and by. But I don&rsquo;t want them  to know who I am, or any thing about me; so I should like to get the boy away  quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earl and his foster-brother walked back towards  Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s booth.</p>
<p>The glory of the fair was over now, for it was past  midnight; the fires were dying slowly out; many of the lights had been  extinguished. The crowd had thinned; only drunkards and dissipated men and  women, the inveterate and insatiable pleasure-seekers, still lingered in the  alleys between the stalls, and in the open spaces before the shows.</p>
<p>Mr. Cadgers had shut up his establishment for the  night, and the front of the circus was dark.</p>
<p>As Gervoise and Humphrey came within a few paces of  the canvas opening at the back of the booth, they saw a tall, gaunt figure  coming towards them, and the Earl of Haughton recognised his late associate,  Herr von Volterchoker, the clown.</p>
<p>He came up to them and looked at Gervoise with an  expression of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the boy?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What boy! &mdash; why little Georgey, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where should he be,&rdquo; returned Gervoise, &ldquo;except  where I left him &mdash; on the truss of hay in there?&rdquo; He pointed to the booth as he  spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you take him with you, then?&rdquo; cried the  clown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Gervoise, his face blanched with  sudden fear. &ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;the boy is in there, I tell you. I  left him there a quarter of an hour ago, asleep upon the hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not there now, then,&rdquo; answered the clown.  &ldquo;Mrs. Cadgers wants to put him to bed with the other lads, and has been looking  for him everywhere. I told her you were out, and I thought, of course, you&rsquo;d  taken the child with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Gervoise; &ldquo;I left him there  asleep. He must have got up and gone out into the fair to look at the other  shows. He can&rsquo;t be far away. You go one way, Volterchoker, there&rsquo;s a good chap,  while I go the other; we shall find him in five minutes, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay we shall,&rdquo; answered the clown. &ldquo;O, by  the bye, there&rsquo;s been a woman here inquiring for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; exclaimed Gervoise; &ldquo;a woman inquiring  for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and very anxious she seemed to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she ask for Mr. Jarvis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she asked for some such name as Gil &mdash; stay! &mdash;  Gilbert,&rdquo; answered the clown, speaking slowly, and watching Gervoise&rsquo;s face as  he spoke.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Gervoise Gilbert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Gervoise Gilbert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she a young woman with black eyes and hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it before you missed the child or after, that  you saw this woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five minutes before. She said she&rsquo;d wait to  see you, and I left her standing close to the opening in the canvas. I went  round to the front of the circus to help Cadgers put out the lights. When I  came back the woman was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the child was gone, too?&rdquo; cried Gervoise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it was after that we missed the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I understand it all!&rdquo; exclaimed Gervoise  Palgrave passionately. &ldquo;The child has been stolen &mdash; my boy has been stolen by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom, Master Gervoise?&rdquo; asked Humphrey Melwood.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;By the person who is the worst enemy he has in the world. Look you, Humphrey,  and you, Volterchoker,&rdquo; cried Gervoise impetuously, &ldquo;you can both help me in  this business. That woman has stolen the child; but she cannot have got far  away yet. If we all three go different ways we may find her. You will recognise  her, Volterchoker. You may know her easily, Humphrey &mdash; a dark woman with a fair-haired  child. Run, run like good fellows. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t find me slow <i>to</i> reward you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men separated. They went into the alleys  between the gingerbread stalls, they searched the open spaces before the  booths, they looked into every place where it was likely the woman might have  hidden, they made inquiries of every creature they met; but their efforts were  useless &mdash; they could discover no trace of the woman or the child. They wandered  about, meeting one another every now and then, and communicating their bad  fortune. They walked about until two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Every light was  extinguished; it seemed as if every creature except these three men slept  peacefully under the shelter of the canvas booths.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker was as indefatigable as either  of his companions. He made inquiries right and left of his comrades in the  fair. Nearly everybody knew him and answered him civilly, and tried to give him  what help they could; and so, indeed, did they show themselves willing to aid  all three searchers. There was only one man, a surly-looking Italian, who was  grinding away at a barrel-organ, and putting a tired monkey through a series of  grotesque performances, who answered at all uncivilly when Gervoise Palgrave  questioned him.</p>
<p>At last, when the Italian had left off grinding,  and the monkey was at rest &mdash; when the silent tents were as quiet beneath the  moonlight as the ghostly camp of some phantom army, and the solemn sound of  Avondale church clock striking two floated up to the hilly common on the soft  autumn air &mdash; the three men abandoned all hope, and went back towards Mr.  Cadgers&rsquo;s booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you both,&rdquo; Gervoise Palgrave said; &ldquo;and  before a week is out, I will reward you both. I know the person who has taken  the child, and, by the heaven above us, she shall be made to restore him to me!  Good-night, Humphrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand to the gamekeeper, who grasped  it warmly in both his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the child  will be found, never doubt. But where will you sleep to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall sleep at all, Humphrey,  for the matter of that,&rdquo; Gervoise answered. &ldquo;I shall go down to Avondale at  once, and put this business into the hands of the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go with you, Mr. Gervoise,&rdquo; said the gamekeeper.</p>
<p>The two men went away together  down the hill  and through the meadows, into the quiet little town. They went straight to the  police-station, and knocked up the officials. Gervoise stated his case,  described the woman and child, and told the police-officer to issue a bill,  offering a reward of a hundred pounds for the finding of the boy. Gervoise told  the man who he was, under a pledge of secrecy; and Humphrey Melwood, who was  well known to the police-officer, corroborated his foster-brother. The first  glimmer of morning light was gray in the eastern sky by the time Gervoise went  back to the booth upon the common.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker lay fast asleep upon a heap  of loose straw in a corner of the circus when Gervoise entered the tent; but he  had not been asleep long. He had returned through the silent alleys in the fair  during the new earl&rsquo;s absence, and had found a feeble light glimmering in the  caravan of the Italian organ-grinder. The clown had stopped at the door of this  tent, talking to the Italian itinerant for about a quarter of an hour, and had  then gone slowly back to Mr. Cadgers&rsquo;s establishment.</p>
<p>When the sun rose next morning, and the traders and  showmen made their preparations for the second day&rsquo;s fair, there was no trace  of the organ-grinder and the monkey. He had departed from Avondale common in  the early morning, with the organ and the monkey, in his gaudily-painted little  caravan.</p>
<p>Early upon that second day of the fair, Gervoise  travelled up to London,  and went straight to the offices of Messrs. Peck and Featherby. They had not  heard of the accident at Avondale, and it was as much as they could do to  believe Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s account of the steeplechase, and the death of the  new-born heir. But they did believe him at last, and congratulated him most  heartily upon his unexpected good fortune. It mattered very little to Messrs.  Peck and Featherby whether their client was Sydney Earl of Haughton, or  Gervoise Earl of Haughton, so long as he gave them plenty of law-business to  do, and paid long bills of costs without any vulgar examination or taxation of  the same.</p>
<p>So there had been a sudden turn in the wheel of  Fortune, and the penniless outcast was now the acknowledged master of Palgrave  Chase; but a feeling of bitterness was mingled with his triumph, a drop of  poison in the wine of life. The child for whose sake he had often prayed for  fortune was lost to him, for a time at least; perhaps for ever. The boy had  fallen into the power of that cruel and drunken mother, and if the new Earl of  Haughton acknowledged his only son, he must also acknowledge his drunken wife.</p>
<p>The selfishness of the Palgrave race triumphed even  over the feelings of the father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better that I should lose the son I love than that  I should burden myself with the wife I hate,&rdquo; thought Gervoise Palgrave, as he  drove away from Gray&rsquo;s Inn with a cheque for a hundred pounds in his pocket,  advanced by Messrs. Peck and Featherby, for his immediate requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ANewLifeAndANewLove"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  A New Life And A New Love</h2>
<p>The funeral of the Earl and Countess of Haughton  was one of the grandest ceremonials ever beheld by the wondering eyes of  Avondale within this present generation. Not since Elizabeth of England and her  attendant train of all the flower of English nobility had ridden down the  street, had there been a grander scene than these solemn funeral pomps  furnished for the curious townsfolk, and the vast crowd of spectators who  pressed into the town from all the country side.</p>
<p>The earl and his countess had been liked, and the  regret felt for their sudden and melancholy fate was sincere and profound; but  those who mourned for the king that was dead, were none the less interested in  the sovereign who reigned in his place, and eager were the glances cast at  Gervoise Palgrave, seventh Earl of Haughton, the chief mourner in that solemn  train of sable chariots and horses, and plume-surmounted, silver-blazoned  hearse.</p>
<p>The crowd pronounced the new earl a true Palgrave,  as indeed he was, to the very core of his heart. Within a month of the funeral  he took possession of Palgrave Chase, quietly, and without unnecessary  demonstration of his new authority. The old servants he retained without  exception. Humphrey Melwood&rsquo;s position he improved so far as that very  self-willed individual would allow it to be improved, and this was to no very  great extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me serve you, sir; that&rsquo;s the only favour I  ask, and that&rsquo;s the only favour I&rsquo;ll receive,&rdquo; said the young man resolutely.</p>
<p>Gervoise improved the gothic lodge with some  additional conveniences for the comfort of his old nurse, to whom he presented  a hundred-pound bank-note to buy her a new gown, as he said; and the dame,  bewildered by the idea of such vast wealth, cried over and kissed him,  declaring that she had always prophesied his greatness.</p>
<p>There are few nobler places in England than the mansion, park, and  woods known as Palgrave Chase. A great quadrangular edifice of gray stone,  surmounted at every angle by a massive gothic tower. On the southern and  principal side, a range of three terraces, with stone balustrades, and broad  flights of shallow steps. Within the quadrangle, a noble court, stone paved,  with a sculptured fountain, Neptune and a  group of sea-horses, in the centre. On the northern side, a range of gothic  windows, terminating at each extremity with an oriel in the tower, looking down  upon a broad rushing stream which crosses the park and woods of Palgrave Chase  on its way to join the Avon.</p>
<p>Of this grand old mansion, of park and woods, of  farmlands and homesteads, the leases whereof filled three large tin boxes, in  the iron safes of the Palgrave muniment-room, was Gervoise master; he who had  found it a hard and difficult thing to pay the weekly rent of a garret in St.  Giles&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The sense of pride and rapture which went with this  sudden, bewildering change of fortune, somewhat deadened the pain of that one  bitter grief which had come upon him in the very hour of his triumph; but  despite of this, the grief was poignant. His son, the boy who had been so sweet  a care, so dear a companion in the day of his trouble, was lost to him in the  day of his joy. By that broad stream glancing silvery bright beneath the dark  foliage of forest-trees, those two should have wandered hand in hand; and the  father paced the green turf alone, despondent. How sweetly the dear familiar  childish voice would have echoed in those long stately corridors. But the corridors  were silent as the grave, and the father felt that in all their splendour they  were gloomy.</p>
<p>The earl omitted to take no step that could be  taken to recover the missing child; but all his efforts were fruitless. Skilful  detectives searched London  for the little one, whom they were taught to recognise by the initials tattooed  upon his wrist; but they sought in vain. In his intercourse with the Avondale  police-constable, Gervoise had taken care to conceal his relationship to the  child. In his intercourse with the metropolitan police he was still more  cautious, and concealed his own identity, securing their confidence by liberal  advances in the present, and their hearty cooperation by munificent promises  for the future. All was without avail. In the great labyrinth of life the boy  Georgey had vanished utterly from the ken of skilled detectives.</p>
<p>For a time, Gervoise Palgrave mourned his child  honestly. He refused all invitations from those new county friends who had been  so &ldquo;uncommonly fond of that thundering rascal, but remarkably gentlemanly  fellow, his father, you know,&rdquo; and wanted &ldquo;to do the civil thing for the  fellow, you know; and introduce him to the big-wigs, and so on, you know.&rdquo; All  these invitations from strangers eager to do him service, Lord Haughton  politely refused. He lived shut up in the luxurious suite of apartments that  had been fitted up for the last earl, whose meerschaum-pipes he smoked, and  whose horses he rode; for the last master of the Chase had not been given to  pious meditation, or philosophical argument on the uncertainty of life, and had  died intestate, whereby his personal, as well as his real, property passed to  the cousin of whom he knew so little.</p>
<p>For a time, Gervoise mourned honestly; but with the  thought of his son&rsquo;s disappearance was ever mingled the dread of his wife&rsquo;s  reappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows nothing of my altered fortunes,&rdquo; he said  to himself, &ldquo;or she&rsquo;d be here, soon enough, to drag me into the mud. And to  think that she should have traced me to Avondale, should have been there that  very night, and should have turned her back upon me, ignorant of my altered  fortunes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time passed, and the poignancy of his grief  lessened, and this intense feeling was followed by an utter weariness, a sense  of the emptiness of his new life. The cup at first had seemed all sweetness  save for that one drop of poison. Now it seemed vapid and tasteless, if not <i>all</i> poison. To live in that handsome  house; to dine off plate that had been in the Palgrave plate-room since the  Restoration, before which historic event it had been pledged to Dutch  money-lenders for the service of the king; to ride a horse worth three hundred  pounds; to sleep in the shade of black-velvet curtains whose heraldic  embroideries in gold bullion and rose silk had been worked in the days of Queen  Bess; &mdash; all these things after a little while ceased to delight the soul of  Gervoise Palgrave. There was a void somewhere.</p>
<p>Early in November he determined to try whether this  void in his soul could be filled by the pleasures of the chase. He appeared in  the hunting-field, where he followed the Palgrave hounds, which he had pledged  himself to maintain in all perfection, and showed himself a very fair horseman.</p>
<p>The county people were delighted. They declared  that his seclusion during the period of mourning for the late earl and countess  did credit alike to his head and heart; for no one supposed that the new earl  could have any special grief of his own to keep him in the solitude of his  ancestral halls.</p>
<p>His appearance in the hunting-field was taken as a  sign that the period of his seclusion was ended. He was besieged with  invitations; and one of these, in a most evil hour, he accepted.</p>
<p>It was an invitation to a hunting-breakfast at Sir  Langley Hurst&rsquo;s, a man of some standing in the county, but a man who owed his  wealth and title to commerce. Sir Langley was a great man in the iron trade.  His father, and his grandfather before him, had made fortunes out of iron, and  his elder brother had died three years before this date, leaving a million of money  &mdash; or an amount which Avondale and its neighbourhood were pleased to call a  million &mdash; to an only child, a girl of nineteen.</p>
<p>This youthful millionaire, Ethel Hurst, resided  under her uncle&rsquo;s roof, and was the darling of that wealthy baronet&rsquo;s household.  Sir Langley boasted a patriarchal family of sons and daughters; amongst them  there was one to whom Ethel was something dearer than cousin. This was Stephen  Hurst, the baronet&rsquo;s second son, who had taken high honours at Oxford,  and for whom his father&rsquo;s political influence had secured the living of Pendon,  a pleasant settlement, something betwixt an overgrown village and a  newly-blossoming town, between Avondale and Hyford Hall, the bran-new red-brick  Elizabethan mansion of the Hursts.</p>
<p>Ethel&rsquo;s wealth was partly derived from a very fine  agricultural estate in the county, certain frontages and odd lots whereof were  just beginning to ripen into building-land, and partly from very considerable  investments in Consols. A finer fortune does not often fall to the lot of a  light-hearted, unsophisticated damsel of nineteen, whose personal expenditure,  inclusive of bounteous charities, had never exceeded five hundred a-year.</p>
<p>For Stephen Hurst&rsquo;s poor, Ethel was the sweetest of  ministering angels; for Stephen himself she was but too sweet, too lovely, too  dear, since his clear perception had long ago enabled him to make a bitter  discovery in the fact that, however dear Ethel might be to him, he was no more  to Ethel than &mdash; a cousin. Sir Langley&rsquo;s fondest hope had been that Ethel and  his eldest son, Gordon Palgrave, godson of the old Lord Haughton, and captain  in a crack Hussar regiment, would make a match of it, and thus unite the two  branches of the Hursts,  and the fine properties of Hyford and Culverly.</p>
<p>But the paternal scheme was not destined to  prosper. Gordon Palgrave, the handsome young captain of Hussars, whose name, in  the choice language of his comrades, &ldquo;stunk of money,&rdquo; had been spoiled by  garrison belles of the fast and furious order, and stigmatised his pretty cousin  with the vile epithet &ldquo;muffish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goes about with flannel and tea and tracts to  queer old parties in cottages,&rdquo; said the young Brummel; &ldquo;teaches in national  schools, and pats the dirty little ruffians&rsquo; heads, and that kind of thing.  Couldn&rsquo;t stand <i>that</i> in a wife, you  know. Course, man who marries must prepare himself for a good deal; wife  running away with the only fellow he likes, you know, and that kind of thing,  which really seems very hard upon a fellow to lose the only fellow he can get  on with, in that disreputable manner; and &rsquo;pon my soul, a woman who can rob a  man of his best friend must be a regular out-and-outer, lost to all sense of  honour, and that kind of thing. But if a man&rsquo;s wife <i>begins</i> with poking her nose into stuffy old cottages, where the  dooce is she to end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Ethel, the brilliant captain appeared a strange  compound of idiotcy and impertinence. His eyeglass, his carefully-waxed  moustache, his all-pervading odour of jockey-club, his contempt for everything  under the sun except some half-dozen &ldquo;fellows,&rdquo; his bosom friends, &mdash; all these  attributes of the modem young man were alike distasteful to her, and she always  fancied the atmosphere clearer when the captain&rsquo;s leave expired, and he  withdrew his august presence from the paternal halls.</p>
<p>Fancy-free as the famed virgin sung by Shakespeare  &mdash; who, by the way, never seems to have been in that blissful condition for one  hour of her anxious life &mdash; is described to have been in the poet&rsquo;s politic  compliment, Ethel Hurst roamed the well-kept gardens of Hyford Hall, until that  fateful day when Gervoise Palgrave, who had refused invitations from men of  much higher standing, made his social <i>d&eacute;but</i> at Sir Langley&rsquo;s hunting-breakfast.</p>
<p>Whether it was love at first sight who shall say?  First sight showed Lord Haughton one of the fairest faces he had ever looked  upon, a face as innocently bright as Milton&rsquo;s Eve in the first bloom of her  purity, a face in which loveliness of soul shone predominant over earthly  beauty of tint and outline, though these were almost perfection. For some time  Gervoise Palgrave was unconscious of any peril to his own peace of mind in the  admiration which he felt for Ethel Hurst. Had he not a right to admire this  lovely image of girlish innocence, just as freely as he admired the well-chosen  pictures and statues wherewith Sir Langley had decorated his spacious rooms and  broad Elizabethan corridors. He told himself that he had a right so to admire  this fair candid girl, who met him always with the same sweet smile of welcome,  and he told himself that the pleasure he felt in her society arose from no  deeper feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can she, or any other woman upon this earth,  ever be to me,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;nearer or dearer than the beauty of a picture or a  statue &mdash; something to admire from a distance? I had my dream and my fancy, and  have paid the bitter price of that fool&rsquo;s paradise which I chose for my earthly  heaven. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> all past and done  with. And as for the folly men call love<i> &mdash; je m&rsquo;en moque!</i> When the grim old suits of armour at the Chase come down  from their pedestals, and go out to make love, <i>I</i> may be caught a second time. But it shall not be <i>until</i> then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a man beguiles his reason with such  sophistries as these, it is a pretty sure sign that he is already gone past  redemption on the broad high-road which leads to the Temple of Folly.  Gervoise Palgrave deceived himself wilfully, obstinately, madly shutting his  eyes to the truth. He told himself that if he liked to come to Hyford Hall, it  was for Sir Langley&rsquo;s genial society, for the captain&rsquo;s billiard-playing, for  Stephen&rsquo;s intellectual conversation, for the pleasant county folks he met  there, for the exciting sport of archery, in which the Misses Adelina, Sophia,  Bessie, and Gertrude Hurst excelled; for anything and everything except the  real magnetic influence which drew him to the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I shut myself up in those dreary rooms  at the Chase when the Hursts are always glad to  have me with them?&rdquo; he said to himself, quite ignoring the fact that his  predilection for the society of the Hursts  was giving much offence to his other friends amongst the county gentry. By and  by this fact was made known to him, and at Christmas he gave a ball, a very  grand affair, at which all the best people in the county were present, and at  which her most splendid majesty the Marchioness of Stepletour kindly presided  as hostess. Ethel was the acknowledged belle, though perhaps the fact would  scarcely have been so readily admitted if the young lady had not been an  heiress, and a landowner of some importance. On the night of this festival, did  Gervoise for the first time discover the construction which had been put upon  his devotion to the Hurst  household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to marry one of those bold Hurst girls,&rdquo; said a young  lady of the genus fast, close to his elbow, as he was struggling for an ice in  the crowded refreshment-room. <i>&ldquo;</i>I only  hope it is not the one with the big hook-nose, Adelina; she&rsquo;s the most stuck  up, purse-proud creature. That rich cousin of theirs, Ethel, is engaged to  Stephen Hurst, the rector of Pendon; awfully High Church,  you know, he is, and goodness knows what lengths he&rsquo;ll go when he gets Ethel&rsquo;s  money. I know he wants to introduce choral services at Pendon; but the Pendon  people are disgustingly Low, and I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d ever stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Engaged to Stephen Hurst! The quick, angry  throbbing of his heart told Gervoise Palgrave in this moment, if he had never  known as much before, that Ethel was something more to him than a picture or a  statue. In this one moment he knew that he loved her, and loved her  passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will know the truth at once,&rdquo; he muttered, half  beside himself with jealous rage; &ldquo;she can never be anything to me, no, God  help me! I know that. But I will not be duped and fooled by her sweet looks,  her downcast eyes; I will ascertain from her own lips whether she loves this  man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, he loved her, and had allowed himself to think  his affection was returned. The remembrance of the looks and tones that had  nourished this sweet delusion came back to him sharply. Could that  innocent-seeming girl be a consummate coquette after all?</p>
<p>He remembered words and looks of Stephen&rsquo;s that had  been something more than cousinly &mdash; anxious, watchful looks that followed  Ethel&rsquo;s light steps; earnest tones, expressive of more than kindred&rsquo;s common  affection.</p>
<p>The next dance was a waltz, which the master of  Palgrave Chase and Ethel Hurst were to dance together. After the dance he led  her into a picture-gallery under the pretext of showing her the old family  portraits, and there, with a strange abruptness, asked her the portentous  question, whether she was or was not the promised wife of her cousin Stephen.</p>
<p>The heiress blushed crimson, paused for a moment,  utterly embarrassed by the sudden question, and then replied in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Haughton with intense  feeling; and then they both stood silent, motionless, the girl&rsquo;s changing  colour, downcast eyelids, and tremulous lips betraying but too plainly her  cherished secret.</p>
<p>The temptation of that moment was too much for  Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s fortitude. He bent over the sweet face he loved, clasped  the shrinking form in his arms with a sudden, passionate embrace, and imprinted  one despairing kiss upon the pure brow. Thus far, passion had its way with him;  then cold, stern, cruel reason came to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own one, my darling, forgive me!&rdquo; he said,  releasing the offended girl. &ldquo;I was mad. For pity&rsquo;s sake forgive me. I have no  right to speak of my love to you; no right &mdash; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden influx of waltzers in the gallery, as the  last chords of the waltz sounded from the orchestra, interrupted him, and he  was not unthankful for the interruption. He paced the deserted ballroom that  night when the last of the long line of carriages had driven away, and pondered  on his folly, his madness.</p>
<p>What could he do? Fly from this splendid home, go  abroad, to Central Africa, to the farthest mountain-range of India, anywhere to escape his  hopeless love, to hide his dishonour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were free!&rdquo; he said to himself again and  again; &ldquo;O God, of what use to me are lands and wealth without my liberty? The  poorest hedger and ditcher upon my estate is free to claim the girl who loves  him, but not I. I must stand aloof, and let her think me the basest of men. I  have said too much &mdash; and too little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="APrecautionaryStep"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  A Precautionary Step</h2>
<p>There was one who had discovered Gervoise  Palgrave&rsquo;s secret before the young man had owned it to himself, and that one  close observer was Stephen Hurst, rector of Pendon, and devoted worshipper of  his lovely cousin. He had pleaded his cause, and received his answer, a sad  sentence of condemnation; but he was too generous to resent the offence against  his self-esteem, too pure of mind and noble of heart to be angry with the girl  who had refused to make his life happy.</p>
<p>He stood aloof, earnestly anxious for her welfare.  All that a brother could do to demonstrate affection for a beloved sister he  did still. He was still her friend, her counsellor, her spiritual adviser and  faithful ally in all good works. He saw that the earl loved her, and he  resigned himself, after a sharp mental contest, to the thought that he beheld  his successful rival in this patrician suitor &mdash; young, handsome, wealthy &mdash; in  every attribute and in all surroundings a brilliant alliance for the orphan  heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Haughton is just the sort of man whom women  admire,&rdquo; he said to himself, <i>&ldquo;</i>and  every woman is at heart a Tory. Rank and ancient name always have the charm of  romance in the eyes of an inexperienced girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long period of patient watchfulness, the  day came in which Stephen saw but too clearly that his cousin Ethel loved  Gervoise Palgrave, Lord Haughton. Until that decisive hour hope had lurked in  the young man&rsquo;s breast, unsuspected by himself. That hope had made life very  sweet to him; now existence must become most bitter.</p>
<p>But why did not the Earl of Haughton declare his  love? Stephen Hurst was utterly perplexed by a reticence that seemed  unaccountable. That Gervoise loved Ethel was obvious to every eye that beheld  them together. After the ball at the Chase, where the earl and Ethel Hurst had  appeared for the first time in public together, there was no one in the county  so blind as to attribute his visits to Hyford to any attachment for the  hook-nosed Adelina. Sir Langley would have preferred to see one of his  daughters elevated to the peerage; but as Providence  had denied him this rapture, he was contented, and indeed grateful, for the  assurance that his niece would wear a countess&rsquo;s coronet, and be in a position  to launch her cousins in the first circle of London society.</p>
<p>But, in the mean time, why this delay? The earl was  in love, the earl was beloved. Why did he not pronounce the portentous words  that would ally him for ever to the house of Hurst? His delay puzzled everyone; but most  of all did it disturb Stephen Hurst, whose clear logical mind, ever anxious  where Ethel was concerned, began to be filled with suspicion of Gervoise  Palgrave.</p>
<p>There must be a mystery somewhere, a secret reason  for the earl&rsquo;s reserve. There was something to find out. Stephen had sworn to  serve his cousin with more than a brother&rsquo;s devotion. It was his duty,  therefore, to watch this man whom she loved &mdash; this man who loved her, and who  yet hesitated to claim her for his wife.</p>
<p>While his conduct was exciting this wonder, Gervoise  Palgrave suddenly left Warwickshire, and went up to London, where he took up his abode at a  second-class hotel near Blackfriars-bridge. He chose the house because it was a  busy place in all seasons, frequented by commercial men &mdash; a place where his  coming and going would excite no attention, where no one would take the trouble  to inquire who or what he was.</p>
<p>He spent two hours on the first day of his stay in  town at the office of a pettifogging solicitor in Clement&rsquo;s Inn.  From Clement&rsquo;s Inn he went to Printing-house-square.</p>
<p>He put an advertisement in the <i>Times</i> newspaper. He availed himself of the universal mediator, the  only go-between that never betrays, the only fetcher and carrier that can  safely be trusted. In the next morning&rsquo;s paper the following advertisement  appeared at the top of the second column in the first page:</p>
<p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Agatha G.,  go to Mr. Bagswell</i>, <i>solicitor</i>, <i>Clements Inn, and you will hear of your  husband</i>, <i>whose circumstances have undergone considerable improvement</i> &mdash; <i>G. G.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>This advertisement appeared in the <i>Times,</i> not one morning only, but for  twenty consecutive mornings. Throughout the twenty days during which the  advertisement appeared, Gervoise remained in London.</p>
<p>There was no answer to the advertisement. The Earl  of Haughton called two or three times in Clement&rsquo;s Inn.  Mr. Bagswell, the lawyer, only knew his client by the name of Gilbert. Gervoise  had employed him in some money-lending transaction two years before, and that  was all the intercourse there had ever existed between the two men. Mr. Bagswell  was a safe person, therefore, to employ upon this occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife must be dead,&rdquo; Gervoise said to the  solicitor, after the advertisement had appeared for the twentieth time. &ldquo;If she  were living, you would have seen her here before this.&rdquo; Mr. Bagswell shook his  head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Gilbert  mayn&rsquo;t have seen the <i>Times</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody sees the <i>Times.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, every man of business, not every woman. What  do women care about the news of the day? If an earthquake was to swallow up the  whole of America,  the news of it wouldn&rsquo;t interest a woman half as much as the price of her  next-door neighbour&rsquo;s last new bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave sighed. He had begun to hope that  his wife was dead; that he was a free man, free to marry Ethel Hurst; and here  was this disagreeable solicitor trying to convince him that he had no  foundation for such a hope. But the Palgraves were an obstinate race &mdash;  impetuous, determined not to be moved aside from any pathway that promised to  lead to glory or happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my wife were alive, she would have seen that  advertisement,&rdquo; said Gervoise; &ldquo;or she would have heard of <i>it. </i>Somebody or other would have pointed it out to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bagswell shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who should guess that the advertisement related to  Mrs. Gilbert?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Agatha G.; mightn&rsquo;t it be Agatha Green, Agatha  Gregory, Agatha Grigson? People have enough to do to mind their own business,  without running about telling each other of advertisements in the <i>Times.</i> If you <i>want </i>to find your wife, Mr. Gilbert,&rdquo; added the lawyer rather  significantly, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t despair just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have the advertisement repeated for a  fortnight longer. But I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stop in London  all that time. If Mrs. Gilbert comes here, you can let me know of her coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, if you give me your address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; answered Gervoise, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t  exactly know where I may be during the next fortnight. If you hear anything of  my wife, you can put an advertisement in the <i>Times:</i> &lsquo;Agatha has been heard of.&rsquo; That will be enough. I&rsquo;ll come  up to town directly and see her. I am no hypocrite, Mr. Bagswell. I don&rsquo;t want  to find my wife because I love her, but because I left her in poverty; and as I  am better off now than I ever hoped to be, I wish to come to an amicable  arrangement with her. She shall have plenty of money, if that can make her  happy. I only want a friendly understanding, and &mdash; a separation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheDieIsCast"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Die Is Cast</h2>
<p>Lord Haughton went back to Warwickshire, and shut  himself up in his favourite rooms at Palgrave Chase. The oriel window of his  sitting-room overhung the steep crag beneath which the stream rushed noisily  downwards over smooth boulders and sharp craggy masses of granite, half hidden  by wet moss and lichens.</p>
<p>In the deep oaken window-seat Gervoise sat for  hours together, listening lazily to the rushing of the water, and waiting for  news from Mr. Bagswell, the attorney. But the fortnight expired without tidings  of the lost. The advertisement appealing to Agatha was inserted for the last time,  and there was no sign from the attorney.</p>
<p>Upon the day after that on which the last  advertisement appeared, Lord Haughton rode to Hyford Hall. He had made up his  mind; whatever risk there might be, he had now resolved to incur the danger. He  told himself that his wife was dead. His wicked hope that this might be so had  grown day by day into a firm conviction that it was so. His advertisement,  published so many times, had told of his improved fortunes. Would she, who had  clung to him persistently in his poverty, be likely to hold herself aloof from  his prosperity? This was the result of all his cogitations. But if he were  deceived, and the risk were ever so great, he was resolved to incur it. At any  hazard, he was determined to become the husband of Ethel Hurst. He never for a  moment contemplated the possibility of a refusal. He knew that Ethel loved him;  he had known it long ago, though no such confession had ever escaped from the  girl&rsquo;s innocent lips.</p>
<p>Lord Haughton went to the abbey. The servant who  admitted him conducted him at once to the drawing-room. It was a dark misty  day, early in February, and Ethel was sitting near the fire, with a favourite  dog at her feet. The girl sat in a thoughtful attitude, with her elbow buried  in the cushioned arm of her low chair. The firelight gleamed redly upon her  bright hair, and lit up the folds of her violet-silk dress. An open book had  fallen to her feet, and her sketching apparatus lay in disorder upon a little  table near her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Hurst! Ethel!&rdquo; said Gervoise, advancing  through the dusky room.</p>
<p>He had waited for the London papers of the day to reach him at the  Chase before starting for the abbey. It was four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon now,  and it was already nearly dark. But it was not too dark for the young Earl of  Haughton to see the sudden radiance of joy that lit up Ethel&rsquo;s face as she  recognised him. The lover thought that one look more precious than Palgrave  Chase and the earldom of Haughton &mdash; that one glorious smile, which melted away  in a moment, and gave place to maidenly blushes.</p>
<p>That one smile was enough. Gervoise forgot all the  story of the past. He forgot the bleak winter morning, the shivering parson in  a dirty surplice, the low-born father-in-law with dingy hands and doubtful  grammar, and the baby-faced girl so soon to be transformed into a tipsy virago.  The Earl of Haughton forgot everything except Ethel Hurst and his love for her;  and he asked her to be his wife.</p>
<p>Why should she say him nay? She loved him, and she  knew that he loved her, for the vital spirit of truth breathed in every word he  uttered. There could be no possible impediment to their union. Gervoise was her  superior in rank &mdash; she was at least his equal in fortune. It is doubtful,  though, whether Ethel Hurst thought of these things; whether she thought of  anything, except that the man who was dearer to her than any other creature  upon this earth had asked her to be his wife.</p>
<p>So Gervoise Palgrave was accepted. Early the next  morning he called upon Sir Langley, and received a prompt acceptance of his  proposal for Ethel&rsquo;s hand. Lord Haughton begged that an early date might be  chosen for the wedding, and the baronet assented willingly enough to the  proposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="BeforeTheWedding"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Before The Wedding</h2>
<p>The 1st of March was appointed for the wedding. The  bridal tour was arranged. The young couple were to make a brief progress  through Switzerland and Italy,  and were to return to Palgrave Chase in June. The marriage was to take place in  the church nearest to Palgrave Chase, a pretty village church, with a dear old churchyard  through which the Avon flowed, for ever  murmuring softly past the resting-places of the quiet dead.</p>
<p>Everybody had expected that the wedding would have  been a very grand ceremonial, and that half the country would have been invited  to be present. But to the general surprise it was not so. Lord Haughton  requested that the wedding should be strictly private. There was to be no  grandeur, no train of carriages, no footmen in silk stockings, carrying  gigantic bouquets, no fashionable bridesmaids, no glorification or extravagance  whatever.</p>
<p>The twelvemonth of mourning for the late earl and  countess had not yet expired. This was the reason which Gervoise alleged for  preferring a quiet celebration of his marriage; but in very truth he was  tormented by a vague dread of some catastrophe which might hinder the peaceful  performance of that sacred service. The recollection of that other wedding  weighed upon him like a dismal burden. It haunted him waking and sleeping. He  was always dreaming of the wedding that had been, and the wedding that was to  be, and confounding the two ceremonials one with the other in his dreams.  Sometimes he was standing at the chilly altar in the city church, with Sir  Langley Hurst giving him Agatha for his wife; sometimes he stood in the chancel  of the church near the Chase, with the dirty landlord acting as father to Ethel  Hurst.</p>
<p>He generally awoke from such dreams as these with  his heart beating violently, and his face bathed in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>But the wedding-day drew near, nevertheless, and as  that day came nearer and nearer, the burden grew heavier, until the Earl of  Haughton&rsquo;s resolution began to fail him, and he was almost ready to confess the  truth.</p>
<p>He had not the courage to do this. He set out for  Hyford Hall one day, with the intention of revealing that dismal secret; but  half-way upon the road he turned his horse&rsquo;s head, and went home again. He <i>could</i> not tell the woman he loved that  he was a liar and a traitor. He could not steel himself to behold the white  change that would creep over that lovely face, the wild look of anguish in the  deep-blue eyes. No; he had sinned, and he was determined to hold to his sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the consequence of my wrong-doing fall upon  me, and not upon her,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Upon the last day of February the lovers rode out  together side by side, with a couple of grooms behind them. They had often  ridden gaily thus in the bitter wintry weather. The winter had been severe and  long, and the fields were still covered with snow; the icicles glittered upon  the leafless hedges; the frosty ground rang under the hoofs of the horses.  Ethel was in very high spirits, for to-day Gervoise was gayer than he had ever  been yet.</p>
<p>He had gone too far to recede. The wedding was  irrevocable now, and he was glad that it was so. There was no longer time for  hesitation or uncertainty; there was no longer chance of escape. The die was  cast. In less than four-and-twenty hours Ethel Hurst would be his wife.</p>
<p>They cantered along the high road, laughing and  talking. Ethel&rsquo;s cheeks glowed with rosy brightness through her veil. The  lovers rode under the low stone archway leading into Avondale. The High-street  of the quaint old town was gayer than usual this afternoon, for it was  market-day, and the business of the market was scarcely over. The inns near the  market-place were crowded with customers, the ostlers were busy running from  one horse to another with handfuls of hay and pails of water. At one corner of  the narrow street the way was blocked by a couple of smart farmers&rsquo;  chaise-carts, and a ponderous covered vehicle belonging to the Avondale  carrier; and at this spot Lord Haughton and Ethel were compelled to pause for a  few minutes, waiting until the carrier&rsquo;s cart should move on.</p>
<p>In these few minutes the two equestrians became the  object of the universal gaze. The Prince and Princess of Wales driving through  a country town could not have attracted more attention than Lord Haughton and  his plighted wife attracted in the High-street of Avondale.</p>
<p>Burly farmers doffed their hats to the young earl;  applecheeked matrons dropped curtseys; the younger portion of the community  stared in open-mouthed admiration. But they could only enjoy this pleasure for  about three minutes. The carrier&rsquo;s cart moved off, and the way was cleared.  Lord Haughton shook the reins on his horse&rsquo;s neck, and the animal was cantering  off, when a woman broke through a crowd that had gathered in the doorway of an  inn, rushed forward into the centre of the road, and caught at Gervoise  Palgrave&rsquo;s bridle.</p>
<p>She was a disreputable-looking woman, clad in rusty  garments, that were little better than rags, with dishevelled hair hanging  loosely about her face, and a battered bonnet that had fallen half off her  head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; she cried, clinging desperately to  the bridle; &ldquo;you false, heartless scoundrel! how dared you desert your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could say no more. The earl&rsquo;s horse reared and  struck out with his fore-legs in the air. The woman fell upon the frosty  roadway. Gervoise reined-in his horse; the woman was picked up senseless; but  the crowd hastened to assure Lord Haughton that no harm had been done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the horse kicked her, my lord,&rdquo; one  of the lookers-on said; &ldquo;she was frightened, and fell. She was only stunned.  It&rsquo;s her own fault, for flying at your lordship like that. She must be mad, or  drunk, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should fancy so,&rdquo; the earl answered coolly.  &ldquo;See that the poor creature wants for nothing,&rdquo; he said to the landlord of the  little inn, who was standing on the kerb-stone; &ldquo;I will pay all expenses. &mdash;  Come, Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The riders cantered away as the woman was being  carried in at the low doorway of the inn. Ethel Hurst was very pale, and she  did not speak till she and her lover had left the town of Avondale behind them, and had slackened their  pace upon the road beyond the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Gervoise,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;how frightened I  was when that woman stopped you! Why did she attack you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Haughton laughed as he answered this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling Ethel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might just as well  make the same inquiry of you. The woman is mad, or drunk, I suppose, as that  man said just now. She could have no other reason for acting as she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="GervoisePalgravesCurse"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s Curse</h2>
<p>Lord Haughton was to have dined at Hyford Hall upon  the eve of his wedding-day; but after his ride with Ethel he excused himself  upon the ground of unexpected and important business, which would keep him a  prisoner for that evening. The settlements had been duly arranged already, all  necessary deeds executed, and his engagement for that evening had been an  informal one.</p>
<p>He rode home to Palgrave Chase after leaving Ethel  at the hall; he rode slowly homeward through the chill winter twilight,  thinking of what he was to do.</p>
<p>He was to become the husband of Ethel Hurst at  eleven o&rsquo;clock upon the following morning; and the woman who had snatched at  his horse&rsquo;s bridle in the Avondale High-street was his wife.</p>
<p>This was the problem that Lord Haughton set himself  to solve; and he did not find it by any means an easy one. It was more  especially difficult, inasmuch as he had not more than eighteen hours in which  to accomplish its solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall not balk me,&rdquo; he thought to himself;  &ldquo;come what may, I will stand at the altar to-morrow with Ethel Hurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pondered over the circumstances of that fatal  marriage in the city church. What evidence was there to prove it? The testimony  of the clergyman who performed the ceremony, the witnesses who were present  during that performance, the record in the parish register, and the  certificate.</p>
<p>Lord Haughton knew that his wife had taken  possession of the certificate shortly after the marriage. Agatha&rsquo;s father had  been a witness of the ceremony. And there had been other witnesses &mdash; the clerk  and the registrar. Above all, there was that indestructible testimony in the  parish register.</p>
<p>How, then, was this hateful secret to be stifled?  It could only be stifled by the consent of Agatha herself. There was no other  way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall go to Australia,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;I will  load her with benefits if she will go away and release me from the ties of the  past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Haughton dined alone in the room overlooking  the waterfall. After dinner he sent for Humphrey Melwood.</p>
<p>Margery and her son had been considerably benefited  by the new master of Palgrave Chase. They lived a very easy life in the comfortably-furnished  lodge, and Humphrey had plenty of money, with full license to work or to be  idle, just as it pleased his humour. He was a great deal with his  foster-brother; hunting and shooting with him; attending upon him, whenever it  pleased the earl to allow such attendance.</p>
<p>Humphrey went into the pretty lighted chamber  to-night while Gervoise was lounging over his wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Humphrey, and shut the door behind you,&rdquo;  said the earl, looking up. &ldquo;You may as well sit down and help yourself to a  glass of that Burgundy,  for I want to have a good long talk with you. You&rsquo;ve often talked of serving  me, Humphrey; and I know you&rsquo;ve always meant what you&rsquo;ve said. I think the time  has come in which I want your service, as sorely as ever an unlucky wretch needed  the help of a faithful friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall have it, Master Gervoise; you shall  have it, my lord,&rdquo; cried the gamekeeper. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s my heart&rsquo;s blood you&rsquo;re going  to ask of me, you shall have it as freely as if it was so much water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want quite as much as that,&rdquo; answered  Gervoise; &ldquo;I only want your help in a matter that must be kept a secret. I know  you&rsquo;ve plenty of the dare-devil in you, but that isn&rsquo;t exactly what&rsquo;s wanted in  this case. I want prudence and secrecy. Can I depend upon you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Haughton was silent for some minutes. He sat  with his chin resting upon his hand, thinking. There are some things that are  very bitter to recall &mdash; very humiliating to the man who has to confess them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s almost every man&rsquo;s lot to be a fool  at some time or other in his life,&rdquo; Gervoise said at last. &ldquo;I had my fling of  folly about five years ago, and I paid dearly enough for it. When my father  died he left me without a sixpence that I could call my own, and with an  education that adapted me for everything except a hand-to-hand struggle with  the world. I had a taste for art. I could paint; and my father&rsquo;s fashionable  friends, lounging in his drawing-room after one of his snug little bachelor  dinners, had criticised my boyish sketches, and prophesied great things about  me. When I found myself quite alone in the world, I went to those amiable  friends of my dead father&rsquo;s and solicited their helping hands. I didn&rsquo;t ask for  money, Humphrey; I only asked for introductions &mdash; patronage. I might as well  have asked such help of the dreary stone pavement over which I tramped  backwards and forwards, seeking for employment. But I was very young, very  ignorant; and the world had not conquered me yet. I took a lodging in a  respectable tradesman&rsquo;s house, and set to work painting for bread. For a time I  contrived to live. My ambition was not blighted &mdash; I hoped in a fair future, and  worked conscientiously, happily. But work as I would, I could not keep myself  out of debt. I owed money to my landlord. His daughter was a pretty, innocent,  baby-faced girl. She fell in love with me, or fancied that she had fallen in  love with me. Her father hinted as much to me: I must either pay the money I  owed him and go; or I must marry the girl whose peace of mind was endangered by  my presence in that house. This, or something to this effect, was what the  father said. You will despise me, I daresay, Humphrey; but you have never  fallen so low as I have. You have never known the fear of starvation. I married  my landlord&rsquo;s daughter &mdash; and I was miserable with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave stopped, and covered his face  with his hands. Humphrey looked at him wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re free of all that now, Master Gervoise,&rdquo;  said the gamekeeper; &ldquo;your wife&rsquo;s dead, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Gervoise, without removing his hands  from before his face, &ldquo;she is not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood sat motionless, with an empty  glass in his hand, staring at his foster-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dead, Master Gervoise! And you a-goin&rsquo; to &mdash;  marry &mdash; Miss Ethel Hurst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Humphrey,&rdquo; returned Lord Haughton fiercely;  &ldquo;and I <i>will</i> marry Ethel Hurst, come  what may!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Master Gervoise, how can you marry her if &mdash;  the other one, you know? It&rsquo;s against the law, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s against the law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen to me, Humphrey,&rdquo; said Lord Haughton.  &ldquo;I told you just now that I wanted your help. I want you to help me to &mdash; get  rid of this woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red colour died out of Humphrey Melwood&rsquo;s  sunburnt face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Gervoise &mdash; you don&rsquo;t &mdash; mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean no possible injury against this wretched  creature. Any reunion between us is impossible. All I want is freedom &mdash; freedom  to marry the girl I love. This woman must be got out of the way. I want you to  take her to Birmingham by the first train  to-morrow morning &mdash; from Birmingham you can get  off to Liverpool. There you can put your  charge on board the first vessel that sails for Australia. I have been looking at  the papers; the Cydnus leaves Liverpool upon  the 10th of next month. Will you do this business for me, Humphrey? You have  talked a good deal of sentimental nonsense about giving me your life, and so  forth: will you take my wife to Liverpool, and keep close guard over her till  the Australian-bound vessel sails out of the Mersey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; answered Humphrey;  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s little I&rsquo;d refuse to do for you. And it isn&rsquo;t much to get this woman  out of the way. But suppose she refuses to consent to this plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>must</i> consent to it,&rdquo; replied Gervoise. &ldquo;I may be compelled to deceive her, perhaps;  and may have to promise to join her by and by in Australia. She is a desperate woman  when her blood is up. But I used to have a good deal of influence over her. I  may be able to manage her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is she, Master Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Avondale, at the King&rsquo;s Head. I want you to go  off at once, Humphrey; see her, tell her that Gervoise Gilbert wants to see  her, and bring her back here with you. Don&rsquo;t tell her anything but that. She  knows nothing of my present rank; and she must remain ignorant. You can go and  return by the little door in the passage at the end of these rooms. I&rsquo;ll let  you in when you come back. I don&rsquo;t want anybody to see this woman, or to know  that she has been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some further conversation between the two  men; and then Lord Haughton led his foster-brother along a narrow passage to a  half-glass door, opening into a flower-garden, where shrubs and evergreens grew  upon the margin of the broad stream. The roar of the waterfall was loud in the  stillness of the winter night. Neither moon nor stars were visible in the black  sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dark night!&rdquo; said the earl, in a whisper.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to Avondale by the high-road, Humphrey; you won&rsquo;t attempt to go by  the side of the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the danger. You might miss your footing  in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I. The footpath by the river&rsquo;s half a mile  nearer than the high-road. There&rsquo;s no fear of my missing my way. I&rsquo;ll be back  in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man walked lightly across the little  grassy lawn. There were some steps cut in the perpendicular bank of the river &mdash;  a rustic staircase, guarded by a light iron balustrade. The steps were very  steep, and led down to the margin of the waterfall. Humphrey Melwood descended  the rustic staircase, and groped his way along the narrow pathway. Lord Haughton  went slowly back to his own rooms. A study, lined with bookshelves from floor  to ceiling, opened out of the room in which he had dined. He took the lamp in  his hand and went into this room, which was his chosen retreat. He sat down by  the fireplace, and took a book from the shelf nearest his hand; but although he  opened the volume and turned over the leaves, he made no attempt to read. He  could only sit there, waiting, and listening to the roar of the waterfall below  the deep bank, and the moaning of the wind in the wide chimney.</p>
<p>It was a little after ten o&rsquo;clock. At eleven he  might expect Humphrey and &mdash; the woman. What if, when she came, she should be  violent and desperate! What if she should refuse to assent to his smooth  proposals! What if she should hold him to his marriage vow, and come between  him and Ethel Hurst!</p>
<p>He walked up and down the room, thinking of what he  should do if his wife refused to go to Australia. What other expedient was  there &mdash; what other?</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave paced backwards and forwards,  backwards and forwards, only stopping now and then to look at the clock upon  the chimneypiece, until it was ten minutes past eleven, and he heard a light  tap upon the glass-door in the passage outside his room. Then he went to the  door, opened it, and admitted two people &mdash; Humphrey Melwood and Agatha  Palgrave.</p>
<p>The unhappy creature&rsquo;s head had been hurt by her  fall under the horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and her forehead was bound by a linen rag, that  was flecked with blood. This, and the pallor of her haggard face, gave an awful  ghastliness to her appearance. She looked about her with a wondering stare as  she came into the room, and then turned fiercely upon Lord Haughton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this has been your home while I have been  begging in the streets of London,&rdquo;  she said, with an angry sneer. &ldquo;I wish you joy of your fine house, Gervoise,  and of the kind heart that could make you turn your back upon a miserable  woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own friends would have sheltered you, Agatha;  you might have gone back to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! to tell them that my husband had deserted  me?&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;No, Gervoise, I had too much pride for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s wife was not quite sober yet.  She had been half mad with drink when she had rushed out of the doorway of the  inn to throw herself in her husband&rsquo;s pathway; but her fall had sobered her a  little. She was unnaturally calm, and there was an angry light in her dark  eyes.</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood, standing upon the threshold of  the door, watched his foster-brother&rsquo;s wife with an anxious face. He began to  think that it would be no very easy matter to get this pale, resolute-looking  woman on board an Australia-bound vessel, unless she should consent willingly  to such an arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that she&rsquo;ll never do,&rdquo; Humphrey Melwood  thought to himself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of those women that&rsquo;ll hold on like death to  anything they&rsquo;ve set their hearts on. Master Gervoise will have to give up his  new wife, for he won&rsquo;t get rid of this one in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the right or wrong of the business, the  gamekeeper did not give himself any trouble about that. He was a kind of rustic  savage, and had all the untutored notions of a savage. To be faithful to those  he loved, and to revenge himself upon those he hated, comprised his entire  creed of morality. He could neither read nor write, and had never been to  church since his early boyhood, when he had been conducted thither by a village  schoolmaster, who rapped the heads of his pupils with a cane at intervals  throughout the service, to keep their minds from wandering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stop in the next room for a short time,  Humphrey,&rdquo; Gervoise said presently; &ldquo;I must speak to my wife alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheSoundOfTheWaterfall"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  The Sound Of The Waterfall</h2>
<p>The gamekeeper closed the door between the two  rooms, leaving Gervoise and Agatha alone in the little study. Humphrey sat down  near the fireplace. There was no light except the red glimmer of the low fire.  The table was still littered with the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the dessert. He drew one of the decanters towards him, and filled his glass.  He was restrained by no code of honour or politeness; and he listened to the  voices in the next room, wondering whether his foster-brother would be able to  conquer the pale-faced, obstinate-looking woman who claimed him for her  husband.</p>
<p>At first the voices were very low; then they ceased  altogether, and the gamekeeper only heard the woman&rsquo;s faint, moaning sobs, and  Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s footsteps as he paced up and down the room. But after this  the voices grew louder. Humphrey heard his foster-brother&rsquo;s tones raised in  passionate denunciation; the woman&rsquo;s voice rose almost to a shriek; and then  again there was a sudden lull.</p>
<p>It was a long interview. Humphrey Melwood, looking  at the clock every now and then, kept close count of the time. It was tiresome  work sitting by the low fire waiting and doing nothing, while these two  passionate creatures upbraided each other in the next room. The gamekeeper  found the time hang very heavily upon his hands; and the only entertainment he  could find for himself was an occasional recourse to the decanters upon the table  before him. He drank a good deal in this manner; and when the interview between  the husband and wife had lasted a little more than an hour, Humphrey Melwood  fell into a doze, with his arms lying upon the table, and his fingers still  resting upon the stem of his half-filled glass.</p>
<p>He was awakened suddenly by the opening of the door  and the hasty entrance of Lord Haughton, with the lamp in his hand. The young  man closed the door behind him, placed the lamp upon the table, and then walked  to the low mantelpiece. He stood there with his elbows resting upon the marble,  and his face covered with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it is too cruel &mdash; it  is too bitter a burden. I shall blow out my brains! I shall do something to put  an end to all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood rose, and went close to his  foster-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she go, Master Gervoise?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t go; she won&rsquo;t consent to anything  except to fasten herself upon me for ever and ever. She will compel me to be  false to every vow that I have made to the woman I love. O Humphrey, if you  knew how we love each other, Ethel and I! I am not a fool or a coxcomb; but I  know that my poor girl&rsquo;s heart will break if she ever has to learn the truth.  We love each other so dearly; we love each other&mdash;&rdquo; Gervoise broke down, and  burst into a passion of tears. Humphrey Melwood, half-stupefied with the wine  he had been drinking, stared hopelessly at his foster-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t, now;  don&rsquo;t, for pity&rsquo;s sake! You&rsquo;ll make me mad like, if you do that. It hurts me to  hear you; it hurts me. I feel &mdash; I feel almost as if I could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gamekeeper stopped, with his teeth set and his  clenched hand suddenly lifted, as if he would have struck down some invisible  foe; but his arm dropped slowly by his side, and he gave a long sigh. The fumes  of the wine had mounted to his brain by this time, and all the latent  fierceness of his halfsavage character had been aroused by the strong drink and  the sight of his master&rsquo;s grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t bear it. I give you fair warning that I shall do something desperate if  you go on like that. It makes me mad, Master Gervoise &mdash; it makes me mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Humphrey,&rdquo; answered Lord  Haughton, turning from the mantelpiece, and dropping into an arm-chair by the  fire; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I know I must seem a fool and a coward; but it&rsquo;s no use  fighting against it. They showed me Ethel in her wedding-dress last night,  Humphrey. I can see her blushing face now as she stood before me, half-hidden  under her pure white veil. My beautiful, innocent darling, are you to be  sacrificed because I have been a villain? I love her so dearly, Humphrey, with  the truest, tenderest, purest love that man ever felt for woman; and am I to  give her up, and break the noblest heart that ever beat in woman&rsquo;s breast,  because that creature in there trades upon the mistake of my youth &mdash; the one  mad folly of my wretched youth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat staring at the dying embers in the low  grate. Humphrey watched the young man&rsquo;s gloomy face with a strange expression  in his fierce black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t she go, Master Gervoise?&rdquo; the gamekeeper  said presently; &ldquo;that woman in there, can&rsquo;t you get her to go away, and let you  alone? You are rich, and can afford to give her plenty of money. Won&rsquo;t that  keep her quiet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>No, Humphrey; nothing will  satisfy her &mdash; nothing but my ruin. It&rsquo;s that she wants; that, and nothing else.  I begged her to go to Australia,  America  &mdash; anywhere. I told her a lie, for I said that I would join her there by and by;  but the she-devil only laughed in my face, with a horrible, half-drunken laugh.  She&rsquo;ll stick to me, she says. Until this hour I have believed that it was she  who took my son away upon the night of the races; but she declares that she has  never been in this part of the country until to-day, and that she has never  seen the child since I took him away from London. Her manner seems like truth, and the  boy&rsquo;s disappearance remains a mystery. She has been tramping all over the  country, searching for me in almost every town in England. She only came into  Avondale by chance this afternoon, about a quarter of an hour before she saw me  in the market-place. She knows nothing. I have told her that this house belongs  to a nobleman, and that I am only a dependent here. If she knew the truth,  there&rsquo;d be no getting her away from the place. As it is, I&rsquo;m bewildered how to  act. O Humphrey, when my wedding-day drew near, and I heard no news of that  woman, I thought that she was dead. I did think that, so help me Heaven, or I  would not have gone on; I would have drawn back at the last, and told my dear  girl the truth. But now &mdash; what am I to do? &mdash; what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gamekeeper did not answer directly. He had kept  his eyes fixed upon the low red light in the fireplace while his foster-brother  had been talking, as if more absorbed by his own thoughts than by Lord  Haughton&rsquo;s passionate words. Now he lifted his eyes and looked full in the  earl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you bent upon keeping your word to Miss Hurst,  Master Gervoise?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I bent on keeping my word to her?&rdquo; cried  Gervoise. &ldquo;I tell you, Humphrey, I love her better than my life; she is all the  world to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if this woman in yonder could be only got out  of the way, you&rsquo;d risk all the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be nothing to fear if she were out of  the way. I would risk everything except the chance of her following me to the  altar and proclaiming the tie that binds us. I would risk everything but that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would, Master Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you think it&rsquo;s no good persuading her to  emigrate somewhere far away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good; I&rsquo;ve tried hard enough to induce her to  that. I&rsquo;ve tried to persuade her, and I&rsquo;ve tried to bribe her, but she only  laughed at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s quiet now,&rdquo; muttered Humphrey, pointing to  the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she has exhausted herself with her own  violence; but she won&rsquo;t be quiet long. She&rsquo;ll break in upon us presently, I  daresay. What am I to do, Humphrey? We must arrange some plan &mdash; we must do  something; or else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else what, Master Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to Ethel to-morrow morning and tell her  all the miserable truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be hard for you to have to do, Master  Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard for me!&rdquo; cried Gervoise; &ldquo;it would be death  to me! I tell you, Humphrey, unless I can keep my faith to Ethel at mid-day  to-morrow, I will shoot myself before midnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood got up and walked to and fro, with  his hands in his pockets, looking at the floor.</p>
<p>The gamekeeper was a fine, handsome fellow, of the  semi-savage type, with a muscular frame and sunburnt face, and broad, brawny  hands. There was gipsy blood in his veins, and he had the glittering gipsy  eyes, the blue-black hair, the flashing white teeth, and the roving, restless  nature. He had the gipsy cunning, and the gipsy love of fine dress and gay colours.  To-night he wore a velveteen shooting-jacket, with great shining  mother-of-pearl buttons, and he had a rainbow-hued woollen comforter twisted  round his strong, full throat. He walked up and down the room for two or three  minutes, as if arguing some question in his mind. Then he stopped suddenly by  the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; said the  gamekeeper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor ignorant fellow; I can&rsquo;t think of anything to help you,  except&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped his voice, and did not attempt to finish  the sentence. The hoarse roar of the rushing waters under the bank seemed to  distract his attention; for his black eyes kept wandering restlessly towards  the window, as if their glance unconsciously followed the direction of the  sound to which he listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can get her away quietly for  to-night, Master Grervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by going with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that. You&rsquo;ve told her that you&rsquo;re  only a dependent in this house, and that the nobleman this place belongs to is  a sort of master over you, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I told her that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, you can easy tell her that you  must get your master&rsquo;s leave before you go away from the house. Tell her, if  she&rsquo;ll go away back to Avondale with me &mdash; quietly &mdash; you&rsquo;ll join her at the  King&rsquo;s Head early to-morrow morning, and go back to London with her. You could tell her that,  couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I might tell her that, and persuade her to go  away with you to-night; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When to-morrow morning comes, what then? Am I to  keep my promise? Am I to tell Ethel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about to-morrow morning, Master  Grervoise. There&rsquo;s a long time between this and the hour for your wedding.  Something may happen &mdash; to &mdash; take this woman &mdash; out of your way &mdash; between this  and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gamekeeper spoke in a voice little louder than  a whisper, and he kept his eyes fixed upon the ground all the time. Gervoise  started up out of his chair, and looked at Humphrey Melwood with a strange  expression &mdash; an expression in which a wild and sudden horror was mingled with a  wild and sudden joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he cried, in a half-broken  voice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean &mdash; you don&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and stood still, with that strange look  fixed upon his face.</p>
<p>The gamekeeper never raised his eyes from the  ground. He pointed to the closed door without looking up &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she got any papers about her &mdash; her  marriage-certificate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she tells me she has lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but that won&rsquo;t help me. She knows the name of  the church where she was married. The parish register will tell everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I forgot that. But she has no certificate  about her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No letters, or anything of that kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She has been tramping here and there about the  country. It isn&rsquo;t likely she&rsquo;d have any letters about her. No one has cared to  write to her lately, poor wretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another silent pause; and still the  dismal roar of the waterfall below the bank sounded hoarsely in the solemn  stillness of the winter night.</p>
<p>The two men stood opposite to each other upon the  broad hearthrug; the gamekeeper always looking downwards, Gervoise with his  eyes fixed upon his foster-brother&rsquo;s face. The hands of the little clock upon  the mantelpiece pointed to ten minutes before one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and see if you can get her to go away quietly  with me, Master Gervoise,&rdquo; Humphrey Melwood said presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do with her?&rdquo; Gervoise  asked, in a hesitating, constrained manner. &ldquo;How will you get her away, so that  there may be no interruption of the wedding to-morrow? How do you mean to get  her away from this part of the country without her finding out who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind that, Master Gervoise! You&rsquo;ve asked  me to serve you, and I&rsquo;m ready to do it. What I said about shedding every drop  of my blood for you, if you wanted it, wasn&rsquo;t quite such foolish sentimental  talk as it seemed, perhaps. I&rsquo;d do it, Master Gervoise &mdash; I&rsquo;d do it!&rdquo; cried the  gamekeeper, with his eyes flaming. &ldquo;You say that you&rsquo;d go and kill yourself if  you had to break your faith with that young lady at Hyford Hall. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t  break your faith. Get this woman to go away quietly with me. That&rsquo;s all I want.  Get her to go away quietly. You&rsquo;re sure that nothing will persuade her to go to  America or Australia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve tried everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; then get her to go away with me &mdash;  quietly.&rdquo; Lord Haughton made no answer. He stood for a moment thinking; then he  went into the next room.</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood went to the oriel window, opened  it, and looked out upon the shadowy lawn.</p>
<p>The moon, which rose late, was rising now, and  there was a faint silvery glimmer in the wintry sky.</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood could see the outline of the trees  in the park upon the other side of the river, black against the sky, and the  rippling waters of the cascade glimmering here and there in the dim light. The  air was bitter cold, and the wind was moaning upon the river, with a slow,  dismal sound that was like the wail of a human voice.</p>
<p>Gervoise found his wife sitting where he had left  her, asleep. Her bonnet had slipped off, and her head had dropped upon the  cushioned arm of her chair, with all the loose dishevelled hair falling about  her haggard forehead.</p>
<p>If anything could have moved Lord Haughton&rsquo;s heart  to pity this woman, it might have been the sight of that wan, white face, lying  helplessly upon the velvet cushion. It had been a pretty face once, and he had  loved its fresh young prettiness after his own fashion. But he had no pity for  this woman now; he looked upon her only as an impediment to the gratification  of his newest wish. He had no more merciful feeling towards this miserable  woman, who had been his wife, than he would have had for any inanimate obstacle  that divided him from the new object of his selfish passion.</p>
<p>He had no pity in his heart. He had only a vague  fear &mdash; a horrible dread. He felt as if he had been standing upon the verge of a  dismal abyss, whose depth he could not fathom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agatha,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The woman started and looked up at him, half  asleep, half awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how late it is? You can&rsquo;t stay here  any longer. It&rsquo;s past one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agatha Palgrave rubbed her eyes with her thin  hands, and sat blinking at her husband for some moments before she seemed to  understand him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go away, Agatha. The inn at Avondale will  be shut up for the night. If you stay here any later you mayn&rsquo;t be able to get  in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go away with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &mdash; at least, I&rsquo;ll come to you early to-morrow  morning. I can&rsquo;t leave without seeing the master of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gervoise, you are trying to deceive me,&rdquo; cried the  woman, starting up, and grasping at her husband&rsquo;s wrist; &ldquo;you are trying to  deceive me. I know it by your face; you are as white as death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired to death,&rdquo; answered Gervoise; <i>&ldquo;</i>you may believe me, or not, as you  please, Agatha; but I tell you you <i>must</i> leave this house to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a firmness in his tone that seemed like  truth. The wretched woman was tired out. Her miserable wanderings hither and  thither had enfeebled her constitution,. already impaired by intemperance. She  was quite worn out now, and submitted to her husband&rsquo;s will from sheer want of  strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will promise to come to me the first thing  to-morrow morning?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At daybreak?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>At daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Very well. Remember, if I  don&rsquo;t see you then, I shall come back here after you. I&rsquo;m not to be put off  easily, remember, Gervoise. I&rsquo;ve suffered enough to make me desperate. How am I  to get back to Avondale without you? I don&rsquo;t know the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person who brought you here will take you back  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the servants belonging to this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>He&rsquo;s a strange kind of  person. I asked him ever so many questions as we came along about you, and how  it was you were living here; but he wouldn&rsquo;t answer one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very wise. Come, Agatha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman gave a weary sigh, and then drew her  ragged shawl round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re so rich, you may as well give me  something to buy decent clothes with,&rdquo; she said sneeringly; &ldquo;I want them badly  enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you anything &mdash; everything &mdash; to-morrow.  Come.&rdquo; He went into the next room, slowly followed by his wife. Humphrey was  standing near an open window waiting for his foster-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife will go back to Avondale with you,  Humphrey,&rdquo; Lord Haughton said.</p>
<p>He led the way out into the little passage, and  opened the half-glass door. Agatha went out first, and stood upon the lawn  waiting for Humphrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will want money,&rdquo; whispered Gervoise in the  gamekeeper&rsquo;s ear; &ldquo;here is my purse. I will send you more tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed the purse into Humphrey Melwood&rsquo;s hand,  but the young man rejected it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money,&rdquo; he answered, in an angry  whisper; &ldquo;<i>and you know that I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>He waited for no remonstrance, but stepped out upon  the lawn, and taking the woman by the wrist, told her to keep close to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going back the same way we came?&rdquo; she  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>I don&rsquo;t like that way &mdash;  it&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>I&rsquo;ll take care of you.  Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man led Agatha Palgrave to the rustic  steps in the cliff. Step by step they descended &mdash; he first, she behind him &mdash;  very slowly. The moaning wind that swept along the stream blew coldly in their  faces. The frost was beginning to break, and a drizzling rain was falling. Lord  Haughton stood in the narrow doorway while those two went down to the path by  the river. He could hear their voices as they descended the steep rustic stairs  &mdash; the woman&rsquo;s feeble little cries of terror, the man&rsquo;s gruff answers to those  piteous exclamations. Then he heard nothing more except the perpetual sound of  the waterfall, roaring with a dismal monotony in the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>The Earl of Haughton went back to the room where he  had dined. He sat down by the hearth and replenished the fire, then he went  over to the open window and seated himself in the deep oaken window-seat. He  sat there with his folded arms resting upon the broad sill, and looked out into  the garden, dimly visible in the faint wintry moonlight. He was heedless of the  cold wet wind that blew upon his face; he was indifferent to the lateness of  the night.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour after Humphrey and Agatha  descended the steps in the cliff a distant sound mingled itself with the  mournful moaning of the wind. This time it was not the wind only that sounded  in the stillness. This time there was, indeed, the long, dismal wail of a human  voice.</p>
<p>But the mournful sound died away, and melted into  the swelling murmur of the wind, drowned in the perpetual noise of the rushing  water under the shadow of the steep bank. Then the master of Palgrave Chase  shut the window, took the lamp from the table, and went through the firelit  study into his spacious bedchamber.</p>
<p>He set the lamp down upon the dressing-table, and  by chance saw his face in the glass. Of all the Palgraves who had been tenants  of that chamber, not one among them had ever seen a ghastlier reflection of  himself than the white haggard image which looked at Gervoise Palgrave  to-night.</p>
<p>He turned away from the table with a groan, and  flung himself, dressed as he was, upon the bed, to take what rest he might  before the late winter morning. This was how the Earl of Haughton passed the  eve of his bridal.</p>
<p>And through the rest of that long night, mingling  with his dreams, and suddenly awakening him every now and then with a choking  agony in his dry throat, and a cold sweat upon his face, the long, despairing  cry of a human voice was blended with the hoarse roar of the waterfall.</p>

<p>Dull, dark, and drizzling was the morning which was  to elevate Ethel Hurst to the peerage, an elevation that was very distasteful  to numerous matchmaking mothers within a visiting distance of Palgrave Chase,  who had hoped to see the young earl subjugated by the charms and  accomplishments of one of their daughters, and who thought his preference a  kind of insult to those fair young damsels.</p>
<p>Sir Langley&rsquo;s six daughters were to officiate as  their cousin&rsquo;s bridesmaids, and to these young ladies the cold wet morning  caused much disgust. They shivered in their diaphanous draperies of virginal  white; and the broad scarlet sashes, which gave warmth and colour to their costume,  were scarcely redder than the tips of their pretty noses. They bore their  martyrdom with tolerable patience, however, satisfied with the knowledge that  this day was to give them a countess for their cousin; a countess who might get  them invited to court balls and concerts, and who would introduce them to the <i>creme de la creme</i> at her brilliant  establishment in Park-lane or Grosvenor-square, for of course Lord Haughton  would secure a town house immediately on his return from the honeymoon trip.</p>
<p>To Ethel the cold wet morning seemed of little  importance, though the maid who dressed her in her bridal robes loudly lamented  the ill augury. What could it matter whether she went through sunlight or  darkness to give her hand to Gervoise Palgrave? She loved her chosen husband so  dearly that she needed no omen of sunshine to assure her of future happiness.  What sorrow could assail them so long as Heaven permitted them to dwell  together? What but death could part them, by so much as a thought?</p>
<p>The wedding was to take place at Pendon Church,  where Stephen Hurst and the Vicar of Avondale were to officiate. It seemed a  hard and bitter thing for Stephen to utter the words which were to bind his  cousin Ethel to his rival, but he consented to officiate in compliance with the  loudly-expressed wishes of his family, and Ethel&rsquo;s gentle appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have promised to be all that a brother could  be to me, Stephen,&rdquo; she said timidly; &ldquo;I shall think you are something less  than my brother, or that you do not approve of my marriage, if you refuse to  perform the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this he consented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever you need a brother&rsquo;s devotion, or a  brother&rsquo;s counsel, you shall not find me slow to perform my promise,&rdquo; he said,  with a gentle pressure of his cousin&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>When the carriages reached the little gate of  Pendon churchyard, Lord Haughton came out of the porch and along the narrow  pathway leading to the gate.</p>
<p>The drizzling rain came down upon him, though he  was an earl, and though he came bareheaded to receive his bride; somewhat to the  surprise of the gaping villagers, who were inclined to wonder that the very  elements themselves did not respect the lord of Palgrave Chase.</p>
<p>Ethel Hurst went up the narrow pathway by her  uncle&rsquo;s side, with Gervoise walking on her left hand, and the crowd had enough  to do to stare at bride and bridegroom.</p>
<p>The Earl of Haughton&rsquo;s pale, dark face might have  been a study for a painter in its perfection of masculine beauty. But the  darkest tints upon the artist&rsquo;s palette would have been needed for his work,  and the picture would have been rather a gloomy one.</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave did not at all satisfy the rustic  and popular idea of a happy bridegroom. If this were the happiest day of his  life, he had a strange manner of wearing his happiness.</p>
<p>Everyone had expected to see the young earl&rsquo;s  countenance radiant with the sunshine of triumphant smiles, the brightness  whereof should have atoned in some wise for the want of light in the heavens.</p>
<p>But it was not so. The earl had been standing in  the church-porch, waiting for his bride, for upwards of a quarter of an hour,  and though the rural populace had kept close watch upon him all that time, not  one amongst them had seen Gervoise Palgrave smile.</p>
<p>It was natural to him to be pale, but to-day he was  paler than usual. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face had a haggard look,  like that of a man who has been deprived of his customary rest.</p>
<p>As he came up the soddened pathway now, he was not  looking at his bride&rsquo;s fair face, though he was walking by her side. His eyes  turned uneasily from right to left, from left to right again, as if looking for  someone or something in the crowd; as if looking for something or someone that  he half expected and greatly feared to meet.</p>
<p>The churchyard was densely crowded in the  neighbourhood of the pathway along which the bride and bridegroom walked. In  spite of the miserable weather, in defiance of Lord Haughton&rsquo;s desire that the  wedding should be a quiet one, people had come from a very long distance in  order to see the young heiress of Hyford Hall married to the master of Palgrave  Chase.</p>
<p>As Gervoise and his two companions drew near the  porch, the crowd about the gate opening from the meadows was suddenly pushed  open, and <i>something</i> was brought into  the churchyard.</p>
<p>The crowd parted and fell away from it. Until this  moment there had been a buzzing noise of murmured remarks amongst the eager  spectators, everyone of whom had found something or other to say about the  bride. But all at once there was an awful silence. Every eye was turned away  from the bride and bridegroom; every eye was directed towards that SOMETHING  which had been brought into the churchyard.</p>
<p>It was a burden carried by two  labourers upon a roughly-fashioned litter, made of a couple of planks hastily  tied together. The burden was partially covered by a large freize coat that had  been stripped from one of the bearers. It was covered, but it was not hidden.</p>
<p>Everybody present knew that the burden carried by  those two men was a corpse.</p>
<p>The men went slowly through the churchyard with  their burden. They had a vague idea that their presence there was somehow out  of keeping with the great event of the day. But that was no fault of theirs.  They had a certain business to do, and they were bound to do it, though a royal  princess had been about to be married that day in Pendon Church.</p>
<p>Their business was to carry the body of a woman,  lately found floating in the Avon, a couple of miles off, to the principal inn  at Pendon, there to await the coroner and his jury; and their nearest way to  the inn lay through the churchyard. This was the men&rsquo;s business, and they did  it without reference to Miss Ethel Hurst or the Earl of Haughton.</p>
<p>Ethel uttered a shriek as the ghastly burden was  carried slowly past her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Gervoise?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;O, what is it?  &mdash; who is it? Is it somebody who has been hurt? &mdash; somebody who is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clasped her lover by the arm, and looked up  imploringly in his face, but he made no answer to her eager questions. He stood  looking at the motionless figure on the litter, with every feature in his face  as rigid as if flesh and blood had been suddenly transformed to iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it? Is the person ill, or is &mdash; is &mdash; she  dead?&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;O, go and see, Gervoise; go and ask them what has  happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men had reached the gate opening into the  highroad by this time, and the crowd had gathered round them and their dismal  burden. Everybody was anxious to see the dead woman&rsquo;s face, more eager even  than they had been to see the bride herself in all the glory of her wedding  dress. Everybody was eager to know who and what the dead woman was. Was it a  stranger? Was it anyone from Pendon?</p>
<p>Gervoise obeyed his bride&rsquo;s behest. He walked  slowly to the gate, still bareheaded. The crowd made way for him as he  approached, and he went straight up to one of the two labourers, and touched  him upon the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Lord Haughton asked, pointing to the  figure upon the litter.</p>
<p>The corpse was a woman; there was no doubt of that.  The water dripped slowly from the folds of her shabby gown, and her feet &mdash; not  large or coarse in shape, but, O, how miserably clad &mdash; were visible below the  tattered edge of her skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked the Earl of Haughton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pore woman, my lord, as was found floatin&rsquo;  on the river out yonder, by me and my mate, betwixt here and Avondale, little  better nor two hour ago. She&rsquo;s drownded herself, pore sould, I suppose. She&rsquo;s  been one o&rsquo; them &lsquo;fellers-de-see,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m afeard, your honour; but I dessay as the  pore thing&rsquo;s young and reyther good-lookin&rsquo;, the coroner&rsquo;ll bring it in &lsquo;trumperary  insanity.&rsquo; Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to see the pore creetur&rsquo;s face, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd surged forward as the labourer&rsquo;s rough  hand moved towards the drapery that covered the face of the dead, and there was  a breathless pause of expectation.</p>
<p>But the man waited to receive the word of command  from Gervoise Palgrave himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would your lordship like to see the pore thing&rsquo;s  face?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Earl of Haughton, drawing a  long breath before he spoke.</p>
<p>The man lifted the coat from off the litter.</p>
<p>The dead woman&rsquo;s face was terrible to look upon;  for there was all the horror of sudden death in the fixed features, and the  widely-opened eyes, with their blank, sightless stare.</p>
<p>But Gervoise Palgrave had no need to look long at  that rigid face. He knew it too well &mdash; he knew it only too well! He went back, very slowly this time, to  the church-porch, where Ethel was waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, Gervoise?&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;is the person  dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! O, poor creature! But who is she, Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a stranger here, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite a stranger here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she is drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She threw herself into the river, I suppose, poor  unhappy creature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, Ethel. The men who found her say as  much. But, my dear love, you must not be unhappy about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help feeling unhappy?&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;We  can only be happy while we forget that there is such misery in the world. And  you look unhappy, Gervoise, as well as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I, Ethel?&rdquo; asked the young man. &ldquo;Well,  certainly, dearest, such an event as this is scarcely very agreeable upon one&rsquo;s  wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beadle in attendance in the background murmured  something to the effect that such occurrences must be expected in a country  where Tories were in the minority.</p>
<p>But Stephen Hurst and the Vicar of Avondale were  waiting in the vestry, whither Gervoise Palgrave conducted his bride; and by  and by the bridal procession went slowly up the aisle, and the wedding-party  ranged themselves about the altar-rails.</p>
<p>The solemn service was read. There was no  interruption &mdash; no one to forbid that aristocratic union.</p>
<p>Gervoise was quite free to wed whom he pleased. His  first wife was carried to a village tavern by a couple of boors, with an  inquisitive crowd following at the heels of her bearers, while her husband  knelt before the altar to swear fidelity to a fairer bride.</p>
<p>Short widowhoods have been the fashion ever since  the Prince of Denmark&rsquo;s flighty mother consented to make Claudius a happy man;  and certainly Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s time of mourning was not a long one.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>Amongst the crowd that remained to fill the shadowy  aisles of the old church during the marriage ceremony was one man who had kept  himself completely hidden behind the rustic spectators in the churchyard, and  had yet contrived to keep a watchful eye upon every detail of the strange scene  enacted there. This man was the wandering artist, the tramp and tumbler,  Volterchoker, who had been lately perambulating in solitary dignity, or &ldquo;on his  own hook,&rdquo; as he elegantly termed it. Few market-days had passed on which the  accomplished Volterchoker had not appeared, early or late, in the busy  market-place of Avondale, to earn his modest reward by the spinning of basins,  or dextrous handling of gilded balls; and he had never appeared in Avondale  market-place without managing to obtain precise information as to the past,  present, or probable future movements of Lord Haughton. He had thus kept  himself fully <i>au courant</i> as to the  proceedings of his late fellow-wanderer, while at the same time obtaining a  decent living between Birmingham,  Avondale, and two or three other towns within some twenty to thirty miles&rsquo;  distance.</p>
<p>Thus it was that on the morning of the earl&rsquo;s  marriage, Herr von Volterchoker &mdash; duly forewarned of the event &mdash; was able to  present himself at the church-gates modestly muffled in greatcoat and woollen  comforter, unnoted by the rustic crowd. Nor in the church did he attract any  more attention. He sat in a darksome little pew under one of the galleries; and  Lord Haughton had no idea that this disreputable acquaintance assisted at his  nuptials, and took note of the ghastly pallor which disfigured the bridegroom&rsquo;s  countenance, and the husky tones of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="HiddenInTheDeadWomansHand"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Hidden In The Dead Woman&rsquo;s Hand</h2>
<p>After the wedding ceremonial was concluded, and the  bridal procession had departed for Hyford Hall, Herr von Volterchoker lost no  time in getting to the small town, or overgrown village, of Pendon, where he  went straight to the Rose and Crown. The coroner&rsquo;s jury were already assembled  in a little parlour with a very low ceiling, made lower in reality by a  ponderous beam that supported it, and made lower in appearance by reason of a  dingy-brown paper that covered it.</p>
<p>Everybody about the Rose and Crown was full of the  inquest, and the clown had no difficulty in obtaining all the information that  was to be had upon the subject.</p>
<p>In the first place, the woman had been identified  as a poor miserable tramp who had arrived at the King&rsquo;s Head at Avondale upon  the previous day.</p>
<p>The landlord of that hostelry was now in the  parlour giving an account of what he knew before the coroner and his jury. The  door of the parlour was open, though the assembly within was supposed to be a  closed court, and there was a dense crowd in the low, narrow passage and on the  threshold of the chamber.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker had sharp elbows, and he was  an unscrupulous pusher. He made his way through the crowd, and planted himself  in the doorway, where he held his ground firmly, while the populace around and  about him buffeted themselves into a temporary scarlet-fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She were a pore tramp of a creetur&rsquo;,&rdquo; the landlord  of the King&rsquo;s Head was saying in reply to the coroner&rsquo;s last question; &ldquo;and,  bein&rsquo; as it was market-day, Avondale was all of a stir like, and our place was  full, and we didn&rsquo;t take much notice of her. She asked if she could have a bed,  and I told her no, we&rsquo;d got no beds for such as her; and then she sat in the  tap-room drinkin&rsquo; gin and cold beer &mdash; dog&rsquo;s-nose them low sort of tramps call  it; and then by and by she&rsquo;d got no more money, I suppose, and she goes and  clutters-up the doorway with a lot more, as very nigh drives me beside myself  by not movin&rsquo; on; and then, when Lord Haughton and Miss Hurst came by on horseback,  this rantipolin creetur&rsquo;, she flew out at the horses&rsquo; heads, and was close upon  run over. And she calls out something to my lord; and Miss Hurst she give a  scream, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay. What did the woman say to Lord Haughton?&rdquo;  asked the coroner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, your worship; I don&rsquo;t think anybody  heerd what the pore mad creetur&rsquo; said, but it must have been somethink  wild-like, for Lord Haughton he says presently as she was mad, and everybody  else says so too; and he says,  &lsquo;Take care of the poor creetur&rsquo;, and let her  have whatever she wants.&rsquo; And she was took up unconscious; but she soon  come-to, with vinegar and burnt paper, and such-like, held close to her nose;  but she was stupid and sleepy like with drink, and we put her in a room over  the stables, away from the house &mdash; a comfortable room enough, your worship, and  as clean as the best room in the house; gentleman&rsquo;s servants sleeps in it  sometimes when the house is full. And the cook, she went to look after the pore  woman; but she didn&rsquo;t seem to want anythink, and she flung herself down on the  counterpane in her clothes, and fell fast asleep. We didn&rsquo;t hear any more about  her, your worship &mdash; bein&rsquo; busy all the evenin&rsquo;, and havin&rsquo; no time to go  dancin&rsquo; attendance upon tramps and suchlike &mdash; until next mornin&rsquo;, when I says  to my wife, &lsquo;How about the pore woman what slept over the stable? She&rsquo;s to have  her breakfast, and everythink comfortable, accordin&rsquo; to Lord Haughton&rsquo;s  directions.&rsquo; But my wife she makes answer, &lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, James, the woman&rsquo;s gone;  Bill&rsquo; &mdash; that&rsquo;s Bill the ostler&mdash;&lsquo;told me so this momin&rsquo;. She went away last  night.&rsquo; And if you&rsquo;d like to hear all about it from Bill&rsquo;s own lips, your  worship,&rdquo; added the landlord, &ldquo;why you can, for he&rsquo;s in the passage; and you  may know him by his red hair, and he&rsquo;s a&rsquo;most always got a strawr in his mouth  a-chewin&rsquo; of it,&rdquo; added the landlord in a confidential undertone to the  official who made a move towards the door, in the evident intention of going to  seek Bill.</p>
<p>Bill the ostler was found by means of this  description, and came lumbering into the room presently, with a grin upon his  face, as on some festive occasion. He was duly sworn, and then was asked what  he knew about the dead woman. A great deal of questioning was necessary before  Bill could be got to state his case clearly; but after considerable beating  about the bush, the following information was extorted from him:</p>
<p>Between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock &mdash; a little after the  chiming of the half-hour by the bells of St. Gwendoline&rsquo;s Church &mdash; a man had  come up to him, as he was just about shutting the gates of the stable-yard, and  had asked him if there wasn&rsquo;t a strange woman in the house &mdash; a woman who had  spoken to Lord Haughton that afternoon. He had replied to the effect that there  was such a woman, not in the house, but in a kind of loft over the stable. The  ostler had pointed at the same time to the window of the loft, where there was  a glimmer of light from a rushlight that the cook had left there. The man made  no more ado, but went straight to the stable below the loft, clambered up the  ladder leading to the woman&rsquo;s sleeping-place, and five minutes afterwards came  down again with the woman. They left the yard together; but before going away,  the woman told the ostler it was all right, she was going to her husband. As to  the man, the night was so dark that Bill didn&rsquo;t see his face, &mdash; not to know it,  Bill said, &mdash; though he had a kind of a fancy that the man&rsquo;s voice wasn&rsquo;t  altogether strange to him, but he couldn&rsquo;t say when or where he&rsquo;d heard it  before. The man was tall and broad-shouldered, and wore a velveteen coat. This  was all that Bill the ostler had to say for himself. This was all that the  coroner could extract from Bill, work him as he might.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t very much. The woman had been seen to  leave the stables of the King&rsquo;s Head at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock, with a strange  man, and had never been seen again until the next morning, when she was found  by a farm-labourer, floating in among the rushes that fringe the banks of the  Avon, as it flows through the meadows near Pendon.</p>
<p>The jury did not long deliberate upon their  verdict.</p>
<p>The woman had been found drowned.</p>
<p>Nobody for a moment suspected foul play. There were  no traces of violence, and who could have had any motive for attempting to  injure a wretched tramp, who had nothing to be robbed of? The woman had parted  with the man, most likely, people said, in discussing the inquest, and had lost  her way in the darkness, and wandered into the river, or else had wilfully  thrown herself into the water.</p>
<p>The coroner and the jurymen went home, and as it  was long past dinner-time in Pendon, the crowd dispersed from the public  chambers and passages of the Rose and Crown. But Herr von Volterchoker  remained. He contrived to scrape acquaintance with the landlord, and as he  produced a handful of gold and silver when he paid for his refreshment, the  landlord concluded that he was a respectable b<i>on&acirc;-fide</i> traveller, shabby and doubtful of aspect though he was.  After ordering and doing ample justice to his dinner, he inquired if he could  have a bed, and anon announced his intention of remaining in the house;  whereupon the landlord invited him to take his tea in the snug little  bar-parlour, where the fire burned as brightly as fires only burn in  bar-parlours, and where there was a birdcage, with a bit of green baize hanging  over it, a net of lemons, a little grove of clean clay-pipes bristling up out  of a brown earthenware jug, an eight-day clock in a corner, and a  highly-varnished and rather fly-blown coloured print of the Avondale and Pendon  Highflyer mail-coach hanging above the crockeryware shepherdesses on the  mantelpiece.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker was not particularly fond of  tea in a general way; but on this occasion he drank as many cupfuls of that  beverage as his landlady would give him. Of course there was a good deal of  conversation during the social meal, and of course that conversation was almost  entirely upon the subject of the drowned woman, still lying in an obscure  back-chamber of the snug little inn.</p>
<p>In the course of this discussion, Herr von Volterchoker  heard how the chief surgeon in Pendon and the jurymen had been into the dismal  back-chamber to see the corpse, before the examination of the witnesses, and  how the medical man had declared that the woman had been alive when she fell  into the water, and that death had ensued from suffocation by drowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to see the poor creature, sir?&rdquo;  the landlady said to Herr von Volterchoker.</p>
<p>The clown replied that he would like to see the  dead woman; and by and by, when the teapot had been emptied, after the third  watering of the leaves, and the last pile of buttered toast had been made away  with, the landlady of the Rose and Crown lighted a candle, and conducted her  visitor to the chamber of death.</p>
<p>The dead woman was lying on a table, with a sheet  thrown over her rigid face and figure. The landlady lifted the sheet, and Herr  von Volterchoker took the candle from her hand, and looked long and earnestly  at the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a look in the face that I&rsquo;ve seen before,&rdquo;  he thought; &ldquo;the boy has light hair and blue eyes; but there&rsquo;s a look in this  woman&rsquo;s dead face that I&rsquo;ve often seen in his, for all that. Yours was a short  widowhood, Mr. Jarvis, or Mr. Gervoise Palgrave, or my Lord Haughton, or  whatever you please to call yourself,&rdquo; muttered the clown, as he stood with the  candle in his hand, looking down at the face of the dead.</p>
<p>He was startled by something falling at his feet,  something that fell with a jingling noise upon the stone flooring of the room.</p>
<p>The landlady had dropped a bunch of keys out of a  little basket that she carried on her arm. She was a portly woman, and did not  relish the exertion of stooping; she looked piteously at the clown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Would</i> you mind&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picking up the keys. Of course not,&rdquo; said Herr von  Volterchoker.</p>
<p>He knelt down and put the candle on the ground  beside him. He found the keys, and he found something else, too, which he  picked up and examined thoughtfully, still kneeling on the stone floor.</p>
<p>It was only a few shreds of brightly-coloured  worsted &mdash; red, green, and blue; but the clown scrutinised the scraps of woollen  stuff as earnestly as if he had been an entymologist, and had just found some  new insect.</p>
<p>He got up presently, and showed the shreds of  worsted to the landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this belong to anything of yours?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not it,&rdquo; answered the landlady. &ldquo;I can tell you  where those bits of worsted came from; they were in the palm of that poor  drowned creature&rsquo;s right hand, and it was clenched upon them as tight as if it  had been made of iron. Mr. Manders, the surgeon, he forced the poor soul&rsquo;s  fingers open, and the bits of worsted dropped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t take any special notice of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor any of the jurymen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered Herr von Volterchoker. &ldquo;What  sharp fellows these coroner&rsquo;s jurymen are, to be sure; and what a blessing that  we&rsquo;ve got such clever people always ready to investigate the circumstances of  our deaths, and bring foul play to light, when we don&rsquo;t come by our deaths  fairly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clown took an old envelope out of his pocket,  and put the scraps of worsted into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep these, if you&rsquo;ve no objection, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Objection! lor&rsquo;, no, sir. If you&rsquo;ve a fancy to  keep them as a kind of curiosity like, pray do; you&rsquo;re as welcome as can be to  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing found about the woman &mdash; no  letter or paper &mdash; nothing to give a clue to her identity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! well, I won&rsquo;t detain you in this cold room  any longer. I&rsquo;ll go out and take a stroll between this and suppertime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker put on his hat, and went out  into the village street, there to deliberate at his leisure upon the  discoveries of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did those scraps of wool come into the woman&rsquo;s  hand?&rdquo; he asked himself: &ldquo;they must belong to something that she snatched at  when she was drowning. They belong to no garment of hers: they must have  belonged to some other person&rsquo;s clothes; and that other person threw her into  the river. The bits of worsted look like part of the fringe of a woman&rsquo;s shawl.  It was a woman, then, that threw her into the water. But how can that be? &mdash; she  was last seen with a man. She left the stable-yard of the King&rsquo;s Head in  company with a man, at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock. She was found drowned this  morning. Who can doubt that the man drowned her? But who was the man? Could it  be <i>that</i> man in disguise? And then,  how about these scraps of coloured worsted in my pocket? They must have  belonged to a woman&rsquo;s garment; men don&rsquo;t wear such bright colours. Yes,&rdquo;  thought the clown suddenly, &ldquo;they do sometimes. The coloured worsted might have  belonged to a man&rsquo;s knitted comforter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker paused before one of the  windows of an emporium which was called by the Pendonians &ldquo;the shop.&rdquo; There  were other shops in the village, but this was <i>the</i> shop <i>par excellence,</i> by right of its superior standing.</p>
<p>It was a queer, low-ceilinged place, with a window  upon each side of the door, dingy, and dimly lit up by the tremulous flare of  oil-lamps. Stationery and haberdashery, grocery, crockery, butter, cheese,  pork, bacon, and confectionery, children&rsquo;s toys, working-men&rsquo;s smock-frocks,  and wide-awake hats of hard, coarse-grained felt, were all to be had at &ldquo;the  shop.&rdquo; There was a post-office also attached to the establishment, and a  glimmering lamp, that was very little better than a lantern, hung over the  letter-box at an angle of the old-fashioned house.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker went into this shop. There  were some customers gathered together in a little knot near the counter,  talking, in solemn and mysterious tones, to the proprietor of the  establishment, about the wedding, or the inquest, no doubt; but at the sight of  a stranger, the proprietor left his friends and patrons to shift for  themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, sir?&rdquo; he asked blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want something warm for my throat, that&rsquo;s all.  This kind of weather plays the deuce with a man if he&rsquo;s subject to bronchitis.  I want something to wrap round my throat &mdash; something soft and comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proprietor looked rather doubtfully at his  customer. There was very little of Herr von Volterchoker visible, except his  nose, the end of which appeared above thick folds of woollen stuff.</p>
<p>It was scarcely within the range of possibility for  the clown to be more wrapped up than he was at that moment. But, of course, it  was the proprietor&rsquo;s business to sell his goods, and not to wonder as to the  requirements of his customers; so he retired to some mysterious corner of the  shop, and reappeared presently with a couple of wooden boxes containing knitted  scarfs, long and fleecy, and comfortable-looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a sweet thing, sir; quite new, which we can  highly recommend at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Herr von Volterchoker did not stop to hear the  usual formula of recommendation. He turned the two wooden boxes upside-down  without ceremony, and emptied the contents upon the counter.</p>
<p>The fleecy comforters were dark chocolate, dingy  claret-colour and black, dirty orange, and insipid lavender. There was no red,  green, or blue. There was nothing that matched the scraps of worsted in the  clown&rsquo;s waistcoat-pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said coolly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the sort  of thing I want. Are these all the comforters you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve had no others this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, no others. These are generally approved,  sir, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I wanted something brighter &mdash; livelier  colours. You had livelier colours last year, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not livelier colours than <i>these</i>, sir.&rdquo; The proprietor pointed to  the dingy claret and the dirty orange. &ldquo;These have been very much approved,  sir; livelier colours ain&rsquo;t approved in comforters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s no matter. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker walked out of the shop. The  proprietor looked after him with a flush of indignation mantling upon his fat  face. He was rather an important man in Pendon, and was not accustomed to be  treated so cavalierly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer customer,&rdquo; he said, as he returned  to the group of gossips crowded about the counter, behind which the  proprietor&rsquo;s wife, and the proprietor&rsquo;s son and daughter, were busy weighing  ounces of tea and half-pounds of butter; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a queer customer, whoever he  is; and not much <i>good </i>either, I  should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following afternoon Herr von Volterchoker  walked from Pendon to Avondale. He was a very good walker, and indeed, had  become pretty well used to pedestrian exercise in the course of long, weary  trampings through the country with Mr. Cadgers and his equestrian <i>troupe.</i> The frost had set in again, so  the roads were dry and hard once more, and the sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs and  rolling wheels, the jingling of bells, the occasional barking of a noisy  sheep-dog, and sturdy labourers&rsquo; voices calling to each other on the high-road,  travelled far in the thin, frosty air.</p>
<p>The town of Avondale  was very quiet to-day; for it was only on market-days that there was much life  or bustle in the queer old streets, and Herr von Volterchoker found no  hindrance to the business that had brought him thither.</p>
<p>It did not appear to be very important business  after all; for he employed himself in going from shop to shop, lookings at  woollen comforters of all colours and descriptions. But he was difficult to  please; and it was a very long time before he got the sort of thing he wanted.</p>
<p>At last, however, after he had been walking about  the little town for upwards of two hours, and had sorely tried the patience of  every haberdasher in the place, by reason of giving a great deal of trouble and  not expending sixpence, he found a dingy, low-roofed shop, in a back street, or  rather lane, close by the ponderous archway under St. Gwendoline&rsquo;s Church. The  shop was a miscellaneous sort of emporium, kept by a widow-woman who had a  day-school in the back-parlour, and who sold sweet-stuff and gingerbread, and  slate-pencil and writing-paper, and pickled cabbage and onions, as well as  haberdashery.</p>
<p>But small as the good woman&rsquo;s stock-in-trade might  be, Herr von Volterchoker found that amongst it which he had not been able to  discover elsewhere, namely, a knitted woollen scarf with stripes of gaudy  colours &mdash; blue and red and green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the sort of thing I want,&rdquo; said the clown,  selecting the rainbow-hued muffler from half-a-dozen fabrics of a dingier  character; &ldquo;this is the sort of thing for me. Something bright and lively. Is  it hand-knit, now, or wove?&rdquo; Herr von Volterchoker went to the doorway of the  little shop with the scarf in his hand, in order to satisfy himself on this  point, by a close inspection of the fabric.</p>
<p>During this inspection he took from his  waistcoat-pocket the envelope containing those scraps of worsted which he had  picked up from the floor of the room in which the drowned woman lay, and  contrived to compare them with the material of the scarf in his hand. They were  exactly of the same colour and quality. He went back to the little counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is hand-knit, and it&rsquo;s the  nicest made scarf I&rsquo;ve seen in all Avondale. I should fancy now, that, first  and last, you&rsquo;ve sold a good many of these, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow shook her head dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business in Avondale ain&rsquo;t what it used to be in  the old coaching days, sir,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I had but two comforters of that  pattern; they was knit by a poor woman in the almshouses, and the profit on &rsquo;em  isn&rsquo;t more than threehalfpence, and I&rsquo;ve had one of &rsquo;em on my hands ever since  last Christmas was a twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had only two of them first and last,  including, this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, never more than two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when did you say you sold the other one?&rdquo;  asked Herr von Volterchoker carelessly enough, as he put his purchase in his  pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sold it last Christmas twelvemonth, sir, to Lord  Haughton&rsquo;s under-gamekeeper &mdash; not this Lord Haughton, sir, but the poor lord as  was killed in the steeplechase last August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. You sold it to the last Lord  Haughton&rsquo;s gamekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and a good-hearted, pleasant-spoken  young man he is, though very wild-like, and very much in favour with the  present earl, which they do say the present earl was wet-nursed by Mrs.  Melwood, which is Humphrey Melwood&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humphrey Melwood! I think I know the young man &mdash; a  dark, gipsy-looking fellow, with ear-rings in his ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He&rsquo;s got into disgrace many times, with  drinkin&rsquo; and other wild ways; but he never was better off than he is at  present, for Lord Haughton treats him quite as a kind of friend and companion  like, and Mrs. Melwood she keeps the principal lodge at Palgrave Chase she do,  as pretty a little <i>gorthic</i> cottage as  you might wish to live in, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow, having once broken the ice, would have  been content to talk for half an hour together upon this or any other topic.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker handed her a crown-piece, and  she was a very long time selecting the change for that coin out of the little  heap of silver and copper in a wooden bowl, which she had taken out of a drawer  under the counter.</p>
<p>But the clown had obtained all the information that  was likely to be of any value to him. He took his change, wished the widow  good-day, and left the shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheDetectiveScience"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  The Detective Science</h2>
<p>The principal lodge at Palgrave Chase was on the  high-road between Pendon and Avondale; so Herr von Volterchoker was able to  pass it on his way back to the Rose and Crown without going an inch out of his  straight road.</p>
<p>But he did not pass the little gothic cottage,  pleasantly sheltered by the black foliage of a group of spreading yew-trees,  and a tall hedge of thick laurel. He paused at the great gates, and peered in  through the iron scrollwork. A woman was standing at the open door, and a glow  of red firelight streamed from the threshold out upon the hard, frosty ground,  on which light flakes of snow were falling in the cold, gray twilight.</p>
<p>It was a very pretty picture, that of the gothic  windows reddened by the firelight, the crimson glow upon the frost-bound path,  the drifting snow, the background of dense wintry foliage, the steel-gray sky  with one low streak of yellow light fading out in the west; but Herr von  Volterchoker did not look at it from an artistic point of view; he only  contemplated it with an eye to business.</p>
<p>Decent rearing and education this man had known in  his early years, but the sense of goodness or beauty had never been given to  him. He had a natural capacity for wickedness, and had graduated on racecourses  and in gaming-booths, and taken high honours in the rogues&rsquo; university. He was  a liar and a thief &mdash; a man in whom the greed of gain was a vile disease so  deeply implanted in his nature that it would perhaps have broken out in him had  he been born in a palace, undisputed heir to a kingdom. He was a man who could  trade upon the vices of his fellow-men, and hold it no shame to prosper by  reason of the perdition of his fellow-creatures&rsquo; souls. His life had been for  more than thirty years a long career of crime and infamy, sometimes prosperous,  sometimes unlucky. He had been a traveller in almost every quarter of the  globe, and had perhaps never so long existed by honest means as during those  two years in which he had been content to earn a scanty living in the  employment of the worthy Cadgers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said to the woman  standing at the lodge-door. &ldquo;Is your son at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Margery Melwood answered, with a sigh. <i>&ldquo;</i>Humphrey&rsquo;s at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman hesitated a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you want to see him <i>very</i> particular, sir?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do want to see him particularly. He knows  me; I&rsquo;m an old friend of Lord Haughton&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t make it convenient to call to-morrow,  or Monday, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going up to town by the first train  to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman came to the gate, unlocked it, and  admitted Herr von Volterchoker. The lodge was only divided from the mansion by  a lawn and shrubbery. Beyond this lawn there rose a steep terraced slope from  which the towers of the old house frowned on the wintry landscape.</p>
<p>Lord Haughton&rsquo;s mansion looked very black and  gloomy now, for there were no lights in the mullioned windows, no sign of  habitation upon this the principal side of the house.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker followed Margery Melwood into  the lodge. The fire burned cheerily in the comfortable little chamber, a green  log of resinous wood hissed and sputtered and flamed upon the top of the coals,  like some clamorous young pretender who creates a flare and blaze, but gives no  honest warmth. There was a tray, and some teacups and saucers set out upon the  round table; there were gaudy-coloured pictures on the walls, and a pert little  Dutch clock in a corner, ticking loud enough for the noblest eight-day that  ever Transatlantic poet heard upon the stairs of quaint, Puritan farmhouse.  There was every sign of comfort in the simple rustic chamber.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker&rsquo;s quick eye took notice of  all this, and then turned to Humphrey Melwood, who was sitting by the fire,  with his elbow resting upon the little tea-table, his legs stretched out upon  the hearth, his chin drooping on his breast, and his eyes fixed in a vacant  stare.</p>
<p>At the first glance, the intruder saw that the  young man had been drinking. His face was wan and haggard, his rumpled hair was  tossed in a mass upon his forehead, his dress was loose and disorderly.</p>
<p>At the second glance, Herr von Volterchoker saw,  hanging loosely round Humphrey Melwood&rsquo;s neck, that very scarf which the  gamekeeper had bought a year before of the widow-woman at Avondale.</p>
<p>Yes, there were the gaudy colours, the colours that  matched those scraps of worsted that had been found clenched by the stiffened  fingers of the dead woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker put his hand almost  involuntarily on the waistcoat-pocket in which he carried the envelope  containing the shreds of coloured worsted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got you pretty tight, Mr. Humphrey  Melwood,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t you I want, it&rsquo;s your master. It&rsquo;ll be  rather a sell for me if the murdered woman turns out to be some simple-hearted  beauty that <i>you</i> wanted to get rid of.  But I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much chance of that. There was a look in that drowned  woman&rsquo;s face that I&rsquo;ve seen in Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s son. And then, again, the  woman flew out at my lord, and caught hold of his bridle as he rode through  Avondale. Why should she do that unless &mdash; unless she was his wife &mdash; his  miserable, abandoned wife? I don&rsquo;t forget what he said on the day when I  tattooed the child&rsquo;s arm: &lsquo;There is a person who will try to get this boy into  her power,&rsquo; said Mr. Jarvis, <i>alias</i> Gervoise Palgrave. Who should that person be except the mother of the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These thoughts travelled through the clown&rsquo;s mind  swift as lightning. He only stood for a minute or so looking round the flrelit  room, and yet he thought all this, and saw that Humphrey Melwood wore a  velveteen coat, and remembered how Bill, the ostler from the King&rsquo;s Head, had said  that the man who fetched the woman away from the stable wore such a coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Melwood,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I suppose  you&rsquo;ve forgotten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, indeed,&rdquo; the young man answered, in a  thick voice; <i>&ldquo;</i>wh-where &rsquo;v I see y&rsquo; &mdash;  b&rsquo;fore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the night after the steeplechase at Avondale &mdash;  the night when Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s son was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood started up and struck his hand  upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold y&rsquo;r tongue!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Master Gervoise don&rsquo;t  care about people knowing he ever had a son &mdash; he don&rsquo;t care about folks talking  of his first marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if the very mention of his  foster-brother&rsquo;s name had sobered the young man. The stupid, vacant look of his  eyes gave place to a sudden brightness; a dark crimson colour dyed his olive  skin. He was used to drinking, and the fumes of the liquor he had taken  speedily dispersed as his intellect was aroused from its dull torpor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if this gentleman wants to talk  to me about private business, you&rsquo;d better go up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t drink any more, Humphrey,&rdquo; urged  Margery Melwood, in a pleading tone, glancing anxiously at a half-empty  brandy-bottle on the mantelpiece as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t drink any more,&rdquo; the young man  answered moodily; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s much good in drink. It doesn&rsquo;t stop  a man from thinking, or save him from horrid dreams when he goes to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery Melwood sighed as she looked at her son,  and then went slowly up a little staircase leading out of the room, and closed  by a door that was like the door of a cupboard.</p>
<p>Humphrey turned his chair with an impatient gesture  &mdash; the action of a man whose mind was so disturbed as to create a vague sense of  bodily discomfort &mdash; and faced the fire. The yellow flare of the resinous  pine-wood shone full upon his haggard cheeks, his black gipsy eyes,  sombre-looking and bloodshot to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said abruptly; &ldquo;what is it you want with  me, Mr. &mdash; I&rsquo;m blest if I remember your name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Vokes &mdash; William Vokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Vokes &mdash; Mr. William Vokes &mdash; what has  brought you to Palgrave Chase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very important business, and a very strange  business, Mr. Melwood,&rdquo; answered the clown, dropping his voice almost to a  whisper. &ldquo;I only reached Pendon in time to be a witness of Lord Haughton&rsquo;s  second marriage. I want to know how his first wife came by her death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tawny hue of the gamekeeper&rsquo;s face changed to a  dark livid pallor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Lord Haughton&rsquo;s first wife to you that you  should bother your head about her?&rdquo; he asked in a defiant tone.</p>
<p>The clown was silent for a few moments, reflecting  on this question. Humphrey took the brandy-bottle from the mantelpiece, poured  some of the spirit into one of the tea-cups at his elbow, and drained the cup  as carelessly as if its contents had been water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ho, Mr. Humphrey Melwood,&rdquo; thought the clown,  &ldquo;if <i>that&rsquo;s</i> a specimen of your habits,  you&rsquo;re rather a dangerous friend and ally for the Earl of Haughton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the woman to you that you should trouble  your head about her?&rdquo; repeated Humphrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; the clown answered gravely; &ldquo;Lord  Haughton&rsquo;s wife was my niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your niece!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my own flesh and blood; do you understand?  I&rsquo;m an old man, and I&rsquo;ve knocked about the world a good deal; but my feelings  mayn&rsquo;t be quite dead for all that. The wife of Gervoise Palgrave was my niece,  and I want to know how she met with her death. She was seen at Avondale on the  afternoon of the day before yesterday. She was seen alive on that day; and she  was seen to speak to Lord Haughton as he rode through the town with Miss Hurst.  Between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock that night she was seen to leave the stables of  the King&rsquo;s Head with a man; a broad-shouldered, stalwart fellow, in a velveteen  coat; and the next time she was seen she was carried dead through Pendon  churchyard. I want to know what happened in the interim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood wiped the perspiration from his  forehead with the cuff of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I know about her?&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;why  do you ask me about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; the clown answered, with an  entire change of manner, &ldquo;I only want information, but I must get it how and  where I can. You are a friend of Lord Haughton&rsquo;s. I expected that you&rsquo;d know  all the particulars of his wife&rsquo;s death. It was odd, wasn&rsquo;t it, that she should  be drowned upon the eve of the earl&rsquo;s second marriage? It was still more  strange that I should happen to be at Pendon on the day of the inquest at the  Rose and Crown, and should see the poor dead creature, and recognise her as my  niece, whom I hadn&rsquo;t seen for many a year, for I&rsquo;ve been a wanderer upon the  face of the earth, and parted from all my kith and kin. Well, well, it&rsquo;s a  strange world, a very strange world. You can&rsquo;t give me any information about  that poor creature&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; answered the young man, after a brief  pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, it&rsquo;s an unlucky business altogether. I  suppose Miss Hurst, the present Countess of Haughton, has been told nothing  about this first wife of Gervoise Palgrave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Humphrey Melwood answered sullenly.  &ldquo;If you want to know the Earl of Haughton&rsquo;s business, you&rsquo;d better go and  question him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear fellow, be reasonable,&rdquo; exclaimed the  clown. &ldquo;Lord Haughton has started for the Continent, with his lovely young  bride. You don&rsquo;t want me to follow him, and spoil all the pleasure of the  honeymoon by asking him awkward questions about his first wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; muttered Humphrey with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I must ask questions of you; and  if I were you, I&rsquo;d answer &rsquo;em civilly. You&rsquo;ll find it wise to do so. However,  I&rsquo;ll wish you good-night now, and look in again another time. You don&rsquo;t seem in  the humour for a pleasant chat. I&rsquo;ll leave you to the young man&rsquo;s best  companion &mdash; the brandy-bottle &mdash; and your own thoughts. Ta-ta!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker waved his hand gracefully,  opened the door, and went out. It was quite dark now, and the ground was white  with snow, against which the yews and cypress looked blacker than ever.</p>
<p>The interior of the lodge was lighted by the red  glow of the fire. Herr von Volterchoker paused for a few moments upon a narrow  slip of grass that bordered the broad gravelled carriage road, and looked in at  the latticed window, whence he beheld a strange piece of dumb-show in the  firelit chamber.</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood suddenly sprang up from his moody  attitude by the fire, knocking over his chair as he rose, snatched a gun from  its place above the little chimneypiece, cocked it, and rushed towards the door  of the lodge.</p>
<p>But within a few paces of the door he stopped as  suddenly as he had risen from his chair. He let the stock of the gun fall  slowly to the ground, passed his hand across his forehead with a convulsive  shudder, like a man who awakes from some hideous dream. Then he went back to  the chimneypiece, replaced the gun, and sat down once more before the fire,  with his feet on the fender, his elbows on his knees, and his face hidden in  his hands.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker watched him for a minute or  so as he sat in this attitude before the fire, and then turned away with a  contemptuous shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no great credit to any fellow to reckon you  up,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;My game here lies straight before me, as smooth  as a turnpike-road. I must work the master through the man. You&rsquo;re in luck&rsquo;s  way, Mr. Vokes. That <i>unde</i> dodge was  rather a good one, I flatter myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="HuntingUpThePast"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Hunting Up The Past</h2>
<p>Herr Von Volterohoker left Pendon the day after his  interview with Humphrey Melwood; but before departing he informed the landlord  of the Rose and Crown that he should soon be again a guest at that cosy little  hostelry. Arrived in the great City, he took a cab at the railway-station, and  ordered the man to drive to one of the dingiest localities in Lambeth. The  cabman drove across Westminster-bridge, and turned aside under a railway-arch  in the Westminster-road. The clown stopped the cab, and got out under the  archway. He paid and dismissed the driver, and then walked away at a pretty  brisk rate. He turned a corner presently, and penetrated into a narrow little  street, dingier and dirtier even than the one he had left.</p>
<p>There were some children playing in a group upon  the door-step, before a miserable little chandler&rsquo;s shop, in which the  atmosphere was made horrible by the odour of red herrings, strong yellow soap,  cheese, and tobacco. Herr von Volterchoker thrust the juvenile population right  and left of him as ruthlessly as if they had been a litter of youthful pigs,  and strode into the shop. He took no notice of the proprietress of the  establishment, nor of the slip-shod matrons and old-faced children crowding about  the counter, but pushed his way through a narrow pass between a pile of  firewood and a treacle-tub, and opened a little door.</p>
<p>Beyond this door there was a square yard of  passage, and a staircase so narrow that the two walls were black and greasy  with the friction of people&rsquo;s shoulders; so close and low, that the  unaccustomed visitant suffered temporary asphyxia, and was powerless to draw  breath until he reached a better atmosphere.</p>
<p>The better atmosphere was only good by comparison;  for the room which Herr von Volterchoker entered was dark with a brown fog  which crept in from out of doors, and misty with the steam of a washing-tub on  a bench near the window. A couple of coloured shirts dangled, dripping wet,  from a frayed rope that was hung across the room. They looked something like  military trophies hanging from the roof of a chapel, and were quite as ragged.  A woman was standing before the wash-tub, with her bare arms plunged in the  dirty soapsuds. A boy was standing near the dingy fireplace; not standing in  the normal position of humanity, but supporting himself upon the palms of his  poor little hands, and with his feet in the air. The woman looked round, and  the boy turned a somersault, and dropped into his natural position dextrously  enough, as Herr von Volterchoker&rsquo;s creaking footstep sounded upon the  carpetless floor.</p>
<p>The woman was a careworn, slovenly matron, of about  forty. The boy was pale and thin; but he was very pretty, and had something of  the haughty face of his father, Gervoise Palgrave, Earl of Haughton. He ran  forward eagerly to meet the clown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you were never coming back again,  uncle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;O, do tell me about papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I tell you about him,&rdquo; the clown  answered sulkily enough, <i>&ldquo;</i>except what  I told you before? He&rsquo;s gone to America,  and he&rsquo;ll never come back till he&rsquo;s made a large fortune; and that won&rsquo;t be for  a long time &mdash; not till you&rsquo;re a man; so what you&rsquo;ve got to do is to be a very  good boy, and to obey your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked wistfully at the clown&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are my uncle,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;papa  never said you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your papa was a little too high in his notions,&rdquo;  Herr von Volterchoker answered curtely, &ldquo;and he looked down upon his poor  relations. However, let bygones be bygones; I&rsquo;m willing to forget and forgive.  Are you happy with Mrs. Beppo, Master Georgey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; repeated the boy; &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;ve never been  happy since papa went away. I can&rsquo;t be happy without him; I loved him so &mdash; I  loved him so dearly; and it was unkind of him to send me away that night &mdash; that  cruel night, when you tied a handkerchief over my mouth, and sent me away with  Beppo and the monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stash</i> that!&rdquo; cried Herr von Volterchoker fiercely. &ldquo;Did anybody ever hear such a  young varmint to talk! Now, you look here, Georgey,&rdquo; added the clown, seating  himself upon the only available chair, and taking the boy between his knees,  &ldquo;whatever was done that night was done for your good, and whatever has been  done all along has been done for your good; and if your friends didn&rsquo;t love  you, they wouldn&rsquo;t have done it. So cheer up, my little lad, and be a good boy,  and mind what your affectionate uncle says to you. Things have taken a turn  with me; and instead of leaving you here with Beppo, to learn posturing and go  out by and by with the organ and the monkey, I&rsquo;ve half a mind to send you to a  nice comfortable boarding-school &mdash; twenty pounds a year, everything found, and  no holidays. How would you like that, Master Georgey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, and looked at the woman bending  over the washtub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Beppo has been very good to me,&rdquo; he said  gently. The woman turned round and smiled at the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shure, now, I&rsquo;ve done my best, <i>Jargy</i> darlint,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s  little enough the best is in a place where praytees is fourteenpence a stone.  But I never did see a more contented little craytur. Shure, I often thinks it&rsquo;s  a fairy changeling he is, and not a boy at all at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker looked rather contemptuously  at the enthusiastic Irishwoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick to your washing,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want to talk  to the little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thin, if the luck&rsquo;s changed wid yer honour,  ye&rsquo;ll maybe give us a trifle to drink yer health wid,&rdquo; said the Irishwoman in a  very insinuating tone.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker took a sovereign from his  pocket, and flung it on the little table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;ll satisfy you, Biddy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Hooroo!&rdquo; cried the woman;  &ldquo;sure yer honour&rsquo;s a prince this mornin&rsquo;. I haven&rsquo;t seen the loikes of that  since I forgot meself and me familee so much as to marry a low-lived  organ-grindher &mdash; not but what Beppo&rsquo;s better than some, and it isn&rsquo;t  complainin&rsquo; I am. But you&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to take the child away, are ye now,  asthore? The bit o&rsquo; money you pay us comes uncommon handy; and sure the  craytur&rsquo;s such a blessed little darlint, that the heart that didn&rsquo;t take to um  would be hardher than stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Biddy,&rdquo; exclaimed the clown  impatiently; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take the boy away just yet, but I&rsquo;m going to  take him for a walk this afternoon. &mdash; Will you go, Georgey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, uncle; it&rsquo;s nice out of doors, and it&rsquo;s so  dark and dull in here. &mdash; But I love you, Mrs. Beppo,&rdquo; the boy added, smiling at  his Irish protectress; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m always happy with you, because you&rsquo;re so much  kinder than mamma was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put on a shabby little cloth cap, and declared  himself ready to accompany Herr von Volterchoker; but the Irishwoman left her  washtub and tied a woollen handkerchief round the boy&rsquo;s neck. Then she kissed  him tenderly, and handed him over to the clown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll bring um back to-night?&rdquo; she said to Herr  von Volterchoker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, most likely,&rdquo; answered the clown; &ldquo;but you  needn&rsquo;t be frightened if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the boy&rsquo;s hand, and was half-way down the  narrow staircase before the Irishwoman could make any remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Georgey,&rdquo; he said, as soon as they had left  the chandler&rsquo;s shop, &ldquo;I want you to tell me where you lived before you came to  Putney-heath that night with your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>We lived in a very narrow  place, crowded and dirty, like this,&rdquo; the boy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the name of the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>No, I don&rsquo;t know the name  of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And before that, where did you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before that we lived with grandpapa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure, you lived with grandpapa; but  where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a street that was dark and narrow, but not very  dirty, and where the children had shoes and stockings. In the last place they  ran about with bare feet, or had horrid boots that let their toes comes  through. I remember grandpapa&rsquo;s house quite well; it was near the river, and  near a big dreadful-looking place, that papa said was a prison for wicked men;  and there was a big church near &mdash; O, such a big church, bigger than any other  church in the world! &mdash; and another big place that wasn&rsquo;t finished being built,  and where there used to be lights burning at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker reflected for a few moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prison,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and the river, and a big  church. Why, it must have been down Millbank way, I should think. Do you  remember if the place was called Westminster,  Georgey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the boy answered; &ldquo;I think I have heard that  word before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you could find your grandpapa&rsquo;s  house, Georgey, if you were taken close to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try. I should like to see grandpapa; he was  always kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; answered the clown, <i>&ldquo;</i>we&rsquo;ll try and find grandpapa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the boy across Westminster-bridge, past the  Houses of Parliament, in the direction of Millbank.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Now, Georgey, do you know  where you are?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the boy answered, looking about him;  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the water, and there&rsquo;s the big church; it was this way grandpapa  lived, down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled the clown towards a narrow street leading  out of the main thoroughfare; a quiet little street, where there were humble  shops and shabby-looking old-fashioned houses. The boy dragged his companion  half-way down this street, and then stopped suddenly before a carver and  gilder&rsquo;s shop, above the window of which was painted the name of William  Pickshaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried, pointing to the picture-frames;  &ldquo;that&rsquo;s grandpapa&rsquo;s shop; I remember the gold things in the window.&rdquo; Herr von Volterchoker  opened the half-glass door, and a bell rang loudly to announce the entrance of  a customer. A little old man, with a canvas apron round his waist, and his  hands smeared with gold-leaf, came out of a back-room which was evidently used  as a workshop. Georgey ran forward to him, and took hold of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, grandpapa,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me! You know  me, grandpapa, don&rsquo;t you? You know Georgey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man uttered an exclamation of surprise, and  then snatched the boy up in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Georgey!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;why, Georgey, I never thought  to see you again. Where&rsquo;s Aggy? &mdash; where&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, grandpapa,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where your mother is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we left her. Papa took me away from her; O, a  long time ago, in the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left her? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she was unkind; because she used to beat  me, grandpapa,&rdquo; the boy answered, in a half whisper; &ldquo;and because she used to  go out and take my clothes away, and papa&rsquo;s clothes, and come home and seem  almost as if she was mad. I was afraid of her, grandpapa, and papa was very  unhappy with her, and so we ran away; and we were very happy until papa went  away and left me with uncle; and since then I&rsquo;ve been with Beppo and Mrs. Beppo  and the monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man stared at his grandson with a stupefied  expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand him, do you, sir?&rdquo; said Herr  von Volterchoker. &ldquo;I suppose it is some time since you last saw him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed, sir,&rdquo; answered the old man; &ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t set eyes upon the child, or my daughter, or my daughter&rsquo;s husband, for  the last twelve months. They left me last Christmas twelvemonth, sir; because,  to tell the truth, I was obliged to turn them out, as you may say. Gervoise  Gilbert hadn&rsquo;t a sixpence to bless himself with, so he couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay  me any rent for my rooms, and I couldn&rsquo;t afford to go without the money, bein&rsquo;  a poor man, sir, and working very hard to pay my way. So they went, and where  they went I never found out, for Gervoise had a good deal of pride about him, and  poverty seemed to sour and turn him, somehow or other, and he was very close  and high in his ways. And as for my unfortunate daughter, I&rsquo;m sorry to say  she&rsquo;d taken to drinking before that time, and didn&rsquo;t seem to care what became  of her. Not that the blame&rsquo;s all due to her, sir, for if she&rsquo;d had a different  kind of husband she might have been a different woman. So I let &rsquo;em go, sir,  and I never heard any more of &rsquo;em, from that day to this. But I suppose you  know all about &rsquo;em, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know very little of  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where my poor Agatha is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I only know that your son-in-law, Gervoise  Gilbert, disappeared last summer, leaving this boy upon my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappeared! but how, and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clown paused and reflected before he answered  this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was in the neighbourhood of Manchester,&rdquo; he said  presently. &ldquo;Your son-in-law had been painting scenery for a theatrical company,  a wandering kind of company, of which I was a member; and one night after the  performances were finished, he told me he was going away, and asked me to take  care of his boy for him till he came back, or sent to me for the child. I&rsquo;m  rather a soft-hearted fellow about children; and I really couldn&rsquo;t find the heart  to say no. So I took the boy, and I&rsquo;ve done the best I could for him ever  since. &mdash; Haven&rsquo;t I, Georgey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy calls me uncle,&rdquo; said Herr von  Volterchoker; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s his affection. However, I&rsquo;ve done my best for the child,  out of friendship for the father; and as things have just taken a bit of a turn  with me, I shall be able to do a good deal better for him henceforward, Mr.  Pickshaw; but what I want is a little bit of a talk with you, so that I may  understand what I&rsquo;m doing before I go any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, to be sure,&rdquo; answered the old man;  &ldquo;nothing could be fairer than that. Any information I can give you, sir, you&rsquo;re  free and welcome to. But I wish you&rsquo;d brought me some news about my daughter. I  wish you could tell me something about my poor girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He meant to keep the secret of Agatha Palgrave&rsquo;s  death. It was a secret that might prove a mine of gold to him, if he knew how  to play his cards properly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you walk upstairs, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickshaw;  &ldquo;we can talk a great deal more comfortably in the room over this. Not that  there&rsquo;s many customers to interrupt us, sir; trade&rsquo;s very slack just now; very  slack indeed. But the shop&rsquo;s cold; so, perhaps you&rsquo;d be kind enough to step  upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door, and led his visitor and the boy  up a narrow flight of stairs, and into a decent sitting-room, with  old-fashioned windows looking out upon the street.</p>
<p>There were deep oaken seats in these windows, and  on one of them a girl was sitting, with her back turned towards the door. She  turned round as she heard the footsteps of the men entering the room. It was  quite dusk; but as the girl turned, the light of the fire shone full upon her  face, and the clown saw that it was the living resemblance of that dead face  which he had seen in the tavern at Pendon.</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker had considerable difficulty  in refraining from some expression of surprise at the wonderful likeness  between the living and the dead; but he recollected himself in time. He had  declared himself an entire stranger to Agatha Palgrave, and he must therefore  conceal his astonishment at the likeness betwixt the two sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that young lady is your daughter, Mr.  Pickshaw,&rdquo; he said carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the old man; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Susan, my  youngest daughter. She&rsquo;s three years younger than Agatha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Pickshaw recognised her little nephew, and  took him up in her arms. She carried the boy to the window-seat, and placed him  in her lap. They talked to each other in low voices, while Herr von  Volterchoker and the old man seated themselves at the little table near the  fireplace. The room was only lighted by the flickering glow of the fire, and  the faint twilight fading in the narrow street without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to put the matter straight before you, Mr.  Pickshaw,&rdquo; said the clown, &ldquo;I must tell you, in the first place, that my own  fortunes have undergone a change since Gervoise and I parted company. I&rsquo;m happy  to say I&rsquo;m now pretty well off; and I&rsquo;m prepared to adopt your little grandson.  That&rsquo;s number one. You&rsquo;ve no objection to that, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, sir,&rdquo; answered the old man eagerly;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only glad the poor child has found a friend. I&rsquo;m a struggling man myself,  and I&rsquo;ve more mouths about me than I can fill as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, number one&rsquo;s a settled thing. Now  for number two. I shall send the boy to a good school, and have him brought up  as a gentleman, and I shall expect him to take his stand in life as a gentleman  by and by. But, in order to do that, I must be able to prove his identity; I  must be able to satisfy the world when the world asks questions about the boy.  Do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Pickshaw; &ldquo;I daresay I&rsquo;m  very stupid, but I don&rsquo;t quite understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quite understand what I mean. I&rsquo;ll make  it plainer to you, then, my dear sir. I want you to give me any papers that you  happen to have by you that may help to prove the boy&rsquo;s identity by and by. The  certificate of his mother&rsquo;s marriage, for instance. I daresay now, as a prudent  father, you&rsquo;ve kept that yourself, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker looked very anxiously at the  old man, but Mr. Pickshaw shook his head with a hopeless expression of  countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I daresay it would have  been wise of me to have kept the certificate, but I didn&rsquo;t. I think Agatha had  it herself. But if so, it must be in this house, for she left a desk with a lot  of papers behind her. &mdash; Susan, do you know what became of that old desk of  Agatha&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is upstairs in my room, father,&rdquo; the girl  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring it down then, Susan,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickshaw.&mdash; &ldquo;If the certificate&rsquo;s there, you shall have it. It&rsquo;s no use to me. That marriage  never brought me anything but unhappiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything of Gervoise Gilbert&rsquo;s  history before his marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know that he came to my house as a lodger,  and got deep in my debt; and then my eldest girl must needs fall in love with  his handsome face. He was a gentleman by birth, he told us, and went under a  false name because he didn&rsquo;t want his father&rsquo;s friends to know how low he&rsquo;d  fallen. Palgrave is his right name, and under that name he was married; but he  was never called by it. He hadn&rsquo;t a sixpence in the world except what he worked  for, and was never likely to have. That&rsquo;s all that I ever knew about his  history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker smiled as Mr. Pickshaw said  this. These people were utterly ignorant of Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s rank. They were  poor struggling workers for daily bread, and were by no means likely to look  into the <i>Peerage</i>, where they might  have seen the names of the Palgraves, Earls of Haughton and Barons Davenant.</p>
<p>Susan Pickshaw reentered the room presently with a  dilapidated mahogany desk in her arms. She set this down on the table, took a  candle from the mantelpiece, lighted it, and placed it before her father.</p>
<p>The old man opened the desk, the lock of which had  long ago been broken, and turned over a heap of tumbled letters and papers,  flung together in utter disregard of order. He was very long searching and fumbling  amongst these; so long that the clown lost patience, and begged to be allowed  to assist him. Mr. Pickshaw made no objection to this, and in less than five  minutes Herr von Volterchoker had succeeded in finding the document he wanted &mdash;  the certificate of Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s marriage with Agatha Pickshaw. The clown  folded this, and put it in his pocket without waiting to ask permission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want the registration papers of  the boy&rsquo;s birth and baptism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickshaw could not give his visitor either of  these, but he directed him to the office where the child had been registered,  and told him the name of the church where he had been christened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all I want,&rdquo; said Herr von  Volterchoker; &ldquo;so now Georgey and I will be off. &mdash; Come, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I to stay with grandpapa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Georgey: you&rsquo;re going back to Mrs. Beppo, and  then you&rsquo;re going to a school where you&rsquo;ll learn to be a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll let him come and see his poor old  grandfather some day, won&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Mr. Pickshaw, whenever you like to  have him. I&rsquo;ll drop you a line, by and by, and let you know what school I fix  upon for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir; and if you should ever hear  anything of my poor girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not likely,&rdquo; answered the clown.  &ldquo;Good-night. Is your daughter here like her sister?&rdquo; he asked, as Susan  Pickshaw took up the candle to light him downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very like her, sir; as like as two peas. Susan&rsquo;s  face is a little longer than Aggy&rsquo;s, and her hair isn&rsquo;t quite as dark; that&rsquo;s  about all the difference between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker took the boy straight back to  the dingy little chandler&rsquo;s shop, and delivered him over to the Irishwoman.  Then he betook himself to a comfortable but not too reputable tavern in the  purlieus of the Borough, where he ordered a rumpsteak and a pot of porter, and  spent the rest of the evening reading the paper, and thinking of the business  of the day. Early next morning he was up and stirring. He went to the  registrar&rsquo;s office in Westminster,  as soon as it was open, and got a certified copy of the register of George  Palgrave&rsquo;s birth. He did the same with the register of the baptism, and then he  went back to his old haunts to pick up a living in his old manner until Lord  Haughton should return from his honeymoon tour, and Herr von Volterchoker&rsquo;s  plans should be ripe for execution.</p>
<p>Paris was especially gay in the  early spring, when the newly-married couple took up their abode for a brief  season at the H&ocirc;tel Bristol, and the Earl of Haughton found the aristocratic <i>salons</i> of the Faubourg Saint Germains,  and the fairy mansions of the Champs Elys&eacute;es, open to himself and his fair  young bride. The earl and countess in short achieved what their Gallic admirers  called <i>un succ&egrave;s &eacute;clatant;</i> yet often,  amid the glittering crowd that filled some long suite of fairy chambers,  opening one into another in a vista of light and beauty, Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s  thoughts wandered back to that dismal garret in a court near Seven Dials, that  bare and cheerless den in which he had toiled for long hours before his easel  with no higher aim or hope than &mdash; bread, to keep off starvation.</p>
<p>He remembered that hard bitter past, and he tried  to be happy. Surely, if ever a man had reason to rejoice, it would seem to be  this man, who had been lifted from the lowest abyss of social misery to hold  his place amongst the privileged creatures of this earth; and yet there were  times when the Earl of Haughton would have thanked God with wild passionate  gratitude, if all this splendour and high fortune had proved only a long  feverish dream.</p>
<p>Yes, there were brief intervals of despair in which  Gervoise Palgrave cried aloud, &ldquo;O God, that it were only a dream! If it were  but a dream, how gladly would I awake to the old life, with all its sordid  misery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such gloomy thoughts as these haunted Lord Haughton  by night and day: strange honeymoon fancies to fill the mind of a man who loved  his wife &mdash; a man to whom all the glories of the world were fresh and new, with  the gilding yet untarnished by custom.</p>
<p>What had he done that his life should be miserable  to him? Gervoise Palgrave perpetually asked himself that question. What had he  done? Was it his fault if Agatha&rsquo;s life had been brought to a strange and  sudden end? Was he to blame because the details of that wretched woman&rsquo;s fate  were shrouded in mystery?</p>
<p>Why, then, was he unhappy? He never voluntarily  answered that question, even in his own secret thoughts. Yet it seemed as if in  the dark recesses of his mind there was an answer to that awful question. He  was miserable because he had committed a great crime; not a common crime, for  which he might be called upon to make awful expiation on the scaffold; but a  crime that was all the more terrible because another was liable to pay the  penalty of this iniquity. He had suffered another man &mdash; suffered! why, he had  tempted him! &mdash; to steep his soul in sin so that the tempter might have his  selfish wish.</p>
<p>The memory of that night before the wedding at Pendon Church  was for ever present to Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s mind; he started from his sleep  sometimes with a shrill hysterical cry, and the cold drops of agony upon his  forehead. He tried to live in the present, but the past was more palpable to  his mind than the events of the hour; and little by little he grew more and  more absent in manner and gloomy of countenance, until at last the lively  Parisians began to notice the young Englishman&rsquo;s moody manners and melancholy  looks. Then the worst horror of a guilty conscience began. Gervoise Palgrave  knew that he was watched; he knew that curiosity was already aroused, and that  the scorpion slander would soon lift its venomous head, rampant, unappeasable,  to claim its wretched victim.</p>
<p>Ethel&rsquo;s husband had to simulate a gaiety he did not  feel. The simulation was miserably hollow, as all spurious things must be. But  Ethel was too candid a creature to detect the sham smiles, the false unmusical  laugh. If her husband smiled, she believed that he was happy; if he laughed,  she thought that he was amused.</p>
<p>They had been southward to Nice and Florence, and they had returned to Paris to finish their honeymoon before going  to settle at Palgrave Chase.</p>
<p>Palgrave Chase! The Earl of Haughton thought of  this place as he might have thought of some black and gloomy mansion in which  he had dreamed of wandering in some hideous nightmare vision. Palgrave Chase!  the noble old pile of building, with the noise of falling water for ever  echoing through the oak-panelled chambers.</p>
<p>It was scarcely strange that these haunting  thoughts, these gloomy shadows, darkening all the joys of life, had a fatal  effect upon Lord Haughton&rsquo;s physical health. His strength ebbed away, as the  days dragged themselves out so slowly, as it seemed to him, even in this gay  French capital, whose citizens appear to have nothing to do but to amuse  themselves. The olive tint of his handsome face faded to a waxen hue, over  which, with every transient emotion, a vivid crimson flush glowed like low  clouds that catch their colour from the sinking sun. These hectic flushes, and  the strange brightness in the earl&rsquo;s dark eyes, were diagnostics that no  physician could have failed to interpret unfavourably. But Ethel mistook the  crimson glow in her husband&rsquo;s face for the warm hue of health, and the new  brightness in his eyes seemed to her the light of happiness. It never entered  into the young wife&rsquo;s mind that these signs were nature&rsquo;s danger-signals, and  gave warning of a fatally insidious disease.</p>
<p>As for Gervoise himself, he never complained. If,  sometimes, after a canter in the Bois de Boulogne,  he felt his heart beating at a feverish rate, and the hot perspiration breaking  out upon his face, he took little heed of these tokens of weakness. There might  be nothing ominous in this decline of strength; if there were, it mattered  little &mdash; it was perhaps the best thing that could happen to him.</p>
<p>The earl kept the secret of his own feelings, on  this point and on every other, and he performed all the duties of his position  with as much assiduity as if he had been the happiest and strongest man in Paris. He did everything  that was required of him. He rode and drove with his wife in the Bois de Boulogne, in all the pretty suburban regions; he  went shopping in the Rue de la Paix, and on the Boulevard des Italiens; he  escorted Ethel in all her visits; he attended her at the Opera. He loved her,  and he had a kind of pleasure in her happiness, though the burden on his mind  was never less heavy to bear, though the haunting shadow of his life was never  to be driven away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="EthelsVisitor"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Ethel&rsquo;s Visitor</h2>
<p>It had been arranged that Lord Haughton and his  wife should remain abroad until the beginning of June, when the apartments  which were being newly decorated for the bride at the Chase would be ready; but  before the end of May, Gervoise&rsquo;s health gave way, very much to the alarm of his  devoted wife.</p>
<p>An English physician was sent for, in compliance  with Ethel&rsquo;s urgent request, and remained for nearly an hour alone with the  earl. He looked very grave when he came out of Lord Haughton&rsquo;s room, but could  tell Ethel nothing, except that her husband was suffering from extreme  debility, and that he required perfect repose, both of body and mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mind has been lately much disturbed, I should  imagine,&rdquo; the physician said.</p>
<p>Ethel shook her head incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should disturb my dear husband&rsquo;s mind?&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;He has every reason to be happy; unless, indeed, the shock of his  cousin&rsquo;s sudden death last year may have affected him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it very possible that Lord Haughton  has been so affected,&rdquo; the physician answered. &ldquo;In any case, repose is most  essential to him. His native air might be of service also in restoring his  strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel knew that Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s infancy had  been spent in the neighbourhood of the Chase; she therefore did all in her  power to hasten the return to Warwickshire, even against her husband&rsquo;s will;  for the earl had a nervous horror of that ivy-covered gothic mansion, perched  high above the rushing waters that were for ever falling, falling, falling  under the shadow of the steep bank.</p>
<p>The earl and countess arrived at the Chase upon a  bright May evening; but, mild as the weather was, Gervoise had suffered  considerably on the long journey from Paris  to Warwickshire, though he had travelled express for the best part of the way.  He was very silent and very pale when he handed his wife into the carriage that  was in waiting at the station, and he sank back into a corner of the  comfortable vehicle with a long-drawn sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Little pleasure had either wealth or love brought  this man. He had been selfish all his life, and had sought his own happiness,  and yet had utterly failed to win even the negative happiness called peace. He  was fain to fall back now upon the physical selfishness of an invalid. The  vitality of his mind seemed to have ebbed away with his bodily strength. He  only wanted to lie down and rest, and to be let alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; he said, as the carriage entered the  shrubberied drive leading to the great hall-door, &ldquo;I think that the shadow will  never be lifted from the dwellers in yonder house. I have heard it said that no  Palgrave has ever known happiness since Rupert Palgrave, the Hanoverian,  betrayed his Jacobite brother more than a hundred years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lights were burning in all the principal apartments  of the old mansion. Lord Haughton and his wife dined in that very room in which  the earl had spent the eve of his wedding-day.</p>
<p>Little happiness awaited the young wife in her  splendid home. Gervoise grew rapidly worse after his return to the Chase, and  Ethel was tortured by perpetual fears, which she tried in vain to persuade  herself were needless and unreasonable. Upon the very morning after his return,  the earl was too ill to rise, and at his wife&rsquo;s earnest entreaty allowed her to  send a telegraphic summons to a distinguished physician at Birmingham. At noon this gentleman was with  Lord Haughton, and during the interview Ethel wandered about the house, looking  very sadly at the old pictures, the faded tapestries, the quaint carvings &mdash;  looking at them in a strange absent way, and scarcely seeing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that Gervoise would have shown me all  these things,&rdquo; she said to herself mournfully; &ldquo;my new home seems almost as  desolate as if I had come back to it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were three drawing-rooms at the Chase,  opening one into the other. Ethel seated herself in the smallest of the three,  the innermost chamber; a pretty little room, with white panels and gold  mouldings, and with an old-fashioned border of painted flowers running all  round the cornice. There was a bay window overlooking the gardens, and an  old-fashioned high chimneypiece, exquisitely carved, and painted white, like  the rest of the woodwork.</p>
<p>There was a fire in this room, for the day was  dull, cold, and unseasonable. Ethel seated herself in the bay-window, and  looked out at the sloping shrubberies and the stretching meadows beyond the  ivy-grown park-fence that shut in the gardens of Palgrave Chase. She was in no  humour for any of her familiar occupations, though this room had been specially  prepared for her use, and though her piano and books and drawing-materials had  been brought from Hyford, and arranged in this apartment by the careful hands  of her own maid.</p>
<p>For more than half an hour the countess sat in the  old-fashioned window-seat looking listlessly out at the dull gray sky and the  dark fir-trees in the shrubbery, with the tears rolling slowly down her cheeks.  She was so occupied by her own sad thoughts, that she did not hear the  footsteps of one of the servants coming through the adjoining room, and was  only roused from her reverie when the man was close to her.</p>
<p>Ethel started to her feet, and hastily brushed the  tears from her eyes. The man handed her a card upon a salver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman begs to see your ladyship upon most  particular business,&rdquo; the servant said.</p>
<p>The gentleman was Mr. Vokes, otherwise  Volterchoker.</p>
<p>Ethel looked wonderingly at the card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know anyone of this name,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman said he was a stranger to your  ladyship; but he made sure your ladyship would see him, if you would be so kind  as to read what&rsquo;s written on the back of the card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel turned Mr. Vokes&rsquo;s card. On the back there  were a few words scrawled in pencil.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;<i>Will Lady  Haughton be good enough to see Mr</i>. <i>V.  on business of vital importance to Lord H.</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Important to my husband!&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;What can  he mean? &mdash; Let him come to me immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant went in quest of Mr. Vokes. Ethel  walked up and down the room, impatiently awaiting the coming of her strange  visitor.</p>
<p>Mr. Vokes, <i>alias</i> Herr von Volterchoker, had endeavoured to adapt his appearance to the occasion,  and was no longer the disreputable-looking tramp and tumbler who had handed  round his greasy hat for halfpence in the market-place of Avondale. He wore a  suit of black, and had almost a clerical look. His manner was courteous and sympathetic,  almost oily in its extreme politeness and consideration.</p>
<p>Ethel motioned him to a chair with a gesture which  had some shade of hauteur in its careless grace. The Countess of Haughton was  an impulsive young lady, who had her likings and dislikings, and she was not  very favourably impressed by the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have something to say that concerns my  husband,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am ready to hear anything that interests him.&rdquo; Mr. Vokes  hesitated, and turned the brim of his hat slowly round and round in his bony  hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The business upon which I come is not a very  pleasant one,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I feel that I have a duty to perform &mdash; a duty  towards society and your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; Ethel asked haughtily. &ldquo;I  do not understand this preface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will understand the preface better when you  know the story, Lady Haughton,&rdquo; answered Mr. Vokes, with a sardonic grin upon  his face; &ldquo;but before I go any further, let me ask you one question. When the  Earl of Haughton asked you to be his wife did he tell you that he was a  widower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;What do you mean by such a  question? Lord Haughton was not a widower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lady,&rdquo; returned the clown, with insolent  significance; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right enough there. When Gervoise Palgrave asked you to  marry him he was <i>not</i> a widower, for  his first wife was alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel started to her feet in sudden anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried, <i>&ldquo;</i>you would dare to insinuate that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t insinuate anything about <i>you,&rdquo;</i> the man answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be  frightened, my lady. You are Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s lawfully wedded wife; for his  first wife was treacherously murdered upon the night before your wedding-day.&rdquo;  Some women would have fallen senseless and lifeless to the ground, smitten by  these words as by a thunderbolt. But Ethel&rsquo;s was no common schoolgirl nature.  She stood erect, motionless as a statue, with her eyes fixed upon the grinning  wretch who sat opposite to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lie!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;an infamous and wicked  lie! A base plot against my happiness and my husband&rsquo;s honour. I will never  believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AFriendInNeed"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  A Friend In Need</h2>
<p>Ten minutes after Mr. Vokes had been admitted to  the presence of the countess, another visitor arrived at Palgrave Chase. This  second visitor was Stephen Hurst, who had heard of the arrival of the earl and  countess, and had come immediately to call upon his cousin &mdash; the cousin he had  loved so truly and so hopelessly.</p>
<p><i>Had</i> loved! &mdash; alas, he loved  her still. Vainly had he striven to banish her dear image from his heart. He  still loved Ethel, as truly and faithfully as he had loved her in those happy,  never-to-be-forgotten days when they had wandered together in the woods about  Hyford Hall in the long vacation. Of course he indulged in the sophistries  common to men in his position; for he was a conscientious man, who tried to do  his duty unflinchingly. He flattered himself that his present feelings for  Ethel were very different from those of the past. He had ceased to love her: he  thought he felt for her now only a tender friendship, an eager desire to serve  her, if ever she had need of his aid.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances he considered himself  justified in making a very early call at Palgrave Chase.</p>
<p>The servant who admitted Mr. Hurst was the same man  who had, five or ten minutes previously, conducted Mr. Vokes to the countess&rsquo;s  apartment. He told Stephen that Lady Haughton was at that moment engaged with a  person who had called upon particular business.</p>
<p>The young man would have gone away after hearing  this, if he had not happened to encounter Lucy Trotter &mdash; Ethel&rsquo;s maid &mdash; a young  woman who had been seven years at the Hall, and whom her kind young mistress  treated rather as a humble friend than as a servant. This young person was  passing across an inner hall &mdash; on her way from one part of the house to another  &mdash; and heard Stephen Hurst&rsquo;s voice as he spoke to the servant. She made her  appearance immediately, and seemed delighted to see her old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, Mr. Stephen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go away  because our young miss &mdash; I meanter say, her ladyship the countess &mdash; but the old  way of talking do come so natural like &mdash; don&rsquo;t you go and run away because her  ladyship&rsquo;s got someone with her in the drawing-room. He&rsquo;s nobody. I sor him go  upstairs; and he&rsquo;s one of those shabby black, respectable kind of persons that  looks something betwixt and between an hotel-waiter and a methody minister.  He&rsquo;s only come for a subscription to a dancing-school for destitute  chimley-sweeps, or some such rubbish, I dessay. Never mind <i>him</i>, Mr. Stephen; you go up and see Miss Ethel &mdash; there I go again! &mdash;  but, sir, you know it does &mdash; now, don&rsquo;t it? You go up and see her: she&rsquo;ll be  glad enough to see you; and that&rsquo;ll be an excuse for gettin&rsquo; rid of the  minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Lucy, I really can&rsquo;t intrude upon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intrude upon fiddlesticks!&rdquo; cried Lucy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just like you, Mr. Stephen. As if you don&rsquo;t know my lady will be glad to see  you! I am sure I shall be very glad for you to see her, for she&rsquo;s in very low  spirits, poor dear, because of the earl&rsquo;s health being bad, which I never see  anyone lookin&rsquo; worse than he does, certainly, poor gentleman; and Miss Ethel  don&rsquo;t see the change in him as I do, through not having seen him since the  weddin&rsquo;-day. Now, you go upstairs, Mr. Stephen, and don&rsquo;t be nonsensical. The  idea of such ceremony between first cousins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephen went half unwillingly and unannounced to  the drawing-rooms which had been familiar to him in the last Lord Haughton&rsquo;s  lifetime. He went into the first room and shut the door behind him, and went  into the centre and larger apartment. But here he was arrested suddenly by a  sound that came from the inner room &mdash; the sound of a woman&rsquo;s passionate  sobbing, while a man&rsquo;s hard voice went on, relentless as the voice of fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the afternoon of the last day of February,&rdquo;  said this voice, &ldquo;you and Gervoise Palgrave were riding together through the  town of Avondale.  You were riding past a little tavern where the market-people assemble, when a  woman ran out, tried to seize the bridle of your lover&rsquo;s horse, and called him  a villain and a scoundrel. The Earl of Haughton took this very lightly: the  wretched woman was mad or drunk, he said &mdash; it was altogether a most absurd  business. But yet I doubt if my Lord Haughton was quite in his usual spirits  for the rest of that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cruel voice paused, and Stephen Hurst heard the  woman&rsquo;s sobs grow louder. He listened &mdash; it was base and mean, perhaps, to  listen, but if it were so, Stephen was unconscious of either baseness or  meanness; he only felt that the most vital interests of the woman he loved were  affected by the words to which he listened, and that it was his business to  protect and defend her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wretched woman was carried to some humble  shelter in the Avondale inn. They put her in a stable, I think, or a loft, or  some place of that description. It was good enough for her, for she was only a  miserable tramp, who, in her mad drunkenness, had been so audacious as to  attack the master of Palgrave Chase. She was put in a loft over a stable, and  when she was sought for on the following morning, she was nowhere to be found.  Pardon me &mdash; she <i>was</i> to be found, but  not in the neighbourhood of the inn. She was found drowned in the river Avon, and her dead body was carried through Pendon  churchyard five minutes before your wedding with the man who had been her  husband. O yes, Lady Haughton, I told you only the truth when I said that your  marriage was in perfect accordance with the law of the land. Your husband was a  widower when you married him; his first wife had been dead half-a-dozen hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; cried Ethel&rsquo;s voice, broken  by sobs. &ldquo;I do not know what motive you may have in bringing me this story; but  nothing short of my husband&rsquo;s own confession would make me believe that he had  deceived me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very incredulous, Lady Haughton. Why not  go to Gervoise Palgrave, tell him what I have told you, and if my assertions  are false, let him disprove them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel was silent for a few moments, and again  Stephen heard her low hysterical sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband is ill,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I cannot disturb  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>fear</i> to go to him, Lady Haughton,&rdquo; answered Mr. Vokes; &ldquo;you fear. You know I have  told you the truth. I will tell you even more: that wretched woman, your  husband&rsquo;s first wife, was lured away from Avondale, and treacherously murdered  by Gervoise Palgrave, the man you love. I have proof of your husband&rsquo;s guilt,  and I shall know how to make good use of it. Look back, Lady Haughton &mdash; look  back, and remember all that has passed between you and your husband, and ask  yourself if every circumstance in the past does not point to one conclusion.  Your husband is ill, you say? Shall I tell you why he is ill? shall I tell you  the nature of his disease? He is sinking under the burden of a guilty  conscience. It is remorse which is sapping at the very roots of his life. Judge  for yourself whether it is any common disorder which has stricken him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments there was silence. Then, in a  voice that was subdued and yet resolute, Ethel asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you come to me with this story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are the person most interested in Lord  Haughton&rsquo;s welfare, and it is with you I must come to an understanding as to  whether I am to keep this matter secret, or do my duty, and see Gervoise  Palgrave&rsquo;s dead wife avenged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Stephen Hurst, crossing the  threshold of the inner room as he spoke, &ldquo;it is not with Lady Haughton, but  with me, that you must come to an understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sudden aspect of this young man, who entered  the room with his head erect, and his eyes flashing with indignant fire, the  valiant Herr von Volterchoker faltered a little; but he recovered himself  quickly enough, and it was in a tone of supreme insolence that he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have listeners, then, hanging about your  rooms, it seems, Lady Haughton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Stephen; <i>&ldquo;</i>but on this occasion Lady Haughton happened to have her friend and  kinsman near at hand when she had most need of his service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr von Volterchoker seemed rather discomposed by  this speech.</p>
<p>Ethel tottered forward a few paces, and flung  herself on the ground at her cousin&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not true,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this cannot be  true. O Stephen, speak to me, for pity&rsquo;s sake; give me some comfort, for this  man has almost driven me mad &mdash; say that it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe that he has spoken the whole  truth, Ethel,&rdquo; Stephen replied, raising the distracted girl from the ground. <i>&ldquo;</i>He may have spoken some of the truth,  perhaps; and a little truth eked out by a good deal of falsehood makes the  terrible machinery by which many a man has paid the penalty of crimes he never  committed. Sit down, Ethel; sit down, and calm yourself. Let me talk to this  man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man has a name as well as other men,&rdquo;  observed Mr. Vokes insolently, &ldquo;and you may as well call him by it while you&rsquo;re  about it. My name&rsquo;s Vokes, at your service &mdash; William Vokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung himself upon a low couch near the window  as he spoke, and stretched out his long legs; but he was by no means as much at  home as he had been before Stephen&rsquo;s appearance, though he tried to carry off  his lurking uneasiness by a little extra swagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you come here with this story about Lord  Haughton?&rdquo; Stephen asked, in a calm business-like tone. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re an honest  man, and want to use your information in the interests of society, why don&rsquo;t  you go straight to the nearest magistate and tell him what you suspect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Stephen,&rdquo; cried Ethel, &ldquo;is this the way you help  me?&rdquo; But the young rector took no notice of this interruption. He never removed  his eyes from Herr von Volterchoker&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re an honest man, take your suspicions to  the proper quarter,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bring them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose I&rsquo;m not an honest man,&rdquo; returned Mr.  Vokes, folding his arms and confronting Stephen with an air of spurious  confidence. &ldquo;Suppose I&rsquo;m not an honest man &mdash; at any rate, no more honest than  the generality of my species. Suppose I want to turn my information to good  account, for my own benefit, and not for the advantage of society at large. How  if, having found this secret, I&rsquo;m prepared to sell it in the best market? How  then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a scoundrel,&rdquo; answered Stephen, &ldquo;and  we must deal with you as a scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably. But it sometimes happens that a  scoundrel picks up a big diamond, and the precious stone&rsquo;s worth just as much  as if it had been picked up by the Archbishop of Canterbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how if the pretended diamond is only a bit of  glass, Mr. Vokes? How if your secret is no secret, but merely a concoction of  your own lively brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can prove one part of it in half a second,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Vokes; &ldquo;I can prove that Gervoise Palgrave was married before he  married his present wife, for I have the certificate of his first marriage in  my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out his pocket-book as he spoke, selected  the certificate from several other papers, walked to where Stephen Hurst was  seated, and held the document open before him while he read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This paper certifies the marriage of Gervoise  Palgrave with one Agatha Pickshaw,&rdquo; said Stephen very coolly; &ldquo;but how do I  know that the Gervoise Palgrave here named was Gervoise Palgrave, Lord  Haughton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was rather an awkward pause after this. Ethel  watched the two men breathlessly, with a terrible interest in every word that  was spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, as for <i>that,&rdquo;</i> exclaimed Herr von Volterchoker, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy enough to prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but it remains to be proved. People are  not found guilty of murder upon very slight evidence nowadays, and the evidence  you have to bring against Lord Haughton isn&rsquo;t strong enough to hang a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vokes put the certificate in his pocket. He sat  down again, and amused himself by gnawing his finger-nails furiously, like a  savage cur mumbling a stolen bone. It had been easy enough to frighten a loving  woman, who was ready to take alarm at the first whisper of danger to the man  she loved; but it was a very different matter to confront this self-possessed  young parson, who seemed to have all his wits about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had better try to dispose of my  information elsewhere,&rdquo; the clown said presently.</p>
<p>He was white with suppressed rage, and he trembled  as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think you had,&rdquo; Stephen replied, with  consummate politeness; &ldquo;your information has had no effect here but to occasion  causeless alarm in Lady Haughton&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; answered the clown, with a savage  sneer; &ldquo;I make no doubt I shall find a market for my secret. I told Lady  Haughton that I possessed the proof of her husband&rsquo;s guilt; she will know that  I have spoken the truth &mdash; when it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put on his hat and went towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; cried Ethel passionately, &ldquo;you will  never surely let this man go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If his secret is worth buying, I will pay him for  it,&rdquo; Stephen said quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that it is; but if I am hasty in  coming to that conclusion, let Mr. Vokes meet me at my lawyer&rsquo;s office  to-morrow at two o&rsquo;clock. I shall be ready to hear anything he may have to  say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not condescend to enter into any  negotiation with you, sir,&rdquo; answered Mr. Vokes. &ldquo;When next I discuss this  business it will be with the Earl of Haughton himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the clown stalked away, followed by Stephen,  who saw Mr. Vokes to the staircase, and committed him to the care of one of the  lounging footmen always to be found in the neighbourhood of the hall.</p>
<p>The young man then went back to Ethel. She was  standing near the window, pale, but very calm. She had wiped the tears from her  swollen eyelids, but the expression of her face was more piteous than if it had  been drowned in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she said imploringly, &ldquo;since you have  heard what this man has said, I can only look to you for help. I know that it  is not true &mdash; it cannot be true; but I look to you to protect my husband from  this man. There may be some secret &mdash; some cloud upon his past life; and if it  is so, I am ready to bear my part of the burden. I love him so dearly, that if  there is suffering to be endured, I would bear it willingly for his sake. I  would bear it gladly, if by so doing I could save him one pang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephen turned to the window and looked out at the  sloping shrubberies as Ethel said this. How vainly he had yearned for this  girl&rsquo;s love, and the supreme blessing had been withheld from him to be given so  freely to Gervoise Palgrave, the handsome stranger, the chance acquaintance of  a few weeks! Even to his Christian patience it seemed a hard thing; but he had  promised to be her faithful and constant friend, and he was prepared to perform  his promise unflinchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who has just gone away from this house is  a scoundrel and a swindler, Ethel,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;I watched his face just  now, while I was talking to him. He has no fatal secret to dispose of. I saw  the coward under the mask of the braggart: there is nothing to be feared from  him.</p>
<p>But there may be some half-truth in what he has  said. The certificate of marriage which he showed me may actually relate to  some early marriage of your husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should Gervoise conceal that marriage from  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The union may have been unhappy, or so humble a  marriage that Lord Haughton was too proud to speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think that,&rdquo; Ethel said mournfully. &ldquo;I  cannot think that Gervoise would disavow his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephen was silent. He remembered the period before  Ethel&rsquo;s marriage, and he remembered how Lord Haughton had for a considerable  time refrained from any declaration of his love, after that affection had  become an obvious fact to every observer. Did not this in some manner bear out  the stranger&rsquo;s assertion that Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s first wife had only died  within a very short time of his marriage with Ethel? Stephen was too generous  to reveal such thoughts as these to the unhappy wife, who so early needed his  consolation and support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let this man&rsquo;s slanders disturb you,  Ethel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will be for me to sift this business quietly, without  prejudice to Lord Haughton&rsquo;s interests. In the mean time I beg you to banish the  affair from your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to do so, for my husband&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very ill, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very ill. He was ill when he left Paris, and he seems much  worse this morning. I never thought I should have so sad a welcome to Palgrave  Chase. I look to you for help, Stephen. You promised to be my friend, and I  bitterly need your friendship. I must say good-bye now, for I must go and see  if Gervoise wants me. Will you stay and dine with us, Stephen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hurst declined this invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be of more use to you elsewhere, Ethel,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;I want to think this matter over very quietly before I decide how I  shall act in your behalf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Lady Haughton&rsquo;s cold hand in his own, and  pressed it tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Ethel!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If unselfish  wishes could help you, you would not long be unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to his pretty parsonage at Pendon, and  shut himself in the little room which he made his study. He made a pencil  memorandum of the particulars of the marriage certificate, and jotted down the  name of the bride, Agatha Pickshaw, and the name of the church at which the  marriage had taken place. The church was Saint Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first step must be to find out if the Gervoise  Palgrave mentioned in this document is Gervoise Palgrave, Lord Haughton,&rdquo;  thought the young man; &ldquo;and my next step shall be to inquire into the character  of Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s accuser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="HumphreysConfession"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  Humphrey&rsquo;s Confession</h2>
<p>Ethel went straight to her husband&rsquo;s room after  Stephen Hurst had left her. Gervoise had risen now, and was sitting near the  fire in his study, pale and haggard-looking, wrapped in a long dark velvet  dressing-gown, and with his unkempt hair falling in disorder upon his forehead.  He looked up as his wife entered the room, and held out his hand to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were out, my darling,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>No, Gervoise, I have been  home a long time; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had visitors, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ethel answered, hesitating a little;  &ldquo;Stephen Horst has been with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>That&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why strange, dear Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have just sent one of the grooms to  fetch his father, and Mr. Warboys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fetch Mr. Warboys the lawyer!&rdquo; cried Laura;  &ldquo;what do you want with him, Gervoise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Haughton sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to tell you, my pet, you would be unhappy,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;You are too good for me, Ethel, too bright and beautiful. Happiness  has very rarely reigned at Palgrave Chase, my darling, and when she enters her  reign is never long. I think the house is doomed, Ethel, and all who dwell in  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Gervoise &mdash; Gervoise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frightened girl fell on her knees by her  husband&rsquo;s side. Doubt and fear took possession of her. She saw some vague  confirmation of the stranger&rsquo;s fearful accusations in her husband&rsquo;s manner, and  she trembled from head to foot as she knelt by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Gervoise,&rdquo; she cried piteously, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be  true &mdash; it can&rsquo;t be true! Tell me that it is not true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Haughton turned his haggard eyes upon his  wife&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Ethel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer him at first, but she still  knelt at his feet, looking up at his white, careworn face. She looked at him  and saw something more than physical weakness or physical pain in those wan and  altered lineaments. She pitied him with all her woman&rsquo;s heart, with all the  force of her pure and noble soul, and yet something within her, stronger than  her own will, seemed to urge her on to sound the depths of those secret  thoughts that had been so carefully hidden from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gervoise,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, and then she  went on speaking very slowly, and with her innocent eyes fixed upon her  husband&rsquo;s face as she spoke, &ldquo;Gervoise, I had a dreadful dream last night, and  the remembrance of it haunts me to-day. I dreamt that a man came to me, a man  whose face I had never seen before, and spoke to me of you. O Gervoise, he told  me that there was a blight upon our wedding morning, and that the shadow of  death came between us and divided us when we should have been happiest and most  united. He told me this, and then he led me out from this house into the dark night,  and led me on until we came to a stream of black, troubled water, and on the  flat shore beside that troubled river there lay the body of a woman, drowned,  Gervoise &mdash; drowned, poor wretched creature. The moon had been hidden by the  clouds until that moment, but in that moment the clouds swept away, and I saw  the woman&rsquo;s face. Shall I tell you whose face it was, Gervoise? It was the face  of the woman who stopped your horse in Avondale market-place on the day before  our wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave groaned aloud, and hid his face  upon his wife&rsquo;s breast. Her arms crept round him, and held him there; not  perhaps with their old impulsive love and confidence, but with the sheltering  tenderness of a mother who clings to the child she loves &mdash; the child from whom no  guilt, however black or horrible, can alienate her unreasoning affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all true, then,&rdquo; the wretched wife murmured  to herself, in a low, broken voice, while her husband&rsquo;s face was hidden upon  her shoulder, &ldquo;it is all true; and there is nothing left for me upon this earth  except to comfort and pity him.&rdquo; Her husband&rsquo;s head grew heavier and heavier as  it lay upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>She tried to lift it, and could not; and then, in a  sudden panic, screamed aloud for help.</p>
<p>Lord Haughton&rsquo;s valet came rushing in at the sound  of that terrified voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, look at him, help him!&rdquo; Ethel cried; &ldquo;his face  is as white as death. He is dying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the servant reassured her. His lordship had  only fainted, the man said. He brought cold water and hartshorn. Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s  eyes opened presently, and he stared about him with a faint convulsive shudder.  The valet led his master into the adjoining room and persuaded him to lie down.</p>
<p>Ethel stood near the fireplace in the study,  staring blankly at the burning coals. It seemed to her as if the powers of her  mind were paralysed. She could not realise the full horror of her position. She  knew that it was horrible, and that was all. She knew that her husband was  guilty, since he had tacitly confessed his guilt. She knew that he was guilty,  and that she loved him in spite of his guilt.</p>
<p>She went into the adjoining room presently and  would have seated herself beside the bed upon which Gervoise was lying; but the  valet whispered to her that Dr. Wilmington, the Birmingham physician, had  specially ordered rest and quiet for his patient. He was to be kept alone, and  was to sleep as much as possible. The recovery of his physical strength  entirely hinged upon the perfect repose of his mind.</p>
<p>Ethel bowed her head submissively and went away to  the pretty dressing-room, in which modern elegance was blended exquisitely with  the quaint grandeur of the past &mdash; the room which had been prepared for a happy  wife, and in which a miserable woman flung herself upon her knees, and wept  aloud for her guilty husband.</p>
<p>She wept and prayed for him; she tried to think of  the nature of his guilt, but she could not. Her love came between his image and  the crime which she believed him to have committed, and she could not realise  the extent of his wickedness. She remained for hours half kneeling, half lying  beside a <i>prie-dieu</i> chair in her  dressing-room. The tears poured in torrents at first, and then dried and left  her eyes bloodshot and haggard. Sometimes her lips moved in passionate prayer  and supplication for the guilty creature to whom her heart so obstinately  clung; at other times she sank into a kind of stupor, in which she had only a  vagu&eacute; sense of some overwhelming grief which had suddenly darkened her life.</p>
<p>She remained thus until the low western sunlight  glowed redly upon her window, and flecked the oaken wainscot with crimson  brightness. Then she rose half mechanically, and drew a shawl round her, for  the fire had burnt itself out, and she was cold and shivering.</p>
<p>The broad window of her dressing-room was ajar, and  beyond the window there was an iron balcony, and a light iron stair leading  down into the flower-garden, below which the waterfall rushed over the mossy  crags and boulders. With her shawl wrapped closely round her, Ethel went slowly  down the iron steps, and across the smooth turf, winding in and out amongst the  beds of bright flowers, until she came to the steps in the side of the  river-bank &mdash; the rugged steps down which Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s first wife had  gone to her death, on the bleak, starless eve of Ethel&rsquo;s wedding-day.</p>
<p>The young countess little knew whose footsteps had  trodden the pathway she was now following. She went down the rugged mossy  steps, and across a little rustic wooden bridge that spanned the waterfall. She  went mechanically, scarcely knowing whither she went, wandering anywhere in the  agonised restlessness of her grief.</p>
<p>The gray twilight was creeping over the sky, and  the low streaks of vivid crimson in the west grew lurid in the gathering  darkness, and glinted upon the black trunks of the trees like splashes of wet  blood; so, at least, it seemed to Ethel, to whose tortured mind all common  things assumed strange, distorted images.</p>
<p>She wandered on under the fir-trees, whose dark  foliage loomed against the fading sunlight like the black plumes in a funeral  procession. The wind had risen with the going down of the sun, and the upper  branches of the firs tossed to and fro against the low yellow light.</p>
<p>Ethel shuddered at the image suggested by those  waving branches &mdash; she shuddered as she thought that perhaps the greatest mercy  pitying Heaven could grant to the sinful lord of Palgrave Chase was an early  death, which would release him from the dread burden of his guilty shame.</p>
<p>Her mind was filled with these gloomy thoughts as  she wound her way, with a slow, mechanical step, amongst the pine-trees,  through an atmosphere that was odorous with their faint incense-like perfume.  She walked on, wrapped in her own despair, like some sleepwalker who wanders  blindly hither and thither in a painful dream, until she found herself close to  the lighted casement of the lodge that was kept by Margery Melwood and her son.</p>
<p>No mention of this man&rsquo;s name had dropped from the  false lips of Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s accuser. Herr von Volterchoker knew the  secret of the poor man&rsquo;s guilt; but that secret was useless to him, save so far  as he could use it against the rich man.</p>
<p>Ethel knew nothing of Humphrey Melwood, except that  he was a handsome, gipsy-faced young man, who was ready to <i>go</i> through fire and water in the service of his foster-brother.</p>
<p>This was enough to render the loving young wife  well disposed to the reformed poacher.</p>
<p>There was no garden before the lodge; the casement  window looked out upon a narrow plot of grass that skirted the drive, and  widened into a little shrubbery on one side of the gates. One half of the  diamond-paned casement was open this evening as Ethel approached the lodge, for  the wind that tossed the fir-trees was a southern wind, and the evening was  warm.</p>
<p>The light within the cottage was the light of a  fire, and before that fire there were two figures &mdash; two figures that flung  great black shadows upon the low ceiling and the whitewashed wall, and seemed  to fill the little room with their presence. One of these figures was an old  woman, sitting in an armchair, close to the fire; the other was a man &mdash; a man  with a brown face, glittering black eyes, and tumbled raven hair &mdash; a man who  was half-lying, half-sitting on the ground, with his face turned towards the  fire, and his head resting on the woman&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>Some instinct, something stronger than her own weak  will, led Ethel to this open window. It may have been that a shuddering horror  of the loneliness around, the black fir-grove and the darkening sky, had taken  possession of her. She went up to the window with slow, weary steps, that were  noiseless upon the soft turf; she went up to the window with the intention of  speaking to Margery Melwood and her son.</p>
<p>The young wife, the beautiful heiress of the great  ironmaster&rsquo;s wealth, the happy child, whose girlhood had been one bright  holiday, yearned now for the sound of a human voice to break the dreadful  silence of her despair.</p>
<p>She was close beside the little window when she was  startled by the sound of her husband&rsquo;s name. She paused only in the first impulse  of surprise, but in that pause, brief though it was, she heard that which  rooted her to the spot, as if she had been held there by a hand of iron.</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood was speaking. He was speaking to  his mother, but he was not looking at her. His gaze was fixed upon the red  coals before him, and Ethel saw the firelight reflected in the black depths of  his gleaming eyes. The young man&rsquo;s head still leaned against his mother&rsquo;s knee:  it leaned there, but it did not rest, for every now and then, as Humphrey spoke,  he rolled his head from side to side like a wretched, fever-stricken creature  who tosses to and fro upon his sleepless pillow. The old woman&rsquo;s face was bent  over her son, and thus completely hidden from Ethel; but from the convulsive  movement of her shoulders the watcher knew that Humphrey&rsquo;s mother was sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; the young man said, &ldquo;it was for his  sake &mdash; for my little foster-brother, Gervoise; for my first friend, Master  Gervoise; for my master, the new Earl of Haughton, &mdash; it was for him I did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the words that rooted Ethel to the spot  on which she stood. She was standing behind the window, close to the wall of  the house, and she could hear every word that was spoken within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept my secret, mother, and I must keep it to  the end. There&rsquo;s only one man who knows it, and he must have the devil himself  for a friend, or else he couldn&rsquo;t have found it out. That man who came here one  night directly after my lord&rsquo;s wedding &mdash; he knows it; and if he speaks and  tells what he knows, they&rsquo;ll hang me, I suppose. It would be almost a charity  to do it, for at least that would put me out of my misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it, Humphrey?&rdquo; cried the old woman  in a stifled voice. &ldquo;O, why, why did you do this dreadful deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother? Because <i>his</i> happiness depended upon it; because I saw his misery, and the  sight of it made me mad. He sent me that night &mdash; the night before his marriage  &mdash; he sent me to fetch the woman at the King&rsquo;s Head. She was in a loft over the  stables asleep, the ostler told me. He showed me to the place, and I went up  the steps and found her in the loft. She was lying in a drunken sleep, dressed  in her walking clothes, all but her bonnet, which was lying on the ground near  her. It wasn&rsquo;t easy to wake her; but I did wake her at last, and I told her  what Master Gervoise had ordered me to tell her. I told her that her husband  wanted her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and pushed his hair away from his  forehead, and stared at the fire in a gloomy silence. Then he went on again in  a slow, dreamy way, as if he had been talking to himself rather than to the  wretched mother who was listening to him in an agony of grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the gipsy blood that&rsquo;s in me makes me  different from other folks. I come of a people that don&rsquo;t set much value upon  their own lives or the lives of their neighbours. This woman stood in my  master&rsquo;s way. That thought was in my mind as I went alone to fetch her; that  thought was more than ever in my mind while I was walking back to the Chase,  with her by my side. She seemed a sulky kind of woman, and I fancied she was  stupefied by the drink she&rsquo;d taken. This was all I knew of her; but I hated  her, for she stood between my master and his hopes of happiness. I took her to  the house, and Master Gervoise let us in at the little door close to his own  rooms. We went in with him, and he took his wife into the little inner room  that&rsquo;s full of books and such-like, and he left me in the other room, where he  had been dining, and where the table was spread with wine and glasses. Master  Gervoise had told me to drink some wine, and I sat down by the fire and filled  a glass from the decanter that was nearest me. I don&rsquo;t know what the wine was,  but I know that it seemed very good. I went on drinking it till the bottle was  empty, and my brain was all on fire when Master Gervoise came in presently  alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped again, and moved his head again, and  then went on as he had done before, without once looking up at his mother. The  night-wind sweeping past the lodge fluttered Ethel&rsquo;s dress and shawl, but those  within the cottage were too much wrapped in their own thoughts to take heed of  the sounds without. So long as the gates remained locked, Margery Melwood  fancied herself safe from any eavesdropper. It was not likely that anyone from  the house would be prowling about the grounds on that dark cheerless night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Gervoise came in to me,&rdquo; said Humphrey,  &ldquo;and I saw at once, from his face, that all was wrong. He told me that his wife  refused to go away; and he told me with the same breath that no power on earth  should hinder him from keeping his engagement with Miss Hurst. There was a good  deal more said; but it all came to that, first and last. The woman refused to  leave England,  and Gervoise swore that he would be the husband of the girl he loved. It was  then that the black thought grew up in my mind; it was then that I resolved to  save my master from misery and disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he asked you?&rdquo; cried Margery Melwood; &ldquo;he  tempted you to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no word, mother; by neither word nor look. He  did not tempt me; it was my own love for him that tempted me. But he knew what  I was going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, as well as I knew the thought that  was in my own mind. He knew what I meant to do, and he never bade me hold my  hand. Heaven help him, and Heaven pity me! I think we were both mad that night,  mother. Do you know what dreams are &mdash; those dreadful dreams in which one gropes  about in the dark upon the edge of a horrible precipice, pushed on against  one&rsquo;s own will by a man whose face is hidden? That night seemed to me like one  of those dreams. I knew what my master wanted: he wanted to get rid of that  woman somehow or other; and I knew that he had only me to help him. I told him  that I would get her away, safely out of the way, and that all should be right.  He knew what I meant, mother. I saw it in his face; I heard it in his voice  when he spoke to the woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause; and in the silence Ethel heard  the southern wind sighing amongst the fir-trees, the dropping of the ashes on  the hearth, and Margery Melwood&rsquo;s voice moaning faintly, &ldquo;O my son, my son &mdash; my  wretched, guilty son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to take the woman back to Avondale. That was  what my master said to her. He would send for her, or go himself to fetch her &mdash;  I forget which he said &mdash; the following morning. To me that to-morrow morning  seemed as far off as the end of the world. Master Gervoise said something to me  about money. I should want money, he said, to get the woman out of the way &mdash;  making believe to think there&rsquo;d be the expenses of her journey, and such-like;  but I knew by his shaking voice that he was telling a lie. He let us out at the  little door by which he had admitted us a couple of hours before; and we went  across the flower-garden, and down the steps in the cliff, the woman clinging  to me as she felt her way upon the slippery stairs. I held her arm as we went  along by the side of the water. She pleaded very hard to go the other way, by  the high-road; she was afraid of that narrow path by the water. She pleaded  very hard. O my God, I can hear her voice in my ears at this moment; I have  heard it always &mdash; ever since that night! And yet I live, mother &mdash; I live, I  live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man stopped, and for the first time since  Ethel had begun to watch him he covered his face with his brawny hands, and  gave way to a paroxysm of grief. He went on at last, but in a broken voice, and  with a wild terror in his great black eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took her down by the lonely pathway, mother; but  I couldn&rsquo;t do it at first. I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to do it, though I fancied there  were voices in the rushing of the water that kept crying to me that I was a  coward, and that it ought to be done at once. I led her along the river-bank,  not towards Avondale, but the other way, across the meadows betwixt this place  and Pendon churchyard. Poor creature! she was a stranger, and she fancied I was  leading her right until we got very far towards Pendon, and then she cried out  that I was taking her the wrong way, that I was leading her into some lonely  place where she would lose herself. I turned back when she said this, and we  went towards the Chase again; but still I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to do what it was in  my mind to do. So presently I asked her if she would go abroad, over the sea to  America,  or somewhere. I asked her if any sum of money would tempt her to do this; but  she answered me in an obstinate, sulky way, and told me that nothing on earth  would tempt her to leave Avondale unless her husband went with her. &lsquo;He has  deserted me once,&rsquo; she said, in the same determined way, &lsquo;and he shall never  abandon me again while I live!&rsquo; I told her that she was a very foolish woman,  and that if she cared for her own safety, for the safety of her life, she had  best give way, and do what she was asked to do. God help me, mother! When I  said this I wanted to give her a chance; I wanted to save her. I think I would  have given my own life if I could have served my foster-brother without doing  the wicked deed that was in my mind. If she had been a man, and had provoked  me, and we had fallen upon one another, each of us with a knife in his hand, I  would have held the sin of bloodshed light enough; but she was a woman, and we  were alone together in the darkness, she clinging to me as we groped along the  slippery path, and there was not a creature near to help her. I gave her that  one chance. I told her if she cared for the safety of her life she would do  well to give way, and not provoke Gervoise Palgrave; but she told me that her  life was of little value to her, for she was a miserable wretch, and that her chief  motive for living was the hope of being revenged on the man who had deserted  her. Three times I gave her the same warning; three times she answered me in  the same words and in the same tone; till at last she provoked me, and I put my  hands upon her shoulders and held her rooted to the slippery ground, close upon  the edge of the water. &lsquo;I am going to kill you!&rsquo; I said; <i>&lsquo;</i>you are as obstinate as death; but you shall never stand in the  way of my master&rsquo;s happiness.&rsquo; She gave a long, horrible scream, and clutched  with her thin fingers at the scarf that was tied round my neck. I feel her  fingers dragging at me now, mother &mdash; it is very seldom that I do not feel them  &mdash; and their frozen touch creeps to my very heart, and seems to stop its  beating. I pushed her backwards, her feet slipped upon the mossy ground, and  she fell with a great splash into the water. I didn&rsquo;t stop to see how she fell,  or when she sank. I ran away, and ran with all my might; but her scream rang in  my ears as I went, and the air seemed filled with the sound of it. I ran for  upwards of a mile, and then I stopped and drew breath. I walked on again, and  walked till morning, following every twist and turn of the river, until about  an hour before daybreak, when I came in sight of a village called Renthorpe.  You know it, I daresay, mother: it&rsquo;s full seventeen miles from here. I found a  little public-house &mdash; a humble little place, called the Hen and Chickens &mdash;  where I sat all day drinking and smoking. You remember the 1st of March, Lord  Haughton&rsquo;s wedding-day; and you remember my coming home late at night, mother,  with my boots and gaiters all stained with clay and mud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I remember, I remember,&rdquo; the old woman  moaned. &ldquo;I remember that night &mdash; too well, too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humphrey Melwood staggered to his feet, and took  his hat from a peg behind the little door that closed upon the staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all the story now, mother; and now  you know the reason of the change in me. I&rsquo;ve been a wicked, guilty wretch; but  what&rsquo;s worst of all to me is, that my wretchedness doesn&rsquo;t seem to have done  any good to him I wanted to serve. I was up at the house this morning, in the  hope of seeing my lord; but though it was close upon midday he hadn&rsquo;t left his  room, and his valet told me that he didn&rsquo;t think his master would live to see  harvest-time. I&rsquo;m going out now, mother; don&rsquo;t sit up for me if I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Humphrey?&rdquo; the old woman  asked entreatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, mother, as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Humphrey, Humphrey, you&rsquo;re going to the  public-house again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the only place where I can buy  forgetfulness!&rdquo; the young man answered fiercely, jingling some money in the  loose pocket of his velveteen shooting-jacket. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hinder me, mother, unless  you want to see me mad. You&rsquo;ve questioned and watched me, to find out what was  the matter with me. You know all about it now, and you know why I&rsquo;ve turned sot  and idler, at the very time when folks were beginning to talk of Humphrey  Melwood&rsquo;s growing an honest industrious fellow after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man opened the door, and went out upon  the gravel drive. Ethel drew herself against the wall, between the door and  window, and though Humphrey brushed against her dress as he passed her, he was  quite unconscious of her presence. He unlocked the gates, opened one of them,  and went out into the road, banging the gate behind him as he went.</p>
<p>The wretched wife crept slowly away from the place  where she had heard the story of her husband&rsquo;s secret. To some women it might  have been a relief to know that the hand they loved was free from actual guilt.  But it was not so to Ethel. To her it was no comfort to know that another had  done the fatal deed, since it had been done for his sake, and he had failed to  intercede for the victim by so much as a word, by so much as a look.</p>
<p>But was this so? Was she to accept Humphrey  Melwood&rsquo;s condemnation of the man she loved? Alas, yes; for Humphrey&rsquo;s  confession had only confirmed the mute revelation which Gervoise had already  made of his guilt. The fitful colour in his face, the feverish sparkle in his  eyes, the restless gaiety, the sudden fits of gloom &mdash; to Ethel&rsquo;s innocent mind  these signs had been all incomprehensible until to-day. But she had the clue to  the secret now; and she looked back and saw that, from the hour of the marriage  in Pendon Church, her husband&rsquo;s mind had been  haunted by the shadow of his victim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Identified"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  Identified</h2>
<p>Stephen Hurst went to work very quietly to  investigate the wild accusation made by Herr von Volterchoker. It was a strange  position for him to occupy, since, in so doing, he was acting as the friend of  the man who, of all other men, he had most reason to dislike. But it was a part  of his compact with Ethel, since to serve her husband was to do her double  service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, how she loves him!&rdquo; the young man thought. &ldquo;How  tenderly she loves him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After sitting in his study for upwards of an hour,  thinking over the business before him, and deliberating on the course which he  ought to pursue, the young man went to his father&rsquo;s lawyer, Mr. Warboys, of  Avondale &mdash; an elderly man, who was the very personification of gravity and  silence, and who might safely have been trusted with the state secrets of a  nation.</p>
<p>To this gentleman Stephen Hurst delegated the task  of watching the man who called himself Vokes, and lodged at the Rose and Crown  at Pendon. The lawyer set his confidential clerk to watch Mr. Vokes&rsquo;s present  movements, and, if possible, he was to obtain some information about the  stranger&rsquo;s past history.</p>
<p>Having thus secured the help of a very powerful  ally, Stephen was able to leave Warwickshire. He went to London by an evening train, which reached the  Euston terminus at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock. He slept at an hotel close to the  station, and early the next morning took a preparatory step towards  investigating the details of Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s marriage, supposing the  Gervoise Palgrave of the marriage certificate exhibited by Ethel&rsquo;s visitor to  be one and the same with Gervoise Palgrave, Earl of Haughton.</p>
<p>The copy of the certificate which the young  clergyman had made from memory told him that the marriage had been solemnised  at St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church, Westminster,  and that the bride&rsquo;s name was Pickshaw &mdash; Agatha Pickshaw, daughter of William  Pickshaw, of &mdash; </p>
<p>Here Stephen&rsquo;s memory had failed him. He had only  been able to read the certificate once, and though he had read it very  carefully, some of the details had escaped him. He remembered the name of the  bride and the bride&rsquo;s father, but he forgot the name of the street in which the  bride and her father lived.</p>
<p>But this omission might easily be remedied. He sent  for a Post-office Directory, and looked for the name of Pickshaw. There were  several Pickshaws altogether; but there was only one Pickshaw in Westminster, and this  Pickshaw was called William, and pursued the trade of carver and gilder, at No.  7 Little Tolmin-street.</p>
<p>Nothing could be clearer than this. Mr. Hurst took  a hasty breakfast, sent for a cab, and was driven off to Little Tolmin-street.  He found Mr. Pickshaw busily employed in the little workshop behind the  half-glass door. He came out at the sound of the bell, and bowed deferentially  to the young clergyman.</p>
<p>Stephen introduced himself very briefly. He was a  clergyman, he said, and he came in the interests of one of his parishioners.</p>
<p>The old man left his work, and took his visitor to  the sitting-room above the shop, the room in which his interview with Herr von  Volterchoker had taken place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are the father of Agatha Pickshaw<i>,&rdquo;</i> he said, &ldquo;who married a person named  Grervoise Palgrave some years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; the old man answered; &ldquo;and if you can  give me any information about my poor daughter, you will be doing me a great  favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know, then, what has become of Mrs.  Palgrave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, sir. And I would be very glad to  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little by little Mr. Pickshaw told Stephen the same  story he had told the clown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can give me no news about my daughter,  sir?&rdquo; the old man said, after he had told Stephen all that he had to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Pickshaw, as yet I can tell you nothing,&rdquo;  Mr. Hurst answered gravely; <i>&ldquo;</i>and I  fear that there is little hope you will ever have any good tidings of your  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O sir, you know that she is dead &mdash; you know that  my poor Agatha is dead &mdash; and you won&rsquo;t tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephen Hurst shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am certain of  nothing.</p>
<p>I am groping in the dark, and anything I say may  mislead you, since I am utterly ignorant of the truth. A woman was drowned last  March near Avondale, in Warwickshire, and I have been told that she was your  daughter, Agatha Palgrave. But I believe the man who told me this to be a  scoundrel, and I attach no credit to his assertions. I want, if possible, to  discover the identity of the man called Gervoise Palgrave, the man who married  your daughter. Can you help me to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man reflected for some moments, scratching  his head with a nervous feeble hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a photograph upstairs, sir,&rdquo; he said at  last. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a photograph of my son-in-law, that was taken a twelvemonth  after his marriage, if you&rsquo;d like to see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephen begged to be allowed to see the photograph.  The old man went outside the sitting-room door, and called to his daughter. The  girl&rsquo;s voice answered him from the story above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a photograph of Gervoise still hanging in  the room your sister Agatha used to sleep in, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pickshaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring it down, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl came down presently with the photograph in  her hand. It was a very poor likeness, framed in a tawdry gilt border of Mr.  Pickshaw&rsquo;s workmanship; but the resemblance was quite sufficient to identify  Gervoise Palgrave, Lord Haughton, as the Gervoise Palgrave who had married  Agatha Pickshaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my poor daughter&rsquo;s husband the person you are  looking for?&rdquo; asked the old man anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; this is the portrait of the person I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will that help you to find out what has become  of my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the knowledge will help me to do so; but  your daughter&rsquo;s fate is a mystery to me as yet. Our first and most important duty  is to find Gervoise Palgrave&rsquo;s son. Can you give me a minute description of the  man who called here with the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickshaw did his best to describe the personal  appearance of Herr von Volterchoker. Wherever he was at fault, his daughter  helped him out; and between them they gave a description which enabled Stephen  to recognise Mr. Pickshaw&rsquo;s visitor as the man who had intruded upon Lady  Haughton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know the man,&rdquo; Stephen said, &ldquo;and I have  good reason to think him a villain. But it strikes me that he is one of those  clever villains who are rather apt to overreach themselves. I will do my  uttermost to find the clue to your daughter&rsquo;s fate, Mr. Pickshaw, and it shall  go hard but that your grandson shall have his rights, even if his mother is beyond  the reach of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandson&rsquo;s rights!&rdquo; murmured the old man;  &ldquo;little Georgey&rsquo;s rights! Gervoise is better off, then, than he was when he  left me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; answered Stephen, &ldquo;much better off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pickshaws would fain have questioned him further,  but he would tell them nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some foundation of truth in that  man&rsquo;s accusation of Lord Haughton,&rdquo; Stephen thought, as he walked slowly away  from Tolmin-street; &ldquo;and if the story of the marriage was true, there may have  been some truth in the darker story of &mdash; Heaven grant that the earl&rsquo;s illness  may be a mortal one, and that his death may save Ethel from the shame and  anguish of knowing that she has married a villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Parting Of The Foster-Brothers</h2>
<p>Lord Haughton was dying. The doctors who attended  on him &mdash; the grave physicians from London and Birmingham, who held daily  consultations in one of the darksome old rooms at the Chase &mdash; no longer made  any pretence of hope. They told Ethel that she must be prepared for the worst.  Her husband was doomed: he had been foredoomed for a long time, the doctors  told her. She received these sad tidings very quietly. The doctors wondered at  her still white face, her blank tearless eyes.</p>
<p>It was better that it should be so, she thought.  What was there in life for this poor guilty creature, whose existence was  blighted by remorse for that foul crime in the doing of which he had been a  tacit accomplice?</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my God,&rdquo; she cried, in her lonely hours of  agony, &ldquo;to think that I, who love him so much, should confess that it is better  for him to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night and day she kept watch beside the dying man&rsquo;s  bed, only lying down for a brief interval of broken slumber on a sofa in the  adjoining room. Gervoise would have had her leave him, but she laid a gentle  hand upon his lips, and implored him not to say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be with you, Gervoise,&rdquo; she said  entreatingly; &ldquo;I am happy with you, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were quite alone when she said this; they were  alone, and the earl seemed a little better than usual. Ethel was sitting in a  low chair by the bedside, and the bright June sunshine was streaming into the  room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are happy with me?&rdquo; exclaimed Gervoise in a  faint, tremulous voice, looking at his wife with an expression of surprise;  &ldquo;you are happy with me; and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I know all, Gervoise,&rdquo; Ethel answered, in  a low earnest voice; &ldquo;I know all. I did not believe what that man told me; and  yet &mdash; and yet I thought he would scarcely dare to make such an accusation  unless there was some truth in his words. But I heard something else; I  overheard that most miserable young man, Humphrey Melwood, tell his mother the  dreadful story of that which happened on the night before my wedding. I heard  the story, Gervoise; I heard how you were tempted by this man in his mistaken  devotion to you &mdash; I heard and understood how he himself, poor ignorant  creature, was tempted by his love for you. The crime was very dreadful &mdash; most  horrible, most cruel; but O, my darling, there is forgiveness for all  wrongdoings; there is a God who has said that although our sins are as scarlet,  they shall be made white as snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s voice broke, and she burst into a  torrent of sobs, and buried her face in one of the pillows that supported the  wasted form of the invalid. Gervoise was silent, but great teardrops rolled  slowly down his hollow cheeks. For the first time since the night of Agatha&rsquo;s  appearance at Palgrave Chase, the icy bonds that bound that stubborn soul gave  way before the warm influence of holy words, and the guilty man wept. For the  first time, and in that moment, his weary heart felt something nearer peace  than it had ever known since that fatal night of crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can love me still, Ethel?&rdquo; he said, after  a long pause &mdash; a long silence in which the two sorrowful hearts beat in unison,  strengthened by the might of affection in that supreme hour of anguish; &ldquo;you  can love me still, in spite of all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest, better than I ever yet loved you,  for you have more need of my love. A wife&rsquo;s affection would indeed be worthless  if it grew less when it was most needed. I love you, Gervoise; and I know now  what an unquestioning, unreasoning sentiment love is. In all my misery it has  survived, unchanged and changeless. Trust in it, Gervoise &mdash; trust in it almost  as you may trust in the mercy of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young wife sat long by her husband&rsquo;s side,  talking to him and reading to him. She read blessed words out of that holy  gospel which brings sweet promises of mercy to the weary sinner; which offers  the bright hope of redemption to the penitent heart. He fell asleep by and by,  worn out by the emotions of that long interview; and Ethel slept too, in the  easy-chair by the invalid&rsquo;s bedside, until late in the evening, when she was  awakened by her faithful maid, Lucy Trotter, who brought her mistress a cup of  strong tea.</p>
<p>There was a shaded lamp burning on a table at some  distance from the bed when Ethel woke, and there was a bright wood fire, which  gave the invalid&rsquo;s chamber a comfortable and cheerful appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two more desolate creeturs than you two looked  when I first came into the room, with the fire low, and no candles, and your  white dress looking quite ghostly in the twilight, as if you was a warnin&rsquo;  sperit sittin&rsquo; by poor Lord Haughton&rsquo;s bedside, I never clapped eyes on. But I&rsquo;ve  tidied up and made things a bit comfortable, without disturbing of you; and now  do take a cup of tea, Miss Ethel, like a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy had never left off calling her young mistress  Miss Ethel in familiar converse. She had been a great comfort to the countess  in this terrible hour of trial, although she had no suspicion of that dark  secret which added such a terrible sting to Ethel&rsquo;s natural grief.</p>
<p>Late that night Gervoise rose suddenly from a long  sleep that had seemed strangely peaceful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see Humphrey,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I want to see  my foster-brother. I must see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was past eleven, but one of the servants was  sent immediately to tell the gamekeeper; and after an interval of little more  than a quarter of an hour the young man&rsquo;s heavy footsteps sounded in the room  next to Lord Haughton&rsquo;s, and in the next minute Humphrey came into the  sick-chamber. His hair was disordered, his eyes were bloodshot, and he had a  strange, scared look in his pale face. He had been drinking that night, and  almost every other night ever since the death of Agatha Palgrave; and he had  only just staggered home from an alehouse when the messenger arrived at Margery  Melwood&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>But at the sight of his foster-brother Humphrey  seemed to grow suddenly sober. He went to the bedside, and fell on his knees,  with his brawny arms clasped upon the silken coverlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O master,&rdquo; he cried, <i>&ldquo;</i>O master, I loved thee so, and yet I have brought thee to this. Me  and my wickedness have been a blight upon thy life, Master Gervoise; and yet  God knows I&rsquo;d have given my own life for thee, and held it no favour. But I  have been a wicked wretch, Master Gervoise, and have brought him as I love to  his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; gasped the Earl of Haughton, lifting  himself into a sitting position, and laying his wasted fingers on the  gamekeeper&rsquo;s clasped hands. &ldquo;My sin, Humphrey, my own sin, has brought me to  this. I sent for you to tell you that it was my own sin, Humphrey. Let the full  burden of it rest upon me. I have repented, Humphrey: an angel &mdash; an angel upon  earth &mdash; has spoken holy words of consolation to me. I have repented of my  dreadful sin; I have prayed, Humphrey, for you as well as for myself, and such  peace has come down upon my soul &mdash; such heavenly peace &mdash; that I dare to think  it is an earnest of God&rsquo;s forgiveness for my sins. And you, Humphrey &mdash; you,  too, will repent. Promise me that, by the fidelity which has been so fatal to  us both; promise me that you will repent, and pray, as I have prayed, for  pardon. Your life shall not be a hard one. My wife, who is an angel of patient  love and forgiveness, she will see that no common troubles of want or poverty  shall ever affect you, Humphrey. And now good-bye, old friend &mdash; foster-brother!  My prayer is that we may meet again, purified from our sins, in a better world.  Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man&rsquo;s feeble fingers tightened on the  rough hands of his foster-brother. A rain of burning tears fell upon those wan  fingers as Humphrey&rsquo;s face bent over them. The gamekeeper wept aloud in  passionate irrepressible grief.</p>
<p>Ethel heard his hoarse sobs, and came in to put an  end to this agonising interview. She touched Humphrey on the shoulder as he  knelt beside her husband&rsquo;s bed, and motioned to him to leave the room.</p>
<p>He obeyed her without an attempt at remonstrance.  With his hands clasped before his face, he moved with slow footsteps to the  door; but at the door he turned and spoke to Ethel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was for your sake, my lady,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it was  all for your sake. You&rsquo;d need love him well when you remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away as he finished speaking, and closed  the door after him as softly as if he had been accustomed to a sickroom.</p>
<p>That night, for the first time, Gervoise spoke to  Ethel of his child &mdash; the missing boy whom he had mourned sincerely and truly  enough, until his grief had melted away before the full sunshine of his  new-born love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Ethel, I must see him,&rdquo; the sick man cried in  eager, passionate accents; &ldquo;I must see that boy before I die, or else &mdash; who &mdash;  who will identify him &mdash; who will give the young earl his rights? I know that  you will protect and love him, Ethel; but I must identify him before I die.  Some impostor might be palmed off upon you if I die before I have identified my  son. I had a mark made upon his arm &mdash; the initials &lsquo;G. P.,&rsquo; and an earl&rsquo;s  coronet. But any wretch could simulate such a mark as that upon the arm of the  base-born brat he might choose to substitute for my son. And yet there is one  means by which you, Ethel, might recognise the boy. Last August, when I was  very poor &mdash; penniless, Ethel, starving; ah, you look wonderingly at me, poor  child! You have need to wonder, for mine is a strange history. Last August,  when I was wandering destitute upon the stones of London, I sold a picture &mdash; a portrait of my  boy &mdash; to a pawnbroker in Caslope-street, St. Giles&rsquo;s. Can you remember the name  of the street? Yes, yes, you will, I know; and you will find my boy for me,  Ethel. Warboys will help you. The child must be found; remember that, Ethel. I  must see him, and acknowledge him as my heir, before I die. Write, dearest;  write to Warboys at once. He is a clever old man. I know that it is late to  send to him but time is so short, Ethel, so short. I must see my boy before I  die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervoise sank back upon his pillow. All the  emotions of that day had terribly exhausted him, both bodily and mentally. He  grew delirious presently, and rambled strangely in his talk, making a confused  medley of all his past life; one moment fancying himself penniless in the  streets of London, at another moment screaming the chorus of some convivial  song that had been familiar to him at his spendthrift father&rsquo;s table; anon  echoing the shouts of the lookers-on when his cousin rode to his death.</p>
<p>The earl&rsquo;s valet came in to bathe his master&rsquo;s head  with some cooling lotion; but Ethel would suffer no hired nurse to tend that  beloved invalid. With her own hands she damped his burning forehead; with her  own hands she administered the fever-draught to those parched lips.</p>
<p>Then, when the delirium subsided, and the sick man  sank at last into a peaceful sleep, Ethel opened a writing-portfolio that lay  under the light of the shaded lamp on the table near the fire, and wrote to the  Avondale solicitor, telling him all that her husband had told her about the  missing child, and imploring him most piteously to employ every possible means  of finding the boy, since the earl&rsquo;s days and hours were numbered. It was  nearly two o&rsquo;clock in the morning when the countess sealed this letter, and  gave it into the hands of her husband&rsquo;s valet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of life and death,&rdquo; she said. <i>&ldquo;</i>You must wake one of the grooms, and  tell him to ride to Avondale immediately with this letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheLastOfGervoisePalgrave"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  The Last Of Gervoise Palgrave</h2>
<p>Stephen Hurst returned to Warwickshire the morning  after Mr. Warboys received Lady Haughton&rsquo;s letter, and the two men consulted  together as to what could be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child must be found at any price,&rdquo; said  Stephen, after he had read Ethel&rsquo;s letter; &ldquo;he must be found in time to be  recognised and acknowledged by his father. There is no hope, I suppose, for  Lord Haughton? he is really dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is dying. I saw Wilmington,  of Birmingham,  yesterday, and he told me that even the countess is resigned to the worst &mdash; to  the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child must be found, Warboys. I shall go to  the station at once, and send a telegram to Printing-house square. There must  be an advertisement for the missing boy in tomorrow&rsquo;s <i>Times.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Stephen Hurst seated himself at the table, took up  a pen, and wrote an advertisement offering a hundred pounds&rsquo; reward for the  production of George Palgrave. He gave a minute description of the child&rsquo;s  appearance, and of the mark upon his arm.</p>
<p>This advertisement he saw despatched to London by electric  telegraph. To the advertisement he added an entreaty that it might be  immediately inserted, as it related to a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Having done this, he hurried off to a  printing-office in Avondale market-place, where he set the printers to work to  strike off a hundred handbills containing the same announcement as that in the  advertisement.</p>
<p>Before evening these handbills were ready, and  without stopping to rest or refresh himself Mr. Hurst drove back to the railway  station, with the bills in a brown-paper parcel. He took a ticket for London, and left Avondale  by the evening express.</p>
<p>He alighted at the Euston terminus at ten o&rsquo;clock,  and drove at once to a police-station, whence he saw men sent right and left to  distribute his hundred handbills, while a thousand fresh ones were being  printed in an office near at hand.</p>
<p>Then, and then only, did Mr. Hurst take breath; and  at breakfast next morning he had the pleasure of reading his own advertisement  at the top of the second column in the <i>Times </i>supplement.</p>
<p>The doctors reigned supreme at Palgrave Chase. They  came backwards and forwards between Avondale and London,  and between Avondale and Birmingham,  and contrived to keep Gervoise Palgrave alive by the exercise of their skill  and science. Between them, and with infinite care and trouble, they kept the  feeble lamp of life faintly flickering, while the Earl of Haughton waited,  Heaven only knows how anxiously, for the coming of his son.</p>
<p>Sometimes he lay for hours together in a dull  stupor that was scarcely sleep; at other times he was delirious, and rambled  wildly in his talk, as he had done upon the night of his farewell interview  with Humphrey. But every now and then he started up suddenly from his pillow,  and asked one question, the form of which rarely varied, often as he repeated  it: &ldquo;Is there any news of my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slow days dragged themselves out, and as yet  there were no tidings of the missing child. The feeble flicker of the lamp grew  fainter and fainter, and Ethel trembled as she watched her husband&rsquo;s fitful  slumbers, fearing that every awakening would be the last.</p>
<p>One day the invalid seemed better, and even  stronger: a brighter light burned in his eyes, and a flash relieved the ghastly  whiteness of his careworn face. At first poor Ethel was deceived by that  seeming improvement; but when she spoke to Doctor Wilmington of her newborn  hopes, he shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Lady Haughton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I only wish I dared  give you hope. But I must not deceive you. You have sometimes watched a candle  burn itself out, have you not? If you have, you must have seen how brightly the  flame burns &mdash; at the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel bowed her head upon her hands, and wept  bitterly. All through that bright June day she sat by the dying man&rsquo;s bedside,  reading to him, and praying with him.</p>
<p>Stephen Hurst had paid several visits to the earl  in his capacity of priest and consoler. Gervoise had received him cordially,  and had listened to him with reverential attention; but after these serious  interviews, the sick man sometimes said to his wife, </p>
<p>&ldquo;The good words do me more good when you read them  to me, Ethel; my prayers seem most earnest when you pray with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The low sunlight shone upon those two young heads.  Gervoise lay very quietly with his wasted hand clasped in that of his wife,  with his eyes fixed lovingly on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own one!&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;my own one, how good  you have been to me! My sin has been bitterly punished, Ethel. It seems very,  very hard to leave you, my lovely and loving one, dear redeeming angel of my  life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lay silent, exhausted by emotion. The golden  light about the two young heads changed to a deeper gold, and then melted into  a faint crimson glow that trembled like the reflection of a distant fire upon  the dark oak walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; said the earl suddenly, &ldquo;I feel so much  better to-night; I almost feel as if a change had come to me &mdash; a change for the  better. I shall live, perhaps; I shall live, Ethel, and we shall be happy in  spite of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked in his wife&rsquo;s face; but something &mdash;  something indefinable in that pale earnest face &mdash; told him the falsehood of his  hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Ethel, you know something,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the  doctors have told you there is no hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hope upon earth, Gervoise,&rdquo; the wife cried in a  broken voice, &ldquo;but a better hope than that, dear &mdash; the hope that we may be  happy together in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her arm round her husband&rsquo;s neck as she spoke,  and in the next moment his head rested on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my angel,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;my angel of mercy and  consolation, it is not bitter to die thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But presently the earl&rsquo;s head was lifted suddenly;  his eyes flashed with a new light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he cried, holding up his hand, and  looking towards the door of the apartment; &ldquo;listen, Ethel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound which had startled the dying man was the  sound of a child&rsquo;s voice, an innocent childish voice, that cried, &ldquo;Papa, papa!  where are you, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son is found!&rdquo; cried the earl. &ldquo;Bing the bell,  Ethel; ring, dearest, and let every creature in the house come to witness my  recognition of my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel obeyed, and as she pulled the handle of the  bell, the door was opened, and Georgey ran into the room, and sprang into his  father&rsquo;s arms. Close behind him came Stephen Hurst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, papa,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;they told me you had gone away from me, and this gentleman says you  were looking for me all the time. But O, papa dear, how white your face is! &mdash;  how ill you look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was presently filled with eager witnesses.  Two of the medical men who attended upon the earl, and all the upper servants  of the household, were assembled there to witness Lord Haughton&rsquo;s recognition  of his son. And then, when this had been done, the father clasped the boy in  his arms in one fond last embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Georgey,&rdquo; he said, in a low tender voice, &ldquo;I am  going away on a long journey. I may never see you again upon this earth. I want  you to love this lady when I am gone. She will be a mother to you, my pet; for  she knows the sad story of your childhood, and she will pity you and love you  for my sake, Georgey; and because it is her nature to be tender and pitiful to  everything that has need of her sweet tenderness and pity. You will be very  happy with her, Georgey; much happier than you have ever been with me. And now  send him away, Ethel,&rdquo; said Lord Haughton to his wife; &ldquo;send the child away.  There is very little more time left for me on earth, and it belongs to you, my  darling wife; to you and to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>When the clocks of Avondale chimed midnight little  Georgey Palgrave was Earl of Haughton.</p>
<p>Stephen Hurst&rsquo;s search had been rewarded at last.  The boy had been discovered by means of one of the bills, which the  good-natured Irish wife of the organ-grinder had spelt out upon a dead wall in  the back slums of Westminster.</p>
<p>She hurried home to her husband and told him of her  wonderful discovery, and the two washed and dressed the boy in his tidiest  raiment, and carried him off to the police-office to claim the reward.</p>
<p>Gervoise Palgrave was buried in a niche next that  which held the coffins of his luckless cousin and the fair young countess. He  was buried on a stormy day, under a sky that looked dark against the windows of  St. Gwendoline&rsquo;s Church; and mingled with the howling of the wind that shook  the doors and windows of the edifice, and fluttered the clergyman&rsquo;s white robes  as he stood above the open vault, there was the sound of hoarse and passionate  sobs, the voice of a strong man&rsquo;s ungovernable anguish. That mourner, whose  violent grief would not be repressed, was Humphrey Melwood.</p>
<p>After the funeral ceremony he wandered out into the  meadows through which the winding river took its course. He wandered on  indifferent to the beating of the rain, the howling of the wind, that seemed to  shriek as it swept across the flat meadows; and it was not until nightfall that  he went into a low, tumble-down-looking village inn &mdash; the same place where he  had gone for a shelter upon the morning of Ethel&rsquo;s wedding-day.</p>
<p>Here he sat, drinking deeply, but silently and  moodily, heedless of the rustic talk of a little group of villagers who dropped  one by one into the low-roofed tap-room, wrapped in a gloomy silence, and with  a dark and settled shadow on his face.</p>
<p>The villagers left as they had come, one by one,  and the last who went away left Humphrey Melwood still ordering fresh drink.</p>
<p>He did not leave the place till he was sent away by  the landlord, who wanted to shut up his house, and did not care to stop up any  longer, even for the sake of a customer who drank a bottle of brandy at a  sitting.</p>
<p>Humphrey flung the man a sovereign, and told him,  in a hoarse thick voice, not to trouble himself about the change. Then, with  slow, heavy footsteps, he staggered out of the house, out into the dark, stormy  night, never again to be seen alive by any mortal eyes; never again to be seen  till, in the dismal early light of morning, his dead body was found washed on  shore not half a mile from the spot where the corpse of his victim had been  found on the bridal morning of Ethel Hurst.</p>
<p>Whether he had drowned himself, or whether he had  lost his way and stumbled into the water, under the inky darkness of that  stormy night, there was no one to say. The coroner&rsquo;s jury returned an open  verdict, and Humphrey Melwood was buried in a little gloomy graveyard behind  St. Gwendoline&rsquo;s Church, and only half-a-dozen paces from the vault of the  Palgraves.</p>
<p>For nearly four years Lady Haughton remained a  widow, leading a solitary life, whose chief occupation was the performance of  good works. To the poor around Palgrave Chase she was a ministering angel, to  her dead husband&rsquo;s son the most tender and devoted of mothers. The boy was her  comfort and happiness; and she told herself that it was for his sake she consented  to a second marriage, when, after those quiet years of widowhood, she became  the wife of his guardian, tutor, and friend, and her own first cousin, Stephen  Hurst, much to the delight of Sir Langley, and with the hearty approval of that  self-appointed Areopagus of modem civilisation, Society, as represented by the  county families.</p>
<p>And what of Herr von Volterchoker? The end of his career it is not given this chronicler  to record. Foiled of his hoped-for prize, he fell back into the ranks of  vagabondism, to sink lower and lower in the social scale, until he descended to  that last depth to which none need care to follow him. Few among the dangerous  classes are better known or more closely watched by the police, who hopefully  await the hour when Herr von Volterchoker, <i>alias</i> Vokes, <i>alias</i> Slippery Valker, and a  few other names of dubious import, shall become amenable to penal servitude for  life.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="EvelinesVisitant"></a>Eveline&rsquo;s Visitant</h1>
<p align="center"><i>A Ghost Story</i></p>
<p>It was at a masked ball at the Palais Royal that my  fatal quarrel with my first cousin Andr&eacute; de Brissac began. The quarrel was  about a woman. The women who followed the footsteps of Philip of Orleans were  the causes of many such disputes; and there was scarcely one fair head in all  that glittering throng which, to a man versed in social histories and  mysteries, might not have seemed bedabbled with blood.</p>
<p>I shall not record the name of her for love of whom  Andr&eacute; de Brissac and I crossed one of the bridges, in the dim August dawn, on  our way to the waste ground beyond the church of Saint-Germain des Pr&egrave;s.</p>
<p>There were many beautiful vipers in those days, and  she was one of them. I can feel the chill breath of that August morning blowing  in my face, as I sit in my dismal chamber at my ch&acirc;teau of Puy Verdun to-night,  alone in the stillness, writing the strange story of my life. I can see the  white mist rising from the river, the grim outline of the Ch&acirc;telet, and the  square towers of Notre Dame black against the pale-gray sky. Even more vividly  can I recall Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s fair young face, as he stood opposite to me with his two  friends &mdash; scoundrels both, and alike eager for that unnatural fray. We were a  strange group to be seen in a summer sunrise, all of us fresh from the heat and  clamour of the Regent&rsquo;s saloons &mdash; Andr&eacute; in a quaint hunting-dress copied from a  family portrait at Puy Verdun, I costumed as one of Law&rsquo;s Mississippi Indians;  the other men in like garish frippery, adorned with broideries and jewels that  looked wan in the pale light of dawn.</p>
<p>Our quarrel had been a fierce one &mdash; a quarrel which  could have but one result, and that the direst. I had struck him; and the welt  raised by my open hand was crimson upon his fair womanish face as he stood  opposite to me. The eastern sun shone on the face presently, and dyed the cruel  mark with a deeper red; but the sting of my own wrongs was fresh, and I had not  yet learned to despise myself for that brutal outrage.</p>
<p>To Andr&eacute; de Brissac such an insult was most  terrible. He was the favourite of Fortune, the favourite of women; and I was  nothing, &mdash; a rough soldier who had done my country good service, but in the  boudoir of a Parab&egrave;re a mannerless boor.</p>
<p>We fought, and I wounded him mortally. Life had  been very sweet for him; and I think that a frenzy of despair took possession  of him when he felt the life-blood ebbing away. He beckoned me to him as he lay  on the ground. I went, and knelt at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Andr&eacute;!&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>He took no more heed of my words than if that  piteous entreaty had been the idle ripple of the river near at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Hector de Brissac,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am  not one who believes that a man has done with earth because his eyes glaze and  his jaw stiffens. They will bury me in the old vault at Puy Verdun; and you  will be master of the ch&acirc;teau. Ah, I know how lightly they take things in these  days, and how Dubois will laugh when he hears that <i>Ca</i> has been killed in a duel. They will bury me, and sing masses  for my soul; but you and I have not finished our affair yet, my cousin.</p>
<p>I will be with you when you least look to see me, &mdash;  I, with this ugly scar upon the face that women have praised and loved. I will  come to you when your life seems brightest.</p>
<p>I will come between you and all that you hold  fairest and dearest. My ghostly hand shall drop a poison in your cup of joy. My  shadowy form shall shut the sunlight from your life. Men with such iron will as  mine can do what they please, Hector de Brissac. It is my will to haunt you  when I am dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this in short broken sentences he whispered  into my ear. I had need to bend my ear close to his dying lips; but the iron  will of Andr&eacute; de Brissac was strong enough to do battle with Death, and I  believe he said all he wished to say before his head fell back upon the velvet  cloak they had spread beneath him, never to be lifted again.</p>
<p>As he lay there, you would have fancied him a  fragile stripling, too fair and frail for the struggle called life; but there  are those who remember the brief manhood of Andr&eacute; de Brissac, and who can bear  witness to the terrible force of that proud nature.</p>
<p>I stood looking down at the young face with that  foul mark upon it; and God knows I was sorry for what I had done.</p>
<p>Of those blasphemous threats which he had whispered  in my ear I took no heed. I was a soldier, and a believer. There was nothing  absolutely dreadful to me in the thought that I had killed this man. I had  killed many men on the battlefield; and this one had done me cruel wrong.</p>
<p>My friends would have had me cross the frontier to  escape the consequences of my act; but I was ready to face those consequences,  and I remained in France.  I kept aloof from the court, and received a hint that I had best confine myself  to my own province. Many masses were chanted in the little chapel of Puy Verdun  for the soul of my dead cousin, and his coffin filled a niche in the vault of  our ancestors.</p>
<p>His death had made me a rich man; and the thought  that it was so made my newly-acquired wealth very hateful to me. I lived a  lonely existence in the old ch&acirc;teau, where I rarely held converse with any but  the servants of the household, all of whom had served my cousin, and none of  whom liked me.</p>
<p>It was a hard and bitter life. It galled me, when I  rode through the village, to see the peasant-children shrink away from me. I  have seen old women cross themselves stealthily as I passed them by. Strange  reports had gone forth about me; and there were those who whispered that I had  given my soul to the Evil One as the price of my cousin&rsquo;s heritage. From my  boyhood I had been dark of visage and stern of manner; and hence, perhaps, no  woman&rsquo;s love had ever been mine. I remember my mother&rsquo;s face in all its changes  of expression; but I can remember no look of affection that ever shone on me.  That other woman, beneath whose feet I laid my heart, was pleased to accept my  homage, but she never loved me; and the end was treachery.</p>
<p>I had grown hateful to myself and had well-nigh  began to hate my fellow-creatures, when a feverish desire seized upon me, and I  pined to be back in the press and throng of the busy world once again. I went  back to Paris,  where I kept myself aloof from the court, and where an angel took compassion  upon me.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of an old comrade, a man whose  merits had been neglected, whose achievements had been ignored, and who sulked  in his shabby lodging like a rat in a hole, while all Paris went mad with the Scotch Financier, and  gentlemen and lacqueys were trampling one another to death in the Rue  Quincampoix. The only child of this little cross-grained old captain of  dragoons was an incarnate sunbeam, whose mortal name was Eveline Duchalet.</p>
<p>She loved me. The richest blessings of our lives  are often those which cost us least. I wasted the best years of my youth in the  worship of a wicked woman, who jilted and cheated me at last. I gave this meek  angel but a few courteous words &mdash; a little fraternal tenderness &mdash; and lo, she  loved me. The life which had been so dark and desolate grew bright beneath her  influence; and I went back to Puy Verdun with a fair young bride for my  companion.</p>
<p>Ah, how sweet a change there was in my life and in  my home! The village children no longer shrank appalled as the dark horseman  rode by, the village crones no longer crossed themselves; for a woman rode by  his side &mdash; a woman whose charities had won the love of all those ignorant  creatures, and whose companionship had transformed the gloomy lord of the  ch&acirc;teau into a loving husband and a gentle master. The old retainers forgot the  untimely fate of my cousin, and served me with cordial willingness, for love of  their young mistress.</p>
<p>There are no words which can tell the pure and  perfect happiness of that time. I felt like a traveller who had traversed the  frozen seas of an arctic region, remote from human love or human companionship,  to find himself on a sudden in the bosom of a verdant valley, in the sweet atmosphere  of home. The change seemed too bright to be real; and I strove in vain to put  away from my mind the vague suspicion that my new life was but some fantastic  dream.</p>
<p>So brief were those halcyon hours, that, looking  back on them now, it is scarcely strange if I am still half inclined to fancy  the first days of my married life could have been no more than a dream.</p>
<p>Neither in my days of gloom nor in my days of  happiness had I been troubled by the recollection of Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s blasphemous oath.  The words which with his last breath he had whispered in my ear were vain and  meaningless to me. He had vented his rage in those idle threats, as he might  have vented it in idle execrations. That he will haunt the footsteps of his  enemy after death is the one revenge which a dying man can promise himself; and  if men had power thus to avenge themselves, the earth would be peopled with  phantoms.</p>
<p>I had lived for three years at Puy Verdun; sitting  alone in the solemn midnight by the hearth where he had sat, pacing the corridors  that had echoed his footfall; and in all that time my fancy had never so played  me false as to shape the shadow of the dead. Is it strange, then, if I had  forgotten Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s horrible promise?</p>
<p>There was no portrait of my cousin at Puy Verdun.  It was the age of boudoir art, and a miniature set in the lid of a gold  bonbonni&egrave;re, or hidden artfully in a massive bracelet, was more fashionable  than a clumsy life-size image, fit only to hang on the gloomy walls of a  provincial ch&acirc;teau rarely visited by its owner. My cousin&rsquo;s fair face had  adorned more than one bonbonni&egrave;re, and had been concealed in more than one  bracelet; but it was not among the faces that looked down from the panelled  walls of Puy Verdun.</p>
<p>In the library I found a picture which awoke  painful associations. It was the portrait of a De Brissac, who had flourished  in the time of Francis the First; and it was from this picture that my cousin  Andr&eacute; had copied the quaint hunting-dress he wore at the Regent&rsquo;s ball. The  library was a room in which I spent a good deal of my life; and I ordered a  curtain to be hung before this picture.</p>
<p>We had been married three months, when Eveline one  day asked, &ldquo;Who is the lord of the ch&acirc;teau nearest to this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her with astonishment.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>My dearest,&rdquo; I answered,  &ldquo;do you not know that there is no other ch&acirc;teau within forty miles of Puy  Verdun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that is strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked her why the fact seemed strange to her; and  after much entreaty I obtained from her the reason of her surprise.</p>
<p>In her walks about the park and woods during the  last month, she had met a man who, by his dress and bearing, was obviously of  noble rank. She had imagined that he occupied some ch&acirc;teau near at hand, and  that his estate adjoined ours. I was at a loss to imagine who this stranger  could be; for my estate of Puy Verdun lay in the heart of a desolate region,  and unless when some traveller&rsquo;s coach went lumbering and jingling through the  village, one had little more chance of encountering a gentleman than of meeting  a demigod.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Have you seen this man  often, Eveline?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She answered, in a tone which had a touch of  sadness, &ldquo;I see him every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, dearest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes in the park, sometimes in the wood. You  know the little cascade, Hector, where there is some old neglected rock-work  that forms a kind of cavern. I have taken a fancy to that spot, and have spent  many mornings there reading. Of late I have seen the stranger there every  morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never dared to address you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Never. I have looked up  from my book, and have seen him standing at a little distance, watching me  silently. I have continued reading; and when I have raised my eyes again I have  found him gone. He must approach and depart with a stealthy tread, for I never  hear his footfall. Sometimes I have almost wished that he would speak to me. It  is so terrible to see him standing silently there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is some insolent peasant who seeks to frighten  you.&rdquo; My wife shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is no peasant,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It is not by his  dress alone I judge, for that is strange to me. He has an air of nobility which  it is impossible to mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he young or old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is young and handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was much disturbed by the idea of this stranger&rsquo;s  intrusion on my wife&rsquo;s solitude; and I went straight to the village to inquire  if any stranger had been seen there. I could hear of no one. I questioned the  servants closely, but without result. Then I determined to accompany my wife in  her walks, and to judge for myself of the rank of the stranger.</p>
<p>For a week I devoted all my mornings to rustic  rambles with Eveline in the park and woods; and in all that week we saw no one  but an occasional peasant in <i>sabots,</i> or one of our own household returning from a neighbouring farm.</p>
<p>I was a man of studious habits, and those summer  rambles disturbed the even current of my life. My wife perceived this, and  entreated me to trouble myself no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will spend my mornings in the pleasaunce,  Hector,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the stranger cannot intrude upon me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to think the stranger is only a phantasm  of your own romantic brain,&rdquo; I replied, smiling at the earnest face lifted to  mine. &ldquo;A ch&acirc;telaine who is always reading romances, may well meet handsome  cavaliers in the woodlands. I daresay I have Mdlle. Scuderi to thank for this  noble stranger, and that he is only the great Cyrus in modem costume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is the point which mystifies me, Hector,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;The stranger&rsquo;s costume is not modern. He looks as an old picture  might look if it could descend from its frame.&rdquo; Her words pained me, for they  reminded me of that hidden picture in the library, and the quaint hunting  costume of orange and purple which Andr&eacute; de Brissac wore at the Regent&rsquo;s ball.</p>
<p>After this my wife confined her walks to the  pleasaunce; and for many weeks I heard no more of the nameless stranger. I  dismissed all thought of him from my mind, for a graver and heavier care had  come upon me. My wife&rsquo;s health began to droop. The change in her was so gradual  as to be almost imperceptible to those who watched her day by day. It was only  when she put on a rich gala dress which she had not worn for months that I saw  how wasted the form must be on which the embroidered bodice hung so loosely,  and how wan and dim were the eyes which had once been brilliant as the jewels  she wore in her hair.</p>
<p>I sent a messenger to Paris to summon one of the court physicians;  but I knew that many days must needs elapse before he could arrive at Puy  Verdun.</p>
<p>In the interval I watched my wife with unutterable  fear.</p>
<p>It was not her health only that had declined. The  change was more painful to behold than any physical alteration. The bright and  sunny spirit had vanished, and in the place of my joyous young bride I beheld a  woman weighed down by rooted melancholy. In vain I sought to fathom the cause  of my darling&rsquo;s sadness. She assured me that she had no reason for sorrow or  discontent, and that if she seemed sad without a motive, I must forgive her  sadness, and consider it as a misfortune rather than a fault.</p>
<p>I told her that the court physician would speedily  find some cure for her despondency, which must needs arise from physical  causes, since she had no real ground for sorrow. But although she said nothing,  I could see she had no hope or belief in the healing powers of medicine.</p>
<p>One day, when I wished to beguile her from that  pensive silence in which she was wont to sit an hour at a time, I told her,  laughing, that she appeared to have forgotten her mysterious cavalier of the  wood, and it seemed also as if he had forgotten her.</p>
<p>To my wonderment, her pale face became of a sudden  crimson; and from crimson changed to pale again in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never seen him since you deserted your  woodland grotto?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She turned to me with a heart-rending look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I see him every day; and it  is that which is killing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She burst into a passion of tears when she had said  this. I took her in my arms as if she had been a frightened child, and tried to  comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, this is madness,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You know  that no stranger can come to you in the pleasaunce. The moat is ten feet wide  and always full of water, and the gates are kept locked day and night by old  Masson. The ch&acirc;telaine of a medi&aelig;val fortress need fear no intruder in her  antique garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My wife shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him every day,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>On this I believed that my wife was mad. I shrank  from questioning her more closely concerning her mysterious visitant. It would  be ill, I thought, to give a form and substance to the shadow that tormented  her by too close inquiry about its look and manner, its coming and going.</p>
<p>I took care to assure myself that no stranger to  the household could by any possibility penetrate to the pleasaunce. Having done  this, I was fain to await the coming of the physician.</p>
<p>He came at last. I revealed to him the conviction  which was my misery. I told him that I believed my wife to be mad. He saw her &mdash;  spent an hour alone with her, and then came to me. To my unspeakable relief he  assured me of her sanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just possible that she may be affected by  one delusion,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but she is so reasonable upon all other points, that I  can scarcely bring myself to believe her the subject of a monomania. I am  rather inclined to think that she really sees the person of whom she speaks.  She described him to me with a perfect minuteness. The descriptions of scenes  or individuals given by patients afflicted with monomania are always more or  less disjointed; but your wife spoke to me as clearly and calmly as I am now  speaking to you.</p>
<p>Are you sure there is no one who can approach her  in that garden where she walks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any kinsman of your steward, or hanger-on  of your household, &mdash; a young man with a fair womanish face, very pale, and  rendered remarkable by a crimson scar, which looks like the mark of a blow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; I cried, as the light broke in upon me  all at once. &ldquo;And the dress &mdash; the strange old-fashioned dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man wears a hunting costume of purple and  orange,&rdquo; answered the doctor.</p>
<p>I knew then that Andr&eacute; de Brissac had kept his  word, and that in the hour when my life was brightest his shadow had come  between me and happiness.</p>
<p>I showed my wife the picture in the library, for I  would fain assure myself that there was some error in my fancy about my cousin.  She shook like a leaf when she beheld it, and clung to me convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is witchcraft, Hector,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The dress  in that picture is the dress of the man I see in the pleasaunce; but the face  is not his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she described to me the face of the stranger;  and it was my cousin&rsquo;s face line for line &mdash; Andr&eacute; de Brissac, whom she had  never seen in the flesh. Most vividly of all did she describe the cruel mark  upon his face, the trace of a fierce blow from an open hand.</p>
<p>After this I carried my wife away from Puy Verdun.  We wandered far &mdash; through the southern provinces, and into the very heart of Switzerland.  I thought to distance the ghastly phantom, and I fondly hoped that change of  scene would bring peace to my wife.</p>
<p>It was not so. Go where we would, the ghost of  Andr&eacute; de Brissac followed us. To my eyes that fatal shadow never revealed  itself. <i>That</i> would have been too poor  a vengeance.</p>
<p>It was my wife&rsquo;s innocent heart which Andr&eacute; made  the instrument of his revenge. The unholy presence destroyed her life, constant  companionship could not shield her from the horrible intruder. In vain did I  watch her; in vain did I strive to comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not let me be at peace,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he  comes between us, Hector. He is standing between us now. I can see his face  with the red mark upon it plainer than I see yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One fair moonlight night, when we were together in  a mountain village in the Tyrol, my wife cast  herself at my feet, and told me she was the worst and vilest of women. &ldquo;I have  confessed all to my director,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;from the first I have not hidden my  sin from Heaven. But I feel that death is near me; and before I die I would  fain reveal my sin to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sin, my sweet one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When first the stranger came to me in the forest,  his presence bewildered and distressed me, and I shrank from him as from  something strange and terrible. He came again and again; by and by I found  myself thinking of him, and watching for his coming. His image haunted me  perpetually; I strove in vain to shut his face out of my mind. Then followed an  interval in which I did not see him; and, to my shame and anguish, I found that  life seemed dreary and desolate without him. After that came the time in which  he haunted the pleasaunce; and &mdash; O, Hector, kill me if you will, for I deserve  no mercy at your hands! &mdash; I grew in those days to count the hours that must  elapse before his coming, to take no pleasure save in the sight of that pale  face with the red brand upon it. He plucked all old familiar joys out of my  heart, and left in it but one weird unholy pleasure &mdash; the delight of his  presence. For a year I have lived but to see him. And now curse me, Hector; for  this is my sin. Whether it comes of the baseness of my own heart, or is the  work of witchcraft, I know not; but I know that I have striven against this wickedness  in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took my wife to my breast, and forgave her. In  sooth, what had I to forgive? Was the fatality that overshadowed us any work of  hers? On the next night she died, with her hand in mine; and at the very last  she told me, sobbing and affrighted, that <i>he</i> was by her side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><a name="FoundInTheMunimentChest"></a>Found In The Muniment Chest</h1>
<p>I was three-and-twenty years of age, and I had not  long been articled to my father, an old-established family solicitor in the  comfortable market-town of Orpingdean,   Sussex, when I  fell in love with Barbara Ainsleigh at our race-ball. We had a race-meeting and  a race-ball at Orpingdean, and we put on our gayest aspect at that ripe  meridian of the year, when the corn-fields were growing tawny under the July  sunshine.</p>
<p>Miss Ainsleigh was the representative heiress and  beauty of Orpingdean, just as my father was the representative family solicitor  of that prosperous settlement. She lived with her father in a noble red-brick  house of the Queen-Anne period, shut in from the high-road by tall iron gates  of ponderous scrollwork, and surrounded on three sides by a garden &mdash; a real  old-fashioned garden, in the Italian style, with stone terraces and marble  balustrades, on which the peacocks used to strut and scream in the quiet summer  evenings; and our summer evenings were uncommonly quiet in the roads and lanes  about Orpingdean.</p>
<p>Mr. Ainsleigh was an elderly widower, and Barbara  his only child. It is scarcely necessary to add that he adored her, and that  her path from infancy to womanhood had been liberally bestrewn with those  metaphorical roses which the hand of affection, when aided by the purse of  wealth, can scatter before the footsteps of a household idol. We have no longer  our niche for the Penates; but is there not in every home-circle a god or  goddess before whom the rest bow the knee in love, or fear? Miss Ainsleigh had  the worship of love, and she deserved it.</p>
<p>I can scarcely trust myself to describe her. It is  so difficult to avoid hyperbole when one writes of one&rsquo;s first love. I will  only say that she was a noble English beauty &mdash; a dark-eyed, dark-haired Juno,  with the freshness of Hebe, and the instinctive grace of Diana.</p>
<p>Mr. Ainsleigh had been for the last twenty years of  his life a bibliomaniac; and dearly as he loved his only child, there were some  who would have been at a loss to say whether his books and the binding of his  books did not usurp the larger share of his divided affections. Never till I  knew Barbara&rsquo;s father did I know how much there may be in the outside of a  book. The first day I ever spent in Mr. Ainsleigh&rsquo;s house was a revelation for  me in the art of bookbinding. The bevelled edges &mdash; the hand-painting <i>sur tranche</i> &mdash; the creamy vellum,  relieved by red and gold lettering &mdash; the thick crinkly morocco, in all shades  of sober russet, and glowing crimson, and orange tawny &mdash; the grolier, and  gothic, and renaissance, &mdash; all that is rare and expensive in the art that was  in its prime while printing was yet in its cradle. In the little world of  Orpingdean it used to be said that if Mr. Ainsleigh had not been a very rich  man, he would have been ruined by his bibliomania. But, alas, Orpingdean folks  had the vaguest idea of what sums can be squandered on rare old books and  exquisite bindings, on Virgils in Italic type, printed at Venice by Aldus  Manutius &mdash; on early in-folio copies of Erasmus &mdash; on a <i>Tr&eacute;sor de la langue latine</i> or a <i>Maison  Rustique</i> by Robert Estienne &mdash; on a Strawberry-Hill Lucan, or diamond  editions by Firmin Didot. We knew that Mr. Ainsleigh&rsquo;s uncle had left him a  handsome fortune, but we did not know that it needs the millions of a Huth or a  Van de Weyer to support that expensive hobby-horse on which the book-collector  prances. Lord Lytton has most truly said that one hobby is a wife, and that  half-a-dozen hobbies are mistresses. Mr. Ainsleigh was faithful to his hobby as  ever husband to the partner of his choice. But a man may find his ruin even in  a wife, if she happen to be expensive and insatiable.</p>
<p>After the race-ball I saw a good deal of Miss  Ainsleigh. My father, and his father and grandfather before him, had been  received and liked by the best people in and about Orpingdean. We lived <i>in</i> the town, much to the disgust of my  two sisters, who had been &ldquo;finished&rdquo; at an expensive Parisian school, and who  felt a sense of intense degradation in the near neighbourhood of a coal-yard  and a wine-merchant. But in this old house in the High-street there were oaken  wainscots and spacious rooms, a square paved hall, and a staircase with such  ponderous carved banisters as are rarely seen in modern dwellings; and my  father refused to exchange the house in which he had been born for the finest  and whitest of those new Italian villas, whose campanile towers twinkled in the  sunshine on the hills beyond Orpingdean. My sisters protested that the old  house smelt of pens and ink, and marvelled that anybody should be so civil as  to visit us in such an odious locality.</p>
<p>People did visit us, however, in spite of the  coal-yard, which was exactly opposite our drawing-room windows; and in spite of  the wine-merchant, our next-door neighbour, who seemed to make his arrangements  with a foreknowledge of the days on which we were to have dinner-parties, so  surely did he receive wagon-loads of ponderous cases and bumping hogsheads on  that very day and at that very hour in which our guests assembled. My sisters  declared that this was his scheme of vengeance against us for not visiting him.  &ldquo;I daresay he will contrive to drop a case of Moet and Chandon some day just as  old Lady Hetherside is stepping out of that dilapidated brougham of hers,&rdquo; said  my sister Arabella; &ldquo;and then she will go about saying that she almost met her  death upon our door-step, and no one will ever dare to come and see us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ainsleigh came to us very often, undismayed by  the griminess of the coal-yard, or the bumping of casks and champagne-cases on  the pavement before our neighbour&rsquo;s storehouses. She had been pleased to take a  fancy, as it is called, to my sisters, and they were delighted with her beauty  and vivacity, I counted for less than nothing in the affair; but I felt,  nevertheless, that it was a very nice thing to have sisters; and there was no  attraction in Orpingdean strong enough to tempt me away from our spacious,  shabby, comfortable old drawing-room, when I knew that Barbara was coming to  spend the evening with our girls.</p>
<p>She came very often during the winter and early  spring and summer and autumn that succeeded the race-ball, where she renewed  her acquaintance with my sisters after their return from the Parisian seminary.  Miss Ainsleigh had never been to school. Was she not too precious a creature to  be intrusted to the care of strangers? She had been educated under her father&rsquo;s  roof, by an expensive governess, and by masters innumerable, and the process  had made her a very accomplished young person; though rather superficial,  according to the dictum of my sisters, who had learned Latin, and moral  philosophy, and natural science, and a good many &ldquo;ologies,&rdquo; which Miss  Ainsleigh had not been troubled with.</p>
<p>One of the chief bonds of union between this young  lady and my sisters was music. Barbara had a noble mezzo-soprano voice. My  sister Arabella had a decent soprano, my sister Louisa an endurable contralto,  while I had been endowed with that deep abdominal growl which may be considered  either a fine bass or an insufferable nuisance, according to the taste of the  listener. It was the fashion at Orpingdean to accept me as a kind of amateur  Lablache, and of the execrations that may have been heaped upon me in secret I  would rather not think. I was very grateful to Providence for my ability to growl when Miss  Ainsleigh came to us; for I was thus enabled to partake in those exercises of  the voice which constituted our musical evenings. O, what duets and trios and  quartettes we sang in the long winter evenings, while my father nodded behind  his newspaper, and my mother nodded over her knitting! What gentle gales we  blew, what merry men we uproused, what foxes we assisted in jumping over  farmers&rsquo; gates, what cool grots we inhabited, with what happy laughter we  greeted each other&rsquo;s mistakes, and how like to the melody of the spheres  Barbara&rsquo;s fresh young voice sounded in the ears of one adoring listener!</p>
<p>Yes, my doom was sealed. From that love at first  sight with which I was stricken at the race-ball I might possibly have  recovered. Is it not a faculty of youth to be stricken with such sudden fevers,  and to recover from them, to lay down its votive wreath at the feet of one  divinity to-day, and to pick up the poor frail blossoms, not so very much the  worse for wear, and carry them to another shrine tomorrow? This boyish fancy  for a beaming smile, and dark tresses crowned with flowers, might have been  fleeting as other fancies; but from the love that grew upon me in the quiet  progress of our family intercourse there was no such thing as recovery. We had  a garden behind the old house in the High-street, a long grass-plot, very  excellent for croquet, and a hazel-walk which seemed to have been made for  lovers. We heard the bumping of the casks and cases in a long covered yard next  door, and on warm summer evenings a faint odour of port or sherry was wont to  pervade the atmosphere. But we played croquet indefatigably, nevertheless, in  the summer afternoons and evenings, nor did Miss Ainsleigh scorn to join us in that  delightful sport, once, and sometimes twice a week all through the croquet  season; which, as I take it, extends from the first tolerably fine day in March  to the last dry afternoon in October. We walked in the hazel-walk sometimes,  Barbara and I, while my sisters and Mr. Dodderly, one of our curates, or Mr.  Midvale, his brother in the Church, prepared the croquet-ground, or collected  the balls and mallets when the sport was over. The faint stars used to twinkle  sometimes in the summer sky above the hazel-trees, and it seemed to me  altogether very sweet and very poetical, despite the casks and cases bumping  and rolling close at hand, and the odour of fine crusted port that mingled with  the perfume of our roses and clematis.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more trivial and  commonplace than our conversation on these occasions. It seemed as if we were  trivial and commonplace by choice, for whenever we touched perchance upon any  serious subject, &mdash; our hopes, our dreams, the things we loved, the plans we had  formed for the future, &mdash; we both shrank from the topic as if affrighted, and  hastened with nervous precipitancy to return to some frivolous discussion about  our last discovery in the science of croquet, the new glee we were learning,  the curate&rsquo;s sermon of the previous Sunday, or the popular volume of travels or  poems lately received from the book-club.</p>
<p>We loved each other. Barbara must have been dullest  among women if she had failed to discover how fondly she was adored; and,  without being a coxcomb, I could not choose but assure myself, with unutterable  delight, that I was something more than an ordinary acquaintance in the eyes of  Miss Ainsleigh. And so summer and autumn went by, and no week passed in which  Barbara and I did not meet &mdash; sometimes at my father&rsquo;s house, sometimes at our  quiet little Orpingdean dinner and tea parties; sometimes at the old Queen-Anne  mansion outside the town, where Mr. Ainsleigh received us whenever we liked to  visit him, and where there was a croquet-lawn that had once been a Dutch bowling-green.  Barbara&rsquo;s father was very well pleased that his darling should have found  pleasant friends in the immediate neighbourhood, with whom she could beguile  the weariness of a country life. He paid us a ceremonial visit one morning in  company with his daughter, and expressed to my mother and sisters his  satisfaction upon the subject, in a gallant and stately speech. After this he  invited our household to a ceremonial dinner, at which we met some of the  county magnates, such a dinner as Mr. Ainsleigh only gave about twice a year.  He was a man who took very little pleasure in what is called society. The books  which lined the walls of every room he lived in were his friends and  companions. He existed for them, and he loved them with a complete affection that  left no room in his mind for any frivolous attachments. He regarded his  daughter with extreme tenderness, and he indulged her every wish with  unquestioning alacrity; but whether this beautiful, beaming creature, with the  dark hair and blooming cheeks, was quite as dear to him as his Boccaccio on  large paper, or his original edition of Urquhart&rsquo;s Rabelais, is a question I  should scarcely like to decide. He loved her, and he allowed her to do exactly  as she liked. I have sometimes thought that he might have been a little less  indulgent to this charming daughter if his library had not held the first place  in his esteem.</p>
<p>And in all these pleasant meetings, in our  croquet-parties and musical evenings, our blowing of gentle gales, and  uprousing of merry men, how did the future appear to me, Frederick Wilmot, only  son and heir to Andrew Wilmot, solicitor, of High-street, Orpingdean? Could I  for a moment consider myself a fitting pretender to the hand of Barbara  Ainsleigh, beauty and heiress, future possessor of the grand old red-brick  mansion, and of the wide-spreading lands appertaining thereto, to say nothing  of that funded estate which Mr. Ainsleigh was said to have inherited from his  uncle and adopted father, Lucas Ainsleigh? Alas, I was fain to confess that my  hopes were of the faintest order.</p>
<p>I knew that my father had begun life with an ample  fortune, and that he must have added considerably to that fortune during the  many years of a prosperous professional career. I knew that he would admit me  into partnership whenever I proved myself worthy of that honour. But what of  that? Was it to be supposed that Mr. Ainsleigh would submit to see his daughter  the wife of a solicitor in a country town? Would I submit to such a sacrifice,  were I the father of such a daughter? I asked myself that question, and replied  boldly in the negative. And then I ordered my young hopes &mdash; those fair children  of the mind &mdash; off to execution, and felt myself another Brutus.</p>
<p>Yes; in the future loomed the black shadow of  despair. I knew this, and yet was happy. It is so difficult to be unhappy when  one is four-and-twenty years of age, and in almost daily companionship with the  dear girl one loves. My Barbara&rsquo;s image filled my mind by day and night; but I  worked at my dryasdust labours in the office with a plodding industry that  delighted my business-like father. Ah, those simple, middle-aged people, how  little they know of the dramas that are being enacted under their very noses!  O, how Barbara&rsquo;s bright image danced between the lines of leases and covenants,  deeds of assignment and bills of sale! and how her sweet face peered out at me  from the elaborate curves and flourishes of initial letters, like saint or  siren in mediaeval manuscript!</p>
<p>Well, it was a sweet dream while it lasted. I was  awakened by a crash; terrific as the cannonade that roared without the walls of  Brescia when  Gaston de Foix mounted barefoot to the breach; or as the simultaneous tumbling  of fire-irons that sometimes startled my father from his after-dinner nap.</p>
<p>Christmas was close at hand, and I was looking  forward to several parties at which Barbara and I were to meet. The shadow  looming in the remote future seemed more than usually remote at this period. My  sisters made merry with me on the subject of my devotion to Miss Ainsleigh; for  it is the property of sisters to be disagreeably acute upon these occasions. I  endured their badinage with good humour; for though they asked me if it was  likely that a country-town solicitor could aspire to the hand of a beauty and  heiress, their tone seemed to me to imply that they did not think my case  utterly hopeless, and I took comfort from their idle discourse.</p>
<p>Miss Ainsleigh made her appearance unexpectedly at  our nine-o&rsquo;clock tea one evening in December, when my father and mother were engaged  at on old-fashioned dinner and whist-party. My sisters were chattering by the  fire, and I was sitting apart pretending to read, and thinking of Barbara, when  I heard a carriage stop in the street below. I hurried to the window, scarcely  daring to hope that I should see Miss Ainsleigh&rsquo;s smart little brougham.</p>
<p>I did see that admired vehicle, and three minutes  afterwards Barbara was in the room, shawled and furred, and looking unusually  pale in the light of our wax-candles. My father cherished an antipathy to gas,  which I have since learned to respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Barbara, this is quite a delightful  surprise!&rdquo; cried my sister Louisa. &ldquo;Come to my room, dear, and take off your  things. Of course you have sent the brougham back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; Miss Ainsleigh faltered, in tones very  different from those we had been used to hear from her lips. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay long  to-night. Papa has a friend with him. See, I have come out in my dinner-dress.  I made an excuse for leaving papa and his friend to take coffee alone; and no one  but Emms and Phillis Trotter know that I have come out. I &mdash; I only came to say  a few words to you, Louisa, about something that has happened &mdash; at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed on the point of bursting into tears, and  her grief smote me to the quick. I was hastening to console the object of my  adoration, when Louisa hustled her out of the room, and Arabella followed, both  girls pleased with the excitement of the situation, and utterly indifferent to  my agonies. For half-an-hour I paced the drawing-room in anguish unspeakable;  but at the end of that time the three girls returned; and Louisa, who was not  such a very obnoxious creature as sisters go, told me that she had obtained  Miss Ainsleigh&rsquo;s permission to tell me the trouble that oppressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know almost as much about the law as  papa by this time,&rdquo; said Louisa, &ldquo;and you can most likely explain poor  Barbara&rsquo;s position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not myself I think of,&rdquo; exclaimed Barbara,  half crying. &ldquo;Poverty would not seem so hard to me; but papa &mdash; he is so  refined; his tastes are so expensive, &mdash; a sudden reverse would kill him. And he  will lose all &mdash; even his books, perhaps &mdash; if that dreadful paper is what it  seems to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudden reverse! &mdash; dreadful paper!&rdquo; I implored the  young lady to be more coherent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I have found a will, of my great-uncle Lucas  Ainsleigh&rsquo;s, that makes papa a pauper,&rdquo; she said; and thereupon produced a  yellow-looking document, on a couple of sheets of Bath post.</p>
<p>I was well acquainted with the circumstances of  Miss Ainsleigh&rsquo;s family. William Ainsleigh, her father, had inherited the  estate, which was not entailed, from his uncle, by virtue of a will, dated some  years before that gentleman&rsquo;s death, and immediately after his quarrel with his  only child, a daughter, who had married a certain James Dashwood, a  landscape-painter of some talent, but of no position, against her father&rsquo;s  wish. The young lady and her husband disappeared almost immediately after the  marriage. It was supposed they had gone to America, where the painter had  friends. Lucas Ainsleigh felt the blow keenly, but preserved an obstinate  silence upon the subject of his grief. He publicly announced his intention to  leave all he possessed to his eldest nephew, William Ainsleigh, and he executed  a will to that effect, which document was drawn up by my father, and remained  in his possession till Lucas Ainsleigh&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The will Barbara showed me was dated a week before  the testator&rsquo;s death, the date of which event I perfectly remembered. It was  witnessed by a certain Rachel Coles and Andrew Hardwick, both of which names  were strange to me. The will seemed a good one. The body and signature were in  the same hand. It left the bulk of the testator&rsquo;s fortune to Margaret Dashwood,  late Ainsleigh, &mdash; at that time supposed to be living somewhere in the United  States &mdash; most probably New York, &mdash; and to Barbara&rsquo;s father only five hundred  a-year from funded property.</p>
<p>The testator entreated his nephew to pardon this  sudden change of resolution. He felt the hour of death approaching; and as that  hour drew nearer, his stubborn heart softened more and more to his poor child,  and he felt himself bound to make her all possible reparation for his  unkindness.</p>
<p>This was the tenor of the document. I read it  hurriedly at first, in my excitement, and then carefully, but I could see no  legal flaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find this, Miss Ainsleigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a chest of old manuscripts, in the room where  my great-uncle died,&rdquo; replied Barbara. &ldquo;He was a collector of curious books and  manuscripts, like papa, you know; indeed, it was from him papa learnt the taste  for these things. It was only this evening I found that dreadful paper. Mr.  Lostenwich dined with papa, and after dinner they began to talk about curious  manuscripts; and papa said he had a muniment chest filled with very rare papers  that he had not even looked at, and amongst them he believed there was a  manuscript treatise by Roger Bacon. Mr. Lostenwich said he would like, of all  things, to see such a manuscript. Papa was anxious to show it to him; but he  has not been very well lately, and, as I knew the search would involve some  fatigue, I begged him to let me hunt for the treatise. He consented, after some  little discussion, and then gave me a minute description of the manuscript and  the chest it was to be found in. I took Phillis Trotter, my dear good little  maid, to the room with me, and between us we dragged the muniment chest from  the cupboard where it had been kept for ages, as we could tell by the thickness  of the dust upon the lid. I found the key upon a bunch papa had given me; and  after some little trouble succeeded in opening the chest, and began my search.  Phillis held the candle for me while I knelt down to examine the manuscripts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Phillis know of this?&rdquo; I asked, pointing to  the will, which lay open before me, and from which I could not entirely  withdraw my consideration even while listening to Miss Ainsleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Phillis knows. In my first surprise and  horror I betrayed everything. But she is the best of good creatures, and will  not breathe a word of this business without my permission. I looked over a  great many papers, and threw them back into the chest, but I could see no  vestige of Roger Bacon&rsquo;s treatise, with its long Latin name. I was just about  abandoning my search in despair, when I saw the indorsement &mdash; I think you legal  people call it indorsement &mdash; of that paper. My uncle&rsquo;s name, and the words  &lsquo;last will and testament,&rsquo; excited my curiosity. I opened the paper, and I was  in the act of reading it, when the door was opened, and an exclamation from Phillis  told me of my father&rsquo;s coming. He had been alarmed by my long absence, and had  left his friend to come in search of me. I threw the will back into the chest,  and answered papa&rsquo;s questions as calmly as I could. I assured him that there  was no manuscript of Roger Bacon&rsquo;s to be found in the chest, and persuaded him  to return to his friend and to apologise for my non-appearance. I had recourse to  the favourite feminine excuse, a head-ache; and, after sending papa back to the  dining-room, I despatched Phillis to order the brougham, for my first impulse  was to come to you with this dreadful paper. And O, Mr. Wilmot, does this will  really mean anything, and will it reduce papa to poverty, for I fear he has  squandered a great deal of money on his books, and has considerably  impoverished the estate; and he will have to give all back, will he not, if  that paper is binding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could I answer her when she looked at me with  such a terror-stricken face, alarmed not for herself &mdash; I doubt if she was even  conscious that her own interests were at stake &mdash; but for the father she loved  so fondly!</p>
<p>I was obliged to tell her that to the best of my  belief the will was a good one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must give it to papa,&rdquo; she answered sadly.  &ldquo;It would be wicked to keep it hidden for a single day, now that I know the  duty it imposes upon us. And papa must give up the Hall, and begin life afresh  &mdash; I am sure he will make the sacrifice bravely, but I fear it will cost him a  broken heart. He loves the old Hall so dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she began to think of the people  interested in the newly-discovered will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where my poor cousin is to be found,&rdquo; she  said; &ldquo;it is nearly twenty years since my uncle died, and it was years before  his death that she married Mr. Dashwood and went to America. She never was known to  write to any of her relations after leaving England. I have heard papa say that  he tried to find her out, in order to help her, after the property became his;  but he never succeeded in obtaining any tidings of her. And now all belongs to  her, and she will come back to turn my poor father out of his home, and will  never know how kindly he thought of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked Miss Ainsleigh if she would intrust the  will to my keeping until the following morning. She gave me the sweetest and  most confiding of smiles as she put the document into my hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do exactly what seems best to yourself,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;I am sure you will only do what is right and honourable. If you find that the  will is really valid, please come to the Hall to-morrow morning, and we will  tell papa all about it &mdash; between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus we parted; I conducted her to her pretty  little carriage, and held her dear hand in mine just a little longer than usual  as I bade her good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you should ever come to be poor, Barbara,&rdquo; I  said, &ldquo;you will at least know how dearly you are beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I could not resist saying. For the first time  in my life I had called her Barbara. I felt myself blushing in the darkness;  but she did not reprove me.</p>
<p>I lit the reading-lamp on my father&rsquo;s office-table,  and lay in wait for his return. He came at half-past ten, elated by a final  &ldquo;double, treble, and the rub.&rdquo; I sent my mother up to the drawing-room, where  the girls were too full of Barbara&rsquo;s troubles to care about hearing the <i>menu</i> of the friendly dinner, and I  marched my father into the office, where we sat down side by side, and examined  the last will and testament of Lucas Ainsleigh.</p>
<p>My father thought as I did. He remembered the names  of the two witnesses &mdash; both had been old serrants of the testator&rsquo;s, and both  were dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they had not been exceptionally stupid they  would have taken some means to further the carrying-out of their old master&rsquo;s  wishes,&rdquo; said my father. &ldquo;But it is just possible, by the way, that Lucas  Ainsleigh did not tell them the nature of the document they attested. Some men  are so fatally cautious.&rdquo; The result of our conversation was my appearance at  the Hall early next morning, with the dreadful document in my pocket. Barbara  came out of her pretty morning-room as the servant admitted me. We stopped on  the threshold of Mr. Ainsleigh&rsquo;s study, whispering together for a few minutes  before we went in, and it happened somehow that Barbara&rsquo;s hand remained in mine  while we whispered. I loved her so dearly, I was so sorry for her sorrow, I was  so glad to think that her poverty would bring her nearer to me; there was, in  short, such a conflict of emotion raging in my breast, that I may surely be  forgiven if, in this tremendous crisis, I forgot to release Miss Ainsleigh&rsquo;s  hand.</p>
<p>We went into the study, where the perfume of Russia  leather was almost oppressive, and told our story between us, Barbara kneeling  by her father&rsquo;s chair, and caressing the thin white hand that hung listless by  his side while we broke the intelligence to him. I never saw anyone more weak  and helpless than Mr. Ainsleigh proved himself on this occasion. He seemed  almost stunned by the blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have impoverished the estate, Frederick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You  see the fancies of a bookworm are expensive; and, thinking myself a rich man, I  have been somewhat reckless. I should scarcely like to tell you the money I  gave for my <i>Decameron.</i> And it was I  who bought <i>the</i> Shakespeare &mdash; you may  remember, perhaps &mdash; that was sold at Willis and Sotheron&rsquo;s three years ago. It  is true that at the worst I could sell my books, but it would be hard to part  with them. Marcus Aurelius sold all his possessions for the benefit of the  State, during that period in which the Germanic war and the pestilence at Rome  combined to impoverish the treasury; but he got a good deal of the property  back again, nor do we hear of rare manuscripts among the treasures he resigned.  And I do not pretend to the nobility of mind displayed by that generous  Antonine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bibliomaniac looked round at the grand old  folios with a dismal sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need not talk about selling your library yet,  sir,&rdquo; I said cheerily. &ldquo;My father and I are agreed that the will is a good one,  but we have yet to discover whether there is anyone alive to claim under it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new view of the subject, but it did not  inspire much hope in the minds of Barbara and her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin was my junior by some years,&rdquo; said Mr.  Ainsleigh; &ldquo;she married early, and is likely to have left a large family, &mdash;  even supposing her to be no longer living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law has only to deal with facts, you see,  sir,&rdquo; I answered, with unabated cheerfulness. It was, indeed, very easy for me  to assume this lively and consoling tone; for my heart was dancing with joy. I  knew that Barbara loved me. A very few hours of family trouble seemed to have  made us more intimate than a year and a half of croquet-parties and &ldquo;gentle  gales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some little discussion, it was agreed that an  advertisement should be drawn up by my father, requesting Margaret Dashwood, or  her heirs, executors, and assigns, to communicate with him immediately,  personally or by letter; and further offering to reward any person who should  produce evidence of the lady&rsquo;s decease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that will be much use,&rdquo; Mr.  Ainsleigh said. &ldquo;If Mrs. Dashwood had come back to England, she would surely have come  to this place, where she was born and brought up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot be quite sure of that,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The  lady may have returned under circumstances of extreme poverty, and may have  been too proud to exhibit her altered status in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Ainsleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there should be no response to that  advertisement after it has been inserted a dozen times, on alternate days, we  may fairly conclude that neither Mrs. Dashwood nor her heirs are to be found in  this country; and I will, with your permission, start immediately for America,  with a view to finding them, or sufficient evidence of their decease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go to America?&rdquo; cried Barbara and her  father simultaneously.</p>
<p>They both looked at me as the Mends of Theseus may  have looked at him when he announced his intention of tackling the Minotaur;  but I answered their looks of wonder with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crossing the Atlantic  is a very small business nowadays,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;thanks to Cunard. I shall start  before the end of January; and in the mean time all you have to do is to make  yourself comfortable and wait the issue of events. Things may not be so bad as  you think, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt a courage that was almost desperation as I  watched Barbara kneeling by her father&rsquo;s side, and comforting him with tender  looks and sweet little half-whispered words and the light caressing touch of  her fair hands. Ah, what could not a man achieve for such a woman as that! I  felt myself equal to support not only a wife but a father-in-law. Yes, and to  find money for Willis and Sotheron into the bargain.</p>
<p>Before I left the Hall that day Barbara and I were  solemnly pledged to each other. A detestable man-servant came in with a  coal-scuttle just as my sweet girl was melted into tears by the fervour of my  devotion. And O, in what a leisurely manner the wretch renewed the fire, and  how we stood, self-conscious as unconvicted felons, while he trifled with the  poker, and showed himself neat to punctiliousness in his arrangement of the  shovel and tongs!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you really mean to say that you are not  afraid of my poverty?&rdquo; asked Barbara, when the execrable creature had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to say that I was very much afraid of your  wealth,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I should never have dared to ask the heiress of Ainsleigh  Hall to be my wife. It is only the prospect of a change in your circumstances  that gives me courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I doubt if my life can give me a happier Christmas  than that which followed my interview with Barbara. My father&rsquo;s advertisement  appeared three times a week in the second column of the <i>Times</i> Supplement; but there was no response worthy even of  investigation. Mr. Ainsleigh waited the result with suppressed anxiety; while  Barbara and I did our best to support his spirits and to restrain our own. He  received my offer for his daughter&rsquo;s hand with resignation, &mdash; as if it had been  the last stroke inflicted by the Nemesis of his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not deny that I had hoped a more brilliant  destiny for her,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;She is now but a pauper&rsquo;s daughter, and cannot  be too grateful for your disinterested affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left Liverpool  on the 17th of January, and my business upon the other side occupied the  greater part of a year. With infinite labour, I hunted out the history of  Margaret Dashwood and her husband, together with the history of the two  children who had been born to them, both of whom had died unmarried, &mdash; one an  infant, the other a soldier in the late Civil War. Death had settled all claims  that might have been asserted under the will found in the muniment chest. I  went back to England  late in the autumn, carrying with me ample evidence of the decease of Mrs.  Dashwood and her heirs. She died without a will, and on her death the property  would have lapsed naturally to her father&rsquo;s eldest nephew.</p>
<p>Barbara and I are to be married early in the  spring. I nobly offered to release her from her engagement; she, in a spirit as  noble, refused to be released. Her father is resigned and even happy. There is  another <i>Decameron</i> to be sold at  Willis and Sotheron&rsquo;s in the coming spring, of an older and rarer edition than  the large-paper copy he has cherished so fondly hitherto; and whether he looks  forward with most anxiety to the loss of his daughter or the acquisition of the <i>Decameron</i> is an enigma I shall not  attempt to solve.</p>
<p>We are to live at the old Hall, whence I am to  trudge to my desk at the office daily. The little preliminary discussions of  affairs between my father and Mr. Ainsleigh have revealed the fact that the  latter gentleman has contrived to muddle away a great deal of money, and is by  no means a rich man. If Mrs. Dashwood or her heirs had been alive to claim the  estate, his position would have been a very miserable one.</p>
<p>The good people of Orpingdean, however, believe  that I am going to marry a rich heiress, and no doubt have a great deal to say  among themselves on the subject of my good fortune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><a name="HowIHeardMyOwnWillRead"></a>How I Heard My Own Will Read</h1>
<p>It was wrong to be led away by Scavenger. Scavenger  was the third favourite for the St. Leger; and a sporting prophet of some  celebrity, Mr. Mooney Dooem, of Little Hocus-street, London-road, Manchester,  assured me, for the moderate consideration of three shillings and sixpence in  postage stamps, that if I wanted to do a good thing for myself, the way to set  about it was to back Scavenger with all the loose cash I could lay my hands on.</p>
<p>Now, I am not a sporting man, and I don&rsquo;t know much  of horseflesh. If I had met Scavenger drawing a parcels-delivery van, my sense  of the fitness of things would not have been jarred by the circumstance; nevertheless,  I like a race. Yes, I am passionately devoted to a race. I make a point of  taking Mrs. Pettifer to Epsom and Hampton races every spring. I like champagne  and lobster-salad. I like to wear a green veil, and to talk to admiring  servant-girls at open windows on the dusty road. I used to like chaffing the  toll-keeper &mdash; one feels <i>so</i> witty in a  barouche and pair. I like having my fortune told. I like coming home in the  evening with my mind in a pleasing state of uncertainty as to whether it is the  day before yesterday or the day after to-morrow; and I like finishing the  evening with iced punch, another lobster, and a &ldquo;frienly rub-r-r-r.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I backed Scavenger. On Saturday I gave six to  five on him, on Monday I gave five to four on him, and on Tuesday my partner  Peck (Peck and Pettifer, solicitors, Gray&rsquo;s-inn) made me give him seven to  three on that abominable brute. Peck always backs the field. He is a cautious  man, and never means to marry. He makes unpleasant puns about not wanting to be  hen-Pecked. I have laughed at that doleful joke so long from sheer habit, that  if I heard it in a funeral sermon I believe I should burst into a loud guffaw;  and I give you my honour I never thought it funny in the whole course of my  life. I am rather afraid of Peck, if the truth must be told, for I think he  looks down upon me. I remember once, after a jovial night we had together,  going to the office next morning with a labyrinth of streaky red marks all over  my face; and when I told him that I had awoke and found the cat walking over my  face, he looked as if he didn&rsquo;t believe me.</p>
<p>I backed Scavenger; and then it struck me that as  Peck was going down to Doncaster for the St.  Leger week, I really ought to go too. I could afford the week&rsquo;s holiday quite  as well as Peck, though I was not a single man. So I told Mrs. Pettifer that I  must run down to Yorkshire to wait on one of our best clients, who was going to  marry his eldest daughter (to somebody else of course), and who required my  professional services for the preparation of the settlements. Now I suppose  Yorkshire sounded rather vague, for Mrs. Pettifer asked immediately what part  of Yorkshire I was going to. I replied, as  immediately, Slitherem-on-the-Dwingey. Now I don&rsquo;t know of any town answering  to that name in Yorkshire; but that is no  reason there should not be such a place, and I thought the address would be  reassuring to Mrs. P.; and so it was. Unfortunately, she wanted me to write it  down. I could not have spelt it if you had offered me a million of money; so I  told my esteemed Julia Maria that I would write to her the minute I reached  Slitherem; and so departed.</p>
<p>That brute Scavenger was nowhere, and my loose cash  was jingling in the pockets of the prudent Peck half an hour after the great  race. The cup was won by an outsider of obscure lineage, a rawboned chestnut  animal with one white fore-leg, which made him look as if he had dressed  himself in a hurry and had forgotten to put on his other stocking. Peck had  backed him, and came away from the course with his leathern pocket-book  distended, as in a dropsy, with bank-notes. I hated him with a deep and undying  hatred; but as he asked me to dine with him at the Reindeer, I went.</p>
<p>He is a brute (perhaps I have said that before),  but he is, on the whole, a generous brute, and he gave me a very good dinner.  They know what a bottle of champagne is at the Reindeer, I can tell you; they  can send you up something very creditable in the way of sparkling hock; and if  you&rsquo;ve a fancy for a bottle of old madeira, such as might rival Captain Cook  for sea-voyages, don&rsquo;t be afraid to order it. We had some of that madeira with  our fish. We didn&rsquo;t go into &ldquo;sparkling&rdquo; till the next course came in; and when  we were tired of champagne, we went in for burgundy. I think it was some time  in the fourth course that I was rather annoyed by the very peculiar conduct of  a partridge. It began by his sliding about my plate, and persistently eluding  my fork; he then dipped &mdash; yes, this malicious bird absolutely dipped down,  plate and all, as if he were taking a sensation header, or going through a trap  in the table-cloth. Next he dodged me &mdash; yes, dodged me from side to side;  concealed himself behind the bread-sauce to avoid my knife; till on my making a  final effort to pinion him with my fork, he took to himself wings and flew away  &mdash; into Peck&rsquo;s shirt-front. I believe this gave rise to high words between Peck  and me; but I know we afterwards shook hands; and there was something so really  touching in our reconciliation that I wept. It was foolish of me to wipe my  eyes upon my dinner-napkin, because I thereby introduced foreign particles in  the way of crumbs and mustard into those optics, which injured my sight for  the rest of the evening; but Peck said my conduct did equal honour to my head  and my heart. I think it was in the course of a speech he said this; and I  believe he paid me some very high compliments on my professional capacity and  unblemished integrity. I felt grateful to him, though he pronounced it &ldquo;<i>feshnl cpcty&rdquo;</i> and &ldquo;<i>nblmshed tgrity</i>,&rdquo; and I didn&rsquo;t quite catch his meaning. This, of  course, was after the cloth was removed, and we were taking our port and  walnuts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what brought Julia Maria (Mrs.  Pettifer) so vividly to my recollection at this time, but the image of that  injured woman did recur to me, and my feelings got the better of me. I had not  acted well towards the wife of my bosom. I had not kept my promise; I had never  written to her from Slitherem -on - the - Dwingey; partly because I had not  been there, and partly because I did not believe there was any place of that  name in the map of England.</p>
<p>How we came to think about the theatre, I don&rsquo;t  know; perhaps it was because we had received a circular from the manager of  that place of entertainment, perhaps it was the landlord who suggested the  idea, perhaps it was the waiter; at any rate, there was Peck standing with his  back to the fireplace (O, what had he been doing to himself to make himself so  indistinct and undulating?) &mdash; there was Peck, looking at his watch, and saying  that it was only half-past nine, and that we might as well go and look in at  the theatre.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether earthquakes are indigenous to Doncaster, but that town was certainly agitated by some  convulsion of nature on this particular evening; and as the inhabitants  appeared quite undisturbed by the phenomenon, I conclude that it was quite a  common occurrence.</p>
<p>As to that man who told us the nearest way to the  theatre, I hope he may come to an untimely end. Nearest way indeed! &ldquo;Bear to  your left down the street opposite, and then turn sharp round the first corner  you come to, into a narrow lane.&rdquo; I did bear to my left, whereby I bore right  into a horse&rsquo;s mouth, and received a torrent of abuse from a stable-boy riding  the quadruped. The lad had been drinking &mdash; they will do it at these times! &mdash; so  I forgave him. Then, as to turning sharp round the corner, did I not turn sharp  round the corner, and did I not do the bridge of my nose a serious injury  against the brickwork of the corner house? I have never quite understood how we  ultimately made our way into the theatre; but I think it was side-ways, because  I know something seemed to be taking  me into the Market-place, which, as everybody knows, is adjacent to that  building. Peck took me into a box near the stage. Peck is a play-going man,  quotes Shakespeare and Maddison Morton in his conversation.</p>
<p>I take my family to see the pantomimes every  Christmas; beyond that I am not a connoisseur. The play was <i>Hildebrand the Avenger</i>, <i>or the Spectre of the Mount. </i>Peck  said it was trash; I thought it interesting. Mrs. Hildebrand was a widow,  Hildebrand having been murdered at some remote period. She wore black-cotton  velvet, ornamented with spiky embellishments in crochet-work. I knew it was cotton velvet, because it looked brown, and clung around her queenly form as she  walked. She also wore pearls in her hair &mdash; the correct costume I daresay of  widows in the time of Hildebrand the A. She was rather a big woman, and she  might have been younger; but she was a model of conjugal propriety; and O,  didn&rsquo;t she annihilate Hildebrand&rsquo;s bad brother in yellow boots, when he  revealed a guilty passion which he had chee-yerished &mdash; he pronounced it  &ldquo;chee-yerished&rdquo; &mdash; for a space of some ten or twenty years! Now I should have  enjoyed this dramatic entertainment very much, &mdash; for I felt a strong interest  in the female Hildebrand, and I rather admired Yellow-boots, though he was a  consummate villain, and had three supernumerary consummate villains, dressed in  green baize and bluchers, always ready to carry out any scheme of a criminal  description, &mdash; but there was a virtuous steward, who talked a great deal more  than anybody else, and who seemed to obtain all the applause. I don&rsquo;t know how  he came to be connected with the partridge that had so aggravated me at dinner;  but he &mdash; the virtuous steward &mdash; was nearly related to that malignant bird, and  from the moment he spied me in the corner of the boxes, he made a dead-set at  me. Yes, at me! The abominable and abusive language he used, I shall never  forget. O, ah! he might pretend he meant it for Yellow-boots (the noble-er  Count-er, as he called him); but when he said that &ldquo;the man who didn&rsquo;t do so  and so deserved the most ignominious treatment,&rdquo; it was at me he levelled his  denunciations, and I felt myself the focus of a whole houseful of indignant  eyes. I told Peck of this fact, but he said he had not observed it. Peck never  observes anything. I asked my partner if there was anything in my appearance  calculated to attract the attention of that obnoxious steward; and P. said I  did look rather pale. Suppose I did; was that the virtuous steward&rsquo;s business  or mine, pray? and was I to ask <i>his</i> permission before I turned pale? I felt pale, and I rather fancied I looked  interesting: that black ballet-girl with the eyes &mdash; I mean that ballet-girl  with the black eyes &mdash; thought so, to judge by the way she stared at me. Well  now, who do you suppose that virtuous steward was? The most experienced  playgoer would have failed to fathom that secret That virtuous steward was  Hildebrand himself, who had been cleaning his own plate in his own butler&rsquo;s  pantry, and waiting on his own wife, and depriving himself of all the comforts  and privileges of his station for ten years; for the sake of keeping his eye on  Yellow-boots, who had intended to murder him, but had foolishly intrusted the  carrying out of the business to one of the supernumerary villains, who had  evidently made a regular fiasco of it. Now, was not that idea charmingly  original? I&rsquo;m sure, when the virtuous steward threw off a white beard and a  black cloak (how ever did he clean his plate or draw his corks in that cloak?),  you might have heard a pin drop. I did distinctly hear the wire springs of the  beard when it fell on the stage. And then there was such a burst of applause!  And then poor Yellow-boots (he was a handsome young man, and would have been  graceful if he had only been more settled in his ideas as to what he should do  with his arms) was led away by his own minions, with a view to instantaneous  execution. Perhaps he had been behindhand with their wages, for they really  seemed glad to do it.</p>
<p>How ever it came about, I don&rsquo;t know; but all of a  sudden we were behind the scenes. It was very dark, and there were a good many  stairs, and somebody tumbled down, and I hurt myself. Peck knew the manager;  and it was by some occult and back-stairs influence on the part of Peck that we  had gained admittance to those sacred precincts. And there was Yellow-boots  dressed in the costume of private life, smoking a meerschaum-pipe, and playing  dominoes with the virtuous steward. My first impulse was to strangle the V.S.,  on account of those abusive remarks he had made about me; but Peck said I had  better not; and then I found that I actually had a strong feeling of friendship  for the V.S., and that I should respect and admire him to my dying day.</p>
<p>I think presently the manager wanted to turn me  out, because I was something that began with a <i>d,</i> and disorderly, I knew that I was a model of gentlemanly  propriety, and that the remark was the emanation of an envious mind; so I did  not resent it. But Peck told the manager I was a jolly good fellow, and as  quiet as a lamb when I was something that began with an <i>s</i>; and he invited the manager to come and sup with us at the  Reindeer, which the manager consented to do.</p>
<p>They gave us a spatch-cock and curried lobster for  supper; and this time we tried the sparkling moselle, quite a lady&rsquo;s wine, and  not the sort of stuff to get into your head, especially if you laid a good  foundation of old dry sherry and bitter beer, as I did. Wasn&rsquo;t that manager a  glorious fellow too? And couldn&rsquo;t he sing a comic song too? And did not Peck  and I join in the chorus? O, it was such a song! There were seven murders and  nine ghosts in it; and really, though you were ready to expire with laughing  while you heard it sung, it was not the sort of thing to think of afterwards  when you found yourself alone in the dark.</p>
<p>After supper I proposed the manager, with all the  honours; and the manager proposed Peck and me, with all the honours; and we  drank the theatrical profession, out of compliment to the manager; and the  manager proposed the law, out of compliment to Peck and me. Did he not make a  witty speech about landsharks and bilge-water? I believe it was extracted from  the drama of <i>Black-eyed Susan;</i> but  the manager passed it off as original. And then Peck returned thanks in a  speech that was positively affecting; and then we drank the ladies &mdash; not that  there were any present, but the fair sex in general; Peck said, the black-eyed  ballet-girl in particular: but of course Peck is a single man. And then we went  to the station.</p>
<p>Yes, we went to the station, though I don&rsquo;t  particularly remember <i>how</i> we went. We  had been to bed, of course, because it was six o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning, and  there we were at the station. We might have had a cab, or we might have walked  down and carried our carpet-bags ourselves &mdash; I can&rsquo;t say which; but I am ready  to make an affidavit that it was six o&rsquo;clock A.M., and there we were on the  platform. How that clerk we took our tickets from came to be my second cousin  Mary Jane Thomas&rsquo;s husband, who died when I was a little boy, I don&rsquo;t know; but  Mary Jane T.&rsquo;s husband he was; and what&rsquo;s more, I was not in the least  surprised to see him. Neither did I perceive anything incongruous in the  conduct of the manager, though, on my turning round to wish him good-bye, he  all at once grew so like my great aunt Storkins &mdash; Aunt Storkins was in trade  once, and no Pettifer ever would notice anybody connected with trade &mdash; that I  could have taken him for that elderly individual, if I had not known all the  time that he was the manager as well.</p>
<p>Talk of a long journey! I conclude we went express,  because we didn&rsquo;t stop anywhere; but, upon my honour, it seemed to me as if we  began that journey in the period of the old red sandstone, and didn&rsquo;t reach our  destination till the reign of Queen Victoria. <i>Eons</i> and <i>eons</i> seemed to pass away, and still that Wandering Jew of an  express-train tore onward on its interminable course; and there was Peck  sitting opposite me eating sandwiches the whole time. He wasn&rsquo;t always Peck, by  the bye; sometimes he was Earl Russell; once he was the Emperor Nero, with a  faint tinge of Mr. Alfred Tennyson, but there was an under-current of himself  perceptible all the time.</p>
<p>How we came to pass Bagdad  I don&rsquo;t know, unless it was through the stupidity of the engine-driver; but I  remember somebody pointing to a city which seemed to be constructed of  brick-and-mortar pepper-boxes and fish-sauce bottles with tall stoppers, and  which Peck declared to be that ancient capital of the Saracenic Caliphs. In  spite of everything, we reached London  by half-past ten A.M.; and before I knew where I was, I found myself opposite  my own door, No. 4 Montefiasco-villas, Denmark-hill.</p>
<p>When I say my own door, I am bound to add that at  first I could hardly believe it to be my own door; for of all the stylish  funerals I ever remembered seeing, the most stylish was just starting from No.  4 Montefiasco-villas. Such ponderous mutes! I knew the grief depicted in their  rubicund faces could not have cost a trifle. Such feathers! I clung  convulsively to the palings, for my thoughts reverted to Julia Maria. I  remembered the guilty deception which had attended my departure from home, and  I felt a conscience-stricken man.</p>
<p>Our parlour-maid Mary was standing at the  garden-gate, gaping after the dismal cort&egrave;ge. I gasped out, &ldquo;Whose funeral? Not  your mistress&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; master&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Yes; she said it quite  distinctly; &ldquo;master&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Collect yourself, Mary;  you may have been availing yourself of a false key to the cellaret. Calm  yourself, my good girl, and try back. Whose funeral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master&rsquo;s, sir. Fatal collision&rdquo; (she said  &ldquo;klision) &ldquo;on the Slitherem-on-the-Dwingey Railroad. Poor Mr. Pettifer brought  home on a shutter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slitherem-on-the Dwingey. The girl had the name of  that mysterious vicinity as pat as I have my A B C, &mdash; perhaps patter.</p>
<p>I was a little thrown off my moral equilibrium, but  I was not going to give way; so I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stared at me with that vacuous expression  peculiar to the lower classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw you before, sir, to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much. I strode past the girl, and up  the gravel-walk; but she stopped me, and said she didn&rsquo;t think her mistress  would see a stranger to-day. I used bad language; I said &ldquo;Fiddlesticks&rsquo; ends!&rdquo;  And I went into the house.</p>
<p>She told me, this pert menial, to wipe my shoes on  my own mat, that I might not injure my own carpet; and she looked at me, when  she showed me into my own drawing-room, very much as if she thought I might  mean to purloin some of my own nicknacks.</p>
<p>There was a newspaper on the table. I took it up  mechanically. It was the <i>Slithererm-on-the-Dwingey  Chronicle and Monday Morning Advertiser.</i> Good gracious me! this  Slitherem-on-the-Dwingey &mdash; a place the very name of which I believed to be an  emanation of my own brain, devised to pacify Mrs. Pettifer &mdash; seemed to have  sprung into life by some mysterious agency, and to have become a flourishing  city. The paper was full of advertisements, which plainly showed that Slitherem  was a populous place. One column was marked with a long black streak, evidently  the work of a soft quill-pen. I read that column. It was a detailed account of  the fatal accident on the Dwingey-Junction line, between the stations of  Slitcherem and Slopeydregon, &mdash; I never invented Slopeydregon; that place was a  frightful reality, &mdash; and of the subsequent death of Mr. Augustus Pettifer,  solicitor, of Gray&rsquo;s-inn, from injuries received therein.</p>
<p>Yes; there were the full particulars. The engine  had run off the bank, and I, with several other passengers, had been  precipitated into a field at some distance from the railroad, fearfully  mutilated. Fearfully mutilated! Yes; that was the expression.</p>
<p>The door opened, and admitted Julia Maria Pettifer,  in tears and a widow&rsquo;s cap. In mourning for <i>me!</i> Things were really growing unpleasant. &ldquo;Julia Maria!&rdquo; I was about to exclaim;  but I had scarcely enunciated the J before she interrupted me by burying her  face in her pocket-handkerchief with a sound as of choking.</p>
<p>I felt very awkward; here was I expected to console  my own wife for my own loss. After an embarrassing pause of some moments, Julia  Maria emerged from behind the pocket-handkerchief. I don&rsquo;t know what she had  been doing, but her eyes were not at all red. I took a note of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you perhaps were a friend of  the dear departed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I flattered myself I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I ejaculated, &ldquo;Ju&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped me short at the Ju.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am sorry you did not  arrive in time to attend the funeral. There was a vacant place in one of the  carriages. Mr. Spivins had the toothache, and couldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, Spivins had the toothache, had he! and it was  too much trouble to attend my funeral! I took another note of Spivins&rsquo;s  toothache &mdash; I had lent Spivins money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as you were a friend of the dear departed, you  may like to hear the will read,&rdquo; continued my wife. &ldquo;It will be read in the  dining-room at one o&rsquo;clock. You would perhaps wish to be present; you may be  interested.&rdquo; Having said which, she went back into the pocket-handkerchief and  out of the room.</p>
<p>Now what did it all mean? That was the question I  put to myself. What did it all mean? Could it be possible that any impostor had  had the impertinence to be killed on the Dwingey Junction in my name, brought  home to my house on a shutter, and had even carried his audacity so far as to  go and be buried in my coffin in my family vault in Norwood-cemetery? I had  been induced to purchase a family vault by Julia Maria, though really I had  thought it a foolish investment, because of course if I died, somebody must  bury me, or if they did not choose to go to that expense, it would be <i>their </i>look-out.</p>
<p>One thing may strike the reader as rather singular,  &mdash; it struck me in that light myself, &mdash; namely, that I didn&rsquo;t explain myself;  that I didn&rsquo;t say to Julia Maria, &ldquo;Take off that widow&rsquo;s cap, and put that  absurd handkerchief in your pocket, and draw the blinds up. For this is me; and  I never went to Slitherem-on-the-Dwingey in my life, and consequently never  came home on a shutter;&rdquo; and so on. The fact is, that I was continually trying  to say these very words, and I continually couldn&rsquo;t. This failure I attributed  to two causes. First, the pain at my chest &mdash; O, such a pain &mdash; a weight, an  oppression! I don&rsquo;t suppose anybody ever had an Atlas omnibus, full inside and  out, settled on their lungs; but only a person who had laboured under such a  disease could form a just estimate of my sensations. Secondly, really, what  with the parlour-maid&rsquo;s asseverations, Julia Maria&rsquo;s mourning, and the graphic  account of the accident in the newspaper, I was in a manner beginning to  believe in Slitherem-on-the-Dwingey. Suppose I had been killed? Suppose I had  been brought home on a shutter, and didn&rsquo;t know it? There was an awful  situation!</p>
<p>I pinched myself; it was painful. There was a fire  in the grate; I laid hold of the bars; that was painful, very, and I believe I  swore; but O, it was such a comfort to feel that I was mortal, that I could  have blessed anybody for treading upon my pet corn.</p>
<p>It was a nice thing to be asked into my own  dining-room to hear my own will read. There was Peck, in a suit of black, with  ebony death&rsquo;s-heads for studs, &mdash; he always had a playful fancy, &mdash; sitting in  one of my morocco chairs at the top of my patent telescopic dining-table. He  seemed to have forgotten all about Doncaster.  I tried to recall it to his recollection, but a temporary paralysis of the  vocal organs prevented me.</p>
<p>I suppose our dining-room must have been built on  some newly-invented expanding principle, because it certainly was <i>not</i> as large as Exeter-hall when I left  home; and in the matter of cubic feet it decidedly had the advantage of that  edifice now.</p>
<p>It was really edifying to sit and hear how I had  disposed of my property. There was a picture I rather prided myself upon &mdash; a  Titian, a genuine Titian. The man I bought it from said it was, and of course  he ought to know. Now, I had bequeathed this picture to Peck; Peck was not a  bad fellow on the whole, and had stood my friend once or twice with Julia Maria  after our Masonic dinner in Great Queen-street; and what do you think was  Peck&rsquo;s remark on reading the passage in my will which made him possessor of  this gem? &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I appreciate his kind feeling; but he  wouldn&rsquo;t have known a Reynolds from a Morland, and he always considered Michael  Angelo and Buonarotti two distinct artists. The thing is the vilest daub that  ever came out of Wardour-street.&rdquo; I tried to express my indignation, but  another touch of paralysis was too much for me, and I took another note. Peck &mdash;  daub &mdash; Wardour-street. I had learnt Beniowski&rsquo;s system of artificial memory,  and I checked off those three heads on the fire-irons.</p>
<p>After the will was read, we all gathered round the  fire, and we really became quite sociable. Mary the parlour-maid brought in a  tray of decanters. Didn&rsquo;t the wine go to work! &mdash; my &rsquo;48 port in particular. I  don&rsquo;t know who it was that suggested smoking; but we all looked at each other;  and presently someone &mdash; I think it was Peck &mdash; said there was a box of poor  Pettifer&rsquo;s cheroots in the sideboard drawer, and as it wasn&rsquo;t likely <i>he</i> would ever smoke them, we might as  well blow a cloud. And so there was I, thanking Peck for one of my own cigars.</p>
<p>Our conversation was very melancholy at first; but  presently we became a little more resigned; afterwards we grew quite cheerful;  and at last, upon my word, we were almost uproarious. Peck told one of his best  stories. I knew it by heart, and I laughed in the wrong place, and he scowled  at me. I did it on purpose. Ha, ha! that vengeance at least was within my  power.</p>
<p>It was very pleasant, too, to be taken by the  button and told a good story about myself, the point of which was, that I had  made a consummate fool of myself; and I think if Peck told me one such story,  he told me six; and what&rsquo;s more, I laughed &mdash; yes, I actually laughed.</p>
<p>I think it was Peck proposed that as we&rsquo;d had a  very melancholy morning, we should run down to Greenwich and take a bit of dinner at the  Crown and Sceptre &mdash; of course in a quiet way. &ldquo;We shall find plenty of hansoms  at Camberwell-green,&rdquo; said Peck; and off we went.</p>
<p>Now, when I say off we went, I mean to say off <i>they</i> went, for I did not go; and yet I  wanted to go, and yet I kept continually trying to go, and yet I continually  seemed to be going; but go I did not. Go I did not; for the substantial macadam  of Denmark-hill transformed itself all in a moment into the airy nothingness of  the Goodwin-sands, and I felt myself suddenly going down, down, down into a  fathomless gulf, like another Edgar Ravenswood.</p>
<p>Two broken wine-glasses, a plate of oyster and  lobster shells, a play-bill, a candlestick, and my boots! When I opened my eyes  at the bottom of the fathomless gulf, these were the articles which met my  bewildered gaze. They were on the table above my head; my feet were in the  boots, and I was lying on the floor of that apartment in the Reindeer in which  Peck, the manager, and I had partaken of supper prior to my hearing my own will  read. I was lying on my back on the floor, with my feet on the table above me;  and that is not a pleasant attitude in which to abandon oneself to slumber. I  had one corkscrew, two balance-handle knives, and the neck of a  champagne-bottle exactly under the small of my back. Those trifles did not add  to the comfort of my position; and when I tell you that my head was against a  sharp corner of the fender, and that I found the heel of the manager&rsquo;s  varnished boot planted upon my chest, you will not perhaps wonder that I had  assisted at the reading of my own will.</p>
<p>Yes, it had been only a hideous dream, after all;  and there was the manager, asleep in an easy-chair, with my chest for a  footstool, and looking quite aggravatingly comfortable. There was Peck too in  another easy-chair, with a pocket-handkerchief over his face, looking still  more aggravatingly comfortable. We had a splendid breakfast, plenty of  soda-water and green tea, and started (it really was to-morrow) by the  afternoon express-train; and at eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening I was seated  before the social board, quaffing with Mrs. Pettifer the cup that cheers and  does not do the other thing, in the sacred shelter of my own home.</p>
<p>I told her a good deal, if I did not tell her  exactly all; and never again, Julia Maria, never again! No more  Slitherem-on-the-Dwingeys, no more St. Leger stakes, no more Scavengers, no  more Reindeers, and no more last wills and testaments. No; we will go to Epsom  in the spring-time of the coming year, and hob and nob out of our modest bottle  of moselle, as a steady married couple should do.</p>
<p>But, dream or no dream, I mean to revenge myself  upon Peck for his impertinence about that picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><b><a name="TheScenePaintersWife"></a>The  Scene-Painter&rsquo;s Wife</b></h1>
<p>&ldquo;You  wouldn&rsquo;t think it, to look at her now, sir,&rdquo; said the old clown, as he shook  the ashes out of his blackened clay; &ldquo;but madam was once as handsome a woman as  you&rsquo;d see for many a long day. It was an accident that spoilt her beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  speaker was attached to a little equestrian company with which I had fallen in  during a summer day&rsquo;s pedestrianism in Warwickshire. The troupe had halted at a  roadside inn, where I was dawdling over my simple mid-day meal; and by the time  I had smoked my cigar in his companionship, the clown and I were upon a footing  of perfect friendliness.</p>
<p>I  had been not a little struck by the woman of whom he spoke. She was tall and  slim, and had something of a foreign look, as I thought. Her face was chiefly  remarkable for the painful impression which it gave to a stranger. It was the  face of a woman who had undergone some great terror. The sickly pallor of the  skin was made conspicuous by the hectic brightness of the large black eyes, and  on one cheek there was a scar&mdash;the mark of some deadly hurt inflicted long ago.</p>
<p>My  new friend and I had strolled a little way from the inn, where the rest of the  company were still occupied with their frugal dinner. A stretch of sunny common  lay before us, and seemed to invite a ramble. The clown filled his pipe, and  walked on meditatively. I took out another cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was  it a fall from horseback that gave her that scarp&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  fall from horseback! Madame Delavanti! No, sir; that seam on her cheek was made  by the claws of a tiger. It&rsquo;s rather a curious sort of story, and I don&rsquo;t mind  telling it, if you&rsquo;d like to hear it; but for the Lord&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let her  know I&rsquo;ve been talking of her, if you should happen to scrape acquaintance with  her when you go back to the inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has  she such a dislike to being talked about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  rather think she has. You see she&rsquo;s not quite right in the upper story, poor  soul; but she rides beautifully, and doesn&rsquo;t know what fear means. You&rsquo;d  scarcely believe how handsome she looks at night when she&rsquo;s dressed for the  ring. Her face lights up almost as well as it used to do ten years ago, before  she had the accident. Ah! she was handsome in those days, and used to be run  after by all the gentlemen like mad. But she never was a bad lot, never&mdash;wild  and self-willed, but never a wicked woman, as I&rsquo;ll stake my life. I&rsquo;ve been her  friend through thick and thin, when she needed a friend, and I&rsquo;ve understood  her better than others.</p>
<p>She  was only twelve years old when first she came to us with her father, a noted  lion-tamer. He was a man that drank hard now and then, and was very severe with  her at such times; but she always had a brave spirit, and I never knew her to  quail before him or before the beasts. She used to take her share in all the  old man&rsquo;s performances, and when he died, and the lions were sold off, our  proprietor kept a tiger for her to perform with. He was the cleverest of all  the animals, but a queer temper, and it needed a spirit like Caroline  Delavanti&rsquo;s to face him. She rode in the circus as well as performing with the  tiger, and she was altogether the most valuable member of the company, and was  very well paid for her work. She was eighteen when her father died, and within  a year of his death she married Joseph Waylie, our scene-painter.</p>
<p>I  was rather surprised at this marriage, for I fancied Caroline might have done  better. Joe was thirty-five, if he was a day&mdash; a pale sandy-haired fellow, not  much to look at, and by no means a genius. But he was awfully fond of Caroline.  He had followed her about like a dog ever since she came amongst us, and I  thought she married him more out of pity than love. I told her so one day; but  she only laughed, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  too good for me, Mr. Waters, that&rsquo;s the truth. I don&rsquo;t deserve to be loved as  he loves me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  newly-married couple did indeed seem to be very happy together. It was a treat  to see Joe stand at the wing and watch his wife through her performances, ready  to put a shawl over her pretty white shoulders when she had done, or to throw  himself between her and the tiger in case of mischief. She treated him in a  pretty, patronizing sort of way, as if he had been ever so much younger than  her, instead of twelve years her senior. She used to stand upon tiptoe and kiss  him before all the company sometimes at rehearsal, much to his delight. He  worked like a slave in the hope of improving his position as he improved in his  art, and he thought nothing too good for his beautiful young wife. They had  very comfortable lodgings about half a mile from the manufacturing town where  we were stationed for the winter months, and lived as well as simple folks need  live.</p>
<p>Our  manager was proprietor of a second theatre, at a seaport town fifty miles away  from the place where we were stationed; and when pantomime time was coming on,  poor Joseph Waylie was ordered off to paint the scenery for this other theatre,  much to his grief, as his work was likely to keep him a month or six weeks away  from his wife. It was their first parting, and the husband felt it deeply. He  left Caroline to the care of an old woman who took the money, and who professed  a very warm attachment for Mrs. Waylie, or Madame Delavanti, as she was called  in the bills.</p>
<p>Joseph  had not been gone much more than a week when I began to take notice of a young  officer who was in front every evening, and who watched Caroline&rsquo;s performance  with evident admiration. I saw him one night in very close conversation with  Mrs. Muggleton, the money-taker, and was not over pleased to hear Madame  Delavanti&rsquo;s name mentioned in the course of their conversation. On the next  night I found him loitering about at the stage door. He was a very handsome  man, and I could not avoid taking notice of him. On inquiry I found that his  name was Jocelyn, and that he was a captain in the regiment then stationed in  the town. He was the only son of a wealthy manufacturer, I was told, and had  plenty of money to throw about.</p>
<p>I  had finished my performance earlier than usual one night soon after this, and  was waiting for a friend at the stage-door, when Captain Jocelyn came up the  dark by-street, smoking his cigar, and evidently waiting for some one. I fell  back into the shadow of the door, and waited, feeling pretty sure that he was  on the watch for Caroline. I was right. She came out presently and joined him,  putting her hand under his arm, as if it were quite a usual thing for him to be  her escort. I followed them at a little distance as they walked off, and waited  till I saw Joe&rsquo;s wife safe within her own door. The captain detained her on the  doorstep talking for a few minutes, and would fain have kept her there longer,  but she dismissed him with that pretty imperious way she had with all of us at  times.</p>
<p>Now,  as a very old friend of Caroline&rsquo;s, I wasn't going to stand this sort of thing;  so I taxed her with it plainly next day, and told her no good could come of any  acquaintance between her and Captain Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  no harm need come of it either, you silly old fellow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been  used to that sort of attention all my life. There&rsquo;s nothing but the most  innocent flirtation between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  would Joe think of such an innocent flirtation, Caroline?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe  must learn to put up with such things,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;as long as I do my duty  to him. I can&rsquo;t live without excitement, and admiration, and that sort of  thing. Joe ought to know that as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should have thought the tiger and the horses would have given you enough excitement,  Caroline,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;without running into worse dangers than the risk of your  life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  they don&rsquo;t give me half enough excitement,&rdquo; she answered; and then she took out  a little watch in a jewelled case, and looked at it, and then at me, in a  half-boastful, half-anxious way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  what a pretty watch, Carry!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Is that  a present from Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  if you didn&rsquo;t know better than that!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Country scene-painters can&rsquo;t  afford to buy diamond watches for their wives, Mr. Waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  tried to lecture her, but she laughed off my reproaches; and I saw her that  night with a bracelet on her arm which I knew must be another gift from the  captain. He was in a stage-box, and threw her a bouquet of choice flowers after  her scene with the tiger. It was the prettiest sight in the world to see her  pick up the flowers and offer them to the grim-looking animal to smell, and  then snatch them away with a laugh, and retire, curtseying to the audience, and  glancing coquettishly towards the box where her admirer sat applauding her.</p>
<p>Three  weeks went by like this, the captain in front every night. I kept a close watch  upon the pair, for I thought that, however she might carry on her flirtation,  Joe&rsquo;s wife was true at heart, and would not do him any deliberate wrong. She  was very young and very wilful, but I fancied my influence would go a long way  with her in any desperate emergency. So I kept an eye upon her and her admirer,  and there was rarely a night that I did not see the captain&rsquo;s back turned upon  the door of Mrs. Waylie&rsquo;s lodgings before I went home to my own supper.</p>
<p>Joe  was not expected home for another week, and the regiment was to leave the town  in a couple of days. Caroline told me this one morning with evident pleasure,  and I was overjoyed to find she did not really care for Captain Jocelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit, you silly old man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I like his admiration, and I like his  presents, but I know there&rsquo;s no one in the world worth Joe. I&rsquo;m very glad the  regiment will be gone when Joe comes back. I shall have had my bit of fun, you  know, and I shall tell Joe all about it; and as Captain Jocelyn will have gone  to the other end of the world, he can&rsquo;t object to the presents&mdash;tributes offered  to my genius, as the Captain says in his notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  felt by no means sure that Joseph Waylie would consent to his wife&rsquo;s retaining  these tributes, and I told her as much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,  nonsense,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I can do what I like with Joe. He&rsquo;ll be quite satisfied  when he sees Captain Jocelyn&rsquo;s respectful letters. I couldn&rsquo;t part with my  darling little watch for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When  I went to the theatre next night, I found the captain standing talking to  Caroline just inside the stage-door. He seemed very earnest, and was begging  her to do something which she said was impossible. It was his last night in the  town, you see, and I have very little doubt that he was asking her to run away  with him&mdash;for I believe the man was over head and ears in love with her&mdash;and that  she was putting him off in her laughing coquettish way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t take your answer now,&rdquo; he said very seriously. &ldquo;I shall wait for you at  the door to-night. You can&rsquo;t mean to break my heart, Caroline; the answer must  be yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  broke away from him hurriedly. &ldquo;Hark,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the overture; and in  half an hour I must be upon the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  passed the captain in the dark passage, and a few paces farther on passed some  one else whose face I could not see, but whose short hurried breathing sounded  like that of a person who had been running. We brushed against one another as  we passed, but the man took no notice of me.</p>
<p>Half  an hour afterwards I was lounging in a corner of the ring while Caroline went  through her performances with the tiger. Captain Jocelyn was in his usual  place, with a bouquet in his hand. It was New-Year&rsquo;s night, and the house was  very full. I had been looking all round for some time, when I was startled by  the sight of a face in the pit. It was Joseph Waylie&rsquo;s face, ashy pale and  fixed as death&mdash;a face that meant mischief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  has heard something against his wife,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run round to him  directly I can get out of the ring, and make matters square. Some confounded  scandalmonger has got hold of him, and has been poisoning his mind about  Caroline and the captain.&rdquo; I knew there had been a good deal of talk in the  theatre about the two&mdash;talk which I had done my best to put down.</p>
<p>Captain  Jocelyn threw his bouquet, which was received with a coquettish smile and a  bright upward glance that seemed to express profound delight. I knew that this  was mere stage-play; but how must it have looked to the jealous man, glaring  with fixed eyes from his place at the back of the pit! I turned to look at him  as the curtain fell upon the stage, but he was gone. He was going round to speak  to his wife, no doubt. I left the ring immediately, and went to prepare her for  the interview, and, if needful, to stand between her and her husband&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>I  found her at the wing, trifling with her bouquet in an absent way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you seen Joe?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she answered. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t come back, has he? I didn&rsquo;t expect him for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know, my dear; but he was in front just now, looking as pale as a ghost. I&rsquo;m  afraid some one has been talking to him about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  looked rather frightened when I said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  can&rsquo;t say any harm of me, if they speak the truth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder Joe  didn&rsquo;t come straight to me though, instead of going to the front of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  were both wanted in the ring. I helped Caroline through her equestrian  performance, and saw that she was a little nervous and anxious about Joe&rsquo;s  return. She did not favour the captain with many more smiles that evening, and  she told me to be ready for her at the stage-door ten minutes before the  performance was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  want to give Captain Jocelyn the slip,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I daresay Joe will come  to me before I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe  did not appear, however, and she went home with me. I met the captain on my way  back, and he asked me if I had been seeing Mrs. Waylie home. I told him yes,  and that her husband had come home. Joe had not arrived at the lodgings,  however, when Caroline went in, and I returned to the theatre to look for him.  The stage-door was shut when I went back; so I supposed that Joe had gone home  by another way or was out drinking. I went to bed that night very uneasy in my  mind about Caroline and her husband.</p>
<p>There  was an early rehearsal of a new interlude next morning, and Caroline came into  the theatre five minutes after I got there. She looked pale and ill. Her  husband had not been home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think it must have been a mistake of yours about Joe,&rdquo; she said to me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think it could have been him you saw in the pit last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  saw him as surely as I see you at this moment, my dear,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no possibility of a mistake. Joe came back last night, and Joe was in the pit  while you were on with the tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  time she looked really frightened. She put her hand to her heart suddenly, and  began to tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t he come home to me?&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and where did he hide himself last  night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid he must have gone out upon the drink, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe  never drinks,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>While  she stood looking at me with that pale scared face, one of our young men came  running towards us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  wanted, Waters,&rdquo; he said, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upstairs  in the painting-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s  room!&rdquo; cried Caroline. &ldquo;Then he has come back. I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was following me as I crossed the stage, but the young man tried to stop her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better not come just yet, Mrs. Waylie,&rdquo; he said in a hurried way that was  strange to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Waters that&rsquo;s wanted on a matter of business.&rdquo; And  then, as Caroline followed close upon us, he took hold of my arm and whispered,  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  tried to keep her back, but it was no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know it&rsquo;s my husband who wants you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been making mischief  about me. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t keep me away from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  were on the narrow stairs leading to the painting-room by this time. I couldn&rsquo;t  keep Caroline off. She pushed past both of us, and ran into the room before we  could stop her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve  her right,&rdquo; muttered my companion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all her doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  heard her scream as I came to the door. There was a little crowd in the  painting-room round a quiet figure lying on a bench, and there was a ghastly  pool of blood upon the floor. Joseph Waylie had cut his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  must have done it last night,&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a letter for his wife  on the table yonder.&mdash;Is that you, Mrs. Waylie? A bad business, isn&rsquo;t it? Poor  Joseph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caroline  knelt down by the side of the bench, and stopped there on her knees, as still  as death, till the room was clear of all but me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  think I deserve this, Waters,&rdquo; she said, lifting her white face from the dead  man&rsquo;s shoulder, where she had hidden it; &ldquo;but I meant no harm. Give me the  letter.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better wait a bit, my dear,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no; give it me at once, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  gave her the letter. It was very short. The scene-painter had come back to the  theatre in time to hear some portion of that interview between Captain Jocelyn  and his wife. He evidently had believed her much more guilty than she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think you must know how I loved you, Caroline,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t face life  with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve been false to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of  course there was an inquest. We worked it so that the jury gave a verdict of  temporary insanity, and poor Joe was buried decently in the cemetery outside  the town. Caroline sold the watch and the bracelet that Captain Jocelyn had  given her, in order to pay for her husband&rsquo;s funeral. She was very quiet, and  went on with the performances as usual a week after Joe&rsquo;s death, but I could  see a great change in her. The rest of the company were very hard upon her, as  I thought, blaming her for her husband&rsquo;s death; and she was under a cloud, as  it were; but she looked as handsome as ever, and went through all her  performances in her old daring way I&rsquo;m sure, though, that she grieved sincerely  for Joe&rsquo;s death, and that she had never meant to do him wrong.</p>
<p>We  travelled all through the next summer, and late in November went back to Homersleigh.  Caroline had seemed happier while we were away, I thought, and when we were  going back, she confessed as much to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got a kind of dread of seeing that place again,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always dreaming  of the painting-room as it looked that January morning, with the cold light  streaming in upon that dreadful figure on the bench. The room&rsquo;s scarcely been out  of my dreams one night since I&rsquo;ve been away from Homersleigh; and now I dread  going back as if&mdash;as if <i>he</i> was shut up  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  room was not a particularly convenient one, and had been used for lumber after  Joe&rsquo;s death. The man who came after him didn&rsquo;t care to paint there by himself  all day long. On the first morning of our return, Caroline went up and looked  in at the dusty heap of disused stage furniture and broken properties. I met  her coming away from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,  Mr. Waters,&rdquo; she said to me with real feeling, &ldquo;if he had only waited to hear  me speak for myself! They all think I deserved what happened, and perhaps I  did, as far as it was a punishment for my frivolity; but Joe didn&rsquo;t deserve  such a fate. I know it was their malicious talk that did the mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  fancied after this that her looks changed for the worse, and that she had a  kind of nervous way in going through her equestrian performances, as if there  was a fever upon her. I couldn&rsquo;t judge so well how she went through the tiger  act, as I was never on the stage with her, but the brute seemed as submissive  as ever. On the last day of the year she asked our manager to let her off for  the next night. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the anniversary of my husband&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know you were so preciously fond of him,&rdquo; he answered with a sneer. &ldquo;No,  Mrs. Waylie, we can&rsquo;t afford to dispense with your services to-morrow night.  The tiger act is one of our strong features with the gallery, and I expect a  full house for New Year&rsquo;s night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  begged him very hard to let her off, but it was no use. There was no rehearsal  on New-Year&rsquo;s morning, and she went to the little cemetery where Joe was  buried, a three miles&rsquo; walk in the cold and rain. In the evening, when she came  to the wing, her eyes were brighter than usual, and she shivered a good deal,  more than I liked to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think I must have caught cold in the cemetery to-day,&rdquo; she said to me when I  noticed this. &ldquo;I wish I could have kept this night sacred&mdash;this one night&mdash;to my  husband&rsquo;s memory he has been in my mind so much to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  went on, and I stood at the wing watching her. The audience applauded vociferously,  but she did not make her accustomed curtsey; and she went about her work in a  listless way that was very different from her usual spirited manner. The animal  seemed to know this, and when she had got about half-way through her tricks  with him, he began to respond to her word of command in a sulky unwilling  manner that I didn&rsquo;t like. This made her angry, and she used her light whip  more freely than usual.</p>
<p>One  of the tiger&rsquo;s concluding tricks was a leap through a garland of flowers which  Caroline held for him. She was kneeling in the centre of the stage with this  garland in her hands, ready for the animal&rsquo;s spring, when her eyes wandered to  the front of the house, and she rose suddenly with a shrill scream, and her  arms outstretched wildly. Whether the sulky brute thought that she was going to  strike him or not, I don&rsquo;t know; but he sprang savagely at her as she rose, and  in the next moment she was lying on the ground helpless, and the audience  screaming with terror. I rushed upon the stage with half-a-dozen others, and we  had the brute muzzled and roped in a few breathless moments; but not before he  had torn Caroline&rsquo;s cheek and shoulder with his claws. She was insensible when  we carried her off the stage, and she was confined to her bed three months  after the accident with brain-fever. When she came among us again, she had lost  every vestige of colour, and her face had that set look which you must have  observed just now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  fright of her encounter with the tiger gave her that look,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  much wonder at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it,&rdquo; answered the clown. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the curious part of the story. She  didn&rsquo;t think anything of her skirmish with the tiger, though it quite spoilt  her beauty. What frightened her was the sight of her husband sitting in the  pit, as he had sat there a year before, on the night of his death. Of course  you&rsquo;ll say it was a delusion, and so say I. But she declares she saw him  sitting amongst the crowd&mdash;amongst them, and yet not one of them, somehow, with  a sort of ghastly light upon his face that marked him out from the rest. It was  the sight of him that made her drop her garland and give that scream and rush  that frightened the tiger. You see she had been brooding upon his death for a  long time, and no doubt she conjured up his image out of her own brain as it  were. She&rsquo;s never been quite the same since that fever; but she has plenty of  pluck, and there&rsquo;s scarcely anything she can&rsquo;t do now with Baber the tiger, and  I think she&rsquo;s fonder of him than of any human creature, in spite of the scar on  her cheek.&rdquo;</p>
